Noisey’s west coast editor, Andrea Domanick, was speaking on it and she was very tired. An hour or so earlier, Noisey had published an article she’d been working on for two years about how the music industry was built to fail women. Domanick had been considering music’s reckoning with abuse and sexism well before #MeToo. “Tighten up your office policies – well, the music business doesn’t happen in offices,” she said. “It’s a very unregulated industry that doesn’t protect its workers well. It’s built on intimate relationships. Being the manager of an artist is not something you check out of. People have an idea they can treat each other badly because music is … chiller?” Yet she also noted: “The fact there are no boundaries in music is why we love it, too. It finds the grey areas. Which means it’s also well-placed to lead the change.” Although unrelated to #MeToo, one song in particular brought her meaning home for me: the full-throttle post punk of White Guys by Tim and the Boys, with the lyrics: “I do what I like when I want / Coz I do what I want and I like what I do / I do what I can when I want / Coz I like what I do and I do what I like.” In just two minutes, with the visceral impact only music has, the song captures how it might feel to be a man sailing through life buoyed by a thrum of self-affirmation. Yet it also powerfully expresses how uncomfortable some men are with this privilege. Cis White Boy by the Fremantle band Boat Show took a similar route last year but White Guys cuts through because the vocalist, Tim Collier, although not singing the lyrics autobiographically, uses the word “I”. In these times, “I” is said to be a brave word. As a male friend who is deeply immersed in Australian music said of #MeToo: “It’s the guys who never say ‘I’ and ‘me’ you really have to watch.” Music’s grey areas can be a fertile space for creativity and many of the records covered here explore it. Many are part of the change Dominick refers to, as well, but in very different ways and, with the exception of Divide and Dissolve, not self-consciously. I’ve started a 2018 playlist for these artists. It joins the 2017 playlist, which has a selection of the music covered in this column last year. As always, please share in the comments if you think I have missed any truly excellent – or just very interesting – underground Australian albums from 2018 thus far. Alice Ivy – I’m Dreaming One-man band, you say? Had their day. We have one-woman producers now, such as Alice Ivy (Annika Schmarsel), who sings, plays guitar, wrangles Ableton Live, triggers samples and hits a drum pad – all at roughly the same time. While smiling. And jumping. And hydrating. I’m Dreaming is Schmarsel’s debut LP and a classic on arrival; a beats-and-samples-driven soar and tumble of elation that’ll get under the most sullen of skin. Yes, The Avalanches vibe is strong, but rather than get cranky about the comparison, Schmarsel rides the elephant around the room, claiming the sample-obsessed Melbourne band as one of her biggest influences. On Chasing Stars she coaxes such powerfully bittersweet vocals from Bertie Blackman that management should pitch it to Nasa to sync with its next spaceflight. The drop on Charlie, meanwhile, before the cascade of horns returns redoubled is like the pause between a punchline and a laugh. When performing, Schmarsel lacks artifice. She loses, not keeps, her cool, and in comfy sneakers and a jumpsuit, she literally shows us what to do, dispensing with the party-starting part and storming straight for the D-floor’s sweaty centre. Primitive Motion – House In The Wave Once I lived with a person who played the piano. It would drift down the hall, and in and out of my dreams. House in the Wave has that same distant yet insistent tug, as though the Brisbane duo is playing in a room that, if you enter, will only be dust motes descending on diminuendos. Sourced via a series of improvised sessions, Sandra Selig and Leighton Craig’s third album stirs saxophone, piano and voice together with garden noise, room rustles and birdsong. As the devotional drones of SBF ebb, Selig’s voice ascends, as if caught in the slipstream of a spirit. Entire songs evaporate on exit, leaving the residue of a melody you can only half recall. Though it’s not all vapour and haze. Small Orbit and Feed the Signals gesture at smooth jazz and most songs circle back to a piano or saxophone hook. Curiously, songs fade-in and fade-out arbitrarily, as if being played before and after the record button was pressed. As if deciding on where the start and end should be were as blithe as pointing at a map while blindfolded. A comment on the deceit of recorded sound? Good for them. Divide and Dissolve – Abomination On St Patrick’s Day in Austin, in a courtyard sloshing with pints and good moods, Divide and Dissolve struck their first bottom-heavy chord and shamrocks quivered. Some revellers downed beers and bailed, but those who stayed heard guitarist and saxophonist Takiaya Reed declare: “The colonisation of First Nations people has not ended. We will not ignore the genocide of indigenous people around the world and will continue the conversation with our music.” Divide and Dissolve don’t make doom metal to be liked, but to eradicate white supremacy. Their stealth attack on St Patty’s Day to the unconverted was bang on strategy. Abomination is Reed and drummer Sylvie Nehill’s second raised-fist record and a subversion, too, of doom metal’s style-over-substance tropes of space, wizards, birds of prey and bongs. The album’s instrumental songs do not grant metal’s gratification or countenance its catharsis. Rather, they decelerate, upping the downer vibe and revving like tanks bogged in the sludge of a war with no exit plan. Glowering in the gloom, midway through, is Minori Sanchiz-Fung’s spoken-word story of the “unctuous dark wealth” of the English language: “Like a redirected ray, the immigrant mind turns inward as if an enormous mirror comes down the moment you arrive. It drops like a giant rodent trap and forever divides time.” Native Cats – John Sharp Toro Everyone and everything not in the crosshairs of Native Cats singer Chloe Alison Escott should be relieved. Her superpowers of perception lead to lyrics that first encapsulate and second eviscerate, while maintaining their shake-your-head-in-admiration hilarity. It’s no wonder bassist Julian Teakle is so po-faced at gigs. He’s probably trying not to lose it. The Tasmanian duo make precise and zeitgeist-unaware post-punk they call “electronic pub rock”. This is their fourth and fiercest record – forged amid the tumult of Escott’s transition to life as a woman. Sans guitar, Teakle’s steadfast basslines rope together bright bursts of psych and kosmische, and splashes of melodica that mock, instead of summon, reggae’s chill vibe. Escott’s personal upheaval sees some lyrics shorn of their former abstraction. “Who would you love if was up to you / If the hand on your heart was yours alone?” she asks on Cowboy Builder. Phrased this way, it insists on truth – and you have to work to answer it. From my perspective as a cis woman, it’s another example of why trans and non-binary voices matter. They’ve had to be strong enough to shoulder open a heavy door – yet the light beyond falls on us all. Golden Syrup – Golden Syrup On Golden Syrup’s Facebook page is a picture of a mic in a goldfish bowl. “In another life,” Sara Retallick writes, “I make ... concrète sound compositions.” Yet her audio experiments are not, actually, confined to another life because sound’s boundaries are punctured here too, bleeding warm and thick across her debut LP. The record is split between solemnly sung songs and compositions that, largely, pare back the flesh and excess of industrial and techno to the rubbery cartilage and bare bones beneath. On When Will I Run Out of Breath, a clammy loop is interrupted by a voice hovering on a single note, clownishly degraded in clarity, akin to the drastic vocal experiments of Holly Herndon. Same could be a field recording of airlocks thudding shut on Battlestar Galactica. Returning from outer to inner spaces, Head-Sand is about the pain caused by someone else’s denial. If you empathise, it takes your breath away, just a little. Goaded only by organ and a plain pulsing beat, Retallick lets the song spool almost to an end before gently twisting the knife: “I am your family. Did you forget what that means to me?” Xylouris White – Mother Xylouris White is three albums deep yet apparently still “gestating”. In 2013, drummer Jim White of the Dirty Three (also a sought-after collaborator) paired up with George Xylouris, the latest in a family line of famed Cretan lute players. Together, the iconoclast and legend, vessels of vastly different musical traditions, spilt their skills into songs still swimming with what I once described as “the breeze of a warm Mediterranean night – evocative of olives, ouzo and a clutch of Euros in your pocket as you dance”. Keep the breeze in mind, and its skin-feel, and you’re at the source of what is so darn delightful about Xylouris White’s music: its sensuality and ability to transport. Their virtuosity is evident, always, but it’s never oppressive. It lets you in; loosens your screws. I even saw some Texan cowboys doing a two-step to it. White doesn’t drum so much as pour and withdraw a spectrum of shade and colour across his kit. Xylouris’s voice, meanwhile, can get you quite choked up. On Only Love, it slackens into the growl of a dog that won’t drop its bone; on Achilles Heel it is as old as time. And while Only Love is a raucous shredding joyride on which they show-pony their sizable “chops”, it is really a red herring because most of Mother is brooding and inward. The video for Daphne, of their mothers dancing alone in nature in their respective countries, is beautiful. Flowertruck – Mostly Sunny In 2016 I was pinballing around Bigsound, the Brisbane music industry conference, where hearing about a band carries as much wayward currency as actually seeing them. “Flowertruck?” friends kept pestering. Closest I came was hearing frontman Charles Rushforth’s voice booming over a fence, as if zombie Ian Curtis was back to scythe through the lanyards with his new jangle-pop quartet. Two years on, I get it. The Sydney band’s debut is a super fun amalgamation of suburban 80s Oz pop, back when selling that in pubs meant sweating tough in singlets or writing monster hooks. Flowertruck can do both. New is the Saddest Word belts along like Blue Sky Mining-era Midnight Oil; Comfort the boisterous new-wave punk of Hunters &amp; Collectors. Everywhere else, the ghost of the Go-Betweens or Paul Kelly hums along. Rushforth’s charisma and big voice is the fulcrum here, but secret weapon is Sarah Sykes on keys. Her spacey synths and vocal harmonies give ripper pop songs like Falling Away and Enough for Now the yearning and grandiosity Rushforth shouts about. On the anthemic Dying to Hear, when everyone in the band/studio/friendship circle sings simply “Don’t go”, it tilts things damn well life-affirming. – Marcus Teague Totally Mild – Her Elizabeth Mitchell has an unusual voice. It’s sweet and breathy, lending her words a hesitance. But also decisive and pure of tone; there’s no way she’s not in full control of it. Over the course of this stylish album about the ennui, self-reflection and second-guessing that blooms in the wake (and work) of attaining what you thought you wanted, the effect is unsettling as hell. Mitchell’s clever indie-pop band Totally Mild is the perfect foil for this. The Melbourne quartet are expert at sounding spritely and louche. They vamp on Working Like a Crow, pivoting from plinky verse to sweeping torch song chorus, and ice a sassy groove on Pearl that swoops and swoons on guitarist Zachary Schneider’s diving guitar lines. Then on gorgeous icy opener, Sky, they go mute, leaving it to flutter on stark synths and Mitchell’s brute self-talk; piano ballad Lucky Stars is just her resolve to be unconcerned in love with “lack”. For all of Mitchell’s self-scouring, she’s also wonderfully droll. “When you are different from the rest, they think you’re joking,” she says plainly on Working Like a Crow. It’s exactly that kind of bittersweet clarity that makes listening to Mitchell’s cloistered world so inviting. – Marcus Teague Tom Lyngcoln – Doming Home Sharks. Tom Lyngcoln is really into them. Also in the Nation Blue and Harmony, the Melbourne-via-Hobart musician is as reliable for his consistent, varied output as he is for his woolly, lonesome voice howling out on the cusp. On this stark solo debut, self-recorded “on lunch breaks”, it’s panned left, his punk-blues guitar juddering through reverb on the right. The space between is where his night terrors swim. “Rows of white teeth wrapped around your knee,” goes the title track. On Circling the Years: “Standing on a slow boat 5k out / The gravity impressed on me / I’m watching calves breach the water not much smaller than us / I can’t swim and I’m almost 40.” The obtuse influence of guitarist Marc Ribot (Tom Waits) circles all this; the Dirty Three’s Mick Turner and Neil Young’s Dead Man soundtrack, too. Good, moving matches for the subject of fear. But I can’t quite nail down when you’d listen to this. Gnawing moonless drives. On your phone when the power’s out. Cleaning up after the kids have gone back to their mum’s. What’s the attraction to planning swims with silent predators? Maybe the rush of surely feeling something absolute. – Marcus Teague Mildlife – Phase Caribou was never in Can. Don’t think Kevin Parker was a Bee Gee. Was Arthur Russell on Dark Side of the Moon? Phase, the outrageously assured debut LP from Melbourne four-piece Mildlife, has me rethinking it all. I first saw Mildlife close to a decade ago. They were cool then, techy and moody. Years of 2am slots, vinyl finds, the purchasing of congas and deleting long-ago-released tracks from the internet later, they’ve mellowed and finessed into a lush and extremely danceable space-jazz powerhouse. Nine-minute opener The Magnificent Moon is a victory lap of confidence: a twinkling constellation of synths over 70s-disco rhythms, guitars pinging from counterpoint to lead, and keys player/singer Kevin McDowell crooning: “You’re born and you die, there might be reasons why / Then again who cares, could all be in my head.” Sonic choices play to their eras of influence: proggy flutes and glasses in Im Blau, wocka-wocka disco guitar on Zwango Zop, lashings of moody synth arpeggio throughout. But none of it betrays the band’s telekinetic feelgood glue, an obvious product of countless hours jamming, obsessing over tone, arrangements, gear and melodies, to nail a debut that feels instantly timeless. – Marcus Teague Amaya Laucirica – Rituals Rituals is the right title for this. Since her 2008 debut, Sugar Lights, Melbourne musician Amaya Laucirica has progressed from moody, plainspoken guitar-led pop arrangements to a widescreen, hypnotic space. The kind of thing you can engage with or just let the mood take you. Her third album is top-heavy with these options. Opener Little Clouds implants the mental vista with its distant reverbed snare and church organ swells, the kind of thing that conjures highway lines blurring under wheels, pink-lit tundras, glazed pupils and the Jesus and Mary Chain. “Little clouds covering your dreams,” sings her double-tracked voice from somewhere distant and I’m drifting in the drink, waiting for currents to tow me under. Under the Tide and All of Our Time merge that addictive atmosphere to a dreamy melodic sensibility, harmonies threading new colours through the mist. Late album highlights Let it Happen and Could This Be bookend that mood, but the nine songs here can’t quite sustain the spell. I kept wishing for some thunderous production to ramp up, some drama or rudeness to intrude. But then you can loop back to Little Clouds and forget again. – Marcus Teague"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/19/expect-the-unexpected-the-afl-in-2018-is-predictable-only-in-its-unpredictability","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T16:00:29Z","webTitle":"Expect the unexpected - the AFL in 2018 is predictable only in its unpredictability","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/19/expect-the-unexpected-the-afl-in-2018-is-predictable-only-in-its-unpredictability","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/19/expect-the-unexpected-the-afl-in-2018-is-predictable-only-in-its-unpredictability","fields":{"headline":"Expect the unexpected - the AFL in 2018 is predictable only in its unpredictability","bodyText":"If there was one guarantee about a new AFL season it would be that you never know what is going to be dished up. That is, expect the unexpected. Ever since the Bulldogs and Tigers won AFL’s last two flags from seemingly nowhere on the ladder, predicting winners and form has become little more than guesswork. With 16 quarters under our belts and four rounds passed in the 2018 season, what we know so far is that every team has lost at least once, and anyone with a roll-up-the-sleeves mentality can beat anyone else on any given occasion. Yes, it’s apparent that some teams have looked unsettled with their glossy new recruits and shiny parts. Demons defender Jake Lever has underwhelmed since starting with his new club and has even drawn criticism from AFL commentator Jonathan Brown who said he “had a soft look about him.” The playmaker is averaging 14 touches per game and is yet to look comfortable in his role. Bombers enigmatic forward Jake Stringer is starting to show signs of life with four goals against the Power on the weekend, but is still far from the player the Bombers paid for. Luke Hodge has been averaging 19 disposals but his effort has caught the eye of Danny Frawley, with the former Saint legend saying he “should sit in the grandstands now”. And the Power’s new recruit, ball-magnet Tom Rockliff, hasn’t seen much time on the field. Each team has some version of this that will perhaps be corrected - or perhaps not - in the coming weeks as new players adjust to new styles, blueprints and in some cases, new cities. AFL has become a brutal competition that sees teams seizing on the smallest deficiency. And because of that, we’ve seen so far this year that any player not in tune with a club’s ethos or general movement becomes a liability and weakness that other teams will exploit. Another intangible variable about watching football in 2018 is not being able to predict each week which teams have more to prove than the other. Almost every team is seeking retribution. If you think about each club, it’s hard to find a team that doesn’t have their own mission narrative. Take the Bulldogs. The 2016 premiers went missing last year and failed to qualify for the finals. This year is about restoring the faithful with a finals campaign. At 1-3 (w/l) they bounced back to playing respectable football after a disastrous couple of a losses of more than 10-goals a piece. The Giants are searching for their first flag in 2018 after two consecutive preliminary final losses. Up until the 67-point loss against the Hawks on the weekend, the 2-2 Demons were trying to prove they had moved beyond mediocrity and were ready to take the next step. Maybe they are not there just yet. Even the Hawks, who have dominated the modern football landscape and are sitting in fourth position, are trying to prove that they are still good and relevant and haven’t evaporated into thin air after many critics predicted their decline. And who would have guessed the youthful Eagles who were in a quasi-rebuild would be sitting in second spot after four weeks? What this all means from what we’ve seen over the first four weeks, is that football is more gripping to watch: 50 per cent of the games played so far have been decided by four goals or less; 11 games have been decided by 16 points or less. Teams that have walked into contests listed as favourites have been handed some reality checks, such as how Collingwood tore Adelaide to shreds on the road last weekend. And some teams are still hard to read like Port Adelaide who defeated Sydney by 23 points at the SCG, struggled to beat lowly Lions in Adelaide, then lost to Essendon who the week before were themselves a team dominated by the 0-2 Bulldogs. If there was a trend for 2018 it would be the unpredictable turnaround. Be arrogant at your peril. There are some trivial factors that will determine winning in the 2018 AFL climate. Injuries have played a role this year with seven clubs owning 10 or more injured players and some big names out: Ablett (Cats), Murphy (Blues) Picken (Bulldogs) Rioli (Hawks). Clangers and turnovers are becoming game-changing. You only have to miss one target for it to have a huge ripple effect. Pressure is key. More teams are buying into it, which is producing more errors and scoring opportunities. The 2-2 Suns are averaging 74 clangers per week and 85 turnovers - the most in the competition. But interestingly, the Crows are averaging 82 turnovers per week, and the Hawks 78: two teams that could be playing finals this year coughing up the football. Every team has been vulnerable enough and no team is invincible. Looking at the lessons from the Tigers’ and Bulldogs’ flags, it’s evident that current form means nothing and timing your run is everything. Teams that don’t play four quarters and teams that take a quarter to get going will find themselves struggling, because in 2018, good sides like to dominate their opponent early. They stamp their authority with pressure, quick movement and a stubborn defence. They don’t make too many errors. And they capitalize on the errors they create. Forget what you know now about the top eight. And don’t write off the Saints, Lions or Blues just yet. Welcome to AFL in 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/17/liquidators-sent-in-as-nangus-whisky-and-beef-investment-schemes-sour","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T07:06:42Z","webTitle":"Liquidators sent in as Nangus whisky and beef investment schemes sour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/17/liquidators-sent-in-as-nangus-whisky-and-beef-investment-schemes-sour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/17/liquidators-sent-in-as-nangus-whisky-and-beef-investment-schemes-sour","fields":{"headline":"Liquidators sent in as Nangus whisky and beef investment schemes sour","bodyText":"Concerns about the welfare of a herd of 261 cattle abandoned on a Queensland farm as part of a failed investment scheme run by a bankrupt Brisbane property developer has finally prompted action by authorities. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission on Tuesday obtained orders from the supreme court of Queensland appointing Deloitte as provisional liquidators to three companies associated with Keith Batt and his wife, Margaret Letizia, who were behind the Nangus group of companies. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “The orders were sought by Asic due to concerns about the solvency and lack of management of the companies,” Asic said. “In particular, Asic has concerns about a herd of approximately 261 head of cattle abandoned by company management.” Investors in the schemes run by Batt – who offered investors the opportunity to buy barrels of whisky or small herds of Angus cattle and lease them back to the company with a return of 9.55% – have been struggling to get state and federal authorities to investigate the scheme. It became apparent in early 2016 that all was not well. Nant, the company running the whisky barrel investment scheme, began fobbing off investors who had expected to get their cash out when the barrels reached maturity after four years. Instead they were told their whisky wasn’t ready and that the fine print gave management the sole right to determine when it was. Meanwhile, the company continued to solicit new investors, raising fears that Batt was operating a ponzi scheme. Some early investors got their investments back, but only with difficulty. Most of them were mum-and-dad investors who were attracted to the high 9.55% return offered by Batt and his companies and advertised in the Australian Financial Review. But the investment also lured some of the top end of town, including judges, lawyers and businessmen, who parted with $30,000 to own two barrels of whisky, which were stored at the Nant distillery in historic Bothwell, Tasmania. In 2016 it emerged that in December 2015 Batt had put himself into bankruptcy and transferred the Nant group to his wife to prevent creditors owed more than $8m from his failed property developments taking the Nant assets, including the distillery. But bankruptcy did not slow Batt down. Instead he branched out into offering investments in small herds of Angus cattle which would also yield an astonishing 9.55% return. Bucolic images of glossy black cows in green paddocks displayed on the website soon gave way to a harsher reality. Investors were soon contacting the media saying they had not received the documentation promised by Nant Angus, which was later renamed Nangus Holdings. One investor, who had a child with a disability, put the family’s entire nest egg into the cattle scheme. She eventually tracked her cattle to Blackall in Queensland at an entirely different location to the one Nangus said they were at. She contacted the Queensland police stock squad and has been leading the charge for Batt and his scheme to be investigated. Meanwhile, the Nant whisky business was sold to Australian Whisky Holdings in March 2017. The new owner quickly discovered what investors had feared: an audit revealed that more than 1,330 barrels – bought for as much as $14,000 each by investors – did not exist. Chris Malcolm, the AWH chief executive, spent the next few months fielding calls and replying to emails from anxious investors. They included one who was working on an aid project in Myanmar. “It was my sad duty to inform him that his barrels had not been filled and did not exist,” Malcolm said at the time. The chain of Nant whisky bars Batt opened in Brisbane, Melbourne and Hobart to offer whisky tastings and prime angus steaks have also closed down. The losses on the investment schemes could run well above $20m, yet investors have been frustrated for two years as regulators including Asic, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and two state fair trading commissions have dodged responsibility. Several investors have also been to police in Queensland and Tasmania. Part of the problem is the scheme involved not a sale of a security, such as a share or bond, but a sale of property, which was then leased back to Nant and Nangus. Asic said it had applied for and obtained orders for the liquidation as part of an ongoing investigation into the Nangus group of companies. “Keith Batt and Margaret Letizia, the individuals responsible for the creation and management of the companies, are now both personally bankrupt, disqualifying them from managing a corporation,” Asic said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/18/most-voters-want-turnbull-government-to-tax-more-and-reduce-inequality-poll-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T00:46:59Z","webTitle":"Most voters want Turnbull government to tax more and reduce inequality, poll finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/18/most-voters-want-turnbull-government-to-tax-more-and-reduce-inequality-poll-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/18/most-voters-want-turnbull-government-to-tax-more-and-reduce-inequality-poll-finds","fields":{"headline":"Most voters want Turnbull government to tax more and reduce inequality, poll finds","bodyText":"Almost two-thirds of voters want the government to tax more, spend more and reduce inequality, a new poll has found. The poll of 1,557 Australians by Research Now for the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute shows support for a more generous state dwarfs the support for small government. It found 64% of respondents want “more public spending on public services and infrastructure, funded by more tax revenue, in particular from wealthy people and profitable companies, and less inequality in Australian society”. That compared with 11% who opted for lower public spending, less tax revenue and more inequality. Some 10% said they wanted “neither of these” and 15% were unsure. The poll adds to pressure from an open letter published on Tuesday warning the Turnbull government that Australia is “a low-tax country” and calling for higher taxes to fund social spending. • Sign up to receive the top stories every morning The Australia Institute letter was signed by prominent economists and public figures including the former secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet Michael Keating, the Nobel laureate Peter Doherty, the Miles Franklin-winner Anna Funder and the Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary, Sally McManus. The 2018-19 budget to be delivered on 8 May is expected to contain income tax cuts on top of the Coalition’s existing plan to cut company tax from 30% to 25% for companies earning more than $50m a year. The second tranche of the $65bn 10-year company tax cut plan is still before the Senate with the Turnbull government needing two more votes from Derryn Hinch, Tim Storer or the two remaining members of the Nick Xenophon Team. The poll found that a majority of voters for all parties want more spending and tax: with 56% support from One Nation, independent and other minor party voters, 60% support from the Liberal and National parties’ voters, 71% support from Labor voters, and 75% from Greens voters. The Australian Council of Social Services has warned the Turnbull government in its pre-budget submission that a “milkshake and sandwich” income tax cut is not the right way to address pressure on household budgets. But the latest Department of Finance figures show the government has received $5.5bn more revenue than it expected in the current financial year than when it updated the budget numbers for the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, raising expectations that the budget can afford to me more generous than in past years. On Tuesday the treasurer, Scott Morrison, told the ABC’s AM program that the budget would be “responsible”. “I am not Santa Claus, it won’t be Christmas in May, but, you know, I don’t intend to be the Grinch either when it comes to these things,” he said. Morrison said the budget would contain “measures the country can afford” to invest in a stronger economy, middle-income Australians, infrastructure and services. Later, at a doorstop, Morrison said the budget also “needs to continue to exercise the restraint that has been so important in ensuring that we bring that budget back to balance in 2020-21”. Asked about the call for higher taxes, the treasurer dismissed it as “a numpty of an idea”. “The idea that you increase taxes to grow the economy is stupid,” he told reporters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/17/abe-hopes-trump-meeting-will-bring-japan-in-from-diplomatic-cold","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T05:39:50Z","webTitle":"Abe hopes Trump meeting will bring Japan in from diplomatic cold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/17/abe-hopes-trump-meeting-will-bring-japan-in-from-diplomatic-cold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/17/abe-hopes-trump-meeting-will-bring-japan-in-from-diplomatic-cold","fields":{"headline":"Abe hopes Trump meeting will bring Japan in from diplomatic cold","bodyText":"Besieged by cronyism scandals that have prompted speculation he will be out of office by early summer, Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, will arrive in the US for talks with Donald Trump this week with a potential foreign policy headache to add to his domestic woes.

Tokyo has much to lose from an agreement that focuses on Pyongyang’s ability to strike the US mainland with intercontinental ballistic missiles and ignores the more immediate threat its short- and medium-range missiles pose to Japanese territory. Last year, residents of Hokkaido were twice warned to seek shelter after North Korea test-fired two missiles that flew over the northern Japanese island, albeit at very high altitudes. Throughout Kim’s push to develop a credible threat to the US beyond its Pacific outposts and US troops based in Japan and South Korea, Abe has faithfully stuck to the White House line on Pyongyang’s nuclear program: that unconditional talks are pointless, and that economic pressure must be backed by the threat of military action. Golf diplomacy He was the first foreign leader to meet Trump after he was elected president in 2016 and has made much of their ability to bond over rounds of golf, both in Japan and at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Abe has secured repeated guarantees from Washington that it will honour its security obligations to Tokyo, but risks being relegated to the role of observer when the details of any nuclear deal are hammered out, according to some analysts. Courting Trump “did Abe’s image some good domestically for a while ... but such efforts have not produced enough results if you look at things objectively,” Professor Mieko Nakabayashi, an expert in US-Japan relations at Waseda University, told Agence France-Presse. This week, during their sixth face-to-face meeting, Abe will seek to use that leverage to secure reassurances from Trump that Japan’s interests won’t be overlooked during his meeting with Kim in late May or early June. “Having been surprised by Trump’s decision to meet with Kim, Abe is determined to convince the US president to take a skeptical approach to Pyongyang,” said Tobias Harris, vice-president of Teneo Intelligence, a Washington-based advisory firm. Washington has sought to allay Japanese fears, with a senior US administration official telling reporters last week: “The president has a great deal of respect for Prime Minister Abe’s views on north-east Asia security. He will certainly want to know what additional thoughts Prime Minister Abe has beyond what he has already shared.” Japan’s concerns There is alarm in Tokyo that the cold war abductions of Japanese citizens by North Korean spies could be forgotten in the push for a nuclear settlement. Japan says that North Korea abducted at least 17 Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s to teach their language and culture to the regime’s agents. Pyongyang has acknowledged abducting 13 Japanese – five of whom have since returned to Japan – but claims the remaining eight died while living in North Korea. Another potential risk for Abe is that in Trump will agree to broach Japan’s concerns with Kim, but only in return for concessions on trade. Japan, which was not exempted fromWashington’s recently invoked steel and aluminium tariffs, is resisting Trump’s push for a bilateral free trade agreement which he believes will reduce the US’s trade deficit with Japan. Upcoming US midterm elections, combined with Trump’s own domestic troubles, will only make him more determined to return from his meeting with Kim with a nuclear deal, but one that may not satisfy Japan. “The midterm elections are foremost in Trump’s mind,” Katsuyuki Kawai, who advises Abe on foreign affairs, told Reuters. “This is precisely the time when allies must join together on security matters to face North Korea.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/17/japan-offers-to-lend-hand-in-chinas-toilet-revolution","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T04:53:25Z","webTitle":"Japan offers to lend hand in China's 'toilet revolution'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/17/japan-offers-to-lend-hand-in-chinas-toilet-revolution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/17/japan-offers-to-lend-hand-in-chinas-toilet-revolution","fields":{"headline":"Japan offers to lend hand in China's 'toilet revolution'","bodyText":"Japan has reportedly offered its expertise in the subject of hi-tech toilets to China to help the nation on its mission to revolutionise lavatories across the country. In high-level meetings on Sunday and Monday, officials from China and Japan pledged to improve ties, from cooperating on North Korea to avoiding a global trade war, and potentially working together on infrastructure projects around the world. But infrastructure of a different kind was also on the agenda. Japan’s embassy in Beijing has reportedly been in talks with Chinese officials about Japanese support of China’s so-called toilet revolution. According to the Nikkei Asian Review, Japan’s ministry of foreign affairs, as well as two other ministries, have been seeking ideas from private companies including the inventor of the washlet, Toto, for how to help China. The idea was previously raised in December when Toshihiro Nikai, secretary general of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic party, visited the Chinese communist party’s central party school in Beijing and proposed new areas of cooperation, including hygiene and quality toilets. Sino-Japanese toilet cooperation takes place as the two countries promise to reset relations that have been disrupted by territorial disputes. Japan has deployed toilet diplomacy in India and south-east Asia but its toilets have failed to catch on in major markets like the US. In 2015, Xi launched a nationwide campaign to replace many of China’s squat toilets for foreign tourists as well as for domestic use. Xi described the mission as part of his country’s “revitalisation” and an important measure to “improve quality of life of the masses”. China’s National Tourism administration said it would build or upgrade at least 64,000 toilets between 2018 and 2020. In February state news agency Xinhua reported that China’s toilet revolution was “right on track”, with new bathrooms installed on most of the country’s high speed trains. There have still been hiccups. In January the tourism administration asked local officials to stop spending so much on toilet projects. A public toilet in the western city of Chongqing reportedly cost 1 million yuan (about £100,000). “We don’t need local governments trying to outdo each other with five-star toilets,” Li Jinzao, director of the administration said in a news conference."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/17/jamie-olivers-australian-restaurant-group-goes-into-administration","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T03:26:09Z","webTitle":"Jamie Oliver’s Australian restaurant group goes into administration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/17/jamie-olivers-australian-restaurant-group-goes-into-administration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/17/jamie-olivers-australian-restaurant-group-goes-into-administration","fields":{"headline":"Jamie Oliver’s Australian restaurant group goes into administration","bodyText":"Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has been forced to give up his Australian restaurants after the group was placed in the hands of voluntary administrators. Five of the restaurants trading as Jamie’s Italian – in Sydney, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide and Parramatta – have been sold to the Brisbane-based restaurant group Hallmark in a last-minute rescue deal. A sixth in Canberra has closed immediately. The troubles in Australia come just weeks after the depth of the Naked Chef’s global financial woes emerged. A note on the door of the Canberra restaurant announced its demise: Dear Canberra, It is with great sadness that Jamie’s Italian Canberra has had to close its doors indefinitely. We thank you for all of your support over the last 4.5 years. From all the staff at Jamie’s Canberra we bid you a fond farewell. Big Love Mr O xxx The Naked Chef had stepped in to rescue the six Australian restaurants bearing his name in November 2016 after the Australian hospitality company Keystone group, which operated the franchise, went into administration. Now Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group Australia, which is wholly owned by the UK company Jamie’s Italian Ltd, has suffered the same fate. There were no details about the debts owed by the company, but documents lodged with the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, revealed Oliver’s Australian subsidiary had been in discussion with advisers over voluntary administration since late March. A statement issued on Monday night Sydney time on behalf of the Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group Australia said: “Australia has and continues to be one of our best-performing international markets and, after a short period of in-house management we are pleased to be partnering with Hallmark.” Hallmark said it was “thrilled to partner with Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group on the Australian portfolio”. The sale is a franchise arrangement and Oliver will not retain any shareholding in the Australian group. “We’ll be working closely with Jamie and the UK team, staff and local suppliers to keep driving the business forward and delivering exceptional experiences across the country,” Hallmark said. Oliver’s businesses in the UK have been struggling to restructure their way out of debts of £71.5m (A$132m). One of Oliver’s flagship restaurants closed after falling into administration, and the Jamie’s Italian division closed outlets in a bid to stem heavy losses. In December, Oliver pumped £3m of his own money into the business, and in January the chain said it would close 12 of its 37 UK branches, as part of a rescue deal with its creditors to keep trading. Oliver’s spokeswoman told the Guardian in February the £71.5m figure for the debt of the UK business painted a distorted picture – £47m is covered by loans from HSBC and Jamie Oliver companies. The most recent financials revealed a pre-tax loss of £9.9m on revenue of £112m in 2016. Sales were down 3%. The UK business entered into a Company Voluntary Arrangement believing it could trade out of its troubles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/17/diante-yarber-police-fatal-shooting-barstow-california","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T11:00:35Z","webTitle":"Diante Yarber: Police kill black father with barrage of bullets in Walmart parking lot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/17/diante-yarber-police-fatal-shooting-barstow-california","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/17/diante-yarber-police-fatal-shooting-barstow-california","fields":{"headline":"Diante Yarber: Police kill black father with barrage of bullets in Walmart parking lot","bodyText":"California police fired what sounded like more than 30 bullets at a packed car in a shopping store parking lot, killing a black father of three and injuring a young woman in the latest US law enforcement shooting to spark backlash. Police in Barstow, two hours outside of Los Angeles, killed 26-year-old Diante Yarber, who was believed to be unarmed and was driving his cousin and friends to a local Walmart on the morning of 5 April. Police have alleged that Yarber was “wanted for questioning” in a stolen vehicle case and that he “accelerated” the car towards officers when they tried to stop him, but his family and their attorney argued that the young father posed no threat and should not have been treated as a suspect in the first place. “The police took him away for no reason,” said Brittany Chandler, the mother of Yarber’s 19-month-old daughter, Leilani. “The police should be held accountable for this … They are sick people for them to be able to shoot someone down in broad daylight.” The shooting happened weeks after police in northern California killed Stephon Clark, an unarmed father who was standing in his family’s back yard. Though Yarber’s killing has not prompted massive rallies, both shootings have shone a harsh light on the way police continue to aggressively use lethal force in black communities, even in a liberal state where the Black Lives Matter movement has long protested against police violence and racism. The San Bernardino county sheriff’s department said officers were responding to a “call of a suspicious vehicle” and attempting a “traffic stop” when Yarber, the driver, “suddenly reversed the vehicle” and hit a patrol car and then allegedly accelerated. Blurry footage from a witness captured the sounds of dozens of rounds fired in rapid succession, with one or more officers firing at the car, not far from bystanders and shoppers in the lot. Lee Merritt, an attorney for the family, said Yarber, who was known by the nickname “Butchie”, was not armed and that the car posed no danger to officers when they began spraying him with bullets. “They saw a car full of black people sitting in front of a Walmart, and they decided that was suspicious,” said Merritt. “They just began pouring bullets … It’s irresponsible. It’s dangerous. It’s mind-boggling, the use of force.” A police spokeswoman said “involved officers” were on “paid administrative leave”, but declined to disclose the number of bullets shot and officers who fired. Police labeled the incident an “assault” on an officer, but Dale Galipo, an attorney representing the 23-year-old woman hit in the car, said the investigation so far has revealed Yarber was unarmed and that officers were not in the path of the vehicle, which means they should never have discharged their weapons, let alone fire a barrage of bullets. Galipo said his client was struck by at least two shots and suffered “serious injuries”, adding, “She’s still in a state of shock.” Yarber was also driving his cousin’s car at the time, which was never reported stolen, said Aleta Yarber, Diante’s aunt, who said she has since retrieved the car and that it did not appear it had rammed into police vehicles. Police did not respond to inquiries about the claims that Yarber was a car theft suspect. Aleta’s son was in the car at the time of the shooting, but the bullets missed him. In the weeks since, “He has not been able to say much of anything,” she said. “It was very traumatizing.” Merritt said he believed Yarber was trying to shield others in the car from bullets when he was hit, adding that the 23-year-old woman in the back was initially placed in a police car and treated like a suspect before officers got her medical attention. Ruby Hawkins, Yarber’s sister, said local police often harassed her brother and that the officers should face criminal charges for killing him. “They are the biggest criminals. They are bullies with badges … I don’t know how you can fear for your life with a person that is moving away from you.” Hawkins, 40, said her brother had a job working at a warehouse and that she saw him the night before he was killed. “You see this all the time, but you never in a million years think you’ll be the one crying about a loved one killed at the hands of police.” Training and policy dictates that police should not fire at moving vehicles, said Galipo, noting that these kinds of killings are avoidable and particularly dangerous. Last year, undercover police in Hayward, California, attempted to shoot a driver they were trying to arrest and instead killed a 16-year-old girl sitting in the passenger seat. “It still doesn’t even feel real. I wish I could just wake up and it would be a dream,” said Chandler, adding it was difficult to imagine her daughter growing up without Yarber. Police probably targeted him because he was black, added Chandler, who is white: “They would’ve never drawn their guns on me.” Samantha Robledo, who has a seven-year-old daughter with Yarber, said she felt like police were trying to manufacture reasons to attack his character and justify the killing. “He would always make you smile, no matter what,” she added. “You couldn’t be angry around him. He was so loving and friendly, and that’s what we’re going to miss the most.” Robledo said she has tried her best to help their daughter cope since his death. When they talk about her father now, the girl, Naliyah, says, “He’s my angel now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/17/peta-credlin-boasted-about-admonishing-josh-frydenberg-how-is-that-ok-katharine-murphy","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T03:27:52Z","webTitle":"Peta Credlin boasted about admonishing Josh Frydenberg.

How is that OK?","bodyText":"Right now the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, is trying to do something serious, something voters would expect their elected governments to do – achieve a truce in the decade-long climate and energy wars. You can take any position you like on Frydenberg’s national energy guarantee, you can assert it’s the cure for cancer, or a fourth-worst policy option hopelessly compromised by the delicate startle reflex of the Coalition party room – but one thing is beyond dispute. The energy minister is trying to get something done, and he’s pushing ahead, despite the fact things internally are feeling shaky, and despite the inclination of some colleagues to cue up another round of Canberra’s favourite binge watch – Survivor, Parliament Island. Politics should be about getting things done. The business is supposed to be organised intellectual conflict and its synthesis. But for some it’s about confecting an endless state of war with your opponent, and preaching righteously to the converted. • Sign up to receive the latest news in Australian politics every weekday Everything is tribal, from the politics of destruction to the media organisations seeking to commodify tribalism – as a means of surviving the great technological disruption of the past 10 years. So when someone breaks out of the various cults of diminishing returns and makes a stab at progress, when they make a run for it across open #auspol terrain in a numbed state of shock at their own audacity, the punishments back at My Feelings Trump Your Facts HQ, can be swift and severe. We’ve seen one such example play out over the past couple of days. Frydenberg, during an appearance on breakfast television late last week, rashly removed his cult goggles and observed, out loud, with people listening, what the rest of us can plainly see. Tony Abbott is intent on causing trouble. “He’s always going to try and cut across what the prime minister has been saying lately,” Frydenberg said on the Nine Network. Given that Abbott has set about destroying every attempt Australian policy makers have made at climate action over the past decade, either on his own side of politics, or on the progressive side, Frydenberg’s insight was a distance short of penetrating. It was just bleeding obvious. But tolerance for reality is low on the Sky News night shift. If you’ve never watched, and let’s be honest, most of us haven’t – just picture Fox News mini-mes, on the hunt for their reality TV president. Unlike the Sky day shift, which likes its political journalism fast and straight, the nocturnal crew maintain a simple credo: be strident or remain silent. In this Hobbesian universe, people are either on the team or off it. Frydenberg, in calling out Abbott, had apparently committed a thought crime that had diminished him in the eyes of conservatives and hurt him with “the base” – also known as the increasingly unrepresentative sample of people who still maintain rigid partisan loyalties. Let’s hand over to Peta Credlin now, talking to Andrew Bolt, deep in sundown territory. “I’ve had a conversation with him,” Abbott’s former chief of staff told Bolt. She wasn’t going to divulge details, apart from noting that Frydenberg – who people might remember is a cabinet minister – had been in Principal Peta’s office explaining himself. “I’m not going to get into it on air, but I don’t think you’ll see that again,” said the former staffer, serene in the obvious overreach. Unfortunately it is not a new phenomenon for media folks to blur the lines between commentator and backroom player, but one of the most corrosive things in the modern media environment is the commodification of this mini-industry. These days we don’t just have the odd person hoping just a little too fervently, overstepping just ever so slightly, we have a small production line of people who are sometimes players and sometimes bystanders, generously sharing their insights. The proliferation is such that journalism might have to consider a new code of conduct. In what capacity, exactly, is Credlin admonishing Frydenberg? As Abbott’s former staffer? As a player in Liberal party circles? As a media figure, carrying out a small pro bono sideline in life coaching? If the admonition was carried out as a media figure – and let’s be honest, all of us in the journalism business have been known to periodically tell politicians precisely what we think of them and their various courses of action – in what universe is it OK to retail a private conversation in public, as some strange little game of one-upmanship? For a Twitter moment? Frydenberg, for his part, reports that he’s unmoved by the admonition. It’s all just one big meh. “I stand by my words and I’ll continue to call it as it is,” he says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/18/which-football-teams-have-missed-two-penalties-in-added-time","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T09:00:49Z","webTitle":"Which football teams have missed two penalties in added time? | The Knowledge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/18/which-football-teams-have-missed-two-penalties-in-added-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/18/which-football-teams-have-missed-two-penalties-in-added-time","fields":{"headline":"Which football teams have missed two penalties in added time?","bodyText":"“In Cardiff v Wolves recently, Cardiff were awarded and missed two penalties in second-half injury time.

Tim Hanson has news for Ben: “In April 2010, AFC Wimbledon’s 19-year-old goalkeeper Seb Brown saved penalties from Mansfield’s Jake Speight and Kyle Perry to hand the Dons a 1-0 win. Seb was a boyhood Wimbledon fan and had been brought into the team in place of regular keeper James Pullen. Brown was to repeat the two-penalty-saves feat two years later, keeping out two Luton players as Wimbledon won a Football League place via a penalty shootout.” “This also happened in the Cambridge United v Accrington Stanley game last season,” reports Adam Clark, who notes: “Incidentally, Will Norris, the heroic Cambridge United keeper at the time, is now reserve keeper at Wolves, and was on the bench at Cardiff last Friday.” Joe Groszewski writes in to add that: “In 2006, Blackburn missed two last-minute penalties as we fell victim to Big Sam’s Bolton. Benni McCarthy feebly hit the first straight at Jussi Jaaskelainen but someone was fouled during the follow-up. Then Jason Roberts sidefooted the second to exactly the same place.” Ross Flockhart clarified that the penalties were in the last five minutes and not actually injury-time, but reckons the referee will be familiar … An XI from the same foreign country “In AEK Larnaca’s 3-2 to defeat to AEL Limassol in the Cypriot league last week they started with nine Spaniards.

This was the starting line-up: Copa, Eboué, Stepanovs, Kanté, Boka, Djire, Lolo, Mandaka, Né, Romaric, Sanogo. Moreover, two of the three substitutions that Beveren brought on were also from Ivory Coast.” Boris Cule adds: “Beveren finally went one better on the opening day of the next season, when their entire starting lineup came from Ivory Coast.” Lewis Fairfax has another: “Calcio San Marino (the only team in the principality) regularly field lineups composed solely of players eligible to play for Italy rather than San Marino. They play in the Girone (Group) F of the Italian Serie D, and an example was their match against Sammaurese Calcio on 4 December 2016: Dini (born in Cattolica, Italy), Fagioli (Cesena, Italy), Bova (Caserta, Italy), Fantini (Cesena, Italy), Zamagni (Cesena, Italy), Mazzotti (Cesena, Italy), Cenci (Rimini, Italy), Baldazzi (Castel San Pietro, Italy), Buonocunto (Naples, Italy), Guidi (undisclosed, Italy), Braccini (San Piero in Bagno, Italy).” End times “Has there ever been a professional match where the teams did not change ends at half-time?” wonders Lewis Jones. “If so, what was the reason?” Ian Williams writes: “Yes and no. Shortly after the start of the second half of the Italian Serie B match between Foggia and Bari in 1999, rival fans started to throw missiles at the opposing goalkeepers. In order to complete the match, referee Pierluigi Collina asked both teams if they would be happy to continue the match at the end from which they had played in the first half. With the goalkeepers distanced from opposition fans, the match was completed without incident.

In a sign of its growing concern that protectionism is being stimulated by voter scepticism, the IMF used its half-yearly health check for the world economy to tell policymakers they needed to address the public’s concerns before a better-than-expected period of growth came to an end. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF’s economic counsellor, said: “The first shots in a potential trade war have now been fired.” He said Donald Trump’s tax cuts would suck imports into the US and increase the size of the trade deficit 2019 by $150bn – a trend that could exacerbate trade tensions. “The multilateral rules-based trade system that evolved after world war two and that nurtured unprecedented growth in the world economy needs strengthening. Instead, it is in danger of being torn apart.” Obstfeld said there was more of a “phoney war” between the US and China than a return to the widespread use of tariffs in the Great Depression, but that there were signs that even the threat of protectionism was already harming growth. “That major economies are flirting with trade war at a time of widespread economic expansion may seem paradoxical – especially when the expansion is so reliant on investment and trade,” Obstfeld added. But public optimism about the benefits of globalisation had been eroded because of the growing gap between rich and poor and the fact that many households in the west had seen little or no benefit from growth, he said. “If policymakers are complacent and do not tackle the challenge of strengthening long-term growth, political risks could intensify, possibly reversing some of the progress that economic reforms and integration have achieved to date.” His warning came as the IMF’s World Economic Outlook predicted the growth in 2018 and 2019 would be the strongest and broadest-based since 2010, when there was an initial sharp bounce back from the global recession of 2008-09. The fund said it expected expansion of 3.9% this year and next – up by 0.2 points in each year from the October WEO. The WEO said its biggest growth upgrade since October had been for the US, which is expected to expand by 2.9% in 2018 and 2.7% in 2019 – up from the 2.3% and 1.9% forecast in October. The eurozone is also expected to outperform previous forecasts, with growth of 2.4% in 2018 and 2.0% in 2019, up by 0.5 and 0.3 points, respectively. The IMF made only modest changes to its forecasts for the UK. It said growth was on course to be 0.1 point higher in 2018, at 1.6%, but 0.1 point lower in 2019, at 1.5%. By 2023, the IMF expects UK growth to be 1.6%, slightly higher than the 1.4% pencilled in for the eurozone. Obstfeld said this forecast was a best-case assumption based on a Brexit deal that involved zero tariffs and favourable access to the EU for the City. Growth would still be lower than it would have been had the UK remained a member of the EU. Despite the UK’s muted growth prospects, the IMF gave its blessing to interest rate increases from the Bank of England, noting that unemployment was close to record lows and further falls could add to wage pressures at a time when inflation was already above the government’s 2% target. The fund said strong growth would help dispel some of the remaining legacies of the financial crisis of a decade ago, by accelerating the end to unconventional monetary policies such as quantitative easing, boosting investment and healing labour market scars. “Other after-effects of the crisis seem more durable, however, including higher debt levels worldwide and widespread public scepticism about policymakers’ capacity and willingness to generate robust and inclusive growth,” Obstfeld added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2018/apr/19/losing-mum-breast-cancer-defined-radiography-career","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T08:50:30Z","webTitle":"Losing my mum to breast cancer defined my radiography career","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2018/apr/19/losing-mum-breast-cancer-defined-radiography-career","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/2018/apr/19/losing-mum-breast-cancer-defined-radiography-career","fields":{"headline":"Losing my mum to breast cancer defined my radiography career","bodyText":"As my mum fought against breast cancer, I decided I wanted to spend my life seeking it out in others.

I wanted to be the person sitting someone down and reassuring them, helping them to feel prepared the way my mum had done for me. When she was in the midst of her treatment, I knew I wanted to spend my life tackling the disease she was fighting – not just at the point of diagnosis, but all the way through. I chose the disease that had chosen my mum. After she finished her treatment I started working in mammography image interpretation in a hospital in Oxford and was looking at signing up for a master’s in breast imaging, which would allow me to work as a consultant radiographer. Five years after her initial diagnosis, my mum found another lump. Her GP dismissed it, but I examined the lump and made sure she went back to the GP and got it thoroughly investigated. As I feared, the cancer had come back. She had more surgery and chemotherapy, but in 2014 she was diagnosed with metastatic bone cancer. Despite more chemotherapy, the surveillance scans showed that it had spread to her liver and she was given a prognosis of six to nine months. Mum was determined to enjoy what time she had left. Like me she loved the outdoors and being active. She was a retired PE teacher, so we decided to walk the Devon and Welsh coastlines and she had a wonderful trip to Lundy Island with her closest friends. A few months after we came home, she went into a hospice in Plymouth and I took unpaid leave to spend time with her. Those final few weeks were hard. I’d go out for runs along the coast to clear my head and give me strength. By then I’d worked with cancer patients for nearly eight years and I drew strength from those experiences to help me cope. When my mum died in July 2015, at the age of 68, I really struggled with grief. I couldn’t run, I couldn’t really do anything. Looking back now I don’t remember much about that time; it was a painful blur. I went straight back to work – on reflection I probably needed time, but I was running on automatic. I continued studying for my MSc in breast imaging, using my time in the hospice with mum to write case studies. Eighteen months after she passed away, I got my dream job as a consultant breast radiographer at the Royal Marsden hospital in central London. Every day I meet patients like my mum and families just like my sister and me. I see women who, hopefully, following an ultrasound and mammogram, can be told they don’t have cancer. Then there are obviously days when I have to give the news that it is cancer. Sometimes, I’m able to reassure patients that we’ve caught it early, that they’ve followed the correct procedures by going to see their GP and that they have plenty of treatment options available to them. Other times I might have to say that the treatment isn’t working, and explain what the scans might show. Thanks to my mum’s direct approach, I’m not scared to talk to people about how they’re feeling, and I try to reassure them the way she did me. I can see they’re anxious and, like everyone at the Royal Marsden, I do my best to ensure they have the very best care possible. I’m running the London Marathon on Sunday in memory of my mum and for the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, which funds so much of the research, treatment and care where I work. The training has forced me to take up running again for the first time since mum was in the hospice, and it’s changed my mood so much. I know on the day it’s going to be really emotional but I just hope that mum is looking down on me and feeling proud, not just of me running the marathon but of the person I have become.

At least 10,000 trees are thought to have been felled in Białowieża, one of Europe’s last parcels of primeval woodland, since the Polish environment minister, Jan Szyzko tripled logging limits there in 2016. Greenpeace says that as many as 100,000 conifers and broad-leaved trees in the lowland forest may have been lost. Poland had claimed that the chainsaws were needed to excise a spruce beetle outbreak but, in a damning ruling, the EU judges found that Poland’s own documents showed that logging posed a greater threat to Białowieża’s integrity. A minimum fine of €4.3m – potentially rising to €100,000 a day – could now be levied against Poland unless the tree felling is stopped. James Thornton, the chief executive of the green law firm ClientEarth, said: “This is a huge victory for all defenders of Białowieża forest. Hundreds of people were heavily engaged in saving this unique, ancient woodland from unthinkable destruction.” The EU’s environment commissioner, Karmenu Vella, tweeted: “Protecting biodiversity paramount. We welcome the Polish Govt’s recognition &amp; look forward to implementation”. The European court of justice ruling follows reports of imminent Polish concessions in a separate dispute between Warsaw and Brussels over the independence of its judiciary and free media. EU officials though stressed that Białowieża was a “very separate” case, adding that the commission would now closely monitor Poland’s response to the verdict. “If they comply with the judgment, no problem,” one EU source told the Guardian. “If they don’t, we have a possibility to go to a second infringement procedure that may end up in fines.” A government statement said that Poland would soon propose a “compromise solution” for Białowieża, after a new protection plan had been prepared. Henryk Kowalczyk, the country’s environment minister, added: “Poland will respect the verdict. The Białowieża forest is our national heritage. All the activities have been undertaken with its preservation in the best possible condition for present and future generations in mind.” Another government source told the Guardian: “The issue is not black and white, but nobody will be questioning the ruling.” Białowieża is one of the last remaining fragments of the primeval forest that carpeted Europe 10,000 years ago, and it remains a haven for birds, wolves, lynx and 25% of the world’s European bison population. Nestled across Poland and Belarus on the watershed of the Baltic and Black Seas, Unesco has classified the the forest as a site of “outstanding universal value”. But Greenpeace argues that it is still threatened by government plans to replant in virgin forest areas, and should be turned into a national park. Its spokeswoman, Kasia Jagiełło, said: “Białowieża has beautiful powers to regenerate itself – if it is left alone. If you plant new trees in logged parts of the natural forest, you risk turning it into a managed wood, and we have more than enough of those in Poland.” The group is fighting for charges to be dropped against 300 activists arrested during anti-logging protests, and fears that public safety will be used as “a pretext” for continued low-level logging. Poland has withdrawn its heavy machinery from Białowieża, while preserving a right to continue logging where falling trees or branches are a concern. But the EU court found that Poland had not defined precisely what “public safety” meant, and that its “active forest management operations” could not be permitted for that reason. The issue could be a test for the commission, which sees “a positive recalibration” in Warsaw, since Jan Szyzko’s removal as environment minister in January. Ariel Brunner, head of policy at BirdLife Europe, said that the EU’s swift action had “stopped the chainsaw massacre of Europe’s most iconic forest, but only after substantial damage has already been done. The commission must now show the same resolve in tackling the many other cases of illegal environmental destruction underway throughout Europe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/17/icelandic-boys-titanic-lego-replica-us-museum-worlds-biggest","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T10:44:30Z","webTitle":"Icelandic boy's Titanic Lego replica makes it safely across to US museum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/17/icelandic-boys-titanic-lego-replica-us-museum-worlds-biggest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/17/icelandic-boys-titanic-lego-replica-us-museum-worlds-biggest","fields":{"headline":"Icelandic boy's Titanic Lego replica makes it safely across to US museum","bodyText":"An Icelandic boy who built the world’s largest replica of the Titanic in Lego is to visit the model as it is exhibited in a museum in the US for the first time. Brynjar Karl Birgisson originally used 56,000 bricks to make the eight-metre replica, but “after the front part broke we had to buy more, taking it to a total of around 65,000”, the 15-year-old said. Lego subsidised the build by giving Brynjar a discount on some of the bricks needed for the project. And in a move that echoes the sinister plan of Lord Business in the plotline of The Lego Movie, the teenager has glued the model together. “One hundred twenty tubes of crazy glue were used,” he said. The model, previously displayed in Iceland, Sweden, Norway and Germany, has travelled to the Titanic Museum in Tennessee, where Brynjar will be making an appearance on 21 April. He said the experience had helped him with his autism. “Although I’m still autistic and will always be, I have trained myself to be ‘as normal as possible’ – whatever normal means,” he told the museum in an interview. “I was totally unable to communicate when I started the project and now I’m standing on stage and giving interviews. It has given me confidence. When I started the building process I had a person helping me in school in every step that I took, but today, I’m studying without any support. I have had the opportunity to travel and explore and meet wonderful people.” Brynjar has previously travelled to the US to deliver a TED talk about his autism and the Titanic replica project. He said he recalled first playing with Lego when he wasfive, and explained that his grandfather helped him with the calculations to scale the Titanic’s plans down so that the ship would suit the 4cm Lego mini-figures. Brynjar’s mother, Bjarney Ludviksdottir, told the museum: “When your child comes to you with an interesting big or crazy dream or goal he or she would like to reach, and need your help, listen carefully, and make an attempt to find ways to support the child to reach that goal. It might be the best investment you ever make for your kid.” She added that the story was an inspiration of other parents with autistic children: “When parents of autistic kids start their upbringing, they are often totally blind on what the future looks like. There are so many hindrances that their kids will have to overcome to become functional citizens. “It’s a really good feeling to be able to share with other parents that it’s more than possible to train autistic kids to the overcome these hindrances.” Brynjar does not intend to follow up his Titanic success with another large-scale Lego creation. “I never build anything after the Titanic. I turned more towards exploring ships and their stories because I’m interested in becoming a captain when I grow up,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/26/how-has-the-brexit-vote-affected-the-economy-april-verdict","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T12:21:56Z","webTitle":"How has the Brexit vote affected the economy?

April verdict","bodyText":"Sterling retreats after Carney comments The pound soared earlier in the month amid speculation over an interest rate rise from the Bank of England in May, but sterling has staged a sharp retreat since Mark Carney hinted of a delay following recent weak economic data. Sterling had climbed back above $1.43 for the first time since January after the ONS declared the return of real wage growth – seen as a key prompt for higher interest rates. However, the governor pointed to bad economic news from heavy snowfall and weak retail sales, sending the pound back below $1.40. Sterling remains about 6% less valuable versus the dollar than before the 2016 referendum. FTSE 100 rises as pound weakens What’s bad for the pound is good for the FTSE 100 because many of the companies in the index make substantial profits in dollars and export around the globe. The weak pound, which is a boon for these firms, has helped the index of bluechip British shares rise by almost 400 points over the past month. Fears over a potential trade war between China and the US rattled markets earlier in the month but a softer tone from Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has placated investors. Better than expected UK inflation falls to lowest level for a year Inflation unexpectedly fell in March, the clearest indication yet of the EU referendum result’s fading effects on the cost of living in Britain. Growth in prices accelerated sharply last year, triggered by the weak pound after the Brexit vote pushed up the cost of imports. That has now begun to fade, with inflation sliding to 2.5% last month from 2.7% a month earlier. The outcome was lower than forecast, despite speculation that the reading could have been influenced by one-off factors – such as the lack of a budget in March, which usually drives up the cost of fuel and tobacco in the spring. Better than expected Trade deficit shrinks amid global fears The spectre of a damaging global trade war triggered by Donald Trump could dent the ambition of leading Brexiters to strike free trade deals with the rest of the world after the UK leaves the EU. For now, despite the warning signs, there was better news last month in the narrowing UK trade deficit. The trade deficit highlights the difference between what Britain sells abroad and what it imports. In February, this narrowed to £10.2bn, down from £12.2bn in January. Worse than expected ‘Beast from the east’ causes drop in activity There were signs that the freezing weather and heavy snow early last month brought the UK economy to a standstill, raising questions over whether the Bank of England would raise interest rates in May. Barometers of business activity in the construction and services sectors fell sharply, with the latter recording the worst month for activity since the Brexit vote. The IHS Markit/CIPS all sector purchasing managers’ index fell to 52.1, down from 54.2 on a gauge where a reading of 50 splits the difference between expansion and contraction. As a result, economists are forecasting a fall in economic growth for the first quarter of 2018 by about half from the final months of last year. Better than expected Unemployment falls, but wage growth stalls The big news was the return of real wage growth after a year of negative earnings after inflation for British workers, when the ONS said average pay was once again outstripping price growth. Unemployment also unexpectedly fell to the lowest level since 1975, sliding to 4.2% in the three months to February from 4.3% in the three months to January. However, the return of real wage growth was down to falling inflation, rather than rising pay. Against forecasts for an increase of 3%, average weekly earnings including bonuses rose by 2.8%, at the same level as January. Worse than expected Retail sales feel unseasonal chill March’s bad weather may seem like a distant memory, but the scars still show on retailers’ profit and loss accounts. Freezing temperatures sent shoppers scuttling from the nation’s high streets and clobbered sales. Volume of sales fell 1.2% in March from February, with petrol sales especially hard hit, down 7.4%, said the Office for National Statistics. Sales were down 0.5% between January and March compared with the previous quarter, the worst performance in a year. Better than expected Government borrowing at lowest level since 2007 Philip Hammond received good news from the public finances last month, with figures showing the UK budget deficit had narrowed to the lowest annual level since the financial crisis. According to the ONS, public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, fell by £3.5bn to £42.6bn in the last financial year – making 2017-18 the best year for the budget deficit since the year ending March 2007. The shortfall between how much the government spends and what it receives from taxes was £2.6bn lower than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Meanwhile, the chancellor had hinted during the spring statement he could raise spending in the autumn budget should the public finances remain on track. Worse than expected House price growth slows amid uncertainty Brexit uncertainty is weighing heavily on the UK property market, where house price growth has slowed across the country and in reverse in London. The latest snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) showed demand from buyers fell for the 12th consecutive month in March, coupled with the seventh month in a row for fewer new instructions from sellers. Meanwhile, official figures from the ONS showed the first annual fall for house prices in London since the depths of the last recession in 2009. And another thing we’ve learned this month ... Britain needs more migrants to offset an ageing population Net migration has fallen since the Brexit vote as EU workers choose to return home or decide against coming to Britain. But while that might cheer some Brexit voters, company bosses are growing increasingly concerned about potential staff shortages, which could act as a drag on the economy. The dangers were underlined by new analysis from the International Monetary Fund this month, warning that major economies face being overwhelmed by ageing populations. Calling on the world’s biggest nations to throw open their doors in response, the IMF said adults of working age would need to support twice the number of elderly people as at present within the next few decades. That would put immense pressure on welfare systems and wipe out as much as 3% of potential economic output by 2050."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/17/japan-unit-731-imperial-army-second-world-war","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T09:40:28Z","webTitle":"Unit 731: Japan discloses details of notorious chemical warfare division","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/17/japan-unit-731-imperial-army-second-world-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/17/japan-unit-731-imperial-army-second-world-war","fields":{"headline":"Unit 731: Japan discloses details of notorious chemical warfare division","bodyText":"Japan has disclosed the names of thousands of members of Unit 731, a notorious branch of the imperial Japanese army that conducted lethal experiments on Chinese civilians in the 1930s and 40s as it sought to develop chemical and biological weapons. The country’s national archives passed on the names of 3,607 people in response to a request by Katsuo Nishiyama, a professor at Shiga University of Medical Science, in a move that could reignite the public debate over Japanese atrocities committed in occupied China before and during the second world war. “This is the first time that an official document showing the real names of almost all members of Unit 731 has been disclosed,” Nishiyama told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper. “The list is important evidence that supports testimony by those involved. Its discovery will be a major step toward unveiling concealed facts.” The document lists members of the Kwantung army’s Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department – the unit’s official name – and is dated 1 January 1945. It includes the names, ranks and contact details of more than 1,000 army medics, as well as dozens of doctors, surgeons, nurses and engineers. Japan reluctantly acknowledged the unit’s existence in the late 1990s, but has refused to discuss its activities. Instead, accounts of the unit’s activities have been built around testimony from former members, photographs and documentary evidence. In 2006, Toyo Ishii, a former nurse, said she had helped bury the remains of victims of Japan’s biological warfare programme at a site in Tokyo, as US forces moved into the Japanese capital at the end of the second word war. Ishii said she and her colleagues had been ordered to bury numerous corpses, bones and body parts following Japan’s surrender in August 1945. Other accounts indicate that similar experiments took place in other parts of Asia. In 2006, Akira Makino, a former doctor, said he had been ordered to conduct experiments on condemned men while stationed on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. Formed in the mid-1930s in Harbin, north-eastern China, Unit 731 conducted lethal experiments on an estimated 3,000 prisoners, who were mostly Chinese and Korean. According to historical accounts, male and female prisoners, named “logs” by their torturers, were subjected to vivisection without anaesthesia after they had been deliberately infected with diseases such as typhus and cholera. Some had limbs amputated or organs removed. As Japan headed towards defeat in the summer of 1945, the unit’s leader, Lt Gen Shiro Ishii, forbade researchers from discussing their work and ordered the demolition of the unit’s Harbin headquarters. At the end of the war, US authorities secretly granted unit officials immunity from prosecution in return for access to their research. Several former Unit 731 officials went on to have successful careers in medicine, academia and business. Nishiyama reportedly plans to publish the list online to encourage historians to conduct further studies into the unit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/17/ousted-aa-boss-launches-225m-claim-after-sacking","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T11:26:04Z","webTitle":"Ousted AA boss launches £225m claim after sacking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/17/ousted-aa-boss-launches-225m-claim-after-sacking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/17/ousted-aa-boss-launches-225m-claim-after-sacking","fields":{"headline":"Ousted AA boss launches £225m claim after sacking","bodyText":"The AA is facing a claim of up to £225m in damages from its former executive chairman, who was sacked by the breakdown company last year after a “sustained and violent assault” on a senior colleague. Bob Mackenzie is making the claim based on what he says could be the value of shares the company awarded him under a long-term bonus plan. However, the AA says he is no longer entitled to the shares after his dismissal for gross misconduct on 1 August. Announcing results for the year to 31 January 2018, the board said it had not set aside any sum for damages and expected to be able to recoup legal costs of about £1m. “The group has not made a provision for these amounts, as the group expects to be successful in rigorously defending these claims,” the AA said. “However, the group will incur legal costs of approximately £1m to defend these claims during the next two financial years, which it would seek to recover from Bob Mackenzie when the litigation concludes.” Mackenzie’s late-night altercation with the AA’s Mike Lloyd took place last summer in the bar of the five-star Pennyhill Park hotel in Surrey, and was captured on CCTV. Mackenzie’s lawyers are understood to be claiming he was wrongfully dismissed, having been under extreme pressure, and should be entitled to damages. They will also say that the company had excluded him from talks over a proposed merger between the AA’s insurance business and rival Hastings, which they say was a factor in the incident. Friends and family members have said the company had placed extreme pressure on Mackenzie, who was “not well” and had mixed the prescription drug diazepam with alcohol before the attack. He had been executive chairman of the AA since 2014, when he was instrumental in the stock market flotation. Simon Breakwell, the AA’s chief executive since September, said the sacking ad not overshadowed the company’s “solid performance” during the year. Revenue rose by 2% to £959m, while pretax profit increased by £41m to £141m. However, the AA said it had faced higher costs from its reliance on third-party garages at peak times and during the bad weather, when its vans were too busy to attend callouts. The company is hoping to capitalise on its “car genie” device, launched in August with the potential to predict up to one-third of breakdowns for customers before they happen, according to the AA. It is now in use in 6,000 vehicles. Breakwell said investment in technology would reduce the company’s short-term profitability, but was “vital to our long-term success”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/18/turnbulls-national-energy-guarantee-could-have-no-meaningful-emission-reduction","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T18:00:03Z","webTitle":"Turnbull's national energy guarantee could have 'no meaningful emission reduction'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/18/turnbulls-national-energy-guarantee-could-have-no-meaningful-emission-reduction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/18/turnbulls-national-energy-guarantee-could-have-no-meaningful-emission-reduction","fields":{"headline":"Turnbull's national energy guarantee could have 'no meaningful emission reduction'","bodyText":"The Turnbull government’s national energy guarantee will deliver no meaningful emissions reductions in its own right unless the proposed 2030 target for Australia’s electricity sector is made more ambitious, according to new research. Data on renewables compiled by Green Energy Markets and funded by the progressive activist group GetUp indicates the capacity of renewable projects now under construction already exceeds what is required to achieve the 2030 Neg target of a 26% cut on 2005 levels by 2030. The report draws on economic modelling undertaken for the Energy Security Board to note that an additional 9,271 megawatts of wind and solar will be required in the national electricity market to deliver the Neg emissions reduction target. It also notes that, as things stand now, 9,691 megawatts of renewable projects is sitting in a pipeline waiting to be delivered – meaning the national target has already been overshot without the policy even taking effect. “This suggests that the Neg will deliver no meaningful emission reduction benefit unless the emissions target is further tightened,” the report says. It also notes that the rate of rooftop installations of solar panels is running about 50% higher than the rate assumed in the economic modelling accompanying the Neg, which indicates the current emission reduction target could be substantially strengthened at minimal economic cost. The research will likely bolster efforts by some of the states and territories to lobby the Turnbull government for more ambition in the emissions reduction component of the Neg, even though the current dynamics of the federal Coalition party room make that almost impossible to deliver. State and territory energy ministers will meet this Friday with their federal counterpart, Josh Frydenberg, to decide whether to conduct further work on the Neg. The expectation behind the scenes is work will continue but the Labor states have a number of significant concerns about the proposal. The ACT’s climate change minister, Shane Rattenbury, who has been on the front line of arguments against the scheme, on Tuesday identified five significant concerns about the Neg, including the lowball emissions reduction target and the consequences for action at the state and territory level. Environment groups have also been active in urging the Labor states not to rubber stamp the Neg, arguing it could compromise the progress underway at state level to rolling out renewable energy projects. Business and energy stakeholders have been more positive, pointing to recent improvements in the design of the policy, and to the opportunity to forge a bipartisan consensus in a policy area characterised by a decade of partisan warfare. A range of business, energy and welfare groups are expected on Wednesday to issue a joint statement urging a resolution of the energy policy stand-off. Frydenberg is urging the states and territories to support the proposal in the national interest, and to “turn a corner” on energy policy. But GetUp’s energy campaign director, Miriam Lyons, said the new report showed the Neg would be “a giant step backwards on renewables investment in Australia”. “Malcolm Turnbull isn’t just trying to slam the brakes on renewables, he’s putting the car in reverse,” Lyons said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/17/chinas-zte-a-national-security-risk-to-uk-warns-watchdog","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T05:13:56Z","webTitle":"China's ZTE deemed a 'national security risk' to UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/17/chinas-zte-a-national-security-risk-to-uk-warns-watchdog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/17/chinas-zte-a-national-security-risk-to-uk-warns-watchdog","fields":{"headline":"China's ZTE deemed a 'national security risk' to UK","bodyText":"Britain’s cyber-security watchdog has warned telecommunications companies against dealing with the Chinese manufacturer ZTE, citing “potential risks” to national security. The US commerce department has imposed a seven-year-ban on companies selling products and services to ZTE – which makes mobile phones and network equipment – alleging it failed to crack down on personnel who sold sensitive US technology to Iran and North Korea. ZTE halted trading of its shares in Hong Kong and Shenzhen on Tuesday following the announcement of the US ban, while Beijing warned it would “safeguard” its companies if necessary. In Britain, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said: “NCSC assess that the national security risks arising from the use of ZTE equipment or services within the context of the existing UK telecommunications infrastructure cannot be mitigated.” According to the Financial Times, a letter from the NCSC to companies states that the UK telecoms network already contains a “significant amount” of equipment supplied by Huawei, also a Chinese manufacturer. Adding in equipment and services from another Chinese supplier would “render our existing mitigations ineffective”. ZTE pleaded guilty in March 2017 to illegally shipping US technology to Iran and North Korea. Part of the settlement required ZTE to take action against employees involved in the violations, but instead engaged in a cover-up according to US authorities. “Instead of reprimanding ZTE staff and senior management, ZTE rewarded them. This egregious behaviour cannot be ignored,” said Wilbur Ross, the US secretary of commerce .

Folau created one of the biggest controversies in Australian sport this year when he expressed his fundamentalist Christian view about homosexuality on social media two weeks ago. Under pressure from sponsors such as Qantas and anxious to defend policies of inclusiveness, Rugby Australia chief-executive Raelene Castle and NSW Waratahs counter-part Andrew Hore summoned Folau to a meeting to discuss the fallout of what has been interpreted by many as an appalling anti-gay slur. Since then Folau has refused to back down, while Rugby Australia has decided against sanctioning him for his inflammatory comments, satisfied by a website column in which reiterated the depth of his religious beliefs and insisted he meant no harm. Castle said she was happy Folau did not intend to upset people or damage the game, but will the sponsors be so understanding? Rugby Australia will be holding their breath. Major sponsors come and go in sport, but in the current economic climate and general malaise of rugby in this country the loss of a sponsor such as Qantas, reportedly worth $4m a year, would be financially crippling for Australian rugby. The game in Australia has just experienced the most turbulent period of the professional era following the axing of Super Rugby franchise the Western Force last year for financial reasons. In this vulnerable position the loss of big sponsorship dollars would be extremely difficult for Australian rugby to cope with. It would have dire consequences for the game at the international, Super Rugby and community levels. Some will accuse Rugby Australia of being weak for not sanctioning Folau when the national governing body supports inclusiveness, but does a sporting organisation have the right to punish a player for expressing their religious beliefs? Rugby Australia may have been in breach of laws that protect religious freedom if they had taken action against Folau, who was quoting the Bible. Instead, Rugby Australia is hoping Folau will exercise restraint when posting his religious views on social media and that sponsors will not have cause to complain, but there are no guarantees he will not offend in the future. It was interesting to see Folau accuse Castle of “misrepresenting” his position following their meeting last week. Clearly, Folau is not going to allow himself to be maneuvered to appease the corporates, which means this issue is still in play. The danger is at what point does a sponsor say enough is enough? It might take just one offensive tweet from Folau on a sensitive subject to tip a disgruntled sponsor over the edge. But does a company have the right to break a contract with an entire sporting body over an individual player expressing their religious beliefs? To be sure, a company like Qantas which publicly supported same-sex marriage could argue anti-gay commentary did not fit with their corporate values. But Qantas sponsors the Wallabies, not Israel Folau, notwithstanding the fact he is a key member of the team. His beliefs are his own. They do not reflect Rugby Australia. Would Rugby Australia be entitled to compensation if a sponsor pulled out of their deal over an individual players’ religious beliefs? This is unchartered territory which will no doubt have all parties seeking legal advice, if not moral guidance. Folau has revealed he was prepared to walk away from rugby if his religious opinions damaged the game. Does this mean he would quit immediately if sponsors withdrew their support? This would make him a martyr. Castle has made it clear Rugby Australia is keen to re-sign Folau, who is out of contract at the end of the year. Losing the Wallabies’ highest-profile player in a World Cup year would be a major setback and an embarrassment, particularly if he returned to rival code the NRL. Popular opinion is that if sponsors remain on board, even grudgingly, Folau will re-sign for one more year with the Wallabies and Waratahs to play in the 2019 World Cup and then head to Europe or Japan where he could earn really big bucks. As the parties involved consider their next move, they might want to think about a quote from former Beatle George Harrison: “Heaven and Hell is right now … You make it Heaven or you make it Hell by your actions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/16/cornwall-once-in-a-lifetime-stack-stevens-stadium-for-cornwall","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T12:59:20Z","webTitle":"Cornwall braced for defining moment in its sporting history | Robert Kitson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/16/cornwall-once-in-a-lifetime-stack-stevens-stadium-for-cornwall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/16/cornwall-once-in-a-lifetime-stack-stevens-stadium-for-cornwall","fields":{"headline":"Cornwall braced for defining moment in its sporting history","bodyText":"Amid the onrushing tide of worrying world news stories, the outcome of a 123-person vote in Truro’s county hall might seem relatively trivial. If you live in Cornwall or have the faintest interest in the growth of professional club rugby union, however, Tuesday is as defining a moment as any in the county’s sporting history. No pressure on Cornwall’s councillors but the decision on whether or not to approve council funding for the proposed new Stadium for Cornwall goes way beyond sport. If you had a once-in-a-lifetime chance to boost your local region’s economy, offer hope to those young athletes not destined to become world-class surfers or sailors and create a lasting community legacy, would you grasp it? Or would you take the view that public money allocated for development is better spent on something other than a shiny ballpark which may never host sustainable top‑tier football or rugby? Not all those voting are sports fans and political pressures also mean the vote could still go either way. The positive argument runs as follows: the council says ‘Yes’ and approves £3m of funding towards the stadium project, which it remains confident the government will match. This would remove the funding logjam that has delayed the much-debated £14.3m project for years. An initial 6,000-capacity complex with a 4G artificial pitch would be in use for 365 days a year, shared by Cornish Pirates, Truro City FC and Truro and Penwith College. There would also be a health club and Cornwall’s biggest conference facility attached, all on a site with excellent transport links to the rest of the far south-west. Crucially, the money is not being diverted from stretched social care budgets or pothole-repair funds. It is ring-fenced development cash which, by law, cannot be used for anything other than the economic regeneration of one of the country’s poorer regions. Among previous beneficiaries of such funds have been the Eden Project, Tate St Ives and Newquay airport, all with the aim of convincing people it is no longer necessary to pass the Duchy on the left-hand side en route to somewhere better. The timing, from English rugby’s perspective, could hardly be more significant. On Thursday the Professional Game Board is scheduled to meet to discuss, among other things, the ongoing future of promotion and relegation to and from the Premiership. No one is suggesting the Pirates would thrive in the Premiership right now but imagine that potential avenue being forever closed. What price then a brave new world for the athletic sons and daughters of ancient Kernow? Perhaps the best person to consult on this cat’s cradle of related issues is Mark Evans, the former Saracens and Harlequins chief executive who has been assisting the bid. Like everyone else, Evans is unsure which way the Truro vote will go but is convinced a ‘No’ will kill stone dead any chance of professional club rugby taking root in the rugby-mad far-west. “If it doesn’t happen this time it’ll never happen unless a billionaire comes out of nowhere. The Pirates will go back to being a level 2 or 3 side with very little aspiration, and another heartland goes.” Evans has been saying for two decades that club rugby’s rulers should be more concerned with growing the sport than chasing profit. Ending automatic promotion and relegation, he believes, is a small part of a much bigger picture. “The current model is bust, in my view. It’s not growing the game significantly, it’s not profitable for the investors, television figures for club rugby are not growing significantly [and] attendances are only growing largely through the marquee games. “Are we prepared to say the English league will always be propped up by extremely wealthy people? If all the revenue goes out of the changing room door, the game doesn’t grow. All that money could go into marketing the game or improving facilities. Some club ticket prices are getting ridiculous. We’ve got too many games which leads to too many injuries, which leads to oversized squads, which leads to a Championship that is totally dysfunctional. What we are doing to our second tier is nothing short of shameful. All the game has done is ridden the wave of higher and higher media rights. To which I would say a rising tide floats all boats.” Evans points to Australian rules football, which has invested hugely in places previously without an elite AFL club, and thinks rugby should follow suit – how about a Brighton-based side, for example? – if the numbers stack up. “I want the game to be bigger via a managed-growth model, with a closed league and a percentage of central television money syphoned off to build up new markets. Premiership Rugby can’t have it both ways. They can’t say we want to be independent and control our own destiny and not have a growth strategy. I defy anybody to stand up and say: ‘This is working.’” Which is why the decision this week in Truro resonates far beyond Penzance, Redruth, Camborne and every other Cornish rugby town. Here’s hoping that Hellfire Stadium, Stack Stevens Park or the Vickery Arena receives its green light, even in these uncertain economic times. Build it, to borrow from Kevin Costner in Field of Dreams, and they will surely come. Try again Here are just a few of the fine, prolific wingers who have played club rugby in France this century: Bryan Habana, Joe Rokocoko, Nemani Nadalo, Drew Mitchell, Juan Imhoff, Sitiveni Sivivatu, Vincent Clerc, Cedric Heymans, Christophe Dominici, Emile Ntamack. It is some achievement, therefore, for Chris Ashton to have broken the record for individual tries scored in the competition, eclipsing the previous mark of 21 by Clermont’s Napolioni Nalaga. Ashton, 31, has also been required to play 10 games at full-back and 11 on the wing; as his coach Fabien Galthie wryly observed: ‘He has been a good find, eh?’ At this rate Eddie Jones will be tempted to dust down the ‘exceptional-circumstances clause’ relating to the availability of English-qualified players based overseas. One to watch The Champions Cup semi-finals. Welcome to the Pro 14’s finest hour, with three sides in the last four and an all-Irish final in Bilbao next month if Leinster can beat Scarlets in Dublin and Munster defeat Racing 92 in Bordeaux. Those who fancy Racing and the retiring Dan Carter to progress are forgetting the last time the Irish province featured in a semi-final at Bordeaux’s Stade Chaban-Delmas in 2000. Munster beat Toulouse 31-25 in a game so gripping it still ranks among the greatest European knock-out games.

Colour complicated this venture into urban mystery, first by showing the neon blaze of cities that ought to be asleep. For William Eckersley – whose 2011 series Dark City features in the Museum of London’s forthcoming historical survey London Nights – darkness is a technical illusion: it takes crafty under-exposure to produce a sky so inky, without the reflected glare of the street lights that are London’s insomniac midnight sun. The smothering blackness operates here like an enchantment. A shopping mall’s nondescript car park becomes an infantile model of itself, with the electric pylons as flimsy miniatures and the trees as bonsai bushes. The frozen moment has an air of guilty alarm, as if the blaze of blue light that casts such long, incriminating shadows had suddenly immobilised those skittish trolleys. No longer hijacked by shoppers to be used as beasts of burden, the empty trolleys might be playing some obscure game, positioned in an arena that now belongs to them, with the pylons as spectators. Is this how our consumerist world will look when the frantic consuming ends, and the equipment that eases sales is put out to pasture?

Like everything else he touched, it became a totem drenched in personal meaning, the symbolic headgear of a self-appointed shaman. In reality, according to those who knew him, the hat covered scars from a Stuka crash, in which rear gunner Beuys was seriously wounded, on the eastern front in 1944. That much is true. Probably. Yet the story Beuys later made up about his wartime experience has been discredited since his death in 1986 by people who bothered to check the Third Reich documents. Beuys claimed he was rescued, barely alive, from the burning Stuka by Tatar nomads and swathed in fat and felt to resurrect him. It was a tale that explained not just his survival but his rebirth as a radical visionary out of the ashes of his youth in the Nazi era. The trouble was, it was a lie. Does that matter? Is it still a useful fable, part of his crazy vision, or should we suspect that his entire artistic output is similarly dishonest, or even that it is tainted by a past he never truly rejected or explained? It’s not as if you can escape the image of the burned Beuys saved by fat and felt in the Thaddeus Ropac Gallery’s ambitious survey of his art and ideas. These symbolic substances are everywhere. There’s a cello covered in grey felt, emblazoned with a red cross. Nearby hangs a felt suit in the same muted colour, as well as a camp bed swathed in felt. As for fat, here it is in the form of 41-year-old margarine in cardboard trays in a glass case. Take away Beuys’s myth and what does this stuff actually mean? When I walked in and saw that felt suit, what I saw was despair. It has the look, to me, not of a shaman’s garb but the ersatz clothing of a totalitarian state. Far from escaping the past, the art of Beuys reenacts it. What about his “Feldbed”, or Campaign Bed – a day bed from his studio that he later turned into a sculpture? It is explicitly military, a camp bed from a long-ago war. But this exhibition made me fear I am giving Beuys the benefit of the doubt in seeing tragic depth in works that are glib symbols of redemption. These are the meanings I prefer to see in Beuys’s art. With its old, worn and organic materials it has a loamy, disturbing taste of history. On a rusty tripod, for example, stands a dark cube of matted earth with smashed pieces of terracotta buried in it. This layer of broken pottery looks like the remains of an ancient civilisation. It is tremendously suggestive, an image of the archaeology of human life in all its violence and tragedy: the barbaric ages, the brief and vanished golden ages. Thaddaeus Ropac – one of Europe’s top art dealers, who represents the Beuys estate – explains that this piece, Boothia Felix, symbolises a human. That arrangement of stones and an ironing board over there, that’s a stag. As for the turd-like excrescences of clay all over the ground, these are “lemmings” or “primordial animals”. All are components in Beuys’s Stag Monuments, a series of expansive installations he devised in 1982 out of the detritus of his studio. The biggest Stag Monument of all, with its lightning-like cascade of melted iron, is on permanent view at Tate Modern. Listening to the gallerist, I am uncomfortably reminded of how I recently tried to explain Beuys to a group of Guardian readers at Tate Modern. Beuys movingly portrays the tragedy of modern history, I said – but then found it hard to explain just how he did. So perhaps my desire to see history in his art is just an attempt to rationalise the power it exerts on me. Ropac’s exhibition suggests we really should take Beuys at his word. It draws on the Beuys estate to show how seriously he himself took all his mystic symbolism. In a group of early sculptures he made in the late 1940s, he portrays a suffering gothic Christ, makes a Celtic cross, and imitates an ice age Venus. He is reaching back for the roots of symbolism, the ancient mythic past. The most haunting of these works is an unfinished sculpture of a horse. He set out to make it using the ancient lost wax process – where molten metal is poured into a mould created with a wax model – but never got as far as casting it in bronze. Years later, at the very end of his life, he found this forgotten piece, split open the mould and put it in a vitrine. The wax horse is yellow, as if it were made of butter. On a wall hangs Thor’s hammer, emanating curly bits of bronze. You can’t get much more Teutonic than that. Beuys may, after all, be an artist it’s best not to think about too much. He helped save European art after the second world war and inspires some of today’s most admired artists, such as Anselm Kiefer. Yet he was also a bullshitter, a fake prophet and a Wagnerian poseur whose overblown myths are as daft and empty as the Aryan nonsense he imbibed – without any choice – in his youth.

Her small body is covered with a blanket, her face framed with a scarf. She cries, covering her face with her hands, as she recalls fleeing Afghanistan with her children to follow her husband to Australia, ending up in Nauru and then Sydney – separated from a son and a daughter. “One night some men came to my home – I assumed they were Taliban – and they hit me in my back. I don’t remember if it was a stick or a gun butt,” she says through a translator. “They tried to steal [my son] Daryoush and I tried to save him and they hit my back. I was screaming.” They crossed the border to Pakistan, then into Indonesia, before finding someone to take them by boat to Australia in 2013. But Nasreen was afraid of the water. “My children said we had two options: we die in the water or we get to Australia and have a life. But we didn’t know we’d be stuck with a slow death.” • Sign up to receive the top stories every morning The Hazara family of five – all of whom have been found to be refugees – has been split three ways, with no chance of reunification in sight. In 2014 Nasreen and her daughter Mahboubeh were transferred to Darwin and then Sydney so Nasreen could be treated for the severe injuries stemming from the Taliban beating. Her other two children, Daryoush and daughter Narges, remained on Nauru. They haven’t seen each other since. Her husband, Mohammad, who has lived in Australia since 2011, is banned from living with them. The air-conditioning is on high – it’s a record-breaking hot day outside – but Nasreen can’t bear that it’s cool in her house while Narges and Daryoush are in a tent in tropical Nauru with a rusty pedestal fan. Her son and daughter both suffer from serious mental illness and physical ailments. Narges has twice attempted suicide. She can no longer talk to her sister on the phone because of a years-long ear infection that she says hasn’t been properly treated. It gives her headaches and recently began affecting her hearing. Guardian Australia revealed earlier this month multiple expert recommendations have been made over the past three and a half years that the siblings be transferred to Australia. The government dismissed them all. It has been seven years since Mohammad has seen his other two children. “Do you have children? If you have children, you understand,” he says, also through a translator. Nasreen interrupts: “Even if they don’t have a child, they are human and they have feelings and they understand.” But her husband shakes his head. “If you don’t have a child, you can’t understand.” He sits restlessly. Arriving a few years before his family, Mohammad spent seven months in detention on Christmas Island, then Curtin, before being granted refugee status and residency in Australia. He lives 40 minutes away by bus, with five single refugee men. He is not allowed to live with his wife and daughter or stay overnight. “Why is a five-member family separated into three?” he asks. “Six of the best years of the best part of their lives has passed. They wish to study and enjoy their life, but it’s gone, in pain.” The tangled web of Australian government refugee policy has worked to ensure there are no loopholes allowing people who sought asylum by boat to settle in Australia, but it has created a number of tragic catch-22s. “It’s hard to understand just how gut-wrenching and soul-destroying that must be – to be so, so close to finally seeing the people you love the most, and yet still be so painfully far,” says Daniel Webb, the director of legal advocacy at the Human Rights Law Centre. “There are only a handful of families in this situation. It’s an absolute no-brainer. Families should be together.” The government stance on bringing refugees like Narges and Daryoush to Australia is well known. It’s medically impossible for Nasreen to return to Nauru with Mahboubeh, so at least four of them could be together. The four could apply for US resettlement - under a deal which has so far moved more than 200 people from Manus and Nauru - if the Australian government allowed Nasreen and Mahboubeh to do so from Australia, but Mohammad couldn’t join them. “We are in limbo at the moment,” says Mahboubeh. “Even if they say, ‘You guys can go to US’, my mum, she can’t go back to Nauru. When she has a hip replacement, she has another problem in her back which they can’t fix, so how can she go? “It’s torturing us. I don’t know why [they do it]. Every day we are hoping, ‘OK maybe tomorrow, next week, next year, we will be reunited.’ But it never happens. It’s been … years. Why? We are not bad people, or do anything wrong.” The Department of Home Affairs was asked how a family split up between Australia and Nauru could be reunited, seeing that the Australian-based members are medically unable to return to Nauru. But the department said only: “Individuals who are transferred to Australia for medical treatment should return to Nauru as soon as reasonably practicable.” When asked in Senate estimates whether refugees had to return to Nauru to apply for US resettlement, the department’s head, Michael Pezzullo, said “in general” that was the expectation, but there could be case-by-case considerations made “for compassionate reasons”. Those reasons are yet to be found for a single case. A spokeswoman for the UNHCR Regional Representation in Canberra tells the Guardian that for the “very few” families in a unique situation like this, reuniting in Australia was the only option which made sense. “Refugees forcibly transferred to Manus Island and Nauru but with close family in Australia have been placed in an impossible dilemma by the government’s refusal to bring them together,” she says. The only way this family can ever be together again is if the federal government lets them, says Webb. “The worst thing about this family’s anguish is how easily our government could fix it,” he says. “If Malcolm Turnbull and Peter Dutton just say the word, this family could be hugging each other tomorrow night. They could finally go to sleep without that awful knot in their stomach and without being woken up by those waves of panic that maybe they’ll never see each other again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/16/facebook-ad-feature-predict-future-behaviour","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T14:24:46Z","webTitle":"Facebook ad feature claims to predict user's future behaviour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/16/facebook-ad-feature-predict-future-behaviour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/16/facebook-ad-feature-predict-future-behaviour","fields":{"headline":"Facebook ad feature claims to predict user's future behaviour","bodyText":"Facebook has been criticised for hiding an advertising product that claims to be able to predict users’ future behaviours and target messages at them in an attempt to alter those behaviours. The product, named “loyalty prediction” by Facebook, is part of a suite of capabilities enabled by a machine learning-powered tool called FBLearner Flow. That tool was publicly introduced in 2016, but the advertising techniques it enables were only revealed in a pitch document leaked to the Intercept. The document, according to the Intercept, describes Facebook’s ability to use its vast amount of personal data to identify individual users who are “at risk” of changing to competitors’ products, and then target them with advertising at the moment they would be about to switch. “These individuals could then be targeted aggressively with advertising that could pre-empt and change their decision entirely,” writes the Intercept’s Sam Biddle, “something Facebook calls ‘improved marketing efficiency’”. Tim Hwang, the director of the Harvard-MIT Ethics and Governance of AI initiative, told the publication that Facebook had an ethical obligation to disclose how the technology works. However, Hwang said: “We can’t forget the history of all this, which is that advertising as an industry, going back decades, has been about the question of behaviour prediction … of individuals and groups … This is in some ways the point of advertising.” The technology serves to underscore the power of Facebook to profile its users and make predictions about aspects of their offline life. That capability has led to conspiracy theories about the company listening in to users through their smartphones to better target them for adverts. Although Facebook has repeatedly denied such theories, its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, was nonetheless explicitly asked whether it carried out such a practice during his testimony in front of the Senate and House of Representatives last week. “I’ve heard constituents fear that Facebook is mining audio, which I think speaks to the lack of trust,” Sen Gary Peters said last week. “Does Facebook use audio obtained from mobile devices?” Zuckerberg replied with a flat no – but that did not stop Larry Bucshon, a Republican congressman from Indiana, from bringing up the topic again the following day. Buschon said he had had a conversation with his mother about a deceased relative, and later that night, Facebook had showed her a memorial video of the relative. He asked Zuckerberg whether Facebook was contracting with someone else to listen in, and when Zuckerberg replied that the company was not, Buschon pushed, arguing it was pretty clear that someone was listening in. The questions came despite an explicit denial in 2016 from the social network, in a post titled “Facebook does not use your phone’s microphone for ads or News Feed stories”. A Facebook spokesperson said: “Facebook, just like many other ad platforms, uses machine learning to show the right ad to the right person. We don’t claim to know what people think or feel, nor do we share an individual’s personal information with advertisers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/22/leavers-lisa-ko-review-migrants-debut-chinese-american","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T07:00:18Z","webTitle":"The Leavers by Lisa Ko review – quietly sensational story of migrants’ plight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/22/leavers-lisa-ko-review-migrants-debut-chinese-american","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/22/leavers-lisa-ko-review-migrants-debut-chinese-american","fields":{"headline":"The Leavers by Lisa Ko – review","bodyText":"The Leavers, Lisa Ko’s quietly sensational debut novel about migration, deportation and contested citizenship, is the story of a boy abandoned in the US by his Chinese mother, and the dark, devastating truth behind it. The novel is told in four parts, the first from the viewpoint of 11-year-old Deming, who is given up for adoption after his mother, Polly, goes to work at a nail bar in the Bronx and never comes back. Deming both blames himself for his mother’s disappearance and builds a case against her in his mind through his teen years, until, at the age of 21, he sets off to look for her. She always wanted a better life elsewhere, he remembers. The reader is led by Deming’s judgments and it is only when Polly’s parallel narration comes into play in part two – addressing her son in a second-person narrative – that the facts of her disappearance begin to unspool. Here was a young woman at the bottom rungs of society, both in China and the US, trapped first in economic enslavement, then by inhumane immigration laws. Through her story, Ko contemplates the figure of the Asian self-sacrificing mother, asking similar questions of this archetype as those in the bestselling Korean novel Please Look After Mother by Kyung-sook Shin, about an elderly mother who disappears at a railway station in Seoul. As in that book, we see an Asian woman struggling for agency within her self-abnegating life. Polly, born in the rural backwater of Minjiang, makes her first migration – a well-worn Chinese route from country to city – to embrace factory life and the hope of a bigger future for herself. But after falling pregnant, she makes a second, more traumatic, journey, to America to give birth to Deming. Despite her limited options, she wants more for herself. On seeing an old friend in a cafe who looks free and single, she thinks wistfully: “Once I might have become this woman … free to move across the country because she heard a city was beautiful.” Polly never gains the freedom she craves; her story is a bleak one of false starts. After she leaves, Deming is fostered and adopted by a middle-class white American couple. Kay and Peter Wilkinson take him out of the Bronx into a small town in upstate New York. His outsider status in this Wasp suburb is brilliantly – and painfully – depicted: the only Chinese boy in his school, he becomes the victim of racist bigotry. “In the city he had been just another kid. He had never known how exhausting it was to be conspicuous.” The emotional chaos wreaked by Deming’s cultural displacement is vividly drawn. “I am Daniel Wilkinson,” he tells himself, though he clutches internally to Deming, and returns to the memory of his mother as a path back to his former, whole self: “If he could just talk to his mother in person, maybe he could figure out who he should be.” The Wilkinsons’ liberal do-good impulses are not openly mocked, but they are critiqued by Ko. Their hope – well meaning but condescending – is to rehabilitate “Daniel” into middle-class life. “They wanted him to succeed in the ways that were important to them because it would mean they had succeeded, too.” The Leavers has won praise in the US, and its underlying themes of displacement and deportation carry deep and desperately urgent resonances far beyond America, and fiction. Ko movingly captures Polly and Deming’s liminal presence in the immigrant community, on the margins of society in overcrowded apartments, in nail parlours and factories, who are always there yet invisible to the rest of us. • The Leavers by Lisa Ko is published by Dialogue Books (£8.99).

Hamilton, vice-chancellor’s chair in public ethics at Charles Sturt University, is the author of Silent Invasion: China’s Influence in Australia, a book which was dumped by Allen &amp; Unwin last year over fears of legal action by Beijing, before being published by Hardie Grant. Hamilton appeared before the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, chaired by US senator for Florida Marco Rubio overnight Australia time, in Washington DC. He said Australia was currently being subjected to a Chinese Communist party-sponsored campaign of “subversion, cyber intrusions, and harassment on the high seas”. “Beijing knows that it cannot bully the United States – in the current environment the consequences would be unpredictable and probably counterproductive – so it is instead pressuring its allies,” Hamilton said. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Last week the PLA Navy challenged three Australian warships sailing through the South China Sea, simply for being there. It has scaled up its threats of economic harm unless Australia changes its ‘anti-China’ path. This psychological warfare is only stage one, with real punishment to follow if needed.” Hamilton told the committee that, since the publication of his book in February, he has had to go to “extensive measures” to secure his personal safety: suspected Chinese operatives, carrying a suspected “sniffer” phone to intercept communications, have been caught loitering outside and trying to get into his office; Chinese students have been confronted going through his unmarked pigeon hole; and his computers have been infected with malware. Now, when he speaks at public event Hamilton is provided security guards. Silent Invasion was about to be sent for typesetting by Allen &amp; Unwin when it withdrew from publication in November last year citing “potential threats to the book and the company from possible action by Beijing”. In the wake of its dumping, other major publishers steered clear. “Allen &amp; Unwin’s decision to drop Silent Invasion citing fear of reprisals from Beijing was a spectacular vindication of the argument of the book,” Hamilton said. “No actual threats were made to the publisher, which in a way is more disturbing. The shadow cast by Beijing over Australia is now dark enough to frighten a respected publisher out of published a book critical of the Chinese Communist party.” Hamilton said the withdrawal of the book had had a chilling effect on free discussion of China and its geopolitical influence, and that he had been told by China scholars they censored themselves in order not to jeopardise their visas to China for research, and so protect their careers. Upon publication, China’s ministry of foreign affairs condemned the book as “slander” and “good for nothing”. The Chinese embassy in Canberra called the book “disinformation and racist bigotry” carrying a “malicious anti-China mentality”. The book also divided China scholars. An open letter signed by more than 50 academics said there was no evidence China was seeking to export its style of government, and that the tone of the China debate in Australia was “dissuading Chinese Australians from contributing to public debate for fear of being associated with such a conspiracy”. A counter-letter, signed by more than 40 academics, argued that: “Some of the CCP’s activities constitute unacceptable interference in Australian society and politics”. “We strongly believe that an open debate on the activities of the Chinese Communist party in this country is essential to intellectual freedom, democratic rights and national security.” After Allen &amp; Unwin pulled out, Hamilton’s cause won wide support in the media and in public debate. Several parliamentarians suggested publishing the book in Hansard, as a demonstration of Australia’s commitment to free speech, while offering Hamilton the protection of parliamentary privilege. But Hamilton said in the furore over his stalled work, Australia’s universities were silent, which he claims was as a result of concern that a show of support could jeopardise their lucrative flow of Chinese international students. “It is no exaggeration to say that Australian universities now tiptoe over eggshells to avoid any action that may offend party bosses in China,” he told the committee. “Australian universities are now so closely tied into monetary flows and links with China that they have forgotten the founding principles of the western university.” After Allen &amp; Unwin pulled out, two independent publishers expressed an interest in picking up the book, before also pulling out. One of those was Melbourne University Press, whose board overruled the chief executive on publishing the book. “Sources close to MUP have told me that a factor in the board’s decision was the anxiety of senior university executives about the potential impact of publication on the university’s lucrative revenue flows from Chinese students.” Hamilton commended the “courage and commitment to free speech of Sandy Grant, the principal of Hardie Grant” for taking the book on. In 1986, Grant was a publisher at Heinemann, which defied the UK government in publishing Peter Wright’s expose of MI5 and MI6, Spycatcher. In a high-profile court case over the book’s publication in Australia, Wright was represented by Malcolm Turnbull, now Australian prime minister. Had Silent Invasion never been published, Hamilton said, it would have represented a comprehensive victory for the CCP. Hamilton told the committee many people in Australia were concerned about China’s growing – and undisclosed – influence in the country. “Many Australians have had an intimation that something is wrong … the scale and nature of the threat is one lay people need to understand.” The Congressional-Executive Commission on China is an independent agency of the US government, established by Congress in 2000 to monitor human rights and rule of law developments in China."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/26/football-transfer-rumours-real-madrid-in-record-bid-for-mo-salah","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T08:04:24Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Real Madrid in record bid for Mo Salah?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/26/football-transfer-rumours-real-madrid-in-record-bid-for-mo-salah","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/26/football-transfer-rumours-real-madrid-in-record-bid-for-mo-salah","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Real Madrid in record bid for Mo Salah?","bodyText":"With the inevitability of a lapse in concentration by Dejan Lovren, tittle-tattle is circulating about a bid from Real Madrid for Mohamed Salah. The fee being talked about would amount to a world record and, according to some outlets, the talk has nothing to do with the fact that Real may meet Liverpool in the Champions League final. Most organs are adamant that Liverpool would rebuff any such offer no matter when it came, but some folks are suggesting a swap deal involving Gareth Bale may be on the cards, which sounds like a classic case of putting two and two together and coming up with tut-tut. Real are also said to be interested in Raheem Sterling, Leroy Sané and Kevin De Bruyne. Just who do this Real think they are? Oh right. More, or less, credible are whispers that Liverpool are interested in Schalke’s holding midfielder Max Meyer, who is available for free this summer. The snag there might be that Paris Saint-Germain are also on the case, as Thomas Tuchel, who is expected to take charge at PSG at the end of the season, has identified his fellow German as a key recruit. Tuchel could also prove a thorn in the side of Arsenal, since he also wants Omar Toprak, the Turkish centre-back he brought to Dortmund and who is admired by the north London club. Tuchel is eyeing two other players: Julian Weigl, also of Dortmund, and the left-back Philipp Max, who would replace Layvin Kurzawa, who is being linked with Manchester United despite the fact that his slipshod defending would have José Mourinho pining for Luke Shaw. Not all these stories can be true. Mourinho, meanwhile, has made up his mind on Anthony Martial, who will be invited to do one from Manchester United this summer. PSG, inevitably, are interested and so are Juventus. United will also join the queue for the services of the Fulham sensation Ryan Sessegnon. That will not be the end of United’s shopping spree: Mourinho also wants to splash out on the Roma midfield Radja Nainggolan. The Belgian is also a target for Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool. Finally, having been tipped off by Pep Guardiola, Mourinho also wants to make a dash for West Brom’s Jonny Evans, who has never been more appreciated at Old Trafford than he is now. You could say the same about David Moyes but you’d probably be wrong. Assuming that he will remain the Chosen One for West Ham this summer, Moyes has drawn up a list of players he’d like to sign, including a pair of centre-backs: Swansea’s Alfie Mawson and Brighton’s Lewis Dunk. But Moyes has decided not to make Joe Hart’s loan move permanent. Poor Hart just can’t catch a break. Wolves are also plotting to bolster their defence, or at least sign a new central defender, by bringing in Eliaquim Mangala. Chelsea’s defence and attack could be weakened, meanwhile, if Chelsea pull off their planned swoop for Marcos Alonso. Newcastle want the Hull striker Abel Hernández."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/live/2018/apr/26/tsb-crisis-bank-waives-overdraft-fees-paul-pester-ecb-mario-draghi-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T18:49:41Z","webTitle":"TSB crisis: Customers get compensation, as IBM experts fly in - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/apr/26/tsb-crisis-bank-waives-overdraft-fees-paul-pester-ecb-mario-draghi-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/apr/26/tsb-crisis-bank-waives-overdraft-fees-paul-pester-ecb-mario-draghi-business-live","fields":{"headline":"TSB crisis: Customers get compensation, as IBM experts fly in - as it happened","bodyText":"Time for a recap: The IT crisis at TSB Bank is heading towards its eighth day, as the company continues to struggle to fix problems created by a botched IT migration last weekend. TSB has called in experts from IBM, who are now trying to fix the issues that are still preventing 50% of customers from accessing its internet banking services. CEO Paul Pester has told IBM to find a solution by Saturday - and admitted that the bank is ‘on its knees’, following the move onto new IT kit from its parent company Sabadell. He said: “We are on our knees, we will get up, and come back fighting”. Sabadell has predicted that the mess won’t be fixed until next week -- one reader has been told it could take five working days. The bank has begun compensating customers, with a £40 payment to a couple. It has also waived all overdraft fees in April, and pledged to raise the interest rate on its current account from 3% to 5% - worth up to £30 a year to customers. We understand the measures will cost at least £20m. There’s some good news for small businesses - HMRC have said they’ll be understanding if people can’t get into their accounts to make VAT payments. Several readers have told us that they intend to close their accounts, suggesting TSB will suffer long-term damage from the IT fiasco. Some have also expressed support for TSB’s frontline staff, who have been through a very rough week. I may pop back later if there’s big breaking news. Until then, thanks for reading and commenting. Goodnight! GW Our latest news story on the TSB crisis is now live. Here’s a flavour: TSB customers have spent their seventh successive day battling to access their accounts as the bank admitted that the crisis could run into next week. The bank’s boss, Paul Pester, said TSB will waive £10m in overdraft fees and pay extra interest on current accounts. He has hired a new team of IT experts from IBM who have been told the problems must be fixed by Saturday. However, Jaime Guardiola, the chief executive of TSB’s Spanish owner, Banco Sabadell, said customers may have to wait until next week before normal service returns. The Guardian has uncovered images on LinkedIn of IT workers in Spain who handled the botched transfer celebrating with sparkling wine and exclaiming “TSB transfer done and dusted!” and “Hell of a team!”. The pictures were posted just as the meltdown was beginning, and up to 1.9 million customers were subsequently locked out of their accounts. Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, writes that relations between TSB and its Spanish parent company look rather tense this week.... Let’s try to be generous to Paul Pester, TSB’s beleaguered chief executive. His handling of the fallout from the botched IT “upgrade” has been poor – some of his statements and tweets have been nonsensical, others have been factually wrong – but it is already clear that the primary blame for the fiasco itself lies in Spain, at the door of Banco Sabadell, TSB’s parent. Nils thinks this may explain Pester’s refusal to rule out taking a bonus this year: He should have made the gesture, but he may be wondering if the internal blame game will end with his exit and the usual contractual wrangles. The head of an overseas subsidiary usually makes a suitable fall guy. More here: Here’s a round-up of stories from TSB customers this week: Paul Pester has told the Daily Telegraph that he doesn’t yet know exactly what has caused this week’s IT meltdown, preventing an army of customers from accessing their accounts online. Asked what the specific issue was, he said: “That’s why I have got IBM here. “We have two datacentres, miles of fibre-optic cable and several layers of software. Somewhere among that architecture are issues causing capacity constraints. “We have a team of experts that will get to the bottom of this.” Richard Brittain, the TSB customer who set off today to close his account (having borrowed the petrol money from a friend), has got back in touch. Richard ended up speaking with TSB’s Kent area manager - and learned that they think it might take another five working days to clear all the technical problems. The area manager was able to ‘bend’ the withdrawal rules, so Richard could withdraw all his fund and put them in another bank. TSB also managed to trace money that had gone missing from the account since the IT problems began. It sounds like a good effort under the circumstances. As Richard puts it: It was actually refreshing to talk to someone senior enough who could actually deliver solutions, rather than focusing on the problems. I must say, TSB need to not only compensate their customers, but they also need to recognise their staff who have been a real asset. All of the staff I have come across are genuinely sorry and they really are trying their best to help. I have been asked by the area manager to leave the current account open, so that TSB are able to gain my trust back. At the moment, TSB are going to need to work extremely hard to get the public trust back. We can’t change what’s happened, but the way that TSB deals with this issue will be the deciding factor as to whether we’re going to remain with them. TSB has been churning out some alarming error messages this week -- baffling customers with talk of BeanFactories (to do with programming language Java) and NullPointerExemptions ( ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ ). IT expert Simon Needham suspects that the bank’s user authentication processes aren’t scaling properly -- which is why half its internet banking customers aren’t getting into the service. Bradley Post, managing director of Rift Tax Refunds, says TSB customers should certainly pursue the bank for compensation, and tell HMRC of any problems too. Small business using TSB may struggle to pay HMRC due to the recent problems the bank is facing with their IT systems. The good news is that HMRC will take the circumstances into consideration, however, customers need to record the problems they have encountered so they can put a case together and ensure they do not pay more than they should. The bigger issue now is how customer opinion will change for TSB with some people choosing to sort their finances elsewhere. According to Moneysavingexpert.com customers are now receiving compensation. If you are left out of pocket due to these issues you should look to contact TSB immediately” Claire McAdam and Ian Roddie’s £40 compensation is dwarfed by the bills which some small businesses may claim from TSB. For example, tiler Phil Rooney told BBC Hereford and Worcester that the chaos had already cost him thousands as he was unable to pay staff from his account. We’ve had staff walk out on us, sub-contractors, tilers, electricians, because we’re not in a position to be able to pay them by the internet payments that we usually use so it’s cost us so far £2,000 this week.” Moneysavingexpert.com is reporting that the first compensation payments are already going out to customers who have complained. It said Claire McAdam and her partner Ian Roddie from Glasgow have been paid £40 compensation after McAdam was unable to access her bank account online or make a bank transfer from her account to repay money she owed on a credit card. The bank paid McAdam £15 to cover interest charged for delayed payments on her credit card, and a further £25 for inconvenience caused. The £40 was paid into McAdam’s TSB account just before noon on Thursday. If ‘inconvenience’ payments to affected customers match the £25 paid to McAdam, then TSB is in line for hefty payouts. It has 1.9m online and mobile customers, and if all received the payment the bill would be £47.5m. Broadcast journalist Natalia Crawford of Radio Clyde News has tweeted about the “absolutely disgraceful” situation which TSB customers such as herself are suffering: Britain’s tax authorities have told us that they will understanding if small businesses cannot make payments to them because of the TSB IT meltdown. Some business owners have warned that they cannot make cash transfers, such as VAT payments, to the authorities because they cannot currently get into their TSB account. Asked about the situation, a HMRC spokesperson says: “HMRC will take the circumstances of TSB customers into account if asked to do so.” So, TSB customers should record evidence that this week’s computer problems prevented them making their scheduled payments. If they have a reasonable excuse, in HMRC’s view, they shouldn’t incur any penalties for late payments - as long as they fix the situation when possible. That might reassure SME owners, such as animator Lee Johnson and entrepreneur George Lamptey, who have both tweeted TSB about the issue today: Just in: Paul Pester has told ITV News that IBM team of experts must fixed TSB’s problem by Saturday. That suggests that the bank expects services to remain disrupted until then, but is perhaps hoping to recover by the start of next week (which chimes with Sabadell’s comments) He’s also continuing to duck questions about his bonus, some of which has been held back until the IT migration was completed.... TSB customer Penny Simpson still cannot log into her account online - despite TSB’s claim that things are running smoothly for the vast majority of customers. She reports that TSB refuses to accept her User ID and password. When she clicks ‘forgotten User ID’, the bank sends her.... her old log-in details, and says they are now clear to use. So she tries, only to be told they’re incorrect.... Penny’s also unpressed by Paul Pester’s claim that the underlying banking platform is working well - even though half of internet banking customers ares still locked out. This is like saying the kitchen’s cooking up a storm but the restaurant can’t get any food. I’m sick to death of Paul Pester and his shambolic communications. And, most of all, I’m sick of TSB using the word ‘some’ as if this is a handful of customers. It isn’t; it’s millions. TSB’s Classic Plus pays interest on the first £1,500 of money in the account. So, raising the interest rate on balances from 3% to 5% is actually only worth £30 to a customer per year, or £2.50 per month. Getting back (briefly) to the European Central Bank meeting in Frankfurt.... ECB chief Mario Draghi has warned that global risks such as protectionism have risen - a clear nod to Donald Trump’s trade spat with China. Draghi also point out that European economic growth seems to have moderated broadly recently, with some countries experiencing a loss of momentum. But growth is expected to remain “ solid and broad-based”, he adds -- suggesting the ECB isn’t bracing for a recession.... TSB customer Richard Brittain has has enough of TSB - he’s on his way to his local branch to close his account, having borrowed money from a friend to pay for the petrol. He tells me that he’s made 13 calls to TSB, only to be disconnected after waiting for up to two hours. Richard says: I am now going into town to get all my money out. TSB have now told me they need 7 working days to fix my current account. He also has sympathy for TSB’s staff, who have been “literally in tears” as they’ve handled calls from customers. I don’t think enough is being done to report these issues to TSB. Their number is just constantly engaged, and when you do get through they cut you off after a 2 hour wait in the queue. I have been without access to my bank since Friday... and now we’re being asked to wait even more! Time to move to a better bank! I’m £400 down at the moment, all because of TSB. Money is in my account and it’s being withheld from me! Just goes to show, you cant believe the news. TSB are telling everyone this issue is fixed, yet it’s far from it. Another 2 hour wait on the phone to get through to someone, to just be told that they’re “working on it” We are on day seven now, and I’ve had no answer as to when they’ll be fixing my issues. TSB have just asked me for 5 WORKING DAYS to get my current account “un-deleted” and money returned. Meanwhile, the staff are literally in tears on the phone. Its not their fault that their employer decided to screw over two million of us. But, this doesn’t get my bills paid. I honestly don’t know what else I can do. Their phone system is diabolical, I get disconnected after waiting in a queue for 2 hours!! Back to TSB, and Paul Pester has just tweeted a reminder of this morning’s announcement: In other banking news, the European Central Bank has just voted to leave eurozone interest rates unchanged at 0.0%. It also repeated its promise to keep buying government bonds until at least the end of September, or until inflation has risen sustainably close to its target. Several more TSB customers have told us that they intend to close their accounts. David Green, 39, is the owner of a plant and machinery hire company in Birmingham and thinks heads should roll for the mess: “It’s an absolute disgrace. How can I run two businesses with staff and suppliers who require paying from day-to-day? Some suppliers are refusing to serve us services as we cannot pay like we always have done. It’s not their fault, I wouldn’t expect them to, but it’s diabolical that we’ve been left like this. It’s ruined my business week completely. I have staff who think we can’t afford to pay them. We have suppliers who think we are making excuses. I have to keep sending screenshots to people that question me. How embarrassing for a company which will turn over 10 million this year! How can I operate like this? Sackings should happen and the guy at the top needs to join the real world. Just because he doesn’t need to use his bank every day doesn’t mean we are all in the same position as him. I will be closing my business accounts ASAP as I have lost all faith and cannot risk this happening again.” Textile designer, Lucie, 31, says it is very stressful not knowing if her money is safe: “I’ve tried to log in however TSB doesn’t recognise my password! The robotic repetition of apologies and responses on their website are so mind-numbingly bland and unhelpful. I’ve actually just come back from the bank where I tried to pay my rent and it didn’t go through. Their advice was to just: “Keep trying”. As soon as this is over I will be switching my bank. “ To say that Lorraine Kelly, 52, from London, is fuming is an understatement, she tells us: “I can honestly say that since the weekend it has been a nightmare. I urgently needed to transfer funds to top up my smart meter (as I’m on prepay) but after 40 minutes on hold to TSB the line was cut. Having no choice I stupidly tried numerous times with the same outcome. In sheer anger I clicked on their status report and the final insult was a message saying that TSB have restricted some selected customers. What the hell? If I ever get to talk to anyone at TSB it will be to close my accounts and transfer all my money.” TSB’s pledge that no customer will be left out of pocket as a result of the fiasco will come with a hefty price tag. The bank estimates that its decision to waive all overdraft fees and interest charges in April, as well as raise the interest rate on its ‘Classic Plus’ account to 5% from 3%, will cost an estimated £20m. That’s on top of any regulatory fine the bank might face, as well as the (presumably large) bill for drafting in IBM to fix the problems. The Times is reporting that TSB was warned that its IT migration would flounder unless it spent more money. It says: A TSB adviser warned the bank against embarking on a major internet upgrade on the cheap, The Times can reveal. Consultants raised concerns in 2015 that the bank was not setting aside enough money for the “incredibly complex” project to move customers to a new online system. One said: “There have certainly been some examples of where it has cost significantly more to re-platform an entire bank. It is not overly generous as a budget for that scale of migration.” Parent company Sabadell reported this morning that it set aside €71m in one-off IT costs to cover the TSB migration. That’s roughly twice what UBS analysts had expected....but clearly it wasn’t enough! Radio 5 Live have uploaded their interview with Paul Pester, in which he admits TSB is on its knees and promised to compensate customers from losses suffered through this week’s mess. TSB’s efforts to placate its customers by waiving overdraft fees and boosting its current account interest rate has come too late for some customers. Mark Ellison tells us that he’s moving his account to Metro Bank “with a heavy heart”, as he had previously worked for TSB for five years. He’s also filed a complaint over this week’s disruption. IBM’s team of experts have no time to waste -- TSB customers are continuing to report problems with their accounts. TSB’s Spanish parent company has warned that services might not be back to normal until sometime next week! Jaime Guardiola, the CEO of Banco Sabadell, told analysts this morning that the migration onto its IT kit (from TSB’s previous owner, Lloyds) had been problematic: “Fixing the problem took more time than expected and we were not able to reopen access until Wednesday. I expect next week we will reach something very close to normality,” This is quite a u-turn. On Monday, Sabadell announced that the weekend migration was a success, only to quietly remove that press release the next day..... Guardiola also reiterated TSB’s pledge to compensate customers, adding: “We will make sure that no customer is left out of pocket and we are asking customers to file complaints that will be processed. Waiving overdraft fees is a good start, but it won’t tackle all the losses suffered by TSB customers this week. People could be hit by late fees, for example, if they fail to meet credit card bills or other loan repayments. Clea Bourne, lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London, says the whole financial sector should show some understanding . The decision to call in IBM tech experts to tackle TSB’s IT problems suggests that the problem is bigger than the company realised and may take several days to fix. Remember, at 3.40am yesterday Paul Pester was confidently tweeting that things were ‘up and running’ again -- something that is going to haunt TSB chief for a while. Now he actually has to make it happen, declaring: “I will take direct control from 8 o’clock this morning for our platform, I’ve drafted in a team of global experts from IBM. They are reporting to me, directly to me and I will take control of the platform until it gets fixed. I am putting things right.” Q: Were you warned last week that you weren’t ready for this IT migration? We were ready for the platform switch, CEO Paul Pester insists. TSB expected some turbulence, but no-one expected the issues that have hit the bank since the weekend. Q: Have you considered resigning? I haven’t even had time to think about it, Pester replies. That’s the end of the Radio 5 interview. Paul Pester is now being grilled on Radio 5 Live over TSB’s IT mayhem. Q: Why didn’t you give more information to customers, and claim that everything was fixed when it wasn’t? Pester says that the fundamentals of the bank, such as standing orders, direct debits, ATM machines, are working well. The problem is with capacity -- handling the number of customers who want to use internet and mobile banking services. Q: Why did you tweet that TSB’s services were ‘up and running’ , when for many customers it clearly wasn’t? Pester says TSB’s IT provider (parent company Sabadell) told him it was fixed. Clearly that wasn’t the case. However, he’s now taken personal control - a team of experts from IBM will land at Bristol at 8am his morning, and start to tackle the problem. It’s unacceptable that only 50% of customers can access our internet banking, declares Pester. Q: Isn’t it also unacceptable that you didn’t have control of your customer’s accounts over the weekend? Pester ducks the question; instead, he plugs the decision to waive overdraft fees and raise the interest rate on the Classic Plus current account for current customers who “stick with us”. This is a fight worth fighting. TSB was created to bring more competition into UK banking. Q: Will customers be properly compensated? No customer will be left out of pocket, Pester pledges. We won’t be penny-pinching. Small businesses who have suffered losses because they haven’t been able to pay suppliers or contractors should get in touch. Asked whether he would be giving up a potential £1.6m bonus, Pester told BBC Radio 4 that it was a matter for the company: “The last thing I’m worried about at the moment is bonuses and pay. I’m focused on putting things right for customers. It’s not my decision, that’s a focus for them [the board]. It’s a decision for the remuneration committee.” Speaking on Radio 4, Paul Pester says he has taken control of TSB’s IT platform himself - to tackle the problems that mean only 50% of its customers can get online. NEWSFLASH: TSB has announced that it will waive all overdraft fees and interest charges for retail customers and small business owners for April, as it tries to assuage the anger over its IT meltdown this week. After days of turmoil, TSB has also decided to raise the interest rate on its popular ‘Classic Plus’ account to 5% (a very decent interest rate these days), from 3% -- an attempt to prevent customers fleeing to a rival. In a statement, it says: No TSB customer will be left out of pocket as a result of these issues – to begin to put this right we will be waiving all overdraft fees and interest charges for all of our retail and small business customers for April. As a way of saying thank you to our customers for sticking with us, we’ll be increasing the interest rate on our Classic Plus account to 5% AER. CEO Paul Pester admits that TSB’s migration to new servers last weekend had been very unsatisfactory. He says: As we moved over to our new banking platform last weekend, the landing was an incredibly bumpy one for our customers, and for that I am truly sorry. This is not the level of service that we pride ourselves on providing – nor is it what our customers have come to expect from TSB.... “Of course, customers can rest assured that no one will be left out of pocket as a result of these problems. To begin to put things right, we will be waiving all overdraft fees and interest charges for all of our retail and small business customers for April. TSB also reveals they they’ve called experts from IBM in to help fix the problems with its internet banking. In the meantime, customers still report problems: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. One of Britain’s worst IT botches of recent years continues to rumble on today. TSB customers are still reporting that they can’t access the bank’s online systems, nearly a week after they were taken down for a planned IT migration. Last night, TSB admitted that its internet banking service is only running at 50% capacity - which helps explain why scores of users have been locked out. In the eurozone, the European Central Bank is meeting to set monetary policy. Investor will hope for hints about how the ECB will handle its money-printing stimulus programme, which currently runs until September. In the markets, European stocks are expected to nudge higher after Facebook posted record earning figures last night, suggesting its data privacy problems haven’t hurt profitability.

A few members of Congress understood that the outrage was even greater: that Zuckerberg’s company basically exists in order to spy on us. That it tracks us as we wander online. That it controls the news users see. That it buys up competitors and operates as a near monopoly. That this panopticon corporation (whose services I myself use every day) has more power – political power, cultural power – than any private entity ought to have. As Zephyr Teachout put it, the company is “a danger to democracy”. Understanding this, some in Congress were pretty tough on Zuckerberg. But watching him squirm under the Washington glare reminded me of a different conversation between the young billionaire and an elected official, one that took place in the summer of 2016, back when a sunnier conception of Facebook was mandatory among America’s enlightened class. The setting was the state department’s annual “Global Entrepreneurship Summit”, the elected official was President Barack Obama, and the object seems to have been to deliver a thinly disguised advertisement for Facebook as a lovable facilitator of basic human relationships. Seated with a panel of entrepreneurs from around the world, the president lobbed his friend Zuckerberg an easy question about Facebook “creating this platform for entrepreneurship around the world”. In batting it out of the park, the Facebook CEO, clad in his humble costume of jeans, T-shirt and sneakers, took pains to inform everyone that what animated him were high-minded ideals. “When I was getting started,” he burbled, “I cared deeply about giving everyone a voice, and giving people the tools to share everything that they cared about, and bringing a community together …” No rude senator spoke up to interrupt this propaganda. Instead, Zuckerberg went on to describe his efforts to connect everyone to the internet as a sort of wager on human goodness itself. “It’s this deep belief that you’re trying to make a change, you’re trying to connect people in the world, and I really do believe that if you do something good and if you help people out, then eventually some portion of that good will come back to you. And you may not know up front what it’s going to be, but that’s just been the guiding principle for me in the work that we’ve done …” That’s how it works, all right. Gigantic corporate investments are acts of generosity, and when making them, kind-hearted CEOs routinely count on Karma to reward them. That’s the “guiding principle”. Reader, here is what the president could be heard to say as Zuckerberg ended this self-serving homily: “Excellent.” I bring all this up not to ding Obama participating in a corporate whitewash, but to remind liberals and Democrats that, until very recently, this was who we liberals were. We drank the Kool-Aid. We believed the hype. Facebook wasn’t a “danger to democracy”, we thought. Facebook was democracy. Do you remember? The 2008 campaign, which elevated Obama to the White House, was described by the enlightened as “the Facebook election”. We had seen a community organizer, ably assisted by a Facebook co-founder, win the presidency by organizing communities – by organizing them online! The combination of idealistic togetherness and awesome futurific-ness was thought to be too much for those plodding, selfish Republicans. Obama’s state department, led by Hillary Clinton, became the country’s main institutional proponent of the thesis that, wherever the internet went, there also went markets, and entrepreneurship, and liberation. Clinton called the state department’s new mission “internet freedom” (she introduced the idea in a speech given, ironically, at a museum of journalism); she intended to take what she called a “venture capital approach” to the problem of overcoming state censorship and battling the tyrants of the world. I was exposed unforgettably to liberal techno-optimism at a Clinton Foundation event in March 2015, when I heard a speaker hail social media as the ally and liberator of the female population of the entire planet. Or think of the way Obama surrounded himself with transplanted Silicon Valley types in the last years of his administration; or of Clinton’s 2016 campaign, run by an algorithm; or of Clinton’s rumored intention to make Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s No2, her treasury secretary. But then the narrative went all wrong. Instead of overthrowing unsavory regimes in the Middle East, the internet overthrew its high-minded comrades in the Democratic party. It turned out that even an obtuse cad like Donald Trump could tweet. Errant emails caused countless headaches. Mean Russian trolls published crazy things on Facebook. And finally … Cambridge Analytica, harvesting people’s personal data. What an ingrate the internet has turned out to be. Today the Democratic party stands at the crossroads, and I hope the awful experience of 2016 will at least make them think twice before they resume their devotions in the First Church of Silicon Valley. Maybe they are finally ready to think a little harder about what democracy means. To stand up, at long last, for we the surveilled.

Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Commons home affairs select committee, could barely contain her incredulity on Wednesday. Moments earlier, the head of the union for immigration workers had confirmed there were net targets for removing people who were in the country illegally. So did the home secretary mislead the committee? Or is she oblivious to her department’s workings? Come Thursday morning, it appeared to be the latter. “The immigration arm of the Home Office has been using local targets for internal performance management,” she revealed in a staggering admission to the House of Commons in response to an urgent question. At the committee hearing, there was a suggestion Rudd had no grasp of the inner workings of her department. In reference to the existence of targets, she said: “I didn’t hear that testimony, I’m not sure what shape that might be in.” Here is the shape. There are three layers of state-enforced or enforceable departures: deportations, administrative removals and voluntary departures. Deportation is a specific term that applies to people and their children whose removal from the country is deemed “conducive to the public good” by the home secretary. It can also be recommended by a court. Administrative removals, or removals, refer to a larger set of cases involving the enforced removal of non-citizens who have either entered the country illegally, outstayed a visa, or otherwise violated the conditions of their leave to remain in the UK. Finally, there are the voluntary departures. Crucially, these individuals are still people against whom enforced removal has been initiated. The term “voluntary” simply describes how they leave. Within this category, are three sub-layers: those who depart by assisted voluntary return (AVR) schemes, those who make their own travel arrangements and tell the authorities, and those who leave without notifying the government. It did not take long for evidence of departure targets to emerge. In 2015, David Bolt, an inspector whose job it is to scrutinise the work of the immigration and borders system governed by the Home Office, published a report on enforced removals. Within the publicly available report are a number of references to targets. The key paragraph, 4.16, states: “For 2014-15, the Home Office set a target of 7,200 voluntary departures, an average of 120 per week, with the weekly target rising to 160 by the end of March 2015. For 2015-16, the annual target was raised to 12,000. These targets were split between the 19 ICE teams across the UK.” While technically not a reference to administrative removals, the paragraph is a clear reference to a departure target nonetheless. Crucially, Lucy Moreton, the head of the Union for Borders, Immigration and Customs, said the target culture in immigration operations had trickled down from the headline “net migration target” that Theresa May, the prime minister, has so doggedly kept in place. The target was launched in 2010 by the then prime minister, David Cameron, amid growing fears over the rise of Ukip and against a backdrop of anti-immigration rhetoric. The government has faced repeated calls to ditch the target. It is important to note that the target to reduce net migration – the difference between those leaving and arriving – to less than 100,000 (the most recent estimate puts the figure at 244,000) does not relate entirely to illegal migration. But observers have cited it as the source from which May’s “hostile environment” policies flowed. And that links back to the Windrush scandal. May’s policies have been heavily blamed for the desperate circumstances in which some Commonwealth migrants have found themselves. Later on Thursday, Rudd said that, now she was aware of them, she would scrap Home Office targets for removing people from Britain. It seems likely the government will also face calls, yet again, to scrap its headline net migration target."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/apr/28/12-best-beach-town-holidays-europe-france-spain-portugal-greece-italy-croatia","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"12 of the best beach towns in southern Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/apr/28/12-best-beach-town-holidays-europe-france-spain-portugal-greece-italy-croatia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/apr/28/12-best-beach-town-holidays-europe-france-spain-portugal-greece-italy-croatia","fields":{"headline":"12 of the best beach towns in southern Europe","bodyText":"Šibenik, Croatia It’s known as the gateway to Krka national park and the Kornati islands, but this 1,000-year-old city has enough in itself to keep visitors happily busy for days. A slow amble along its waterfront goes past bars, restaurants and the 15th-century Cathedral of St James, a Unesco world heritage site with a blend of gothic and renaissance architecture. In the labyrinthine old town are several of Šibenik’s fortresses, including Sveti Mihovila, a magical spot for outdoor concerts in summer. There’s also the newly renovated Barone fortress, which has stunning views. Cool off at Plaža Banj, a pebbly blue-flag beach north of the old town. Where to eat/drink Enjoy harbour views from Tomaseo (mains from £12). Start with octopus carpaccio before a main of slow-cooked lamb. For an introduction to Croatian wines, check out Vino &amp; Ino in the old town. Where to stay On a peninsula overlooking the marina, sleek D-Resort (doubles from £152) has smart rooms with balconies and sea views, as well as an infinity pool. Getting there Split airport is 53km to the south-east. In summer, easyJet flies there from Luton, Gatwick and Stansted, and Jet2 from six UK airports. MN Zadar, Croatia With a fascinating Roman, Byzantine and Venetian history, laid-back beaches, a shimmering promenade and audacious public art, Zadar is instantly beguiling. Among its attractions is Nikola Bašić’s underwater art installation, Sea Organ, with its mournful sounds and disco dancefloor-like Greeting to the Sun companion piece. Then there are the remains of the Roman forum and the imposing ninth-century St Donat church and wonderful Venetian marble lanes and stone houses. You can dive into the sea from the promenade or walk 15 minutes south to the pebbly Kolovare beach. For old-fashioned seaside atmosphere, head north along the coast to the Borik and Diklo beach resorts. The town is a great base for day trips: to islands, like Dugi Otok (from £6, 1½ hours, jadrolinija.hr), one of the loveliest in the Zadar archipelago; and glorious national parks such as Paklenica. Where to eat/drink Foša (four courses from £29) serves gorgeous seafood in a romantic spot by Foša harbour, including prawn and smoked mussel gnocchi. For cocktails, grab a sunlounger at the Garden Lounge overlooking the main harbour. Where to stay Book well ahead for one of the four double rooms at Kuća Bajlo (doubles from £56), a stylish B&amp;B in the south of the town. Getting there Zadar airport is 13km east of the old town. Ryanair flies from Manchester and Stansted; easyJet from Luton – both May-October only. Mary Novakovich Sanremo, Liguria, Italy Called City of Flowers for its bloom-laden streets, Sanremo is Italy’s Monte Carlo – with a grand 1905 casino but not Monaco prices. It’s popular with families, and in true Italian style most beaches charge for entry. However, there is a spiaggia libera in the centre, off Corso Trento Trieste, and it’s fun to take the trolleybus (filobus, line U) west to the free beaches of Bagni Azzurri and Tre Ponti. Sanremo’s atmospheric old town, called La Pigna, is a warren of covered alleys, steps and little squares. Where to eat/drink On the main road behind the marina, Basilico e Pinoli does excellent coffee and breakfasts, with lots for vegetarians and vegans. At Osteria Camelot – in an 18th-century house at the foot of La Pigna – try octopus carpaccio (€10), swordfish gnocchi (€10) or seared tuna with sesame (€15). Where to eat stay With a roof terrace overlooking the central beaches, Residence dei Due Porti has smart apartments from €85 a night (minimum stays in summer). Families can get good-value deals in places such as Hotel Marinella, handy for the beach, with half-board in a spacious quad room €220 a night for four in July.Getting there The nearest airport is Nice, served by easyJet from seven UK airports, and by Ryanair from Stansted. Eurostar trains go from London St Pancras from £190 return. It’s a scenic 90-minute train ride along the Côte d’Azur and over the border to Sanremo (from €5.80 one-way).Liz Boulter Sciacca, south-west Sicily In this south-coast port (pronounced “shacka”) founded by ancient Greeks, tourism comes second to fishing. The town spreads uphill from the harbour, with panoramic Piazza Scandaliato the town’s beating heart. Above are steep streets of 16th-century houses, a baroque cathedral and the remains of a castle. It’s also a short drive to the ruins of Selinunte, more evocative and less busy than Agrigento’s. There’s a sandy beach by the harbour, but 7km to the east is wilder Sovareto, with white sand and clear water. Where to eat/drink Tired of fizzy Peroni? Head to Mastro Malto beer shop on the harbour, with a wide choice of mostly Italian craft ales on draught and in bottles, and tasty nibbles. This is, obviously, a town for dining on fish. Try Pane e Vino (Vicolo Sammaritano 22-24, no website) in an alley above the piazza, for fish caponata – with aubergines and onions – and huge prawns. Dinner for two with wine about €70. Where to stay Sciacca’s accommodation is mostly B&amp;Bs. Particularly striking is the Vittorio Emanuele (about €60 B&amp;B), with five elegant rooms in a courtyarded 17th-century palazzo. Two rooms have terraces overlooking the route of Sciacca’s mid-August festival parade.Getting there Sciacca is about 1h 20min by car from Palermo airport, served by Ryanair from Manchester and Stansted, and easyJet from Liverpool, Luton and Gatwick. LB Viana do Castelo, northern Portugal At the mouth of the river Lima on the Atlantic coast, Viana do Castelo is a particularly pretty town, backed by the basilica-topped Santa Luiza hill (jump on a funicular for amazing views, €3 round trip). The charming medieval centre radiates out from bar-lined Praça da República and the narrow winding streets and wide, leafy boulevards are dotted with churches and impressive buildings, with architectural styles from baroque to art deco. There are wild beaches galore: to the south is Praia do Cabedelo, an endless sandy stretch backed by dunes and pine forest that’s great for surfing and windsurfing, and cycle paths and walking trails run along both river and coast. Where to eat/drink For great fish and seafood try small, family-run Tasquinha da Linda right on the port. The custard doughnuts from Confeitaria Natário are famous – expect queues. Where to stay Hotel Fabrica do Chocolate (doubles from €84 B&amp;B) makes a fun, central base – it’s a converted chocolate factory with a good restaurant (chocolate fountains at breakfast!) and a chocolate museum on-site . Getting there Porto is the closest airport (67km away, an hour by bus), served by various airlines, including easyJet and Ryanair.Jane Dunford Peniche, central Portugal Set on a peninsula of the same name, 100km north of Lisbon, Peniche is a working port surrounded by sandy beaches and cliffs riddled with caves. Surfers gather here year-round because if there are no waves on one side of the peninsula, there are likely to be on the other. The most famous beach is Supertubos, which has one of the best surf breaks in the world, that produces curvy waves and hollow powerful tubes. There are also hidden coves to discover on Praia do Baleal, and Praia da Almagreira has fantastic dunes. Take a boat to Berlenga Grande, a wild island 12km off the coast, to discover sea caves and the 16th-century John the Baptist fortress (boats leave daily). Where to eat The harbour is packed with great seafood restaurants. Feast on caldeirada – a Portuguese stew of shellfish, eels and octopus made in a large pot for sharing – at Restaurante Marisqueira dos Cortiçais. Snack Bar Sol é Vida excels with its fresh crab – perfect with a bottle of vinho verde on the veranda. Where to eat stay The 19th-century mansion Quinta do Juncal offers rustic luxury for rustic prices (doubles from €60 B&amp;B) or head out to camp on Berlenga island and wake to spectacular dawns (from €8, reservations via the tourist office, cm-peniche.pt).Getting thereThe nearest airport is Lisbon (easyJet and Ryanair fly there from several UK airports).Edwina Pitcher Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Cádiz, Spain Sanlúcar is a heady mix of palaces, churches and cathedral-like bodegas, topped by a castle. For centuries it was home to the Duke of Medina Sidonia and a departure point for voyages to the new world. Seville aristocracy began decamping here for summer fun in the 19th century and a convivial, relaxed party spirit continues. Sitting at the mouth of the Guadalquivir river, facing the wild dunes of Doñana national park, it has 6km of sandy beaches and the pellucid sea informs every aspect of this lovely town, from the extraordinary light to the manzanilla sherry made from grapes grown in salty air. The best time to come – though actually the worst time to be sitting on Playa de la Calzada – is during August’s Carreras de Caballos, when horses are raced along the beach during the evening low tides (8-10 and 22-24 August 2018). Where to eat Eat fish at tables by the sea along Playa de Bajo de Guía – try arroz con bogavante (rice with lobster) at Casa Bigote (mains €15), or in tapas form at the lively Casa Balbino. Where to stay Trawl AirBnB for private palaces, or opt for the quirky Posada de Palacio (doubles from €50 room only).Getting there The closest airports are Jerez (34km, Ryanair from Stansted) and Seville (110km, several airlines).Sorrel Downer San José, Almería, Spain The white buildings and arid hills are reminiscent of Greece. It’s backed by the cactus desert landscapes of spaghetti westerns and, in summer, is swelled by the cool and bohemian from across Europe, yet this remains a quintessentially Spanish seaside destination. It’s the place to go in Almería with the kids in July or August. San José bustles but is sweet and easy. Rent umbrellas, loungers, pedalos and kayaks from the man on the sand; or explore the crystalline marine park by kayak (adult from €25, child from €15, happykayak.com) or go below (snorkelling from €25, diving from €30, isubsanjose.com). The main beach is wide and white, there are smaller bays east beyond the marina, and the famous protected beaches of Genoveses and Mónsul start 1km to the west (accessible by shuttle bus). Where to eat While views at El Jardín (mains €9) aren’t the best, the fresh salads, pizzas and crepes are delicious. And don’t miss the arroz meloso de pulpo y almejas (sticky rice with octopus and clams) at upmarket 4 Nudos (mains €15) in the Club Náutico in the marina. The main beach is lined by restaurants. Where to stay Boutique hotel MC San José (low-season doubles from €70) is the chic choice, and Refugio Calahiguera (doubles €55), in a nearby cove, the budget choice. Getting there Jet2 flies to Almería (32km from San Jose) from eight UK airports. Also see TUI, Ryanair, easyJet and Thomas Cook. SD Galaxidi, Gulf of Corinth, Greece On the narrow streets of Galixidi, mansions bear testament to the town’s 19th-century heyday as a shipbuilding centre. Today’s Galixidi is a charming, low-key coastal resort on a natural harbour surrounded by mountains. Its five traditional squares lead up to the highest point of the town – the imposing Agios Nikolaos church. Rent a bike from Ganimede Hotel and ride out to the lovely pebbled coves on the forested headland, Pera Penta opposite the harbour, or discover the beaches nearby. Anemokambi beach, about 3km from town, is in a sheltered bay and has golden sand and pebbly bits. Profitis Ilias is a long sandy beach that’s popular with the young crowd for parties after sundown. Another fine beach is the pebbled Agios Vasileios about 15km south-west of Galixidi, just before Agioi Pantes. And 33km north are the spectacular ruins of Delphi, clinging to the edge of Mount Parnassos, home to the Delphic Oracle. Here, visitors can try tandem paragliding flight over Delphi (from €50, paraglidingfun.gr). Where to eat Galixidi is a foodie hotspot. Try the stuffed onions at O Bebelis or fresh seafood at the portside Skeletovrachos taverna. In the morning sip iced coffee like a local at the Art Café Old Liotrivi, with great views of the town. Where to stay The charming, central Ganimede Hotel (doubles from €80) does an incredible Greek breakfast of homemade pies, jams, breads and local honey. Getting there Several airlines fly to Athens, 230km south-east.Merryn Wainwright Volos, Thessaly, Greece On the northern shores of the Pagasitikos Gulf in central Greece lies the vibrant port of Volos, with Mount Pelion as its backdrop and the Pelion peninsula extending east and south like a giant fishhook. Take an evening volta (stroll) along the Argonafton waterfront and lose yourself (enjoyably) in the pedestrian side streets off Ermou. The excellent city beach of Anavros, just beneath the Archeological Museum, is perfect for a dip and has good tavernas. Alykes beach, 6km south-east on the headland and lined with cafes, is also excellent. From Volos, the Pelion peninsula makes a delightful day trip. To the east, its mountainous ridge drops dramatically into the sea; the western side is gentler. There are scenic mountain villages with majestic views over the Gulf and secluded pebbled beaches fringing olive groves. Where to eat Charming Ala Palaia (52 Krokiou) serves dishes from around Greece, such as the popular bean dish fava. Traditional taverna Ellados Eikones (9 Almirou) stays open late, serves tasty Greek dishes and has live music. Where to stay Elegant, comfortable and modern, the Aegli Hotel (doubles from £85 B&amp;B) is on the seafront promenade right in the thick of things and serves a particularly good breakfast.Getting there EasyJet flies to Volos (airport 24km away) from Gatwick. MW Saint-Jean-de-Luz, south-west France Most of south-west France’s Atlantic coast is windblown and frequented by surfers. The exception is historic St-Jean-de-Luz, whose sandy bay is protected from the ocean by three sea walls. It’s been popular for centuries: in 1660, St Jean de Luz’s John the Baptist church hosted one of the biggest royal weddings in history, that of Louis XIV, the Sun King, to Maria Theresa of Spain. The main beach – Grand Plage – is long, so it’s usually possible to find a quiet spot. And for those who want world-class waves, the surf beaches of Erromardie, Lafiténia and Cénitz are within easy reach. Where to eat/drink For breakfast (€8.50), a glass of wine or a meal (two courses €14.50), it’s hard to beat beachside cafe Toki Goxoa, known for its taloas (Basque crepes with corn and wheat) and sheep’s milk ice-cream. On a narrow street of shuttered Basque houses, Le Patio is a friendly bistro with a three-course €17.50 menu. Don’t miss the starter of moules à la plancha, cooked on a hotplate with a touch of chilli. Where to stay French seaside hotels can be pricey in high season. For affordable charm, try Le Petit Trianon, a five-minute walk from the beach with 20 simple, colourful rooms from €95 in July. Only Apartments has flats sleeping four near the beach from around €700 a week in summer. Getting there EasyJet flies to Biarritz (17km north of St-Jean-de-Luz) from Gatwick and Luton (summer only); Ryanair from Stansted. LB Sète, Languedoc, France This buzzing port town offers a charmingly unfussy dose of the Mediterranean life. As there are no major tourist attractions, it’s an ideal place to simply stroll, sit in cafes and eat copious platters of seafood. To the west lies 13km of sandy beach that stretches along the spit that divides the huge saltwater pool, the Etang de Thau, from the Med. It’s a popular area, but with so much space rarely feels crowded. Early July is party time with Gilles Peterson’s Worldwide Festival (30-June-7 July 2018), held in the city’s amphitheatre and on the beach, while August sees water jousting tournaments on the canals, a tradition that dates back to 1666. Where to eat/drinkLa Méditerranéenne (mains from €11) is a friendly seafood restaurant in a quiet spot near the marina; try the swordfish and tapenade. Halles et Manger has wild sea bream for €21. Where to stayHotel Venezia (doubles from €60 room-only) is close to the beaches and has 18 simple rooms, each with a balcony. Getting there EasyJet flies to Montpellier (35km north of Sète) from Luton (summer only) and Gatwick.Carolyn Boyd This article was amended to correct a lead image that, due to an editing error, was of the town of Menton, rather than Sanremo"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/26/tsb-drafts-in-ibm-team-to-end-it-meltdown","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T14:54:51Z","webTitle":"TSB crisis could drag into next week as bank turns to IBM","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/26/tsb-drafts-in-ibm-team-to-end-it-meltdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/26/tsb-drafts-in-ibm-team-to-end-it-meltdown","fields":{"headline":"TSB crisis could drag into next week as bank turns to IBM","bodyText":"The IT meltdown at TSB may not be fully fixed until next week, the bank warned on Thursday, as it drafted in experts from IBM to help solve the crisis that has left up to 1.9 million customers locked out of their accounts for almost a week. The chief executive, Paul Pester, said on Thursday he was “truly sorry” for the botched systems upgrade, which has affected mobile and internet banking customers, but refused to say whether he would give up a potential £1.6m bonus. He admitted there were still problems with TSB’s internet banking and mobile app, seven days after the bank started moving millions of customer accounts to a new platform built by its Spanish owner, Banco Sabadell. Jaime Guardiola, Sabadell’s chief executive, said the difficulties might continue into next week. He told analysts: “Fixing the problem took more time than expected and we were not able to reopen access until Wednesday. I expect next week we will reach something very close to normality.” Pester insisted that no customer would be left out of pocket because of the chaos. The bank will waive all overdraft fees and interest charges for its retail and small business customers for April. It will also raise the interest paid out on its standard current account to 5% on balances up to £1,500, up from 3%, for existing customers who stick with the bank. TSB has estimated that it will cost about £20m to waive the fees and charges, and to raise the interest rate on its most popular account. “As we moved over to our new banking platform last weekend, the landing was an incredibly bumpy one for our customers, and for that I am truly sorry,” Pester said. “Our teams continue to work around the clock to fix the problems that some of our customers are having in accessing their TSB accounts. I want to reassure our customers that the engine room of the bank is working as it should.” On Thursday morning, about half of all customers trying to access their accounts through the TSB website were still unable to do so. One customer said he still could not log on to his account and was concerned about a VAT payment he was due to make to HMRC. Another said that because she could not access her account to make payments, her daughter lost her place on a school trip. Britain’s tax authority said it would be reasonable about late payments from small businesses, as long as they could provide evidence that it was because of TSB’s IT glitch. “HMRC will take the circumstances of TSB customers into account if asked to do so,” a spokesman said. Asked whether he would take personal responsibility for the chaos, Pester said he had been “too busy to think about” resigning. On the subject of whether or not he deserved a bonus after the fiasco, he said it would be a matter for the bank. “The last thing I’m worried about at the moment is bonuses and pay. I’m focused on putting things right for customers. It’s not my decision, that’s a focus for [the board]. It’s a decision for the remuneration committee.” Under the bank’s current plans, Pester could potentially be paid a bonus of up to £1.6m for 2017. However, the remuneration committee stated in TSB’s annual report that the decision on the bonus would be delayed “until migration and integration have been successfully completed in 2018”. The crisis began on Friday, when TSB started a planned migration of 5 million customers and 1.3bn records from its previous owner, Lloyds Banking Group, to a platform built by Sabadell. Customers were told the job would be completed by 6pm on Sunday. However, it soon became apparent something had gone badly wrong, with customers unable to log into their accounts or access funds. Some small businesses have been unable to pay staff or complete transactions, while other customers have reported having their cards declined. Pester said that from 8am on Thursday he was taking over direct responsibility for the IT infrastructure from Sabadell. The IBM team will report directly to Pester. The chief executive has been heavily criticised for misleading customers after tweeting on Wednesday morning that services were “back up and running” when there were still widespread problems. Pester said he was determined TSB would get back on it feet and continue to be a challenger bank to its bigger high street rivals such as Lloyds and HSBC. “The way we deal with every single one of our frustrated customers as quickly as possible will define TSB – both now and in 10, in 15 and in 20 years to come as we continue on our mission to bring more competition to UK banking.” The IT debacle is likely to prove costly for TSB, which potentially faces a multimillion-pound compensation bill and regulatory fines, and the loss of customers. Ignacio Cerezo, an analyst at UBS covering Sabadell’s first quarter results on Thursday, said a one-off IT cost of €71m for TSB “was higher than our €30-40m estimate”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/26/callum-hawkins-did-i-win-collapsed-marathon-runner-not-angry-at-organisers","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T03:31:16Z","webTitle":"Callum Hawkins: 'Did I win?'

Collapsed marathon runner not angry at organisers","bodyText":"Scottish athlete Callum Hawkins has revealed he asked ambulance staff whether he had won the Commonwealth Games marathon or not as he was taken to hospital in a distressed and severely dehydrated state. The 25-year-old was in the gold medal position having completed around 40km of the 42km course in Gold Coast when he collapsed, but recalls little else in the immediate aftermath. “I remember coming around the corner and seeing the bridge, knowing there were about a mile, a mile and a half, to go,” he told BBC. “Then the next thing you know, my legs are almost switching off on me and going to jelly, I’m starting to stumble. “I remember falling off at the side of the road and then trying my best to get back up and then I don’t remember anything after that.” Hawkins, who had a two-minute lead over Australian Michael Shelley, said the next thing he remembered was being in the ambulance following his collapse. “The first thing I asked (was) did I win because I thought there might have been a chance that I went on autopilot and finished it,” he said. “But nobody answered me and I knew straight away, eh that’s a no.” Hawkins said he was not angry about the slow response from organisers or spectators to his collapse that resulted in him hitting his head on the barrier and lying stricken and unattended for several minutes. “If you see that happen it’s the shock of it and you freeze,” he said. “It more annoys me that I managed to put myself in that place [of extreme dehydration] because if I hadn’t I would have won a medal.” Hawkin’s also revealed that he was reluctant to receive any assistance from the roadside in case it would lead to his disqualification from the event. The Scotsman did however concede that in retrospect race officials should have been able to make the decision to remove him from the race. “I was desperate for a medal and I had put everything I could into it,” he said. “So for somebody to stop me I probably would have told them to get [lost], but once I’d got back up, I had no recollection of it, so maybe I should have been pulled. “Maybe there needs to be a rule put in that, after two falls or something, or so long that it looks like you’re not getting any better, there needs to be somebody to pull it like boxing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/26/directors-who-quit-australias-largest-dairy-farm-business-urged-chinese-owner-to-invest-in-it","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T06:16:21Z","webTitle":"Directors who quit Australia's largest dairy farm business urged Chinese owner to invest in it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/26/directors-who-quit-australias-largest-dairy-farm-business-urged-chinese-owner-to-invest-in-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/26/directors-who-quit-australias-largest-dairy-farm-business-urged-chinese-owner-to-invest-in-it","fields":{"headline":"Directors who quit Australia's largest dairy farm business urged Chinese owner to invest in it","bodyText":"The directors who quit en masse from Australia’s largest dairy farm business spent months trying in vain to convince its Chinese owners to urgently invest millions to make the company sustainable, including pleas to drought-proof its properties and improve animal welfare. The trouble within Moon Lake Investments has cast new doubt on its ability to deliver on the promises it made before the Turnbull government approved its $280m purchase of the Van Diemen’s Land Company (VDL). The sale was vetted by the foreign investment review board and the government found it passed the national interest test, partly because Moon Lake promised to invest $100m locally, almost double the number of jobs within VDL and work to conserve the endangered Tasmanian devil population. But the mass resignation of the company’s Australian-based non-executive directors this week has created renewed concern about the business. The directors quit over a proposed restructure which would remove any chief executive role from VDL, instead replacing it with a general manager who would work under Moonlake’s owner, Lu Xianfeng, who would be the chief executive of a range of businesses. In an interview with Guardian Australia, a resigning Moon Lake director and former Tasmanian state treasurer David Crean said the directors had spent months trying to convince Lu he needed to invest millions in the dairy business to make it sustainable. “We couldn’t convince him and therefore we all resigned,” Crean said. “It wasn’t overnight; we’ve been trying to convince him over the last three or four months that these things need to occur.” The board wanted $2m spent on irrigation and water storage to mitigate against any future droughts. “We’ve just gone through a one in 20-year dry in Tasmania so the risk of drought, which is a real risk to the business, actually materialised,” he said. “We said as a matter of urgency we needed to mitigate against this in the future because it adds significant costs to the business if you’re buying feed instead of using pasture.” Crean said their plea had not been met. Nor was the board’s proposal to create new laneways to reduce the number of cows going lame, or to build fences to keep wallabies off grazing pasture. “It’s the largest dairy business in Australia,” he said. “You’ve got to make that a sustainable and profitable business. We didn’t see that happening at the time we resigned. Or we couldn’t convince him to pursue that path.” In a statement to ABC and News Corp, Lu said the restructure had been approved by the foreign investment review board. It had been designed to create a vertically integrated business that could sell products in Australia and overseas. “We are of the view that the corporate governance structure of the Australian operations needed to change in order to best achieve these strategic goals,” he said. “However, given the restructure and proposed new governance structure, the non-executive directors and the CEO of VDL Farms agreed to part ways.” When the sale was approved in 2016, the company promised to add 95 jobs, invest $100m and allow the construction of a fence to help prevent the spread of deadly face tumours among Tasmanian devils. Crean said there had been little opportunity to create the jobs in the VDL side of the business. But he said it was possible to add jobs in new parts of the business –through the construction of a powdered milk factory, for example. “That’s still his idea but it’s about the implementation,” he said. “I’ve got no doubt he intends to do it but it’s about how he implements it.” The Australia Institute’s Tasmanian director, Leanne Minshull, said the business was the “continuation of an economic plan that’s never been suited to Tasmania”. “Just to even think that we’re going to be in the business of maintaining the export of bulk commodities is crazy,” she said. The promised “demon-proof” fence, designed to help conserve the endangered species has not materialised. Moon Lake’s promise was simply to give in-principle agreement to let the state government build it, a project that would be costly and difficult. On Wednesday the Tasmanian Conservation Trust raised concerns that the fence may not be effective even if it were built."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/26/koch-brothers-trump-administration-resumes-democrats","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T10:00:14Z","webTitle":"Democratic senators scrutinize Koch brothers' 'infiltration' of Trump team","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/26/koch-brothers-trump-administration-resumes-democrats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/26/koch-brothers-trump-administration-resumes-democrats","fields":{"headline":"Democratic senators scrutinize Koch brothers' 'infiltration' of Trump team","bodyText":"Democratic senators are demanding information about what they call the Koch brothers’ “infiltration” of the Trump administration, charging that Koch-linked personnel have secured key federal jobs and are determining US environmental and public health policy. The senators – including Sheldon Whitehouse, Edward Markey, Catherine Cortez Masto, Tom Udall, Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren – sent letters to eight government bodies and the White House requesting “information related to efforts by Charles and David Koch, Koch Industries, and the numerous groups they fund to influence decisions”. The Koch network includes advocacy groups and thinktanks funded by the billionaire brothers that tend to advance a stridently conservative agenda, including promoting energy extraction within the US and the sloughing off of regulations. Résumés obtained through public records requests by the Guardian and Documented, a government watchdog group, show the close links between high-ranking federal staffers and the Koch network. “I think right now it’s the most powerful political force in the United States,” Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, said in an interview. “If you don’t believe that deregulation is good and that pollution ought not to be checked and that billionaires ought to be able to pull strings secretly in government, this ought to be a pretty high priority.” The Democrats have identified nine Koch-affiliated staff at the Department of the Interior, for example, which oversees more than 400m acres of federal public land that certain Koch operatives have long thought should be handed over to states and exploited. They include the principal deputy solicitor, Daniel Jorjani, whose résumé gives a sense of how he may respond to matters before the interior department. Jorjani was previously a director at the Charles Koch Foundation and the Charles Koch Institute and also worked at the Koch-supported Freedom Partners. The CV notes that when he worked in the interior department of George W Bush, his job as the project manager of a 105-person “climate change task force” entailed “limiting damage from climate change alarmists”. In the current administration, Jorjani has been linked to efforts to permit mining near the Boundary Water Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota and also to rescind protections for migrating birds. The CV of Doug Domenech, a top interior appointee responsible for territories including American Samoa and Guam, meanwhile, is forthright about his work at the Koch-linked Texas Public Policy Foundation. He was head of the Fueling Freedom project, where his job, he writes, was “managing national, grassroots legislative effort related to opposing electric power plant emissions regulations”. According to its website, the Fueling Freedom project’s goal was to “explain the forgotten moral case for fossil fuels”. In one op-ed, a Foundation director observed that gasoline-powered cars often carry expectant women to hospitals. Another high-ranking interior staffer hired under Trump, Tim Williams, says in his résumé that when he worked at the Koch-funded advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, the overarching mission was “persuading public officials to embrace an agenda of economic freedom”. When the administration announced that it was shrinking two national monuments, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, which are under the purview of Williams’ current employer, his former employer was jubilant, saying it marked the end of “an era of executive overreach”. Koch Industries and various Koch-linked organizations did not respond to requests for comment, but their views are reflected in a Koch document published by the Intercept in which the network celebrates its victories under Trump. “In the first eleven months of President Trump’s administration, the White House and Congress have closely followed the Network’s Roadmap to Repeal,” wrote the document’s authors, referring to a three-step strategy to undo the legacy of Barack Obama that includes rescinding his executive orders and defunding his initiatives. “We have seen progress on many regulatory priorities this Network has championed for years.” In the report, the network claims partial credit – without explaining its role – for high-profile wins such as the announced repeal of the clean power plan, which aimed to reduce carbon emissions from power plants; the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline; and the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. It also says it notched less visible, but still consequential, rollbacks, such as overturning a rule intended to provide safeguards for waterways affected by coalmining. A late-2017 report by the not-for-profit group Public Citizen suggested that 44 Trump administration officials had close ties to the Kochs, including Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt was recently defended against charges of ethical lapses by several Koch groups. Another is Vice-President Mike Pence, about whom Steve Bannon has said: “I’m concerned he’d be a president that the Kochs would own.” “Since the incoming Trump administration really had a dearth of public policy expertise on most issues, the Kochs and their policy groups have provided some of the key people,” said Alan Zibel, who wrote the report.

The ALP is expected to confirm on Thursday that it will drop its plans to increase the Medicare levy for workers earning more than $87,000 to pay for the NDIS – effectively matching the Coalition’s U-turn on the issue. But while the Medicare levy increase proposal is now dead, Labor intends to persist for now in implementing a separate 2% deficit levy first imposed by the Coalition in the 2014 budget, with the rise applying to earnings above $180,000. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A final decision about whether or not to lock in the tax increase for people on high incomes will be made after the budget, due on 7 May. In its 2017 budget, the government proposed a Medicare levy increase of 0.5%, affecting every Australian earning more than $21,655, to help plug a funding gap for the NDIS. Labor at the time refused to support the Coalition’s measure, saying the increase should only apply to workers in the top two tax brackets, not to lower-income earners. On Thursday the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, claimed credit for the government’s about face, saying “taxpaying families would welcome it”. But People with Disability Australia expressed alarm at the decision, saying there was now no mechanism to guarantee NDIS funding over the long haul. “The revenue measures announced by the treasurer are only for this year, and will not guarantee the NDIS in the future,” said Therese Sands, the group’s chief executive. “We are back to the uncertainty around the NDIS and fighting for funding at every budget. We are sick of what is happening to the NDIS and call on the government to put people with disability back at the heart of every decision that is being made.” Morrison will tell business economists on Thursday that the government no longer needs to increase the Medicare levy to fund the NDIS because improvements in economic conditions have led to a boost in revenue. The treasurer will note that tax receipts until February were running $4.8bn higher than forecast by the Treasury last December, including a $1.2bn boost to income tax receipts and a $3bn boost on company tax. Improvements in commodity prices have provided further ballast. “Our economy is finally shaking off the dulling effects of the downturn in the mining investment boom.” Before his speech, Morrison told the ABC the end goal was never a tax increase, it was to ensure the NDIS was fully funded. He said the government would lay out in the budget the reasons it could now fund the NDIS without an increase in the Medicare levy. “A year ago we took a conservative approach to what we believed the economic performance would be, and the receipts for taxes,” he said. “That has been better than we forecast.” Morrison said the $57bn funding gap would be filled by a stronger economy. The government has shifted on the Medicare levy increase to sharpen the tax debate for the next federal election. The government is expected to use the budget to unveil personal income tax cuts, but Labor was pre-positioned on that front – arguing that the Coalition would be giving with one hand and taking with another because it was planning to increase the Medicare levy for all workers earning more than $21,655. Axing the Medicare levy clears the government’s decks politically but voters will have to wait until 7 May to learn how the NDIS can be fully funded in the absence of a specific revenue stream."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/27/exciting-scoring-changes-to-spice-up-new-super-netball-season","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T18:00:25Z","webTitle":"'Exciting' scoring changes to spice up new Super Netball season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/27/exciting-scoring-changes-to-spice-up-new-super-netball-season","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/27/exciting-scoring-changes-to-spice-up-new-super-netball-season","fields":{"headline":"'Exciting' scoring changes to spice up new Super Netball season","bodyText":"The world’s premiere netball league, which begins with a Melbourne derby between the Vixens and Collingwood on Saturday afternoon, will use a Super Rugby-esque scoring system to build its ladder, with four points awarded for a win (up from two last season) and a bonus point for each quarter won. The change means winning teams could earn up to eight points a match and losing sides as many as three, for winning three quarters, but losing. In drawn games, teams will get two points each, up from one in 2017, and a drawn quarter is worth nothing. The game’s bosses say the system will “incentivise teams to make every quarter count” and reward closeness across the competition – which will be screened on Channel Nine on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, instead of the secondary channel 9Gem. Live games and replays will also be available on Telstra TV, the paid Netball Live app and 9Now catch-up. Several other rule changes were unveiled this week. As in basketball, team officials and bench players will be allowed to walk the sideline to talk to players and the number of time-outs has been doubled; from one per team, per half to two, meaning there could be as many as eight time-outs a match. The breaks between quarters have also been increased by a few minutes. Former Australian Diamonds captain turned Nine commentator Liz Ellis “really likes” the points approach, saying it doesn’t “fiddle with the integrity” of on-court scoring, like the long-mooted, but yet-to-be-implemented two-point shot. “Analysis shows this points system would not have made a huge difference to how the ladder finished last season, but there would have been more movement through the course of the year – and that’s great for the sport, because it allows more of a story to be told, to hook the viewers in,” she says. Every quarter will matter in 2018, Ellis adds. “You occasionally get blow-outs, but having that bonus for winning a quarter will help us as commentators to tell a story and it will create drama,” she says. Ellis rejects fans’ concerns it will limit the amount of court time bench players will get. “Suncorp Super Netball isn’t for development. No doubt, it will be something coaches think carefully about, but if you’re in a Suncorp squad, your coach knows what you’re capable of.” Giving coaches more freedom on the sideline appeals to Ellis. “Netball has historically been pretty strait-laced, all about ‘sit still, be nice’. Why can’t a coach walk up and down and show some emotion? Let’s loosen the straps and see what happens! Some coaches will embrace it and others will remain seated and that’s fine.” The caller is “a bit ambivalent” about extra time-outs. “I’m interested to see how it goes. If it ends up building drama, I’m all for it.” Another former national captain, ex-Firebird Clare McMeniman – who says the scoring system is “really exciting” because it will increase competitiveness without fundamentally impacting the way the game is played – has a “wait and see” attitude on time-outs, too. “I don’t think we want both teams taking two each in each half, as four is a lot. But I would be surprised if we got to that situation. It’s a case of seeing how it goes,” she says. Ahead of round one, the pundits struggle to name a premiership favourite. “It’s very hard and that’s what makes it exciting,” McMeniman says. It’s difficult to discount reigning champions, the Sunshine Coast Lightning, which boasts the bookends from the Commonwealth Games final in shooter Caitlin Bassett and keeper Geva Mentor, Ellis says. “Mentor is in career-best form and was sensational for the Roses at the Games. Lightning is without Laura Langman though, who is a very special player,” she adds. Also special, says Ellis, is 23-year-old Helen Housby, who calmly sunk the winning shot for England on the Gold Coast and will line up in a young NSW Swifts outfit, coached by “real athlete’s coach” Briony Akle. “We now know Helen can nail those shots on the big stage.” The other NSW team, the Giants, have stalwart Kim Green returning from a knee reconstruction, as well as another English shooting star, Jo Harten. The Queensland Firebirds have Laura Geitz back, who “just knows how to win games”, according to McMeniman. The addition of 198cm Jamaican shooter Jhaniele Fowler is massive for the West Coast Fever, McMeniman says. “Fever fans should be rubbing their hands together at the prospect of her teamed with Nat Medhurst. Fever is in my top four,” she says. Ellis expects Fever to shine too. “They can win it, absolutely. They have the shooting combination now and the ability to win the ball back.” Collingwood again carries a huge weight of expectation, Ellis says. “They have Caitlin Thwaites in ripping form, Sharni Layton coming back hopefully to her best and the addition of Erin Bell into goal attack. They’re an impressive team,” she says. Reigning minor premiers, the Melbourne Vixens, will be bolstered by the international exposure of defender Jo Weston and midcourter Liz Watson at the Games. Ellis says the Adelaide Thunderbirds – which virtually has a new team in Abi Latu-Meafou, Kaitlyn Bryce, South African captain Bongiwe Msomi, former New Zealand internationals Leana de Bruin, Cat Tuivati and Kate Shimmin – may struggle. “I don’t think they’re a threat for top four, but if they get their combinations right, they may cause some headaches for teams later in the season.” Round 1 Fixtures (AEST) Saturday: Melbourne Vixens v Collingwood Magpies, 3pm, Melbourne Hisense Arena (live on Channel Nine) Sunday: Adelaide Thunderbirds v West Coast Fever, 12.30pm local (1pm AEST), Adelaide Priceline Stadium Giants Netball v Sunshine Coast Lightning, 1pm, Qudos Bank Arena NSW Swifts v Queensland Firebirds, 3pm, Qudos Bank Arena"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/26/thursday-briefing-another-bite-out-of-mays-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T05:30:49Z","webTitle":"Thursday briefing: Another bite out of May's Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/26/thursday-briefing-another-bite-out-of-mays-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/26/thursday-briefing-another-bite-out-of-mays-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Thursday briefing: Another bite out of May's Brexit","bodyText":"Top story: Government lorded over again Hello, it’s Warren Murray with the right things to be in the know about. A bitter row has erupted between Brexiters and the House of Lords after it threw out a bid to give ministers, rather than parliament, sweeping control over powers brought back from Brussels. Jacob Rees-Mogg accused peers of “playing with fire” by defying the Commons – but Amnesty International said: “The Lords have sent a clear message to the Commons: leaving the EU shouldn’t mean leaving rights behind.” The Lords vote of 349 to 221 is one of the biggest majorities against the government so far, and peers still have three more days to chip away at the bill. With a backbench debate on a customs union taking place in the Commons today, Keir Starmer has suggested Labour might seek to force the issue to a vote. This morning we are also reporting that Ireland’s EU commissioner is urging Theresa May to face down the “immoderate ideology” of Brexiters and reconsider her position on remaining in a customs union with the EU. “Some form of customs arrangement and softening of the red lines must be in the best interest of all concerned,” Phil Hogan is expected to tell the Irish parliament’s senate. * * * Trump’s ‘insane’ trajectory – Emmanuel Macron has said he probably failed to persuade Donald Trump to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. The French president wants Trump to accept negotiations for a side-deal with Tehran, in return for continuing to waive sanctions. But speaking to US reporters before leaving Washington, Macron said: “My view – I don’t know what your president will decide – is that he will get rid of this deal on his own, for domestic reasons.” Trump also pulled the US out of the Paris climate change accord and Macron said such changes “can work in the short term but it’s very insane in the medium to long term”. In an impassioned speech to Congress yesterday, Macron advocated many of the things Trump has spent much of his presidency pulling down – saying he was “sure” the US would one day return to the Paris climate change accord, and vowing that France would not abandon the nuclear deal with Iran known as the JCPOA. * * * Nuclear cave-in – North Korea’s nuclear test site at Punggye-ri has probably caved in beyond use from the stress of the explosions, Chinese scientists have determined. The most powerful of the North’s six nuclear device tests, on 3 September 2017, is believed to have triggered an initial big collapse followed by an “earthquake swarm” over the following days and weeks. The findings, by the scientists at the University of Science and Technology of China, may shed new light on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s announcement that his country would cease its testing program. More below in today’s lunchtime read on tomorrow’s inter-Korean presidential summit. * * * ‘Europe has got to wake up’ – The head of the UN World Food Programme says Isis is trying to drive a wave of immigrants from Africa’s Sahel region into fleeing to Europe with the aim of creating instability. Speaking to the Guardian in Brussels, David Beasley said lack of food was being used as a recruitment tool by the extremists. “You are going to have more Isis and extremist groups infiltrating migration … this is where the European community and international community has got to wake up.” The fact that Beasley was nominated for his job by Donald Trump might need to be taken into account here. * * * Tenuous Infinity War link – Well your Briefing writer has seen the latest Avengers movie now and anyone who cares surely knows the general theme. A purple giant called Thanos wants to use the Cosmic Gauntlet of Bling to wipe out life. But the social scientist Mayer Hillman has told Patrick Barkham that we have made it inevitable ourselves. “We are headed for the end of most life on the planet because we’re so dependent on the burning of fossil fuels,” he argues. Hillman, now 86, has been remarkably prescient in the past – trying to stop branch railway lines closing, explaining the environmental costs of driving children to school, and recommending energy ratings for houses, all decades before policymakers caught on. We can only survive, says Hillman, if we gear our lives towards “music and love and education and happiness. These things, which hardly use fossil fuels, are what we must focus on.” * * * Happy feat – A penguin has held its breath for 32.2 minutes underwater in the longest ever recorded dive by one of the birds. Now they don’t do much else, so it would seem reasonable to assume they would get fairly good at it, and emperor penguins, one of which set the record, are the best divers. But their physiology suggests they should only be able to manage about eight minutes max. So how do they do it and what are they getting up to down there? It could be for food, or because they can’t find an opening in the Antarctic ice, says Dr Kim Goetz, but “if an animal is going deeper and expending itself and using all its oxygen to get down there, it is usually because it is worth it”. Lunchtime read: Borderline optimism for Korea summit The president of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, is to meet the North’s ruler, Kim Jong-un, for a historic summit on Friday at the “truce village” of Panmunjom. We are at a crucial juncture where the South has a government that wants to engage, and possibly sign a lasting peace treaty; while Kim has expressed a willingness to stop developing nuclear weapons; and Donald Trump is prepared to attend talks with the regime leader. This initial inter-Korean meeting is “like the opening move in chess”, according to one expert. Here is all you need to know about the summit. There are keen hopes on both sides of the border, including in one unlikely quarter: North Korean defectors who just want to go home. Kim Ryon-hui sought medical treatment in China, where she says she was duped by a broker into travelling to the South. She though she could work, then return to the North, but that’s not how it works for defectors, who are made South Korean citizens and monitored by the intelligence services.

Turnbull and the US charge d’affaires, James Carouso, have both sought to downplay claims that the Trump administration’s decision to redirect Harris to represent the US in South Korea amounts to treating Australia like a second-class ally. On Thursday Carouso told ABC News Breakfast it was a “top priority” to bring a US ambassador to Australia but conceded that “we are all disappointed” Harris, the head of the US Pacific command, will not fill the role. He asked Australians to look at the “bigger picture” in Korea, citing upcoming talks between Donald Trump and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to argue that the US needs an ambassador on the ground in South Korea. Carouso said the US was sending Harris “because of the urgency of the situation in Korea” and applied a positive spin by claiming it “reflects the fact that the United States and Australia have worked together to apply pressure on Korea that has brought us to this point”. Carouso said Australia’s relationship with the US was “incredibly broad and tight”, citing the fact that ministers can contact their US counterparts and more than 700 Australian officials had visited Washington and vice versa in the last year. “Australia should have an ambassador here, there is no doubt ... I don’t know the exact situation but I have been told this is the top priority to get the next person out here as quickly as possible,” he said. Turnbull has not spoken to the US president since learning of the decision earlier this week but insists he is unperturbed. “I’m disappointed that Harry’s not coming because he’s a really good friend, and I think Harry will be disappointed that he’s not coming to Canberra too because he loves Australia,” Turnbull told reporters in France. “He is a guy of enormous experience and ability and, given the situation on the Korean peninsula, given the tensions there, I can well understand why the president has decided that the admiral’s expertise and experience is going to be able to be put to better use in Korea than in Australia.” Turnbull praised the “fantastic job” being done by Carouso. The full-time Canberra post has been vacant since September 2016. “The relationship between Australia and the United States, as you all know as well as I do, that is so deep and so intense and operates at so many levels,” Turnbull said. “The absence, if you like, of an ambassador is not really troubling the very strong relationship we have whatsoever.” Earlier on Wednesday, the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, confirmed Harris would not be heading to Canberra after being notified by the acting US secretary of state, John Sullivan. Bishop said Sullivan made it clear a new appointment to Canberra would be a priority for the next secretary of state. “Based on the assumption he is confirmed by the Senate this week, I hope to have a conversation with Mike Pompeo as soon as possible,” she said. Andrew Shearer, a senior policy adviser for the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, has said it is “hard to escape a bit of a sense that Australia is being treated here as a second-class ally”. A senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, Thomas Wright, told Fairfax Media the backflip sent a “terrible” and “unfortunate” message because it suggested Australia “is not a priority”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/25/bayern-munich-real-madrid-champions-league-semi-final-first-leg","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T20:59:49Z","webTitle":"Marco Asensio gives Real Madrid advantage against Bayern Munich","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/25/bayern-munich-real-madrid-champions-league-semi-final-first-leg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/25/bayern-munich-real-madrid-champions-league-semi-final-first-leg","fields":{"headline":"Marco Asensio gives Real Madrid advantage against Bayern Munich","bodyText":"“The Champions League releases special powers in Real Madrid,” Toni Kroos had warned and there may be no power greater than the ability to resist, survive, and always advance, bruised perhaps but never beaten. Under pressure for so long, when Madrid left the Allianz Arena Raphaël Varane had a bleeding head and the team had suffered, just as Zinedine Zidane had warned they would, but they were victorious once more. It is not over but they are a step closer to a third consecutive Champions League final. Jupp Heynckes said his team’s performance proved Madrid could be hurt, but it was Bayern that were here. At the end, their players stood exhausted, two of them having long departed, Arjen Robben and Jérôme Boateng forced off with injury, missing most of the night and likely to miss the second leg too, trying to grasp what had happened. What had happened was this: goals from Marcelo and Marco Asensio, both superbly struck, overturned Joshua Kimmich’s opener to give Madrid a win, their third in a row here, their sixth in succession against their great European rivals. The goals were wonderfully taken, but Heynckes called them “gifts”. Mistakes defined this game as much as talent did, and Bayern’s were more decisive. One in particular cost them, a terrible error from Rafinha on the halfway line just before the hour sending Lucas Vázquez and Asensio running into space to slip in the knife. From the other end, Bayern’s players watched it unfold, their fate sealed. Bayern had started the night attacking and they ended it attacking too, firing off 13 shots, but Madrid are a club that considers this competition their own for a reason. As for Bayern, while James Rodríguez impressed, the early departure of Robben left them lop-sided, everything going through Franck Ribéry. A constant threat, he nonetheless had to go it alone often. He also encountered Keylor Navas, at fault for the goal but redeemed after. Bayern’s first chance came after just 25 seconds, when Rodríguez put presure on Dani Carvajal and the ball sat up for Robert Lewandowski, inside the six-yard box but at a tight angle. He hit the ball too hard to be a pass and too horizontal to be a shot but the tone appeared to be set and to begin with the pace was frenetic, the game quite direct, Bayern on the front foot. It didn’t last, and nor did Robben. He was forced off after eight minutes and within half an hour Boateng had to go too. Bayern, though, enjoyed much of the ball and by then they had taken the lead when Rodríguez’s pass sent Kimmich racing up the right. Lewandowski ran alongside and Madrid’s goalkeeper was perhaps preoccupied with him, because as Kimmich slowed slightly Navas seemed to edge towards the centre. Instead of crossing, Kimmich hit the ball hard from a tight angle sending it flying in at the near post. Bayern nearly doubled their lead immediately, a swift robbery sending Lewandowski clean through straight from the kick-off, only for Varane to step across, and then Thiago Alcántara giving Ribéry the ball alone inside the area where his touch was astonishingly bad, barely able to believe it as the ball slipped away. Heynckes called it a turning point. Despite the lead, there was still a sense Bayern were not entirely comfortable although Madrid were worse in a game of surprising imprecision for two teams of such rich resources. Mats Hummels’s touch was almost as bad as Ribéry’s had been as he handed Luka Modric the ball, although he was soon involved again at the other end, volleying over from seven yards. Next, Kimmich and Ribéry made an opportunity for Thomas Müller, running in, to hit on the bounce, which Sergio Ramos blocked. But five minutes from half-time, Madrid scored. Ramos’s diagonal ball across was headed back by Carvajal and Cristiano Ronaldo leapt for an overhead kick. He made no contact but did put off Javi Martínez who backed off letting the ball bounce and Marcelo struck a superb shot into the corner. Bayern had three chances in added time at the end of the first half. Rodríguez’s free-kick found Lewandowski leaping seven yards out, but he headed straight at Navas. Ribéry beat Carvajal and clipped to the far post, where Marcelo nodded away from Müller. And from the corner, Lewandowski’s header just evaded Müller by the post. Concerned, Zidane sent on Asensio at half-time in place of Isco, who had taken a knock. Ten minutes later, Asensio scored a hugely significant goal. It came from a corner – for Bayern. The ball came out to Rafinha whose dreadful pass was intercepted by Asensio, who slotted it into Lucas Vázquez, two against one now, running free, Ulreich at their mercy. Vázquez gave it back and Asensio finished with class. Ribéry, relentlessly running at Carvajal and, later, Vázquez, led Bayern’s bid to turn this round. Again and again he went at them. Twice he drew saves from Navas, before Müller and Lewandowski got in each other’s way a metre from the line. As they poured forward, Ronaldo and Karim Benzema fired warnings, but Bayern had no choice. They also had no way through, Madrid waiting, resisting, every ball into the box sent sailing out again. Lewandowski was slipped in late on but clipped wide. The flag was up, anyway. So was time. A moment later, beyond 90 minutes now, the ball was curled towards Corentin Tolisso, inside Madrid’s area. As he turned towards it, it bounced off the turf and over his head, Bayern’s evening defined."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/25/facebook-first-quarter-2018-revenues-zuckerberg","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T22:32:36Z","webTitle":"Facebook posts record revenues for first quarter despite privacy scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/25/facebook-first-quarter-2018-revenues-zuckerberg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/25/facebook-first-quarter-2018-revenues-zuckerberg","fields":{"headline":"Facebook posts record revenues for first quarter despite privacy scandal","bodyText":"Facebook’s data privacy problems have had little impact on its profitability as the company posted record revenues for the first quarter of 2018. The company made $11.97bn in revenue in the first three months of the year, up 49% from the previous year, beating Wall Street estimates of $11.41bn. “Despite facing important challenges, our community and business are off to a strong start in 2018,” said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and CEO, in a statement. “We are taking a broader view of our responsibility and investing to make sure our services are used for good. But we also need to keep building new tools to help people connect, strengthen our communities, and bring the world closer together.” Facebook’s approach to privacy has come under intense scrutiny over the last few weeks, following the revelation that the personal data of millions of Americans was harvested from Facebook and improperly shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Stoked by fears that the data may have been used to try to influence elections in the US and Europe and the discovery that Facebook collects a lot more data than the average person realises (including web browsing history and, in some cases, text messages), some users have started a #DeleteFacebook movement, including the co-founder of the Facebook-owned WhatsApp. Facebook’s user figures indicate that the movement had little effect, with daily active users rising to 1.45 billion (48 million more than the previous quarter) and monthly active users to 2.2bn. Both figures mark a 13% increase from the same quarter in 2017. However, much of the momentum behind the movement came in April, when Zuckerberg delivered eight hours of testimony before Congress, after the quarter was over. In the last few weeks, the social network has announced a slew of changes to its privacy tools and to the way that it collects and shares user data. It has also introduced a verification process for political advertisers and page administrators and plans to comply with Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). As if to demonstrate its continued commitment to transparency, this week the company published its content moderation guidelines – a year after the Guardian revealed the secret rules. Facebook’s chief financial officer, Dave Wehner, warned that GDPR could lead to a fall in users and revenue in Europe, particularly as people start tightening up their accounts to prevent so much targeted advertising. “While we don’t expect the changes will have a significant impact on ad revenue, any change in our ability for us and advertisers to use data can impact our optimisation potential at the margin,” he said. Despite pledging to roll out GDPR-compliant settings to all Facebook users, the chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said the settings “would not be exactly the same format”. Because of this, Facebook doesn’t expect there to be any impact on ad revenue outside Europe, indicating that those settings would not make a difference to the way Facebook uses people’s personal data, which is the whole point of GDPR. Sandberg rejected any suggestion that Facebook should diversify its business model away from micro-targeted advertising. “We are proud of the ad model we’ve built,” she said. “It ensures people see more useful ads, allows businesses to grow, and keeps the service free. Advertising-supported businesses like Facebook equalise access and improve opportunity.” Zuckerberg said that changes the company had made to the news feed to prioritise “meaningful interaction” rather than “passive consumption” were already having an effect – with a decline in people passively watching video. “People want [Facebook] to be more about friends and family and less about content consumption,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/may/28/brilliance-overtakes-beauty-ms-geek-africa-spotlights-tech-genius-salissou-hassane-latifa","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T06:00:47Z","webTitle":"Brilliance overtakes beauty as Ms Geek Africa spotlights tech genius | Lauren Gambino","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/may/28/brilliance-overtakes-beauty-ms-geek-africa-spotlights-tech-genius-salissou-hassane-latifa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/may/28/brilliance-overtakes-beauty-ms-geek-africa-spotlights-tech-genius-salissou-hassane-latifa","fields":{"headline":"Brilliance overtakes beauty as Ms Geek Africa spotlights tech genius","bodyText":"After years of women in evening gowns vying for the title of national beauty queen, glamour is giving way to geekery in Rwanda. A group of female tech entrepreneurs decided it was time to ditch Miss Rwanda for a different kind of competition, one that judged women on brilliance rather than beauty. It was time for Ms Geek. The first Ms Geek Rwanda was crowned in 2014, and the competition has since expanded to include other African countries under the unifying banner of Ms Geek Africa. The event, open to girls and women aged 13 to 25, encourages contestants to use technology to solve everyday problems in their communities. The finalists receive business training and the winner is awarded financial backing to help realise her idea. This year’s Ms Geek Africa is Salissou Hassane Latifa, 21, from Niger. Her winning design is an app that helps communication between people caring for accident victims and the emergency services, and allows medical staff to advise on basic first aid before they arrive at the scene. “Ms Geek has already changed the perception of what girls can do,” says Esther Kunda of the Next Einstein Forum, a founding member of competition organiser Girls in ICT Rwanda. The contest was set up as part of a nationwide effort to transform Rwanda from a small agricultural economy into an engine of technological innovation, with women and girls at the forefront of the revolution. The government has set a target of achieving gender parity in the information communications technology sector by 2020, an ambitious goal in a worldwide industry notorious for its lack of diversity. But through educational campaigns, scholarships and mentorship programmes, Rwanda is determined to become a global leader for women in ICT. “It’s a good place to be a woman in tech right now,” Kunda says of Rwanda. Before the genocide of 1994, it was uncommon for women in Rwanda to own land, receive a formal education or hold jobs outside of the home. After the atrocity, the country’s surviving population was 60-70% female, according to contemporary accounts. President Paul Kagame, who has led Rwanda with an iron fist since 2000, realised that advancing women was the only way forward and has championed their rights ever since. Rwanda now leads the world in female representation in parliament, due in part to a quota system that reserves seats for women. Gender rights are enshrined in the national constitution and laws were changed to give women the right to inherit land and obtain credit. As a child, Rosine Mwiseneza, who was orphaned during the genocide, recalls watching the women around her stepping into leadership roles in government and civil society. They became police officers, accountants, butchers, shop owners. Girls went to school and competed alongside boys for internships and scholarships. Mwiseneza was studying business management at Kepler University in Kigali when she entered the Ms Geek contest in 2016. Her idea was for an automated irrigation system that would help farmers cultivate their fields year-round as opposed to just during the rainy season. Mwiseneza says she was astounded when she won the competition. In that moment, she remembered her parents and all the hardships she had endured. “It was very difficult to believe,” she says. “I started thinking of everything that had passed before that day and I began to cry.” As well as rapid economic growth and rising standards of living, Rwanda is fast becoming a highly digitised society. In 2013, the Akilah Institute, Rwanda’s first college exclusively for women, launched a diploma in information systems. The programme, which started off enrolling just 10 students each year, has expanded sixfold in the five years since it opened. Though there are no national statistics on the number of women in Rwanda’s technology sector, anecdotal evidence suggests the push for equality is having an impact. Fileille Naberwe, 21, in her first year at the African Leadership University in Kigali, says her interest in tech set her apart as a student. Now she has found her niche, working as a fellow at DMM.HeHe, a female-run startup that develops mobile technologies. Her boss, Clarisse Iribagiza, is something of a celebrity entrepreneur in Kigali. Naberwe says she has drawn confidence from watching Iribagiza lead major projects and hold court during meetings. “It’s one of the influences that got to me – seeing her in the biggest position and her handling it like a boss,” Naberwe says. Despite a commitment to equality, however, women here say they still face social pressure to marry young and start families. And, while there are signs of positive change, a perception endures that tech is the preserve of men. Parfaite Wirira, 22, an ICT student at the Akilah Institute, says her parents still ask her brother to fix their phone when it goes wrong, even though she has the technical skills and he doesn’t. “We need to see more ladies who are successful [in ICT], to inspire us and show us what is possible,” she says. “Then maybe one day we will be the role models for a new generation.” Research shows that role models are hugely important to encouraging women to pursue careers in tech and other industries. And that was the central motivation behind Ms Geek. Mwiseneza is hopeful that, as the contest gains prominence and more girls study ICT, Rwanda’s tech culture will evolve to be more inclusive and progressive, echoing the modern history of the country. “In this country it is still not easy for a woman to stand on her own but the change exists,” she says. “The future is not for men only. It is also for women.” The reporting for this article was supported by a grant from the International Women’s Media Foundation African Great Lakes Reporting Initiative"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/25/kanye-west-donald-trump-dragon-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T20:42:16Z","webTitle":"Kanye West proclaims his love for Trump: 'We are both dragon energy'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/25/kanye-west-donald-trump-dragon-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/25/kanye-west-donald-trump-dragon-energy","fields":{"headline":"Kanye West proclaims his love for Trump: 'We are both dragon energy'","bodyText":"Donald Trump has thanked Kanye West after the rapper professed his love for the president and said the pair “are both dragon energy”. West posted a series of tweets about Trump on Wednesday afternoon, days after praising a rightwing pundit on Twitter. “You don’t have to agree with trump but the mob can’t make me not love him,” West said. “We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don’t agree with everything anyone does. That’s what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.” Trump retweeted West’s message, describing it as “very cool”, in the latest display of affection between the pair. West later posted a picture of himself wearing a hat featuring Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again”, then posted a closeup picture of a Make America Great Again hat that appeared to have been signed by Trump. It is not clear what prompted West’s display of affection. In between tweets about Trump he had also written: “I’m nice at ping pong.” West visited Trump Tower during the presidential transition and was booed during a concert shortly after the 2016 election when he declared that he “would have voted for Donald Trump”. This week the Hot 97 radio show host Ebro Darden claimed that West told him: “I do love Donald Trump” during a conversation over the weekend. He also praised the rightwing pundit Candace Owens on Saturday. It is unclear how Trump discovered West’s messages. He does not follow West on Twitter, and Trump did not respond to a later tweet from West clarifying his remarks. “My wife just called me and she wanted me to make this clear to everyone. I don’t agree with everything Trump does. I don’t agree 100% with anyone but myself,” West said in his subsequent message. During a briefing on Wednesday afternoon the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was asked whether West had spoken to Trump since their Trump Tower meeting. “I don’t know of any conversations that they have had over the last week or so,” Sanders said. “I’ll keep you posted if that changes any time.” The meeting did not mark West’s first presidential interaction. In 2005, West said on live television during a telethon for victims of Hurricane Katrina: “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.” Bush later described that moment as the worst of his presidency. In 2009, the then president, Barack Obama, labeled West “a jackass” after West charged the stage in protest at the MTV Video Music Awards after Taylor Swift won an award. Asked for a comment, a spokesman for the Trump critic Senator Ben Sasse paraphrased an infamous West remark, saying: “Kanye, I’m really happy for you, Imma let you finish but Cardi B had one of the best rants on taxation as theft of all time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/28/nicaragua-daniel-ortega-trees-of-life-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T07:30:08Z","webTitle":"Nicaragua's toppling 'trees' strike ominous note for Daniel Ortega's rule","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/28/nicaragua-daniel-ortega-trees-of-life-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/28/nicaragua-daniel-ortega-trees-of-life-protests","fields":{"headline":"Nicaragua's toppling 'trees' strike ominous note for Daniel Ortega's rule","bodyText":"When protesters flooded the streets of Managua this week, their anger found an unusual target: a garish metal forest of 17-metre (56ft) sculptures known as the Árboles de la Vida. The multimillion-dollar art project – inspired by the work of the Austrian painter Gustav Klimt – was reputedly inflicted upon Nicaragua’s capital and other cities by first lady Rosario Murillo in an attempt at civic beautification. For critics, however, the multicoloured structures – more than 140 of which now adorn roundabouts, street corners and parks – have come to symbolize how Daniel Ortega’s Sandinista Front (FSLN) has lost touch with the people in whose name it once fought. As deadly anti-government protests gripped Central America’s largest country this week – and the death toll reportedly rose to more than 60 – the trees came crashing down. “Each time a ‘tree of life’ is felled, the people around it cheer and stamp and jump on it,” celebrated La Prensa, a Managua-based opposition broadsheet. For Ortega, a one-time revolutionary icon who has towered over his country’s politics since the late 1970s, the deadly unrest represents a dramatic reversal of fortunes – not to mention a threat to his rule. “If I were the Ortega government I would be nervous,” said Geoff Thale, a Central America expert from the Washington Office on Latin America advocacy group. Tens of thousands have joined student-led protests, which started as an outbreak of fury over social security reforms and morphed into a broader revolt against the authorities’ violent response – and Ortega’s 11-year rule. At least forty-two people have died in the unrest, including a journalist shot dead while broadcasting on Facebook Live. “We came in memory of the university students who fell fighting a dictatorship,” said Cinthia Madrigal, 30, who joined a march in Managua. “We took to the streets peacefully … and Daniel ordered us to be killed.” During the 1980s, Ortega became a poster boy for the global left: a mustachioed Marxist feted for overthrowing the despised dictator Anastasio Somoza and for his David versus Goliath cold war struggle with Washington. Ortega, now 72, suffered a chastening setback in 1990 after losing a presidential election he had expected to walk. In 1998, his step-daughter – Murillo’s daughter, Zoilamérica Narvaez – publicly accused Ortega of having sexually abused her for a number of years from the age of 12. Murillo chose her husband over her daughter, and gradually moved to the centre of power; both parents deny the allegations. After two failed attempts to reclaim the presidency, Ortega staged a dramatic comeback in 2006 – a victory in Murillo is thought to have played a key role. In his victory speech, Ortega pledged to rule for the poor and for the people and “create a new political culture”. Yet he returned a changed and to many a tarnished man. Former Sandinista comrades began turning away from the Nicaraguan president amid accusations of cronyism and corruption and anger over his support for a highly controversial Catholic church-backed ban on abortion. International backers including Salman Rushdie and Noam Chomsky denounced his authoritarian tack. One critic accused Ortega, once likened to legendary freedom fighters such as Nelson Mandela, of becoming a Latin American Mugabe. This week, as the protests gained momentum, Ortega was even compared to Somoza himself. On the streets of Managua protesters could be heard chanting: “Daniel! Somoza! ¡Son la misma cosa!” – “Daniel! Somoza! They’re the same thing!” Parallels with 1979 are hard to avoid. Some of the fiercest clashes this week have taken place in Masaya’s indigenous Monimbó neighbourhood, where the first flames of the insurrection against Somoza were lit. Protesters have even appropriated one of the revolution’s most famous slogans: “Let your mother surrender!” and turned it against the former insurgent leader. In an unflinching editorial La Prensa warned: “Ortega must step down peacefully or he will have to leave as Somoza left.” Vilma Núñez, a veteran activist who runs the Nicaraguan Centre for Human Rights, said she believed that as far back as the 1980s the Sandinista movement had begun taking on many of the characteristics of Somoza’s corrupt and brutish regime. Since Ortega’s second coming, however, the situation had worsened dramatically as he scrapped constitutional term limits and gained a stranglehold on the country’s media. “Ortega has become increasingly authoritarian, concentrating power in himself and those around him,” Núñez said. Nicaragua has largely escaped the violence which has racked much of Central America, and for a while, Ortega was able to ensure popular support with public works and handouts funded in part by favorable oil deals with Hugo Chávez. But that economic support has dwindled since Venezuela descended into crisis, and household economies have been squeezed. For many, the final straw was recent social security reforms which increased both employer and employee contributions and imposed a 5% tax on pensions. Thale said that for all the FSLN’s flaws and its failures to live up to the ideals and policies it once preached, parallels with the Somoza dictatorship went too far. “I balk a little at saying this is the Somoza regime all over again … [But] I think there are pretty troubling parallels in the situation, and if I were Daniel and the leadership of the FSLN I would be pretty deeply embarrassed by the fact that people can make these comparisons.” Like Núñez, Thale also saw deep-rooted disillusionment with Ortega’s rule driving the unrest. “People have benefited from populist programs so it is not like he has no support at all. But what I think has been happening over the years he has been in office is that he has grown both increasingly distant from his own broader social base – not just hardcore Sandinistas but popular majorities – and he has worked increasingly both to centralise power and to consolidate his personal and family rule. Discontent with that has been growing … over time and has exploded.” Rosario Murillo, who has described the demonstrations as the work of “minuscule and toxic groups”, was also part of the problem with oddball vanity projects such as the “Trees of Life” fuelling the sense that her septuagenarian husband had lost his way. Thale said Murillo was increasingly reviled as a calculating, behind the scenes power broker who many suspect is planning to run for president in the 2021 election. As protests continued to rock Nicaragua this week, the Foreign Office urged British citizens to steer clear of the country. “The situation appears calm but remains potentially volatile,” it said.

Top stories A 12-year-old asylum seeker held on Nauru has publicly pleaded for his severely depressed mother to be moved to Australia, for the urgent medical treatment doctors have been recommending for more than a year. “I feel helpless because there is no one to help us. There is no one to see how we are suffering” Ali says in a series of videos filmed in the tent he shares with his mother. The case of the Iranian asylum seeker Fazileh M, who has been suffering gynaecological issues causing incontinence for more than three years, is the latest in a string of medical transfers that have been urgently requested by doctors on the island but delayed or refused by the Australian Border Force (ABF). Ali says his ongoing indefinite detention has harmed his family. “From the age of seven, when I came here, I have been stuck. I had so many dreams but they have all blown away. I wanted to become an important person but instead I became nothing – even worse than nothing.” The former commissioner of the Australian Border Force, Roman Quaedvlieg, has said on Twitter that the medical transfers from Nauru were a “vexed” issue for the ABF, which has the ultimate authority to move people to care. He conceded that genuine medical transfers were “obstructed and thwarted” by the ABF. A former senior medical officer on Nauru, Dr Nick Martin, told Quaedvlieg: “Every time, without fail, that I tried to get deserving cases the care they needed they were thwarted and obstructed by ABF. Every time.” Quaedvlieg said: “Understood and I accept without equivocation … A tragedy borne from tragedy.” • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Turnbull government has dumped plans to increase the Medicare levy to fund the national disability insurance scheme. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, will use a speech today to confirm the about-face on a measure the government outlined in the 2017 budget. While the government won’t lay out the full details of the decision until the budget in two weeks, Morrison will say the government now can afford to jettison a measure forecast to raise $8.2bn over four years – and still fund the NDIS in the 2018 budget and “beyond” – because the strengthening economy has improved the government’s fiscal position. The proposed Medicare levy increase of 0.5% would have affected everyone earning more than $21,655 and the government seemed unlikely to get it through the Senate. The Danish inventor Peter Madsen has been sentenced to life in prison for the premeditated murder and sexual assault of the Swedish journalist Kim Wall on his submarine. “This is a cynical and pre-planned sexual assault of a particularly brutal nature on a random woman who, in connection with her journalistic work, accepted an invitation for a sailing trip on the accused’s submarine,” said judge Anette Burkø, explaining the rare decision to hand down Denmark’s most severe sentence. Wall was 30 when she died in August last year. The journalist had reported from all over the world for Time magazine, the New York Times and the Guardian, among others. A cross-party group of federal MPs has asked the auditor general to urgently investigate $180m spent on water buybacks last year, amid concerns about whether the government got value for money. The buybacks of water rights from three large properties took place without tender. “There have been concerns about the buybacks raised by the Australia Institute and Guardian Australia,” Senator Rex Patrick said. “The analysis and reports allege that the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources … significantly overpaid vendors.” In one buyback, the government paid $79m – nearly double the valuation made by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has made an impassioned speech in Washington advocating many of the things Donald Trump has spent much of his presidency trying to destroy. Macron said he was “sure” the US would one day return to the Paris climate change accord and vowed that France would not abandon the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. Trump has left the first agreement and has been threatening to quit the second in the next few weeks. Macron presented himself to the US legislature as an unabashed advocate of the liberal world order of global institutions and free trade – the opposite of the America First nationalism that fuelled Trump’s rise to the White House.

There are plenty of reasons not to get hitched – but for Bridie Jabour’s generation, the institution still holds sway, even if they are older by they time they do it. “If we are being brutally realistic, many marriages are probably not going to last. But the Great Barrier Reef is not going to last either, and we don’t know how much of the world is going to last if Trump and North Korea keep playing chicken.

Phil Hogan, the commissioner for agriculture, will tell the senate in the Irish parliament on Thursday that remarks by Jacob Rees-Mogg about Ireland’s beef trade with Britain were “unhelpful and irresponsible”. Speaking earlier this week, Rees-Mogg said the UK was in a much stronger negotiating position than May would have parliament believe and called for her to be “much firmer and clearer” about the damage to the EU if Britain crashes out without a deal. “If we were to apply the common external tariff on Irish beef, the Irish agricultural industry is in serious trouble. You’ve got to ask the EU: does it want to sacrifice the economy of Ireland on the altar of EU ideology? My guess is that the answer is no, and therefore we are in a very strong negotiating position,” he said. He added the government should abandon the customs partnership concept, declaring it “completely cretinous”. Hogan is expected to say on Thursday that such remarks highlight a continuing rift in London between Brexiters and remainers. He will say: “Both sides should compare and honestly weigh the costs and benefits of a free trade agreement versus a customs union. This is a moment for balanced judgment, not costly immoderate ideology. “Some form of customs arrangement and softening of the red lines must be in the best interest of all concerned.” He will say he recognises that the UK’s objective is to achieve a better future for its citizens, but that this “cannot be achieved on a wing and a prayer”. The commissioner will also confirm that the EU has “sent the UK back to the drawing board on the Irish border” and it must come up with new ideas before June. His remarks come hours after Brexit secretary David Davis said he believed the Irish border conundrum would remain wrapped up in wider talks and would not be resolved until October. Hogan will warn that the June target set by the EU for fresh ideas on the border has not moved and has consequences. “No decision on the Irish border, no withdrawal treaty, no withdrawal treaty, no transition,” he will say. His words chime with those of Michel Barnier last week, after proposals on the Irish border were comprehensively rejected by the EU."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/26/barry-review-a-perfect-storm-of-horror-and-hilarity-as-bill-haders-hitman-turns-actor","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T22:25:28Z","webTitle":"Barry review – A perfect storm of horror and hilarity as Bill Hader's hitman turns actor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/26/barry-review-a-perfect-storm-of-horror-and-hilarity-as-bill-haders-hitman-turns-actor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/26/barry-review-a-perfect-storm-of-horror-and-hilarity-as-bill-haders-hitman-turns-actor","fields":{"headline":"Barry review – A perfect storm of horror and hilarity as Bill Hader's hitman turns actor","bodyText":"In a Los Angeles parking lot, Barry Berkman (played by former Saturday Night Live comedian Bill Hader) is telling Gene Cousineau (Henry Winkler, the Fonz, cue whooping) what he is good at. (Barry, Sky Atlantic) “I’m good at killing people,” he says. “Yeah, when I got back from Afghanistan, I was really depressed, I could hardly leave my house for months. This friend of my dad’s, he’s like an uncle to me, he helped me out and he gave me a purpose. He told me that what I was good at over there could be useful here, and, er, it’s a job.” There is so much going on – and so much of what Barry is about – in the scene. Barry is an army vet, now depressed and unhappy in his work as a hitman based in Cleveland. It’s tough for him to adapt to life after war. He is in LA to dispense with his latest mark, Ryan, a personal trainer who – very stupidly – is shagging the wife of a Chechen mob boss. It was the gang – specifically the boss’s bald, camp, deputy Noho Hank (played hilariously by Anthony Carrigan) – who commissioned the hit. Anyway, as well as being a physical trainer (plus extras), Ryan – like everyone else in LA – is an aspiring actor. He takes an acting class with Gene: method acting from the Fonz. Barry follows Ryan in to the building, to put a bullet in his head, but instead finds himself on stage, doing a scene with him from True Romance. Barry also finds potential love, with lovely but seriously self-obsessed and actorly Sally (Sarah Goldberg, also screen-bossingly excellent), and, potentially, new meaning in his life. Hey, maybe he could phase out the killing and get into acting instead? Break a leg. Only thing is, he can’t act – really can’t act. “What you did was dogshit,” Gene tells him, which is harsh but true. Hader does very bad very well, wooden like a giant redwood. But then, in the parking lot, he tells Gene what he is really good at (killing people). Gene thinks it is his audition monologue and sees the raw authenticity (because it is authentic, but Gene doesn’t realise it), and suddenly he is in. The only worry is how easy it is going to be to give up the day job. Clue: not easy at all. So there you have it, the two strands of Barry. A violent crime drama about contract killing, hits and mobsters one minute, and comedy about a lonely lost guy who accidentally ends up on a stage and likes it, the next. There is no danger of this going romcom, though. Right from the start we know the boy-meets-girl storyline isn’t going to be straightforward. We know what Barry is capable of. I don’t mean Hader and his SNL stuff, although that as well. But Barry the character, who can put a bullet in a man’s head without blinking (deadpan is a new – and surprisingly successful – departure for Hader, although surely we are going to see him lose his cool at some point). This is Hader’s baby – he doesn’t just star in it, he is also co-parent (with Alec Berg). He directs the opener, too. And it is fabulous. Somehow, those strands, which don’t have any right to be spliced together in any meaningful way, are. It is one of those unlikely flavour combinations – mango plus chilli; strawberries plus pepper; satire about LA people and actor people plus a dude lying on his bed with his brains blown out (the opening shot, as it happens). It works because of that fabulous juxtaposition, a perfect storm of horror and hilarity. Because it is smart: there are references all over the place (including a place over my head). Because the characters are convincing, three-dimensional people you end up caring about. And because of the performances I’ve mentioned and loads more I haven’t, such as Paula Newsome who plays Detective Moss drier than Death Valley. Oh, yeah, there is a whole police investigation going on, too. Sometimes there is a lot going on in some of those performances. Like Hader’s in that parking lot scene. Here is an actor playing someone who wants to be an actor but isn’t, and he isn’t acting now, although the person he’s talking to – an acting coach – thinks he is acting … Got it? Oh, and Winkler looks like he is having a ball in his role. Did I mention that Fonzie’s in it? Ayyy! This one gets the thumbs up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/25/heidi-alexander-thought-to-be-considering-role-at-london-city-hall","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T20:26:51Z","webTitle":"Heidi Alexander thought to be considering role at London City Hall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/25/heidi-alexander-thought-to-be-considering-role-at-london-city-hall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/25/heidi-alexander-thought-to-be-considering-role-at-london-city-hall","fields":{"headline":"Heidi Alexander thought to be considering role at London City Hall","bodyText":"Heidi Alexander, the former shadow health secretary, is considering quitting the Commons to accept a senior job at City Hall with London mayor Sadiq Khan, the Guardian understands. Alexander was Khan’s campaign chair during the 2016 London mayoral election. The MP, who has spearheaded the campaign to keep the UK in the single market since leaving the shadow cabinet, currently represents Lewisham East. It is understood Alexander may be considering taking a prominent role at City Hall under Khan, though no timeline was given for her departure. Khan’s spokesman declined to comment. Alexander has been the co-chair, with Alison McGovern, of the Labour campaign for the single market, aimed at shifting the party leadership’s position on the issue. Brexit has been her focus since the June election, where her majority increased by 11%. She has authored reports for the campaign group, coordinated Labour petitions and campaigned for parliamentary amendments and motions at Labour conference to advocate for a soft EU exit. Alexander, who was elected in 2010, was previously full time deputy mayor for Lewisham, overseeing regeneration schemes. However, since quitting the shadow cabinet in protest at Corbyn’s leadership in July 2016, Alexander has come under pressure from pro-Corbyn campaign group Momentum, including some local activists who are also members of the far left Alliance for Workers’ Liberty. The influx of new members has sometimes represented a direct challenge, with local members vocally objecting to her decision to quit the shadow cabinet. Momentum’s position is stronger in the neighbouring constituency of Lewisham Deptford; however, the campaign group last week launched a Lewisham East left caucus, to “help comrades build a strong left in the remaining stronghold of the Labour right in Lewisham”. Alexander did not reply to several requests for comment. Should she quit the Commons in order to take up the role, there is likely to be a fierce battle for her south London seat, which was retained at the last election with a majority of more than 21,000. If Alexander is appointed by Khan, he would gain an experienced and popular Labour ally, bolstering his links with the parliamentary party ahead of his re-selection later this summer. Claire Kober, the outgoing leader of Haringey council, has also been recently linked with a job with Khan at City Hall after May’s local elections."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/25/george-north-move-ospreys-northampton-lions-wing-gloucester","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T18:26:10Z","webTitle":"George North finally plumps for move to Ospreys from next season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/25/george-north-move-ospreys-northampton-lions-wing-gloucester","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/25/george-north-move-ospreys-northampton-lions-wing-gloucester","fields":{"headline":"George North finally plumps for move to Ospreys from next season","bodyText":"It took him five months to make up his mind but the British &amp; Irish Lions wing George North will be joining Ospreys next season after signing a national dual contract. North made the decision to return to Wales last November after spending five seasons at Northampton. He joined them from the Scarlets, who had first call on him as his former region, but they opted not to re-sign him. Cardiff Blues and the Dragons made pitches to the 26-year old, who has scored 34 tries for Wales in 73 Tests, but he preferred Ospreys, who will be in the European Challenge Cup next season. Ospreys announced this week that Allen Clarke is taking over as head coach following the sacking of Steve Tandy in January. “I believe the region has an exciting future with the structure and recruitment they have put in place,” North said. “It was a really positive decision for me to sign a national dual contract with the support and structure it provides. I have worked alongside the Welsh Rugby Union to finalise my choice of region and would like to thank everyone involved.” Ospreys have fallen behind the Scarlets in recent seasons and also been overtaken by the Blues, their opponents on the final day of the regular season this weekend at the Principality Stadium, but joining North at Ospreys next season are two fellow Wales players, Scott Williams and Aled Davies. The Guinness Pro14’s final weekend before the revamped play-offs involves a series of derbies. Leinster need a point in Connacht to join Glasgow in the semi-finals and enjoy a rest weekend when the quarter-finals, involving the sides that finish second and third in the two conferences, are played. The Champions Cup organisers have stated that reports Gloucester have already qualified for the tournament next season having reached the Challenge Cup final against Cardiff Blues, who had already secured their place through their league position, are premature. Gloucester, who face Bath at Kingsholm on Saturday, would miss out, even if they beat the Blues, if they finish outside the top six in the Premiership and Racing 92 win the Champions Cup final against Leinster in Bilbao next month having failed to qualify through the Top 14. That outcome is unlikely, with Racing needing three points from their final two league matches to qualify. Should the French side drop out of the top six in the Top 14 and lose against Leinster, they would miss out on the Champions Cup next season. In a bid to incentivise teams to take the secondary tournament seriously, the finalists of this season’s Challenge Cup would have a claim for the final place in the Champions Cup followed by the losing semi-finalists, who would meet in a play-off if they had not already qualified."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/25/bake-in-the-box-cake-only-an-idiot-could-mess-it-up","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T15:10:12Z","webTitle":"Bake in the Box cake – only an idiot could mess it up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/25/bake-in-the-box-cake-only-an-idiot-could-mess-it-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/25/bake-in-the-box-cake-only-an-idiot-could-mess-it-up","fields":{"headline":"Bake in the Box cake – only an idiot could mess it up","bodyText":"Dr Oetker’s Bake in the Box sounds like a cautionary tale adapted for Netflix, but is actually a cake. If you’re looking for nuance in the kitchen, this is not for you. But if you are time-poor, appliance-shy or incompetent, then it is. It is so straightforward to make, so utterly bake-by-numbers, I half-expected to find it came with a sachet of enzymes to help you digest the thing. Alas not. Dr Oetker launched its baking kits late last year with little fanfare. The German-owned food company’s UK branch is based on an industrial estate in Lancashire opposite Crossleys, a company that repairs caravans – another sort of box. Yet Dr Oetker has become one of the leading manufacturers of frozen foods and baking equipment. It dominates the market. Put simply, the bake in the box cake is evolution. I get my hands on the lemon and poppy seed loaf (other varieties include banana and choc chip, and double chocolate). To make it, you remove the lid and empty the mix into the box. Whisk seven tablespoons of milk in using a fork (since we’re on a convenience tip, I use the same tablespoon) and pop into an oven, preheated to 190C/gas mark 5. Remove after 10 minutes, score a 1cm-deep groove down the middle of the cake and return to the oven for a further 20 minutes. This is convenience food from the same school as boil in the bag and microwave meals: all designed to help “overcome the barriers consumers face when it comes to home baking”, says the company. It’s a valid argument, although there’s something conflicting about the almost tyrannical convenience and the fact that it still takes 30 minutes to bake. But it works, and the cake is fine: lemony, dense, too sweet but adequate. The good news is that Dr Oetker didn’t try to gender it with a pink box, or deploy a fun font to make it look hip. The bad news – and I discovered this after eating the cake – is that Dr Oetker has a Nazi past. Richard Kaselowsky, a past owner of the firm, was a “leading supporter” of Hitler. The company’s president at that time – and son of the original doctor – Rudolf-August Oetker joined the Nazi party in the 1930s, news that was later exposed by his son, August Oetker – to his credit – because, according to a spokesman: “The business felt it important to be transparent about any mistakes that were made in the past, set the facts straight once and for all and do everything to prevent anything like the Third Reich happening again.” So there you go. But back to the cake. Dr Oetker’s Bake in the Box is ridiculously simple to make – it would take a colossal muppet to mess it up and yet, I did. Halfway through, I decided to add lemon juice to zhoosh it up – but in my attempt to rip up the rulebook, as it were, I ended up ripping the box. Simple for some, then."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/28/how-i-eat-bodybuilder-flex-lewis","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T11:00:12Z","webTitle":"Bodybuilder Flex Lewis: how I eat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/28/how-i-eat-bodybuilder-flex-lewis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/28/how-i-eat-bodybuilder-flex-lewis","fields":{"headline":"Bodybuilder Flex Lewis: how I eat","bodyText":"Breakfast I’ve had issues with not feeling hungry since I was born, so when I got into this sport, I had to train my appetite as much as my body.

Thursday’s Commons debate on borders and customs regimes after Brexit is a crucial opportunity for MPs to fire a very clear shot across the government’s bows in favour of the softest possible Brexit. The Commons will be debating a motion on Thursday, not a piece of legislation – the latter opportunity will come when the trade bill and the EU withdrawal bill are again discussed by MPs next month. Yet this week’s motion is anything but trivial. It supports frictionless post-Brexit trade borders for manufacturers and it insists on continuing alignments across the Irish border. It is moved by the backbench liaison committee of select committee chairs, so it has backing from senior parliamentarians from Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party. The outcome must send an unequivocal message that we have reached make your mind up time. As so often in the Brexit process, the government’s approach is to continue to kick the can down the proverbial road. But the end of the road is in sight. With local elections due next week, the Conservatives have imposed a light whip on their MPs. Some select committees, including the Brexit committee, are scheduled to be on overseas visits. It is important, nevertheless, that as many pro-European MPs as possible attend this debate and vote for the motion. Most businesses in Britain, especially in manufacturing, want to remain in the customs union or to join one that is effectively the same thing after Brexit. Crucially, the government has also made a solemn agreement with the EU to maintain a frictionless border in Ireland. Both are essential. This motion must be carried. The aim on Thursday and next month must be to maximise the pressure on the government to make the best possible compromise with the EU on customs and tariffs, for the sake of both industry and Britain’s commitments on Northern Ireland. Theresa May prefers indecision and brinkmanship. So, at present, does the EU, under strong pressure from France and Germany to make sure Brexit is not rewarded. But the principles at the heart of the argument – and the parliamentary numbers when the bills return – are about to become inescapable. One further large truth, too often ignored, is that the leavers’ trumpeted alternative of bilateral post-Brexit trade deals – which would not be possible if the UK embraced any version of the EU customs union – is a sham. These deals simply don’t exist. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has drawn an embarrassing blank as he tours the world touting for deregulatory deals. MPs face a choice between a fantasy future and a solid commercially secure future based on existing arrangements. It would be phenomenally irresponsible to opt for the former against the latter. It’s a no-brainer. Some ministers have floated the idea of making this issue a confidence vote. That shows how vulnerable they are. It is why Thursday’s initial skirmish matters. MPs need to increase the pressure on the government as the Lords amendments to the Brexit bill pile up. Sooner or later Mrs May is going to have to get real about the business case, the Northern Ireland case, and the parliamentary numbers. She also needs to get real about the compromises that will be required with the EU if this is to be made to work. Mrs May has got away for too long with promoting the pyrrhic freedom of a fantasy Brexit. That no longer washes. It is compromise time now. Mrs May can’t duck it. And MPs must ensure that she does not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/08/theatre-reinventing-stage-classics-with-attitude-gender-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T17:36:15Z","webTitle":"Why time's up for theatre's 'timeless' classics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/08/theatre-reinventing-stage-classics-with-attitude-gender-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/08/theatre-reinventing-stage-classics-with-attitude-gender-politics","fields":{"headline":"Why time's up for theatre's 'timeless' classics","bodyText":"We’re used to hearing works of art described as “timeless”. It’s a stamp of approval, ensuring a place in the pantheon of masterpieces. Many of our dramatic staples, though, are rooted in the times that produced them. When you revive the play, do you revive the problematic attitudes of the era? As theatre company RashDash recognise, a certain legitimacy comes with the dramatic canon, ensuring some plays get staged again and again. When artistic directors started suggesting to RashDash that doing a classic could be a way of moving up in scale, they took it as a provocation. “It felt a shame that to be taken seriously, given more money, a bigger platform, we would have to be essentially saying the words of a dead white man,” says Helen Goalen. Their response was to take on Chekhov’s Three Sisters and question the values it represents. As artistic director of Chichester Festival Theatre and, prior to that, Sheffield Theatres, Daniel Evans has experience of grappling with the issues thrown up by the classics – particularly musicals, where dodgy views are often wrapped up in a feelgood package. He recalls the care that went into the closing moments of his 2012 production of My Fair Lady. “We were adamant in that Carly Bawden [as Eliza Doolittle] squared herself off to Dominic West [Henry Higgins] as if to say, ‘If I am going to live here, then I’m not going to live here as your inferior. This is going to be a relationship of equality.’” I remember having a long discussion about what our final image should be, and how would Eliza maintain her dignity and her agency.” Such small directorial choices can subtly undercut troubling moments. In her current production of Paint Your Wagon, Liverpool Everyman’s Gemma Bodinetz takes the show’s most baldly misogynistic scene – the selling of a wife at auction – and turns it on its head. The choreography puts the new husband-to-be in a position of scrutiny while the woman “analyses whether she wants him as a piece of meat”. Bodinetz says that questions about how to deconstruct the show’s gender politics were “in the [rehearsal] room at all times”. RashDash are taking a more interventionist approach. Their Three Sisters is carefully billed as “after Chekhov”; they have taken the red pen to this much-loved classic. Among other things, they want to question the difference between how men and women occupy the stage. “We’ve talked a lot about how the men speak very differently from the women in the play,” says Goalen. “The women do have things to say, but the conversations they have are much more about their lives and things in a domestic sphere, whereas the men do a lot of philosophising about life and the world, take authority and hold the room.” Casting can help deconstruct gender stereotypes. For the Everyman rep company, cross-gender casting is a practical necessity, but it’s also become a form of commentary. In Paint Your Wagon, women play the testosterone-fuelled goldminers, men the fandango girls – implicitly questioning expectations of both roles. In Bodinetz’s production of Othello, , the eponymous general is played by – and portrayed as – a woman, with Golda Rosheuvel taking on the central role. The aim, Bodinetz explains, is to recreate for modern audiences the pressures the character might have felt in Shakespeare’s time. “For a woman to be commanding an army, and a black woman and a lesbian at that – all of these things felt very electric,” she says. “It allows an audience not to see these plays as museum pieces.” Timing is crucial. As public conversations about sexual harassment and abuses of power continue, Bodinetz suggests that the questions around gender politics in Paint Your Wagon and Othello feel “really alive”. Evans stresses that, as an artistic director, “one has to address the questions ‘Why now?’ and ‘What is it saying now?’” However these classics are deconstructed, are there some attitudes and ideas that would be better off left in the past? “Fundamentally the question is why choose a show that has those inherent problems rather than one that doesn’t,” says Bodinetz. She stands up for some of Paint Your Wagon’s more progressive features, such as its sympathetic depiction of Mexican character Julio and its emphasis on a female protagonist who seeks an education, but admits that the musical also has plenty of “horrible bits”. RashDash have tussled with similar questions. “I don’t want to stop anyone else from doing the canon,” says Abbi Greenland, “but it’s interesting that we’re doing it when we feel it’s so problematic. I think it depends how much you deconstruct it.” Evans resists the idea that there are certain plays we should resign to the past. “There are some people who say The Taming of the Shrew should be left behind because of what it asks of its female protagonist. Personally I think that’s a shame, because I think there will come a time, or an artist will come along, who will want to turn it on its head.” Bodinetz also insists that there is still value in these shows. “If we forget the horrors of what we’ve all been through in our past, and how women and any number of other minorities have been made to feel throughout history, we are in danger of forgetting the lessons we’ve learnt,” she says. Greenland identifies a larger, more systemic problem. “Even when you engage with the problems in the text, even when you deconstruct it, it still means that the majority of the shows that are staged are by white men,” she points out. “Essentially the viewpoint that we are watching over and over again is white male. Unless you make some other work with other people authoring it, you can’t deconstruct that.” Both Bodinetz and Evans talk about the need to stage such reworked classics as part of their wider programme. For Bodinetz, it’s essential to counterpoint Paint Your Wagon and Othello with pieces written by women and people of colour that reflect the world we live in now. Evans meanwhile points to Chichester’s forthcoming summer production of Me and My Girl as an opportunity to highlight the continuing resonance of class. “In a way that’s one of the great joys of musicals,” he says. “That broad appeal gives you an opportunity to reach a wide range of people, and therefore the responsibility becomes even greater,” he says. As RashDash point out, these considerations about what continues to be staged – and how – go right to the heart of what we value as a culture. “That’s the major problem we’re tackling in our show: what makes good art?” says Goalen. “What have we come to know to be good art? And who has decided?” • RashDash’s production of Three Sisters: After Chekhov is at Royal Exchange, Manchester, to 19 May.

I took to Facebook to vent my surprise: “What is going on with the youth?” I asked. A friend replied: “Dystopia is realism these days?” Patrick Langley’s debut is this kind of book. A distinctly post-Brexit novel, it is set in an unnamed city that both is and isn’t London, thick with the atmosphere of the riots of 2011, and the stricken, devastated aura of the days after the Grenfell fire. It is oblique, and bleak: it is never quite clear what has happened or is happening, what is it about our world that has finally broken or overflowed. There is an army, people are being arrested, council blocks have fallen into disrepair. But why, and how? All we learn is this: It happened slowly at first. The evenings grew eerily quiet. Fewer lights in the windows. Letters slid under doors. Court cases between tenants and landlords fizzled out in defeat for the former. Protests were quietly ignored. Families vanished, there one evening, gone the next. Men in hardhats and hi-vis waistcoats materialised, sealing the doors of freshly vacated flats with sheets of perforated metal. They cling-filmed the windows and poured concrete down the toilets. […] The word ‘decanting’ started floating around. The brothers came to believe that this was a gruesome form of industrialised murder. But there is always a flutter of hope in the dark, and in Arkady it dwells in the unshakeable brotherly love between the novel’s two heroes, Jackson and Frank. Their relationship is so beautifully etched that it doesn’t matter that the world around them is roughly sketched. We encounter the brothers at various moments in their lives, beginning when they are young enough that Frank can’t yet walk and Jackson trundles him around in a duffel bag on wheels; their parents have just disappeared (their mother inexplicably, their father into police custody). They are brought to the city and left to fend for themselves, staying first with a man called Leonard, later in bedsits, and then eventually on an abandoned barge. Frank likes to draw; Jackson likes to map, a psychogeographer on a bicycle riding through the edgelands and musing on the difference between “maps of ownership, maps of property, maps of power”, and the “other territories and signals [that] appear” to those who are paying attention: “an infinity of codes that dictate how the city is moved through, immaterial borders that constantly rise and fall and flux”. These unofficial maps might gesture at a route to freedom; at one point, during the lessons he gives his younger brother, Jackson asks Frank to draw a map of a place that doesn’t exist. On the wall of the barge’s cabin hangs a map of the canal waterways of the country, like a plan of all the possibilities of escape. The barge allows them to make their way north to another unnamed city, where a group of revolutionaries called the Red Citadel are organising protests and fighting the state. Jackson and Frank become associated with the cause, but feel a certain ambivalence about committing, as if the group were a slightly corrupt product of the corruption it’s meant to be fighting. The barge, which they name the Arkady, is the motor of the book, heavy with symbolism and associations. Arkady refers to a man whom Frank “repeatedly draws, in notebooks and on corridor walls: a looming figure with a blank, faceless head”. The man is real, Frank says, and he comes to him in his dreams, “a strange protector or a vengeful foe”. Arkady: an imaginary or maybe real man who stands for a utopian place, Arcadia, the Eden of their family from which they have been thrown out, the green and pleasant land to which it seems this not-England will never return. Arkady is all at once father, place of origin, peace and impossible place. “‘A boat is a floating piece of space’,” Jackson tells Frank, reading Foucault off his phone, “‘a place without a place, that exists by itself”. He’s reading Foucault’s essay on heterotopias. If the utopia is a non-place, an impossible place, the heterotopia is a counter-site, a place where all the places that can be found within the culture are “simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted,” a kind of mirror of society in general. The boat becomes a symbol of escape, but also of the burden that comes with freedom and choice. The final decision they must make on board is a reflection of what this kind of regime does to the people who live in it – there are no good choices, just bad ones and worse ones. In the end, the barge confirms itself to be a tool rather than a destination. The brothers can’t dwell in Arcadia; people need to be placed. Dystopia is dispelled wherever people insist on their organic connection to the land. The psychogeographers will inherit the Earth. Arkady suggests that we’ll build our own arcadias out of the dreams that haunt us, both threatening and protective. • Lauren Elkin’s Flâneuse is published by Vintage.

Jay Crouch, who has a condition that left his small intestine twisted and has caused complications with other organs since he was six weeks old, is recovering at home after receiving two kidneys, a pancreas, liver and small bowel during the 10-hour operation at Birmingham children’s hospital. The surgery, which became necessary after the strain of continuous treatment for his condition became too much for his body, has allowed him to swallow food for the first time. His mother, Katie Freestone, 28, said their relatives were “all absolutely amazed at the incredible progress Jay has made in a relatively short space of time”, after doctors said he was recovering well from the complex operation. “There also aren’t enough words to say thank you to the donor and their family and, while we’re thrilled that Jay has been given this chance, we’re also incredibly aware of the sadness and tragedy that another family had to endure to make this possible,” she said. The operation required a team of 12, including anaesthetists, two surgeons, five nurses and three junior doctors – as well as additional medical staff who were involved with the patient’s wider care. Freestone thanked them, saying it was “fantastic” to be able to take her son home. “It means we can finally get back to our own routine and Jay can be comfortable in his own space.” Doctors diagnosed Jay, who is from Leicestershire, with short bowel syndrome after discovering that his small intestine was twisted. The condition prevented him from eating and digesting food, meaning he had to be fed intravenously and required continuous treatment. But that led to the failure of his organs, making the operation necessary. The hospital said that after the procedure Jay was being fed through a nasogastric tube, supported by oral feeding, and was working towards a full diet in the coming years. The seven-year-old said: “I want to say thank you to my mum for looking after me and my grandma and granddad, who have been telling me every day that I’m getting better.” Jay also thanked medical staff. The hospital says its staff perform about 50 solid organ transplant operations a year, the majority of which are single-organ transplants. Khalid Sharif, a consultant surgeon and the hospital’s lead for transplantation, said: “It’s incredibly rare for this many organs to be successfully transplanted at once and shows the difference that organ donors make to the lives of others. Without the generosity and selflessness of donors, their families and loved ones, such life-saving procedures simply couldn’t take place. “We couldn’t be happier with the progress Jay has made so far, but this will obviously need very vigilant monitoring and support over the coming months and years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/24/donald-trump-says-north-korea-is-very-open-to-summit-as-soon-as-possible","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T17:00:50Z","webTitle":"Trump calls Kim 'very honourable' and says North Korea wants summit as soon as possible","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/24/donald-trump-says-north-korea-is-very-open-to-summit-as-soon-as-possible","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/24/donald-trump-says-north-korea-is-very-open-to-summit-as-soon-as-possible","fields":{"headline":"Trump calls Kim 'very honourable' and says North Korea wants summit as soon as possible","bodyText":"Donald Trump has called Kim Jong-un “very open” and “very honourable” and said the North Korean regime wanted a summit as soon as possible. The president’s compliments marked a dramatic turnaround from “Little Rocket Man” – one of the insults Trump aimed at Kim before the North Korean dictator’s announcement last week that he was suspending nuclear and missile testing. They were also unprecedented for a US president describing the head of one of the world’s most repressive regimes. At a White House meeting with the visiting French president, Emmanuel Macron, Trump was asked about prospects for a summit with Kim. Trump replied: “We have been told directly that they would like to have the meeting as soon as possible. We think that’s a great thing for the world.” Referring to the North Korean leader, who has been in power since 2011, Trump said: “He really has been very open and, I think, very honourable from everything we’re seeing.” He added: “Now, a lot of promises have been made by North Korea over the years but they have never been in this position.” Plans for a summit follow a secret mission to Pyongyang at the end of last month by the CIA director, Mike Pompeo, whose nomination as secretary of state is now before the US Senate. Last week, Kim announced a moratorium on tests of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles. However, most experts believe any White House expectations that Kim is ready to give up the regime’s nuclear arsenal are likely to be disappointed. Trump, however, was insistent about what he wanted to the outcome of the summit to be. “It would be ver easy to make a simple deal and claim victory,” Trump said. “I m not going to do that. I want them to get rid of their nukes.” “We’ll see where that will all go,” Trump said, adding that he is prepared to walk away from talks if they are not productive. “Unlike past administrations, I will leave the table. But I think we have the chance to do something very special.” Asked about Trump’s choice of adjectives for Kim, Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, said: “I think it is important for the president to used measured descriptions of Kim Jong-un. In the past, he has not done that. He may have gone a bit far calling him honourable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/25/jeremy-coste-recipe-poke-bowl-chicken-hawaiian-dish-korean-sauce","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T11:40:05Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Coste’s recipe for poké bowl with chicken","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/25/jeremy-coste-recipe-poke-bowl-chicken-hawaiian-dish-korean-sauce","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/25/jeremy-coste-recipe-poke-bowl-chicken-hawaiian-dish-korean-sauce","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Coste’s recipe for poké bowl with chicken","bodyText":"I wanted to create a poké bowl with a cooked protein and, when well prepared, chicken is extremely tender – a similar consistency to the sashimi-grade fish traditionally used in this Hawaiian dish.

The SAS and other elite units that make up the UK’s special forces are usually deployed on covert operations. Any questions in parliament about them are met by the Ministry of Defence with “no comment”, even when their presence in conflict zones has been established by the media. But MPs are now pushing for the special forces to be subjected to parliamentary oversight. At a Westminster meeting organised by the Oxford Research Group, a thinktank, the Conservative MP Crispin Blunt, former chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said: “It is my view there is a gaping hole in parliamentary oversight.” Other countries with similar elite forces – such as Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Norway and the US – subject their forces to democratic scrutiny. Also speaking at the meeting, the former defence and foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, who chaired the parliamentary intelligence and security committee until 2015, said: “I think it is unanswerable that there should be some form of oversight of the special forces.” He added that if MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, which in most cases were more secretive than the special forces, could face oversight, then so could the troops. But, he said, parliamentarians with the oversight role should not be given the right, as in the US, to be told in advance of operations. Rather than that, any scrutiny should be after the event, he said. He proposed oversight should be done by a sub-committee of the Commons defence committee, with members given high-level security clearance, rather than by the parliamentary intelligence and security committee. A 44-page report by the Oxford Research Group – Britain’s Shadow Army: Policy Options for External Oversight of UK Special Forces – was published to coincide with the meeting. The authors, Liam Walpole and Megan Karlshoej-Pedersen, say: “While there remain many good reasons for the tactical secrecy of UKSF [UK Special Forces] activities, there appear to be fewer good reasons for the complete opacity that currently surrounds them. “Our research shows that Britain is alone among its allies in not permitting any discussion of the staffing, funding and the strategy surrounding the use of its special forces.” Special forces have been used increasingly in Iraq, Libya and Syria as well as in other conflicts around the world, often embedded with local forces. Some MPs suspect the government’s preference for using special forces is a way of avoiding having to go to parliament, as would be likely if there was a large-scale deployment of conventional forces. Rifkind took issue with this, saying there were lots of situations in which special forces were preferable to conventional forces. Dominic Grieve, chair of the intelligence and security committee, is quoted in the Oxford Research Group report as being supportive of the scrutiny proposal, as is the defence committee chair, Julian Lewis, with some caveats. Britain’s special forces were founded during the second world war and today comprise five units – the Special Air Service (SAS), Special Boat Service (SBS), Special Forces Support Group (SFSG), Special Reconnaissance Regiment (SRR) and 18 (UKSF) Signals Regiment. The units are the subject of an exhibition – Special Forces: in the Shadows – at the National Army Museum in Chelsea which opened in March and runs until November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2018/apr/25/the-brothers-who-were-searched-by-the-police-for-a-fist-bump","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T05:00:40Z","webTitle":"The brothers who were searched by the police for a fist bump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/apr/25/the-brothers-who-were-searched-by-the-police-for-a-fist-bump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/apr/25/the-brothers-who-were-searched-by-the-police-for-a-fist-bump","fields":{"headline":"The brothers who were searched by the police for a fist bump","bodyText":"Liam Joseph stepped out of the Nisa convenience store on Deptford High Street. He met his brother, Dijon, who had just ordered some food from the takeaway next door, and they tapped fists. Within seconds Dijon’s arm was grabbed by an officer from the Met’s territorial support group who said she saw them exchanging drugs. As Dijon protested, another officer tightly cuffed his free wrist and accused him of behaving aggressively. “I’m not being aggressive … I’m a big guy,” said Dijon, who is 6ft 8in tall. “Exactly,” the officer replied. At the same time, another officer restrained Liam, while a second rifled his pockets. Finding nothing illicit, the officer took his keys and searched his car. The incident is now under investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. The Josephs, neither of whom has a history of drug-taking or violent crime, have alleged that it was a clear case of racial profiling, there were no reasonable grounds for a search, and that officers used unnecessary force. If the police are exonerated, it suggests an act as commonplace as a fist bump can justify a stop and search – at least if the suspect is black. Dijon shared footage of the 27 February incident on Facebook, where it has been viewed more than 200,000 times. His video ends as officers, finding his girlfriend’s bank card in his wallet, arrest him for handling stolen goods. Eventually, they were forced to release him at the scene after speaking to her on the phone. Finally, having detained the brothers for about 40 minutes, they left – with no apology, no explanation and no paperwork. David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, who last year conducted a review of racial disproportionality in the justice system, said the incident was typical of the way police treat black men. The incident coincided with a political row over stop and search and a violent crimewave in the capital that has led to calls for increased use of the power – but black politicians, police and community leaders have warned that overuse of the tactic damages trust. “This is an exemplary case of the hugely damaging impact that stopping and searching innocent young men can have in driving a wedge between the police and the communities they serve,” Lammy said. Dijon said that the incident was merely the latest in a string of difficult interactions he has had with police. “There was no dialogue,” he said. “There was no attempt to get our attention whatsoever, and it shouldn’t be that way.” He works as a youth mentor, and he said it made it hard for him to continue to advise that police were well intentioned. Liam, a professional musician, said he was used to stop and search, but that this incident was different. “I felt ashamed, and I felt disrespected and I felt threatened; and it felt like it was a toe-to-toe situation,” he said, explaining that he feared police would become more violent. “The whole time, in the back of my mind, I was watching them to, if necessary, get ready to weave to the left or the right to protect myself.” “I do want an apology,” Dijon said. “They know what they’ve done on the day, they know how they treated us; they know they profiled us … how can I make them understand that people do look like me – they are tall, they are black, and they have dreads and they have deep voices – but we’re good people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/11/my-parents-think-im-a-failure-ask-annalisa-barbieri","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T14:00:05Z","webTitle":"My parents think I’m a failure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/11/my-parents-think-im-a-failure-ask-annalisa-barbieri","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/11/my-parents-think-im-a-failure-ask-annalisa-barbieri","fields":{"headline":"My parents think I’m a failure","bodyText":"Over the years I have overheard my parents discussing me many times. I’ve heard personal, critical and sometimes nasty things about me and the direction I’ve taken in life. I’m sure the word “failure” has been used. I’m struggling to understand why. I didn’t excel at school – I chose to go down the creative route. My parents don’t share these interests. After uni, I struggled a bit; I decided not to pursue my degree subject as a career. I got part-time work and had little money, which probably wasn’t the idea my parents had of graduate life. I moved back home with no idea what to do. I had no social life or hobbies, and I was confused and I coasted. I can understand my parents not thinking very highly of me then. Eventually I found out about a job that sounded just what I wanted – but it meant trying to break into an industry in which I had no experience. When I told my parents, they were sceptical. I moved to a new city with only casual work and benefits to live on. It wasn’t easy, but eventually I got a fantastic job. Unfortunately, after careful consideration I decided it wasn’t the career for me. I’m comfortable with my decision and proud of what I achieved, but while my parents appreciate some of this, they are disappointed. I moved back home again, but it’s not like last time. I’ve grown up and gained more confidence. I am starting a new job, but I’ll be working part-time, at least at first. When I overheard my parents, they said this was not the career they would have wanted for me and that I was “immature”. I cry when I overhear these things, then get myself together. I don’t let on I’ve heard. I’m in my late 20s and each time something like this happens, a part of me feels like a lonely, despairing child again. I hope to move out soon. We are a family who suppress emotions, and bringing this up with my parents seems pointless since there is no “truth” to uncover; I already know what they think. It’s horrible to overhear yourself being spoken about negatively, and doubly so when it’s your parents, because, no matter how grown up, many people still crave their parents’ approval. You also have no way to redress things without admitting you overheard, which immediately makes you feel like the bad guy. So, I started off appalled for you and cross at your parents, which is great for sympathy, not so good for helping you out; but then, speaking to a psychotherapist, Chris Mills, helped me see some of your parents’ point of view. “I have sympathies on both sides here,” he said. “Parents should be able to discuss their children in private, because sometimes there are things that need to be talked through. But some things are not for the children’s ears and shouldn’t be overheard. I don’t think all discussion is for all the family.” You only go back to your parents when something goes wrong, so perhaps that’s the only side of you they see. This may be a factor. “I wonder,” Mills thought, “if there are unresolved issues with your parents that go back a long way; and you’ve been struggling to find your feet – the two may be connected. But although you’ve had a number of false starts, each time you’ve gone back to your parents – and they have been supportive and allowed you to do that.” Most parents want to see their children thrive, Mills said, “so maybe they’re frustrated”. They are, after all, older parents who are very insular. They may come from a time when people had one job for life, and that’s what success means to them. But you are on the brink of a new job and I think it’s imperative you leave home – for the last time – and soon. And I think there’s something else for you to consider here. Sometimes, when children (now adult) didn’t get what they wanted from their early home life, they continue to go back to look for the missing piece. You also need to look at that – why you keep going back. “I think it’s time,” Mills said, “to initiate a more adult dialogue with your parents. Not to look for reassurance from them, but to inhabit your own adult self more confidently by offering them reassurance instead. Say something like, ‘You’ve been great, but this is my plan now.’” And then move out, once and for all. • Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

The one between us on her dining table – an ostrich egg from Germany – is a case in point. Bany saw several of them collecting dust on the top shelf of a supermarket. “I don’t speak very good German,” she admits, “but eventually someone understood me and helped me choose this perfect egg.” Outsized eggs are just one inspiration for Bany, whose live-work space is a serene haven in an industrial area in Seven Sisters, north London. In the year they have lived here, Bany and her partner, Tycjan Knut, have transformed the place. “We did the work really quickly,” she says. “Everything was painted. The sofa, dining table and bed frame were all made by us. The kitchen and shelves, too. The Ikea cupboards are the only things we haven’t made.” This is the couple’s first home together. Knut, a painter, moved from Warsaw to join Bany, whose sculpted objects are sold by the New Craftsmen (a luxury craft and homewares shop in Mayfair) and increasingly sought after. Last year, Bany’s work was recognised by Elle Deco as a “future collectible”. “This was our best decision ever,” says Knut. “In Warsaw, we never lived and worked in the same place. We spent many nights talking about being able to make it happen.” “The whole reason for the move was to stop working late nights in a cold studio, feeling a bit hungry,” Bany adds. “We still work a lot – sometimes until 3am – and the weekend is an abstract concept to us, but at least here we are moderately comfortable and more efficient with our time. It’s important.” The flat is on the first floor of a red-brick warehouse (there’s a car mechanic on the ground floor). The open-plan space is divided into kitchen, dining, living and sleeping quarters and there are two more rooms: a bright, north-facing studio for Knut and his canvases, and a room for Bany and her sculpting equipment: cardboard and foam casts, modelling tools and vats of Jesmonite – the rapid-setting composite material from which her smooth, solid objects are created. Bany studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, the Falmouth School of Art and the Slade before segueing into sculpture and design. “I wanted to make something purely for art’s sake but reminiscent of something that you handle, something that you are meant to touch and use.” Her Pilotis range is inspired by modernist support columns. “It became a personal challenge to take one simple shape and make as many variations of that as possible,” Bany explains. The range includes a console table, side table and table-top platter. Each piece is minimal and utilitarian, and the proportions are altered according to usage. “I think of form first. The struggle is to apply the function.” Bany sands or carves the space around her objects from blue foam with modelling tools. Jesmonite is then poured into the negative space. Once this has set, the foam is removed and the solid object revealed. Unique and irresistibly tactile, her smaller pieces are like polished pebbles, while her textured Acacia range has the appearance of calcified stone. Once the Jesmonite has set, imperfections are filled in and smoothed away before a coat of varnish is applied. It’s a painstaking process, as tiny motes can cling to the varnish before it’s fully dried. “This is why our home is so plain and simple,” says Bany. “We don’t have sinks in our studios, so we are constantly walking back and forth through the flat. We need a good passageway from the studios to the kitchen, and we can’t have too much fabric or clutter, because things will just get dusty. It’s finding that balance between a working environment and a restful area. It has to be both.” “We don’t have much storage, so we are restrained with possessions,” says Bany, inspecting some of the items on her open-kitchen shelves, including Japanese ceramics, a collection of delicate glasses made by their friend, the east London-based glass blower Jochen Holz, and a set of mead goblets she found in a charity shop in Cornwall. The artwork on display is by friends and family members, including Tycjan’s father, the artist, Mieczyslaw Knut. “He painted this one especially for me,” says Bany, pointing out a two-tone white canvas that hangs above a cupboard. “I probably should admit I mainly buy or own white things and off-white things. This is just true, really.” “We don’t shop much,” Knut adds. “We just have our eyes open all the time. When we see possibility in something, we get it and work on it.” Bany agrees: “I wouldn’t know where to go to find a good sofa.” The sofa they have was constructed from two layers or foam, a piece of stretched fabric and several sheets of plywood. “It’s a massive piece of furniture inspired by Donald Judd,” says Bany. “It’s deep so it provides both shelter and privacy.” A place to hide from the studio door, perhaps, if only while the varnish dries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/24/trump-macron-dandruff-diplomacy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T17:22:13Z","webTitle":"Trump gave Macron a taste of his bizarre 'dandruff diplomacy' | Arwa Mahdawi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/24/trump-macron-dandruff-diplomacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/24/trump-macron-dandruff-diplomacy","fields":{"headline":"Trump gave Macron a taste of his bizarre 'dandruff diplomacy'","bodyText":"You’ve got to hand it to Trump. The president may be a global joke but he has an uncanny knack of always making sure he has the last laugh. Today’s exercise in dandruff diplomacy vis-à-vis France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, being a shining example. Macron is currently at the White House, a trip which marks Trump’s first state visit from a foreign leader. The pair have gotten together to discuss Iran and Syria and, also, it would appear, so that Trump can put Macron very firmly in his place. “They’re all saying what a great relationship we have, and they’re actually correct,” Trump gushed to the camera as the pair posed for photos. “It’s not fake news. Finally, it’s not fake news. It’s a great honor, a great honor that you’re here, in fact I’ll get that little piece of dandruff, that little piece …” Trump said. He then made a very public show of brushing invisible dandruff off Macron’s shoulder. “We have to make him perfect. He is perfect.” Meanwhile, Macron grinned and appeared somewhat lost for words as he subjected himself to this humiliation. One suspects Trump has been planning this power play for a while. While the pair may have a “great relationship”, Trump and Macron have also been jostling to prove to each other who is more dominant. This started last year, when Trump met Macron for the first and the pair shared a very awkward handshake; a White House pool reporter described it as being of “considerable intensity, their knuckles turning white and their jaws clenching and faces tightening”. For a moment it looked like the handshake might go on and on until one of them exploded, but Trump eventually let go first. Macron was clearly very proud of himself for his stamina; he later told the the Journal du Dimanche newspaper: “My handshake with him – it wasn’t innocent … we must show that we will not make small concessions, even symbolic.” Trump’s dandruff-flicking, it could be argued, also wasn’t innocent. It may have been a hilarious moment but it is also a product of Trump’s somewhat terrifying ideas about diplomacy. Back in the 1980s, Trump apparently lobbied the George HW Bush administration for a job leading nuclear negotiations with the Soviet Union. Richard Burt, who actually had some experience in the whole diplomacy thing, ended up getting the job instead. According to the New Yorker, Trump later bumped into Burt at a wedding and proceeded to tell the guy, who he didn’t know, all about how he would have handled negotiations with the Soviets. He’d have welcomed the delegation very warmly and made sure they were sitting very comfortably down at the table. Then, Trump apparently said, he would have got up, yelled “Fuck you!” and left. Burt rather charitably told the New Yorker he thought there was a sort of theory behind this. “Trump loves the chaos … to mouth off and get people off balance,” he said. “He wants to destabilize them, get them out of their comfort zone, then try to dictate the terms. By doing that, he believes he can get the upper hand. It’s the triumph of technique over substance.” It could also be possible, of course, that Trump has zero impulse control and says and does whatever pops into his mind. Nevertheless, even if there is no method to the man’s madness, it certainly gets people out of their comfort zone. For the sake of international stability, let’s just hope that Trump is satisfied with his little dandruff jibe and tonight’s official dinner doesn’t descend into a tweetstorm about the relative size of the two men’s buttons."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/24/maria-sharapova-drop-out-top-50-caroline-garcia-defeat","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T17:23:42Z","webTitle":"Maria Sharapova to drop out of top 50 after Caroline Garcia defeat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/24/maria-sharapova-drop-out-top-50-caroline-garcia-defeat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/24/maria-sharapova-drop-out-top-50-caroline-garcia-defeat","fields":{"headline":"Maria Sharapova to drop out of top 50 after Caroline Garcia defeat","bodyText":"Maria Sharapova will drop out of the world’s top 50 after suffering a fourth defeat in succession. The five-times grand slam winner lost in three sets to Caroline Garcia in the first round of the Stuttgart Open and has now not won since the second round of the Australian Open. Garcia staged a strong fightback to prevail 3-6, 7-6 (6), 6-4 in two hours 44 minutes for her first victory over the former world No 1 at her fifth attempt. “It was a very close match. I know she is a fighter and it would be difficult until the end,” the French sixth seed, who saved two match points in the second set, said. Sharapova, who came back from a 15-month doping ban at this tournament last April, won the first set with ease but the 31-year-old could not prevent a determined Garcia from dragging herself back into the contest through a tiebreak. A 10th double fault by Sharapova at 4-4 gave Garcia the crucial break in the decider and the world No 7 clinched the contest on her serve in the next game. “I was a little more aggressive today and I returned a bit better. Finally I can say that after seven years I have beaten her. It’s an important win,” Garcia added. Up next for Garcia is the Ukrainian teenager Marta Kostyuk who beat Antonia Lottner 6-4, 6-1. The 15-year-old qualified for the main draw by overcoming France’s Alizé Cornet on Monday. “I can’t say I’m super-surprised, because that’s what I work for, and I know I can play at this level,” Kostyuk said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/shortcuts/2018/apr/24/finland-given-up-on-the-basic-income-dream","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T15:42:45Z","webTitle":"Money problems: why Finland has given up on the basic income dream","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2018/apr/24/finland-given-up-on-the-basic-income-dream","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/shortcuts/2018/apr/24/finland-given-up-on-the-basic-income-dream","fields":{"headline":"Money problems: why Finland has given up on the basic income dream","bodyText":"When the Finnish government embarked on a trial of basic income it was lauded as bold, evidence-focused and innovative. The country became something of a standard bearer in a worldwide push towards basic income projects. In failing to commit to widening the scope of the trial in 2019 beyond its current group, however, that reputation is under threat. Universal basic income (UBI) in its purest form is a payment that every citizen receives on a regular basis, without condition and as of right, in and out of work. Universal credit is paid on a household basis, is means tested and conditional, for example on recipients proving that they are actively searching for and accepting offers of work. The Finnish trial is not universal, as only 2,000 unemployed people were selected for it, but it is a basic income. Developing an understanding of basic income is a marathon, not a sprint. As 2019 parliamentary elections approach in Finland, it would appear that boldness is being replaced by timidity and politics. We know from past experiments that basic income has significant merits. While basic income is in vogue now, it is not new. When the data from a 1970s trial in Dauphin in Canada was crunched, the positive impacts on health, education and wellbeing were clear. Research from 2018 on Alaska’s dividend scheme suggested that universal payments do not undermine work, as critics have claimed. With economic security further under threat by technological changes, new sources of economic security could become necessary: UBI is one. Developing a fully implementable and affordable national UBI scheme will take time. It is one reason the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce has proposed a basic opportunity dividend of up to £10,000 a person in any given 10-year period to provide people with the security to make different choices in their lives. This would be a stepping stone towards UBI. But trials are essential, too – which is why it is encouraging that the Scottish government is looking at hosting some. Hopefully, the next Finnish government will review the evidence when it comes to renewing or extending the basic income trial after the election – the world is watching."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/25/brexit-blamed-record-number-eu-nurses-give-up-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T23:01:31Z","webTitle":"Brexit blamed as record number of EU nurses give up on Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/25/brexit-blamed-record-number-eu-nurses-give-up-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/25/brexit-blamed-record-number-eu-nurses-give-up-britain","fields":{"headline":"Brexit blamed as record number of EU nurses give up on Britain","bodyText":"Record numbers of nurses and midwives from EU27 countries quit Britain last year, fuelling fears that a Brexit brain drain will deepen the NHS’s already chronic staffing crisis. A total of 3,962 such staff from the European Economic Area (EEA) left the Nursing and Midwifery Council register between 2017 and 2018. The register tracks who is eligible to work in those areas of healthcare in the UK. The number of departures was 28% more than the 3,081 who left in 2016-17 and three times higher than the 1,311 who did so in 2013-14, the first year the NMC began keeping data on such departures. At the same time, the number of EU nurses and midwives coming to work in the UK has fallen to its lowest level. Just 805 of them joined the NMC register in 2017-18. That total is just 13% of the 6,382 who came over the year before. “It feels that efforts to boost the number of nurses are being dragged down by a botched Brexit,” said Janet Davies, the chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing. The government’s refusal to detail the rights that the 3 million EU citizens living in Britain will have once the UK leaves the EU in March next year is a key cause of the loss of EU staff, she added. “Nurses returning home, or giving Britain a miss entirely, are doing so because their rights are not clear enough.” Brexit emerged as a key reason why EU-trained staff are stopping working in the UK in interviews the NMC conducted with 3,496 people who left the register between June and November 2017. Almost half (47%) of the 227 EEA nurses and midwives who responded agreed that “Brexit has encouraged me to consider working outside the UK”, while 59% said: “I am leaving or have left the UK.” The NMC figures bear out the much greater difficulty hospital trusts are having recruiting nurses from Europe, particularly from countries where many have come from in recent years – notably Italy, Portugal and Spain. There are now 35,115 EEA nurses and midwives on the NMC register, who together make up 5.1% of the 690,278 staff known to the regulator. That is 2,909 fewer than 2016-17. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: “These figures are yet more worrying evidence of the huge impact that the government’s shambolic approach to Brexit is having for our NHS. The government should have made clear straight after the referendum that these staff were valued and welcome but instead ministers dithered and delayed and now we see a huge fall in the number of staff coming to work here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/29/mps-call-for-crackdown-on-russian-oligarchs-using-city-to-avoid-sanctions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T16:39:06Z","webTitle":"MPs call for crackdown on Russian oligarchs using City to avoid sanctions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/29/mps-call-for-crackdown-on-russian-oligarchs-using-city-to-avoid-sanctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/29/mps-call-for-crackdown-on-russian-oligarchs-using-city-to-avoid-sanctions","fields":{"headline":"MPs call for crackdown on Russian oligarchs using City to avoid sanctions","bodyText":"Labour has called on ministers to toughen the scrutiny and regulation of City flotations as a matter of urgency following the controversial $7bn (£5bn) London flotation of En+, a Russian metals group controlled by oligarch Oleg Deripaska. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, called on the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to introduce serious measures against oligarchs and consider “tightening initial considerations around listings” after the US said it would introduce economic sanctions against the Russian billionaire. Deripaska offered on Friday to reduce his stake in En+ to below 50% in an attempt to prevent the newly imposed sanctions from affecting the company, whose shares have plunged since the flotation as Russia’s relations with the west have deteriorated since the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Some UK politicians are concerned as to why the flotation was allowed to go ahead in the first place. McDonnell was joined by the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, who said there should be an inquiry into why En+ was allowed to float in a deal that earned banks, lawyers, auditors and PR firms £25m in fees. Cable said it was “very odd that we will follow Trump into military action, but won’t join in imposing tough sanctions on oligarchs”. On the En+ listing, he said: “There should be a review of this flotation. When Russian oligarchs are using the London markets to raise money we must take a strict line on scrutiny.” Six banks shared an estimated half of the £25m with the largest share taken by the lead bookrunner, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Citigroup, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan and Russian banks Sberbank and VTB Capital would have shared the rest. The remainder was to be shared by lawyers including Linklaters and White &amp; Case with smaller auditors KPMG and financial PR specialists Finsbury. En+ is a holding company for Deripaska’s metal and energy interests. He built his business empire during Russia’s so-called aluminium wars following the post-Soviet privatisations of the 1990s. It floated in London last November, raising $1bn which was used to pay back borrowings owed to VTB, a bank prevented by sanctions from raising capital in the EU and the US. The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), approved the flotation, but a fortnight ago Deripaska was one of 38 Russian business leaders the US Treasury targeted because of “malign activity” on the part of Vladimir Putin’s government. En+’s share price tumbled as a result, and the stock is now priced at $6, less than half the $14 flotation price. A string of independent directors have resigned although the company’s chairman, the former Conservative minister Lord Barker of Battle, remains the firm’s figurehead. Finsbury no longer advises En+, saying its mandate only extended to the listing. Barker persuaded Deripaska to cut his stake according to a statement released on Friday, as part of efforts to protect investor interests. “Following a series of discussions with the company’s independent chairman, Lord Barker of Battle, Mr Oleg Deripaska has agreed in principle to the chairman’s request that Mr Deripaska reduce his shareholding in the Company to below 50%,” En+ said in a regulatory filing. The US Treasury cited Russia’s support for Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, malicious cyber activities, the occupation of Crimea and support for violence in eastern Ukraine as its reasoning for putting the sanctions in place. They were already in preparation when the UK accused Putin’s government of being behind the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury. At the time, Deripaska described the decision to impose sanctions as “very unfortunate but not unexpected”. “Certainly the grounds for putting my name on the list of SDNs [specially designated nationals] as provided by US officials are groundless, ridiculous and absurd,” he said. An FCA spokesperson said the regulator had responded to the Trump administration’s action by delisting a class of En+ shares aimed at US citizens, but that it had no plans to take any further action because the British government had not asked it to. Deripaska is one of Russia’s best connected international businessmen. Paul Manafort, the former head of Donald Trump’s election campaign who is fighting fraud and tax charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller, worked for Deripaska for many years. Criticising the British failure to follow the US example, McDonnell said: “The City of London cannot risk to be seen as a light touch when it comes to imposing effective sanctions on Russia and clamping down on foreign oligarchs linked to the regime. In this case, it looks like once again we have been playing catch-up with regulators in other countries.” EN+ did not respond to a request for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/27/hadrians-wall-roman-cremation-urns-display-perfume-vase-women","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T09:14:23Z","webTitle":"Hadrian's Wall: Roman cremation urns go on display for first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/27/hadrians-wall-roman-cremation-urns-display-perfume-vase-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/27/hadrians-wall-roman-cremation-urns-display-perfume-vase-women","fields":{"headline":"Hadrian's Wall: Roman cremation urns go on display for first time","bodyText":"The remains of a child who lived in the shadow of Hadrian’s Wall, and a woman who may have been the mother, will go on display for the first time in an exhibition at Birdoswald Roman Fort. The cremated remains were found with enigmatic grave goods including a piece of iron-ring-mail Roman armour. “We don’t know the relationship between the two but we can be sure that there was one,” said Frances McIntosh, curator of Roman collections. “The cremated remains of a young child were buried first, but when the pit was dug for the urn containing the remains of the woman it was very deliberately overlaid and partly cut into the earlier burial pit. “Visitors still often come to Hadrian’s Wall expecting that it was entirely the realm of burly, hobnailed, sandal-wearing, Latin-speaking Roman soldiers – but the picture was far less simple than that. We know that there were many women here, and children too, and the new display is an opportunity to bring them out of the shadows.” The two urns were discovered in 2009 in a burial ground just outside the walls of the fort, which stands on land cleared to build Hadrian’s Wall. McIntosh wonders if the piece of mail, an unusual object to find buried with a woman, suggests that she and the child, aged about five – the age was calculated from a tooth that survived the cremation process – were the family of a legionary stationed on the wall. Ordinary Roman soldiers were not officially allowed to marry until AD197 – 75 years after construction started on Hadrian’s Wall – but many finds, including tombstones of wives and children, suggest that a blind eye was often turned. The museum at the site of Corbridge – a settlement which predated the wall, but became a prosperous town with a large civilian population, the most northern town in the Roman empire – has also been redisplayed to widen the picture of life on and near the wall. The site is known for the hoard of military objects including armour, bundles of spearheads still tied together, textiles and leatherwork, found in an iron-bound chest in the 1960s. Now children’s games and toys, and a beautiful, blue, enamel copper perfume vase, which must have belonged to a woman of high status and was found in a cremation burial from the early second century, are among the objects going on display for the first time.

Idlib is the last major territory still in rebel hands. It is partly held by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadi group that Russia and the Syrian government regard as a legitimate target in an area where civilians and fighters continue to pour in as part of evacuation deals in other parts of the country. Jan Egeland, the head of the UN’s humanitarian task force for Syria, said: “All my energies currently and in the coming weeks are dedicated to averting a fresh humanitarian disaster.” He described Idlib as “one giant area of displacement”. “More than half of the population in Idlib of 2 million have already been displaced, sometimes multiple times, so there has to be a negotiated end to the conflict in Idlib. You cannot have a war in the midst of the largest cluster of refugee camps and displaced people in the world,” he said. “My fear is the Syrian government will say the place is filled with ‘terrorists’ and therefore you can wage war like they did during the sieges in Aleppo and eastern Ghouta … Yes, there are bad guys wearing beards, but there are many more women and children and they deserve protection. You cannot wage war as if everyone is a terrorist, or else will it be a nightmare.” His remarks were echoed by the UN’s special envoy on Syria, Staffan de Mistura, who said: “We hope this would be an occasion for making sure that Idlib does not become new Aleppo, the new eastern Ghouta, because the dimensions are completely different.” A Syrian government assault on the area is likely to lead to the mass movement of people, possibly toward the Turkish border. Up to 300,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) have reached Idlib province since August, and 700,000 have been displaced across Syria since the start of the year, according to UN figures. Egeland said: “The Syrian civil war has lasted two years longer than the second world war, and far from 2017 and early 2018 becoming a moment when the war wound down, the crisis has escalated. “I really thought 2017 would be the last huge war year, but the crisis has continued at the same ferocity into 2018. This has become a tremendous marathon of pain.” The two-day donor conference in Brussels, which is focused as much on the 5 million refugees displaced in neighbouring Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon as the 6 million IDPs in Syria, is the third in a series that began in the UK in 2016. Ministers from Jordan and Lebanon repeatedly warned that the situation was putting a huge strain on their economies and social fabric. About 135,000 Syrian children have been born in Lebanon since the civil war began. Specific pledges will be revealed on Wednesday, with western countries putting pressure on the Gulf states to commit more than in the past. On the first day of the conference, which was dedicated to hearing the views of the huge number of NGOs delivering food and education, the UN’s undersecretary for humanitarian affairs, Mark Lowcock, said 80% of Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries were living in poverty and nearly 35% of child refugees were out of school. Jordan’s planning minister, Imad Fakhoury, said the 1.3 million Syrian refugees in his country were costing $1.5bn, 16% of Jordanian spending and 4% of GDP. Jordan’s economy has grown by only 2% a year in the last seven years, down from 6% in 2000-10. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the chief executive of Save the Children, said education was the key children needed to open the door to a better life. Neither the Syrian government nor the official opposition are attending the conference. Egeland said: “Until three weeks ago, it appeared as if Syrian donor fatigue was kicking in … the whole humanitarian relief programme was only 7% funded for 2018, a catastrophic underfunding. In the last few weeks, the funding has tripled, if only taking it to 23%. We now have only $795m of the $3.5bn that will be needed for inside Syria.” Another $5.6bn was needed to help refugees in neighbouring countries in 2018, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/shortcuts/2018/apr/25/crazy-rich-asians-can-the-romcom-be-a-gamechanger-for-representation","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T15:22:57Z","webTitle":"Crazy Rich Asians: can the romcom be a gamechanger for representation?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2018/apr/25/crazy-rich-asians-can-the-romcom-be-a-gamechanger-for-representation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/shortcuts/2018/apr/25/crazy-rich-asians-can-the-romcom-be-a-gamechanger-for-representation","fields":{"headline":"Crazy Rich Asians: can the romcom be a gamechanger for representation?","bodyText":"I have been on my toes in anticipation for Crazy Rich Asians since Entertainment Weekly put the film’s stars, Constance Wu and Henry Golding, on its cover in November. It is 25 years since Wayne Wang’s Chinese-American family saga The Joy Luck Club and, ever since, Hollywood has largely avoided commissioning south-east Asian (SEA) and east Asian (EA) stories. But the movie’s seductive, funny trailer suggests it will mark an important moment for both communities’ presence in the mainstream. Directed by John M Chu, adapting Kevin Kwan’s bestselling book, the film portrays the opulent lives of affluent south-east Asians through the conventional, commercial lens of romantic comedy. The all-Asian cast is led by Wu, best known for her role in US sitcom Fresh Off the Boat, playing an economics professor who travels with boyfriend Nick (British-Malaysian actor Golding) to Singapore for his best friend’s wedding only to discover he is the son of the richest families in town (“The Prince William of Asia”, as she calls him). Rachel has to navigate the Dynasty-like world of Singapore’s wealthy elite, and avoid the sharp tongue of Nick’s mother, Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh), who, in the words of Rachel’s brazen friend, played by the comedian Awkwafina, is just like an “unrefined banana: yellow on the outside, white on the inside”. As a half-Chinese woman born in pre-handover Hong Kong, role models of my own ethnicity were extremely limited in mainstream cinema. Disney’s Mulan from 1998 (which is currently being made into a live-action feature), remains an important, if flawed, part of my upbringing. The persistent lack of SEA/EA stories and ongoing negative pastiches and stereotypes – which I discovered working in the arts – led producers to deem our stories as “too risky”. However, in recent years, these issues have begun to be addressed. Public debates around whitewashing and the stereotyping and marginalisation of minorities on screen and stage, are finally having an impact. On this site, Yuan Ren spoke of the damaging “depiction of Chinese men as sexually impaired”, a stereotype I am happy to report seems to have been exchanged in this film for smart and sexy (we see several impressively toned torsos of our Asian male leads in the trailer). But Crazy Rich Asians has not been without controversy. There has been criticism of the casting of Golding, who some claimed “wasn’t Asian enough” (the actor was forced to defend his own heritage), while criticism of its representation of people in Singapore persists. Regardless, excitement surrounding the trailer has drowned out most of those negative voices. In the UK, we still have a long way to go. Back in December, there was a virulent backlash against BBC Three’s comedy pilot Chinese Burn, which, despite its best intentions, managed to reinforce the stereotypes it claimed to break down. In contrast, US television has led the way in increasing EA/SEA representation, with shows that give us unique and diverse stories, and prioritise the casting of east Asian or south-east Asian actors. Just to name a few: Dr Ken, Selfie, Master of None, Into the Badlands, Andi Mack, and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. As a great fan of romcoms, I am similarly enthused by the potential of Crazy Rich Asians, even if the film does not end up fully delivering as the beacon of change the community has hoped for."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/24/the-guardian-view-on-millicent-garrett-fawcett-she-deserves-her-place-in-parliament-square","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T17:14:26Z","webTitle":"Millicent Garrett Fawcett - The Guardian view: she deserves her place in Parliament Square","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/24/the-guardian-view-on-millicent-garrett-fawcett-she-deserves-her-place-in-parliament-square","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/24/the-guardian-view-on-millicent-garrett-fawcett-she-deserves-her-place-in-parliament-square","fields":{"headline":"Millicent Garrett Fawcett - The Guardian view: she deserves her place in Parliament Square","bodyText":"It was a joyous occasion in London’s Parliament Square on Tuesday when Gillian Wearing’s sculpture of Millicent Garrett Fawcett was unveiled, marking the latter’s contribution not just to the extension of the franchise, but to other causes for which she energetically worked: women’s education, rights for sex workers, and challenging the brutal conditions in Britain’s concentration camps in the Boer war, among others. The position of the new statue is important. Flanked by the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey and Whitehall, and with Buckingham Palace a stone’s throw away, Parliament Square represents the heart of British power and the establishment. (It has been, too, the site of some of Britain’s most remarkable acts of dissent, notably Brian Haw’s extraordinary decade-long peace camp erected in protest against the Iraq war.) The square is also the home of 11 – now 12 – sculptures of notable people. Until this week, they were all of men: Disraeli, Churchill, Palmerston, Gandhi, Canning, Derby, Smuts, Lincoln, Mandela, Peel and Lloyd George. What tempered the optimism of the day was that it has taken so long for this domination of the male in Parliament Square to have been broken, as London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, noted in his speech at the unveiling. That it happened at all is down to the campaigner Caroline Criado Perez, who had already successfully made the case for a portrait of Jane Austen to appear on the Bank of England £10 note (Scotland, meanwhile, has two women on its new polymer banknotes, poet Nan Shepherd and scientist Mary Somerville). Fawcett would have recognised Ms Criado Perez’s techniques: she started with a petition, just as did Fawcett when she began working on women’s suffrage. It is true that quite often public statues are not especially successful as sculpture, and British cities are littered with some wince-inducing specimens. It is true that there may be better ways of honouring memories than putting up a statue. (One thinks of Jeremy Deller’s moving centenary memorial to the soldiers of the Somme on 1 June 2016, in which young men, dressed in first world war uniforms, quietly gathered in public places up and down the UK.) It is true that sculptures of past worthies can fade into the background of an urban experience, rather than forming its focus – half-remembered military men, many of them the representing beliefs that would hardly be applauded today, abound in the UK’s municipal spaces. But as Mr Khan argued, statues do provide a barometer of the values of a time and a place. Putting them up – and taking them down – can become acts freighted with significance, arousing fierce passions. In the American south, the erection of confederate statues during the era of the civil rights movement reflected a desire to uphold notions of white supremacy. Footage of the toppling of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in April 2003 flashed around the world – at the time, it was invoked as symbol of the swift victory of the US and its allies, but later came to signify the bathetic overreach of their ambition. Recent arguments over the commemoration of Cecil Rhodes have been bitter. Whether to commemorate Sylvia Pankhurst – suffragette, anti-colonialist, radical – in a sculpture in London is the subject of a current debate. The sculptures that adorn our public spaces matter. It is time for women – and not just the semi-naked women who are sculpted as allegories for Justice or Peace – to become part of the grammar of our streets. Ms Wearing’s accomplished bronze makes a good start."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"media/2018/apr/24/daily-express-editor-gary-jones-calls-its-front-pages-downright-offensive","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T18:09:36Z","webTitle":"Daily Express editor calls its front pages 'downright offensive'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/24/daily-express-editor-gary-jones-calls-its-front-pages-downright-offensive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/apr/24/daily-express-editor-gary-jones-calls-its-front-pages-downright-offensive","fields":{"headline":"Daily Express editor calls its front pages 'downright offensive'","bodyText":"The Daily Express editor has said some of his newspaper’s past front pages have been “downright offensive”, made him feel “very uncomfortable” and contributed to an “Islamophobic sentiment” in the media. Gary Jones, who took over at the newspaper last month, said he was unhappy with some of its previous coverage and would be looking to change the tone of the Express. “Each and every editor has a responsibility for every single word that’s published in a newspaper,” he told the home affairs select committee, which is investigating the treatment of minority groups in print media. “Cumulatively, some of the headlines that have appeared in the past have created an Islamophobic sentiment which I find uncomfortable,” said Jones, who is also the editor of the Sunday Express. “It is my responsibility to ensure content is accurate and newspapers don’t look at stereotypical views that may or may not be around in the general public. I should be held to account and be answerable.” Jones, who was previously the editor of the Sunday Mirror and the Sunday People, replaced Hugh Whittow this year after Richard Desmond sold his Northern and Shell newspapers to Trinity Mirror in a £200m deal. The Daily and Sunday Express have been relentless in their support for Brexit and campaigning for reduced immigration. “I’ve gone through a lot of former Express front pages and I felt very uncomfortable looking at them,” Jones told MPs. “There have been accuracy issues on some of them, and some of them are just downright offensive. I wouldn’t want to be party to any newspaper that would publish such material. “I have to accept as a newspaper editor that people have different views to my own and a newspaper is there to represent the broader section of views. But I think there are limits as to how far you should go in an honest and fair-minded society.” The Sun’s managing editor, Paul Clarkson, also appeared in front of MPs and dismissed suggestions that newspapers have a problem with Islamophobia. “In the mainstream media, I don’t believe it is an issue,” he said. The Labour MP Naz Shah held up a Sun front page with the headline “1 in 5 Brit Muslims’ sympathy for jihadis”, which was ruled to be misleading by the press regulator Ipso, and criticised the paper’s record on covering British Muslims. “You chose to present an outright lie as a fact because it supports your editorial narrative, which undeniably stirs up hatred against Muslims,” she said. Clarkson apologised for mistakes in that report, but insisted it was not part of a wider pattern and said the paper’s coverage had changed. He said a large number of complaints in the media about the Sun’s coverage were made by “politically motivated or other kinds of interest groups”, and said the newspaper never received praise when it ran stories that showed Muslims in a positive light. Peter Wright, representing the publisher of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, also denied his newspapers were Islamophobic. “There is no anti-Muslim agenda. It doesn’t exist,” he said. “If we were trying to incite racial hatred, it would be appearing on our front page. Stories inciting hatred against Muslims do not appear on our front page.” He said newspapers had toned down some of their language in recent years, but claimed Hindu and Sikh communities had complained to the Mail about the newspaper using “Asian” instead of “Muslim” in copy. Wright also downplayed the influence of newspapers on Islamophobia in society. “I don’t know where people have got their views from. We’re told these days, they get them all from social media,” he said. “I’m afraid I think social media is a dreadful cesspit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/03/how-to-make-the-perfect-rhubarb-crumble","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T11:00:41Z","webTitle":"How to make the perfect rhubarb crumble","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/03/how-to-make-the-perfect-rhubarb-crumble","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/03/how-to-make-the-perfect-rhubarb-crumble","fields":{"headline":"How to make the perfect rhubarb crumble","bodyText":"If the proof of the pudding is in the eating, then crumble is comfortingly solid evidence that the best desserts aren’t delicate or even pretty: this isn’t a dish to stun social media, but it will momentarily silence the table. I can confidently say I’ve never, even in the darkest days of school dinners, met anyone who doesn’t like crumble. Of course, you can stash just about any fruit you like under that buttery, sugary topping – though as Jesse Dunford Wood notes in his book Modern British Food, not all are appropriate – but the natural astringency of rhubarb, an underrated vegetable-identifying-as-a-fruit that fills the hungry gap between autumn apples and the first summer fruits, is the perfect complement, and a time-honoured partner for a jug of custard. (Dunford Wood also has strong opinions about the correct accompaniments to the crumble. He correctly identifies custard as the ideal). When I asked for recipe recommendations for this column, someone scornfully responded, “Who uses a recipe for crumble?” They’re right: anyone can make a decent rhubarb crumble. But how do you make a perfect one? The rhubarb Rhubarb is the only fruit, or thing passing as a fruit, that sticks with us through the long, grey British winter, its candy-pink canes popping up in warm, dark sheds in Yorkshire, among other places, while the ground outside is still frozen solid – the sturdier, greener outdoor variety takes its place this month, and will continue to flourish, getting ever more monstrous in size, until the autumn. Cookery writers and chefs, including the great Jane Grigson, tend to be snooty about outdoor rhubarb – “fat and stringy monsters, mostly all green and with just the faint remembrance of pink”, as Simon Hopkinson memorably puts it in Second Helpings Of Roast Chicken – but I suspect that’s as much to do with its unremarkable looks as its flavour. The spindly, blushing-pink stalks of January and February are easy for the camera to love, while the olive trunks as thick as a terrier’s ankle are far less Instagram-friendly. They still taste great, however – and, as one of the easiest things to grow in pots that I know, deserve a bit more love from us ingrates in the food media. Whichever you happen upon (and if you’re reading this at the time of publication, it’s likely to be the first of the outdoor crop), it will give off a lot of liquid as it cooks; rhubarb just does. Some recipes seek to remedy this by pre-baking it (as in Rukmini Iyer’s aptly named book The Roasting Tin), or tossing it with cornflour to help absorb the liquid, as Jane Baxter suggests in the Riverford Farm Cook Book. The cornflour gives the filling an unexpectedly thick, almost gummy quality, while the part-baked rhubarb begins to caramelise around the edges by the end of cooking. Plus, it strikes us as we tuck in, what on Earth is wrong with rhubarb juice anyway? Surely one of the great joys of a rhubarb crumble is the chance to watch science in action as that sour, pinkish syrup turns your custard into a curdled mess. If you’re less keen, I’d advise following Iyer’s advice and baking the filling, covered in foil, for 15 minutes before adding the topping. You’ll need to sweeten the filling somehow, but don’t go overboard: the key to success is to maintain the contrast between tangy fruit and sweet topping. The neutral sweetness of white sugar is ideal here, to allow the rhubarb to shine, but seeing as I’m using demerara in the topping, it makes sense to stick with that here, too. … is not the only fruit For some reason, rhubarb has gained a reputation as a fruit that pairs well with strawberries. I’m instinctively repulsed by the idea, but after reading in the Riverford book that “Jane used to think that cooking strawberries was an abomination, but this combination came as a very pleasant surprise”, I’m prepared to give it a whirl. Turns out it’s not just me: everyone hates it. Perhaps it’s just too early in the season, but the baked strawberries have an odd, mushy texture, and very little flavour at all. Always nice to have one’s prejudices confirmed. The apple and rhubarb combination suggested by Anna Jones in her first book, A Modern Way To Cook, proves more popular, though using them in a 1:1 ratio means the softer rhubarb has a tendency to get lost among the more solid chunks of apple. If you must mix your fruits, however, this is probably the best option. The flavourings One thing that does go with rhubarb is ginger: Iyer grates fresh root into her filling, and also adds orange zest and juice, as does Jones. I like the ginger in particular, but some testers find it a bit fiery, so I’m going to leave it out, while recommending anyone who enjoys the warming heat of ginger should be brave enough to give it a try. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall recommends pairing rhubarb with sweet cicely: “As well as adding a lovely, aromatic edge to a dish, the aniseedy leaves make tart fruits seem sweeter, which means you can use less sugar.” Sadly, I don’t happen to have any in the garden, but if you do, this might also be a good option. I’m less sure about Gregg Wallace’s rhubarb and port idea, but if anyone else has time to try it, I’d love to hear your thoughts. The topping Dunford Wood may be right in thinking that tropical fruits have no place in a crumble, but he loses some credibility with his attempts to take back control by cooking the two elements separately: “fewer soggy crumble issues and more consistency with the fruity filling, I find.” This is disappointing indeed: as Baxter’s second rule of crumble states, “Never cook the two parts separately or deconstruct the crumble in any way. This is an abomination.” (Like cooked strawberries, in fact.) Delicious as Dunford Wood’s biscuity, crunchy, honey-sweet topping is, it lacks the wonderfully soggy layer that forms as the fruit steams beneath; one of the hallmarks of a proper crumble, we all agree. If you want a fancy, restaurant-style dish, by all means follow his lead, but make sure you serve it with crème anglaise, rather than besmirching the noble name of Bird’s with such foolishness. (And if you want your crumble in a hurry, Anna Jones’ super-quick pan version, which can be put together in less than 15 minutes, is an excellent version.) Many recipes add oats or ground almonds to their crumble mixtures. Both have their fans – and their downsides. Too many chewy, stodgy oats, and the topping becomes a flapjack; more ground almonds than flour, and it falls apart at the first touch of the spoon (though the American website Chef Steps has a clever, flour-free version using ground almonds and egg yolks that may be of interest to coeliacs). The sweetness of almonds does go well with rhubarb, however, so I’ll be using a smaller proportion, and topping the dish with chopped almonds, an idea stolen from Jones, though I won’t be using coconut oil or sugar as she suggests. Far too exotic. Both dark and light brown sugars have their merits in this context, but we’re all smitten by the crunch of Dunford Wood’s demerara-flecked topping, even if it’s never seen a stick of rhubarb in its life. A proper school-style crumble should be satisfyingly solid, almost craggy, which requires a generous amount of butter and a splash of water to bring it together; chill it before use to help it clump in the correct fashion. Iyer and Hopkinson both add ground ginger to their crumble mixture, Delia Smith sticks in cinnamon as well, Edd Kimber cardamom and Baxter crushed amaretti, but I think it’s delicious enough on its own. Serve with custard, preferably Bird’s, and preferably with a skin as thick as a rhinoceros hide, or plain ice-cream. Also delicious cold for breakfast. Perfect rhubarb crumble Prep 10 min Chill 10-20 min Cook 40 min Serves 6-8 800g rhubarb 40g demerara or white sugar 25g skin-on almonds, roughly chopped (optional) For the crumble topping 150g plain flour 75g ground almonds 170g chilled, unsalted butter, grated or diced 75g demerara sugar ¼ tsp salt Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas 6. Chop the rhubarb into roughly 3cm lengths and put it in a medium baking dish just big enough to hold it all. Pour over the sugar and toss together well. Put all the ingredients for the topping into a large bowl and rub together until lumpy but fairly well combined. Wet your hands with cold water and briefly mix until you have large clumps of dough. Freeze for 10 minutes or chill for at least 20 minutes and up to 48 hours. Tip the chilled crumble mix over the top of the fruit, shake the baking dish to level it off, then bake for 30 minutes. Scatter over the almonds, and bake for 10 minutes more, until golden. • Is rhubarb crumble up there with the finest British puddings, or does this bring back bad memories of school dinners?

Bush will join the poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy, the Scottish makar, or national poet, Jackie Kay and the novelist Jeanette Winterson in a summer project celebrating the Brontë sisters. All four have been commissioned to write a piece of poetry or prose which will then be engraved on stones positioned over the eight-mile route between the sisters’ birthplace and the family parsonage. Winterson will celebrate the Brontë legacy as a whole, Duffy will celebrate Charlotte, Kay has Anne and Bush has Emily. The Brontë stones project takes place in the bicentenary year of Emily’s birth and, appropriately, the 40th anniversary year of Bush’s Wuthering Heights, the mindblowing song she released when she was just 18 years old. Bush said she was delighted to be involved in the project. “Each sister being remembered by a stone in the enigmatic landscape where they lived and worked is a striking idea. “Emily only wrote the one novel – an extraordinary work of art that has truly left its mark. To be asked to write a piece for Emily’s stone is an honour and, in a way, a chance to say thank you to her.” The writers have been commissioned by Bradford literature festival, which will unveil the stones in July. Getting Bush involved is a real coup. While not, in her words, the “weirdo recluse” she is sometimes portrayed as, Bush avoids the limelight. She rarely gives interviews. When, out of the blue, she announced a series of live shows in 2014, her first for 35 years, the news made headlines around the world. The festival’s director, Syima Aslam, said Bush had been approached with a degree of trepidation. “We saw it as such a good fit, but equally we were, ‘she might just say no’. But you won’t know unless you ask … and she said yes, which was tremendously exciting.” The stones project is the only way Bush will be marking the 40th anniversary of her song. Aslam said the Charlotte stone will be at the house where the Brontës, including their wayward brother Branwell, were born in the village of Thornton. Anne’s stone will be in a meadow beside the parsonage in Haworth, now the Brontë Parsonage Museum, where the family grew up. The Emily and Brontë legacy stones will be in the landscape. Putting the Emily stone on the wild and exposed moors was not a difficult decision to take. “There was no other way of doing it,” said Aslam. “I remember a long time ago being laughed at by a friend as we were driving through the moors and I said, ‘It’s all so bleak, it reminds me of Wuthering Heights’. She just looked at me and laughed.” Aslam said it had been important to get a northern writer to celebrate the Brontë legacy and was thrilled that Winterson said yes. Winterson recalled growing up in Lancashire and roaming the hills in the rain and feeling both passionate and misunderstood. “I read the Brontës and felt their spirit stand by me,” she said. “The Brontës showed me that hearts beat like mine, that the struggle to know who you are happens across time and generations, and gender. “They showed me that writing needs the power of the personal behind it – but that somehow the story one person tells has to become a story many people can claim as their own. And the Brontës are women. As a woman I needed those ancestors, those guides. I still do.” Aslam said the calibre of the writers was important. “It has just been perfect. I could not have asked for anything more. These are writers who will be remembered. As much as the stones will be a way in to the work of the Brontës, they will also be a way into these writers as well.” Michael Stewart, who lives in Thornton, came up with the idea in 2013. He said he had long wanted “my village to receive recognition for its place in the Brontë story … It’s fantastic to see the project come to fruition”.

The judge, Anette Burkø, and two jurors found Peter Madsen, 47, guilty of all three of the main charges of premeditated murder, aggravated sexual assault and desecrating a corpse. “This is a cynical and pre-planned sexual assault of a particularly brutal nature on a random woman who, in connection with her journalistic work, accepted an invitation for a sailing trip on the accused’s submarine,” Burkø said, explaining the rare decision to hand down Denmark’s most severe sentence. Wall’s parents, Ingrid and Joachim Wall, who had followed much of the trial from the courtroom, were not present for the verdict, although the seven family seats were taken by other friends and relatives. Wall was 30 when she died. The journalist had reported from all over the world for Time magazine, the New York Times and the Guardian, among others. Her boyfriend told the court she was “incredibly ambitious” and “amazingly curious”. Madsen looked crushed as he heard the verdict, sitting motionless for close to a minute with his eyes closed and his head bowed, in contrast to his behaviour during the trial, when he had looked frequently around the courtroom. He then left to confer with his defence lawyer, Betina Hald Engmark, who announced on their return that he would appeal. The case has gripped Denmark ever since Wall failed to return from a trip on Madsen’s self-built Nautilus submarine on 10 August. Madsen was a semi-celebrity at the time of his arrest, having made a name for himself with three self-built submarines and two crowdfunded manned space projects. Burkø said his version of events – that Wall died when an accident filled the vessel with toxic exhaust fumes – was “not credible and not consistent with the following decision to dismember the body”. Madsen had changed his explanation for Wall’s death several times, Burkø noted. She said the court instead believed the prosecution’s theory that he had sexually tortured Wall to fulfil a violent sexual fantasy. It is very unusual for a life sentence to be handed down for the murder of a single person in Denmark, where prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment serve an average of 16 years. Madsen admitted to just one of the four charges, mistreatment of a corpse. He confessed in October to dismembering Wall’s body after divers found her head, legs and clothing in Køge Bay, claiming it had been necessary to cut it up in order to remove it from the submarine. Over the course of the 11-day trial, spread over seven weeks, prosecutors presented their case in often horrific detail. But Madsen himself refused to go into detail in court, calling Wall’s death “a very, very traumatic event which I do not want to describe”. When he was arrested in August, Madsen initially claimed to have dropped Wall off on land, but he almost immediately admitted that she had died onboard and that he had then “buried her at sea”. At first, he said her skull had been crushed by a heavy latch, but after the discovery of Wall’s head, he said she had been asphyxiated, claiming to have come up with his first story to spare Wall’s parents. During the trial, the court heard from a woman to whom Madsen had confessed that he was “a psychopath, but a loving one”, a judgment backed up by a forensic psychiatric report that described Madsen as a “perverse polymorph” with “psychopathic traits”. Such was the interest in the trial that the Copenhagen district court opened up a special room with a video link on some days to accommodate as many as 115 journalists from 15 countries. Wall’s parents attended the trial most days and quietly took notes from specially reserved seats beside the media section. Madsen expressed his regret when asked to make a closing statement at the end of the trial. “The only thing I want to say is that I’m very, very sorry for what has happened,” he said. Madsen was also ordered to pay damages to Wall’s boyfriend. • This article was amended on 26 April 2018. An earlier version said Peter Madsen was found guilty of reckless sailing and ordered to pay damages to Wall’s parents."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/29/extra-time-how-smart-exercise-can-keep-you-younger-for-longer","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T08:00:37Z","webTitle":"Extra time: how smart exercise keeps you younger for longer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/29/extra-time-how-smart-exercise-can-keep-you-younger-for-longer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/29/extra-time-how-smart-exercise-can-keep-you-younger-for-longer","fields":{"headline":"Extra time: how smart exercise keeps you younger for longer","bodyText":"Slow down, that used to be the mantra for middle age. The dread half-century reached, fiftysomethings were expected to take up less challenging physical activities – if they were physical at all. A gentle stroll around the golf course, perhaps, rewarded with a gin and tonic at the 19th hole; or membership of the local bowling club, blazered crown green rather than 10-pin. Physical decline as the body aged was inevitable, something to be grumbled about, accepted and dealt with. That fundamental law has not changed, but the way we manage ageing has. Getting older need not mean getting weaker, at least not until the end is truly nigh. “Do not go gentle into that good night,” advises Dylan Thomas. “Old age should burn and rave at close of day;/ Rage, rage against the dying of the light.” Thomas raged over a pint pot, but the rage in this case is high-intensity training, bursts of challenging – yes, painful – exercise interspersed with periods of lesser exertion and rest. We should all be doing this in our later years, except for those whose health makes such exertion dangerous. It is not ageing that causes a decline in fitness; rather, that a decline in fitness causes ageing. This is the simple thesis of Play On: How to Get Better with Age by the American journalist and sports fan Jeff Bercovici. Bercovici, a sometime amateur soccer player, seeks to dispel conventional wisdom about longevity: that life is essentially a dispiriting linear process in which the human machine gradually winds down, clogging here and rusting there before falling into decrepitude. Instead, he argues, we can not only extend our lives by occasionally punishing our bodies but extend our “peak years” of fitness into the autumn and winter of existence. Functionality, rather than a long lifespan, is what matters. To do this, he examines the lives of sportsmen and women whose fitness regime has allowed them to keep performing at the top level into their 30s. Like Roger Federer, 36, the Swiss tennis player who many would say is the greatest exponent of his sport in history, and Serena Williams, his female opposite number, also 36. Beneficiaries of the latest findings in sports science and medicine, these athletes lead the way on a journey that we can all follow, at whatever level of performance. The buzz technique that has gained favour is high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in which bursts of intense activity – such as sprinting and cycling – are interspersed with periods of lower-intensity exercise. You know you are at high intensity when muscles burn and you get out of breath. In other words, it hurts. “Ageing science supports that we should do high intensity every week, getting your heart rate up to at least 80% of its maximum,” says Bercovici. “Even 10 or 20 minutes a week will produce results – that means getting up to the point where it feels unpleasant. It should be a feeling that you can’t keep this up much longer. “High intensity activates different pathways in your body, with benefits at the cellular level. Together with gentler exercise, it improves overall fitness. The trick is getting the balance: say, 20% high to 80% low.” Strength training is also important, building muscle and helping to prevent later-life injuries. There is also a neurological benefit from this type of exercise. Instinct tells us that playing bridge and doing the crossword are good for the brain, but workouts also improve cognitive function, although the process is poorly understood. Sitting back with a cup of tea is not an option if you want to stave off the relentless process that is getting old. Many symptoms of ageing are linked to decreased hormone levels, particularly testosterone. The less testosterone you have, the harder it is to retain and build skeletal muscle (all the muscle that is not part of your circulatory system or digestive tract). Skeletal muscle burns a lot of calories. As you lose skeletal muscle, your metabolism slows, meaning any calories you consume are more likely to end up as fat. And fat secretes the hormone oestrogen and proteins that promote chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. As the writer Bill Gifford puts it in Spring Chicken, a 2015 tour of anti-ageing science, “Ageing makes us fat, and then our fat makes us age.” It gets worse. After 45, osteoarthritis – painful inflammation of the bones at the joints – becomes much more common. This happens as the cartilage that acts as a shock absorber in those joints, particularly in the knees, wears down and the cells that help it regrow get worse at their job, again for reasons not totally understood. The shocks that cushion the vertebrae of your spine take a beating, too. By the age of 50, more people than not have at least one bulging intervertebral disk, even if they don’t experience any symptoms. As you exit your 40s, your risk of a herniated disk shrinks. Great – except that it is because the disks themselves are shrinking, which not only predisposes you to new types of pain but explains why you will get a little shorter with each passing decade. Your nervous system is changing, too. Reaction times are at their best around age 24 and become slower from then on. This has to do with the reduced speed at which nerve signals travel. As the protective casings of protein around peripheral nerves degrade, they cannot conduct impulses as efficiently. This is one reason that the simple act of balancing requires more conscious effort in the elderly. But here’s the good news: most of these major changes can be attenuated, delayed or reversed through frequent and vigorous exercise. Bercovici says it won’t keep your hair dark or stop you needing glasses, but the most pernicious symptoms of ageing – cognitive impairment, muscle wasting, bone thinning, cardiovascular damage – just don’t happen in the same way in people who work out often. Take Tour de France cyclists: they enjoy an eight-year boost to their lifespans over we couch potatoes. Athletes in endurance sports or sports that demand a mix of endurance and power, such as football or basketball, fare better than pure power athletes, such as weight lifters. Elite sports performers continue to succeed well past the peak age for their sport, not because they train more but because they train more efficiently. They use periodisation – interweaving intense training with rest – to avoid fatigue and injury. This is something laymen can learn from. Players in their 30s are now common in first-class tennis, most notably Federer. With 20 grand slam titles to his credit, he is the most fluent and elegant of players, with feet as light as a dancer’s. But nowadays, he doesn’t overdo it. “Federer doesn’t drive himself to the wall,” says Bercovici. “Older athletes like him are no longer striving to be the biggest, strongest or fastest, but the smartest, in using their training to maximum effect. The biggest feature of many modern sportsmen now is how much sleep they get. In America, rest in the middle of a sports season was totally alien 20 years ago, but now it is accepted.” So pummelling yourself to death for hours on end in the gym need not be the answer. Relatively brief periods of high-intensity interval training, which make allowances for busy work and family lives, can help keep us young, or at least higher functioning older people. Even Federer is a spring chicken compared with athletes performing well into their forties. British runner Jo Pavey is a home-grown example of increasing longevity in sport. The Devon-based athlete will be just shy of her 45th birthday in August, yet age has not dulled her love of competition. Veteran of five Olympic Games, with two children to care for, she is nevertheless preparing for the 10,000m in that month’s European Athletics Championships in Berlin. In 2014, she won gold in the same event, when she was about to turn 41, becoming the oldest European champion in history. Pavey knows how to pace herself on and off the track, missing this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to ensure freshness in the summer. If anyone beats the linear model for ageing, it is her. “There’s always a next thing to aim for, and something to look forward to,” she says. “The thing is that you get some years when you feel older but when things are going wrong you can be 26 and feel old! You get years when you feel old and others when you feel young again.” Other female athletes have maintained elite performance into their 40s, such as 42-year-old Uzbek gymnast Oksana Chusovitina, who hopes to compete in her eighth Olympics in 2020. And American road cyclist Kristin Armstrong, 44, who came home with a gold from the time trial in the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, her third in that event. And when age takes its toll, there is always the option of medical science. For example, we are only a decade away from being able to 3D-print replacement cartilage – something Andy Murray could do with. Cartilage is particularly affected by age – about a quarter of all adults over 55 show signs of knee osteoarthritis, the inflammation that occurs when cartilage breaks down. Nirav Pandya, an orthopaedic surgeon at the University of California at San Francisco, says: “In the young kid you have such good healing potential. But take that person who may have had a couple of injuries in their knee when they played college sports, and now they’re 35 or 40 and it’s just bothering them. The answer before was, ‘Just stop.’ Now, it may be, ‘Let’s grow some cartilage in this area. Let’s see if we can get your body back to when you were 20 through some of the cell and molecular stuff we are doing.’” In Silicon Valley, where longevity is an obsession, the technological solution is appealing. Tech billionaires are using their wealth to put some distance between themselves and the Grim Reaper. Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the cofounders of Google, have launched a company called Calico (California Life Company) with the mission to “harness advanced technologies to increase our understanding of the biology that controls lifespan”. But death always enjoys the upper hand. Research suggests 120 is the absolute upper limit for the durability of the human frame, no matter what we do in the gym. Cell mutation over time is what does us in. Judith Campisi, a professor of biogerontology at the Buck Institute in the US, explains that the more biologically complex an organism, the harder it is to extend its life. We can keep roundworms alive for 10 times their normal lifespan. But humans? No. “Maybe evolution is trying to tell us something,” she says. Most of us need not worry about life at 120, or even 90. Our sedentary lifestyle helps ensure that many of us will depart this earth well before. Public Health England (PHE) says some six million people between 40 and 60 in England are endangering their health by not taking so much as a brisk walk for 10 minutes once a month. But there is always the chance to change. One of the benefits of being a couch potato in youth and early middle-age is the lack of stress damage accrued by serious athletes that can leave some of them old before their time. “By walking just 10 continuous minutes at a brisk pace every day, an individual can reduce their risk of early death by 15%,” says Professor Muir Gray, adviser to PHE. “They can also prevent or delay the onset of disability and further reduce their risk of serious health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, dementia and some cancers.” Emma Stevenson, professor of sport and exercise at Newcastle University’s Institute for Ageing, says it is all about functionality – living well, not just longer. “Age is not a reason not to be doing things,” she says. “That way, we age more quickly. We may be living longer but without good nutrition and exercise we lose functionality – like simply being able to get out of a chair – and that is not good quality of life.” How to get fit for life 1. Ramp up exercise gradually, preparing your body for the demands you wish to place on it. Walking is a great way to start. Just 10 continuous minutes at a brisk pace every day can reduce the risk of early death by 15%. 2. Aim for 10 or 20 minutes a week of high-intensity exercise – getting your heart rate up to at least 80% of its maximum. This means getting to the point where it feels unpleasant (sweating, raised heart rate, out of breath) and that you can’t keep it up for long. 3. High-intensity interval exercise should be followed by unloading activities, such as stretching and massage. Time-pressured people are tempted to extend exercise during a visit to the gym and skip stretching. Bad idea. 4. Keep to a 20:80 ratio for high:low intensity exercise. Also aim for some strength training (push-ups, squats, resistance bands) to build muscle and help to prevent later-life injuries, like those to the hip. 5. Avoid fads and eat a generally healthy diet, with plenty of vegetables and whole grains. Protein builds muscle and creatine powder in a glass of milk helps build and maintain muscle.

Championed by musicians from her native Poland and elsewhere, including Krystian Zimerman, this pioneering composer seems to be beginning to win the international profile she deserves, at least on disc. Recently there have been distinctive but equally rewarding surveys of her seven string quartets on both Chandos and Naxos. Now, on Chandos, the Silesian Quartet is joined by pianist Wojciech Świtała and others for her two piano quintets, plus two less conventional quartets – for four violins and four cellos. Born in Lodz in 1909, Bacewicz was both a composer and a renowned violin virtuoso, and a more than decent pianist as well. She wrote for strings and piano as a singer might write for their own voice: as someone who knows the instruments’ capabilities inside out, knows how to harness their particular resonances and make each instrument speak naturally and eloquently. This is especially apparent in the 1952 Quintet No 1, in which her music sounds equally idiomatic and at ease with itself in the itchy folk dance of the second movement as it does in the intense, mournful slow movement that follows it, and in the crunchy, ringing harmony of the 1949 Quartet for Four Violins. But you can hear it, too, in the 1965 Quintet No 2 and the 1963 Quartet for Four Cellos, both written after a car accident had ended Bacewicz’s performing career. These are more modernist in outlook, more experimental, sometimes to monumental effect. The Quintet No 2 ends with another folk dance – so often the stumped composer’s cop-out happy ending of choice – but the effect here isn’t twee or toothless, and the energised playing from all the musicians involved is consistently polished and engaging. This week’s other picks Also out this week is Christian Tetzlaff’s live recording on Ondine of the two violin concertos by one of Bacewicz’s clearest influences: Bartók. This comes weeks after Renaud Capuçon’s studio disc of the same works with the LSO and conductor François-Xavier Roth, on Erato. Capuçon and Roth offer a darker, more considered interpretation that is highly persuasive. Aided by conductor Hannu Lintu and the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, Tetzlaff can sound almost skittish by comparison, and tackles the love music of the besotted composer’s Concerto No 1 with a hearts-aflutter vibrato that puts it just the right side of schmaltzy. Ultimately, it’s Tetzlaff and Lintu’s approach that perhaps better captures Bartók’s vibrancy and originality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/25/foreign-office-climate-staff-cut-by-25-under-boris-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T05:00:42Z","webTitle":"Foreign Office climate staff cut by 25% under Boris Johnson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/25/foreign-office-climate-staff-cut-by-25-under-boris-johnson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/25/foreign-office-climate-staff-cut-by-25-under-boris-johnson","fields":{"headline":"Foreign Office climate staff cut by 25% under Boris Johnson","bodyText":"The number of full-time officials dedicated to climate change in the Foreign Office has dropped by almost 25% in the two years since Boris Johnson became foreign secretary, according to data released under freedom of information (FoI) rules. Johnson has also failed to mention climate change in any official speech since he took the office, in marked contrast to his two predecessors. The cutback in climate change diplomacy has come despite the prime minister, Theresa May, asserting that the UK leads the world on climate action. The UK has been praised for its past climate diplomacy, which helped pave the way to the landmark Paris agreement. “It is extremely disappointing,” said Prof Sir David King, who was the foreign secretary’s special envoy for climate change from September 2013 until March 2017. “Yes, we have the Paris agreement, but everybody knows the difference between what the agreement says – if possible no more than 1.5C rise – and what countries have promised is enormous,” he said. “There is a very big amount of work to be done. Other countries have had an enormous amount of respect for what Britain has delivered. If you then cut back the British effort then of course there is a real danger that the focus drifts away.” Johnson gave an assurance that King’s work would continue under his replacement. But FoI documents show that the number of officials working full time on climate change fell from 72 to 55 between early 2016 and 2018, despite the issue being a “network-wide priority” across the UK’s diplomatic corps. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said climate change is one of the Foreign Secretary’s key priorities. “Climate diplomacy could not be more important,” said Barry Gardiner, shadow minister for international climate change. “This is the year countries are supposed to ratchet up their Paris commitments, but so far the government has failed to step up and increase their aspirations. Sadly this government’s rhetoric versus reality is skewed.” In January, May said: “We are supporting the world’s poorest as they face up to the effects of rising sea waters and the extreme weather events associated with climate change. We will continue to lead the world in delivering on our commitments to the planet.” In April, climate change minister Claire Perry said: “The UK is leading the world in tackling climate change while growing our national income, ensuring we are best placed to help other countries reduce harmful carbon emissions.” However, Johnson has yet to mention climate change in an official speech. His predecessors as foreign secretary made strong speeches on global warming, with Philip Hammond saying at a 2015 event in Washington DC: “Unchecked climate change, even under the most likely scenario, could have catastrophic consequences … Our history shows us that when the US and the UK take a lead, we can persuade the world to follow. And we must take that lead.” In 2011, William Hague said: “Climate change is perhaps the 21st-century’s biggest foreign policy challenge. You cannot have food, water, or energy security without climate security.” Johnson has given speeches about ending the illegal ivory trade that drives the poaching of elephants and has ordered a ban on avoidable single-use plastics from the Foreign Office’s UK operations by the end of 2018. In a newspaper column in 2015, the hottest December ever recorded, Johnson cited climate change sceptic Piers Corbyn as saying “the whole global warming theory is unsound, to say the least”. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: “The UK was instrumental in securing the Paris agreement on climate change. We are helping other countries to meet their targets and we are confident that we will be able to meet our own groundbreaking target of reducing emissions by 80% by 2050.” She added: “We have repeatedly made our views clear to the US Administration.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/29/for-the-love-of-tomatoes-grow-your-own","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T05:00:42Z","webTitle":"For the love of tomatoes | Allan Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/29/for-the-love-of-tomatoes-grow-your-own","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/29/for-the-love-of-tomatoes-grow-your-own","fields":{"headline":"For the love of tomatoes","bodyText":"Tomatoes were my gateway drug.

Tomatoes, though, were competitive. A few members of our Observer team sowed them. It was 2007. I was editor of this magazine. We showed off pictures of our seedlings as they grew into plants. We talked about the merits of different varieties (I was taken by Black Crimea). We were obsessed. I wanted us to grow and dig together, outside the newsroom. I looked into guerrilla gardening. Then we found an old allotment, full of wire, glass and rubble. The work was hard. It often rained. Soon the team was just me and photographer Howard Sooley. Howard was my gardening hero. He knew all the Latin names. He had shot the book of Derek Jarman’s Prospect Cottage. His dad grew good tomatoes. We have now shared a plot for more than 10 years. Some experts may tell you to sow two or three seeds together and then save only the strongest. I think weaker plants (like people) will also thrive with love, sun, food and shelter. Ironically there is blight on the allotment site. Tomatoes don’t do well. So now – if I am allowed – I grow a few plants on our rooftop among the flowerpots. I pick out the sucker side shoots and give them organic seaweed feed. Sometimes I just go outside to breathe in the leaves. At the end of summer, I’ll pick the fruit, scatter with flakes of salt and thank the gardening gods – for the plot and the pleasures of home-grown food.

After arriving late for a meeting in Brussels to reassure MEPs of the efficiency of the British government, officials from Amber Rudd’s department conceded that a key function on the app would not work on the phone brand used by more than half of the adult population in the UK. Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP who attended the meeting, said one Home Office official had suggested applicants could “borrow someone else’s” phone to complete the registration. “It is beyond belief,” Bearder told reporters. The group of officials, who were late due to a delayed Eurostar, were in Brussels to demonstrate to MEPs the functions of the new Home Office app in order to build confidence. Rudd had insisted that using the Home Office app would be as easy for the 3 million EU nationals in the UK as setting up an online account at LK Bennett, the clothes retailer. She also said it had been “extensively tested”, but Home Office officials admitted they had not yet begun mass testing of the app. They also said they would be hiring 1,000 caseworkers for a customer service centre for EU citizens, although they had not yet begun this process. However, the fact that the app does not work on Apple devices has highlighted what many say is the government’s poor record with technology. EU citizens who have tested the app say it requires just a small amount of information, such as a scan of a passport, address, email address and a selfie to match the passport picture. The system then matches the biographical details with HM Revenue &amp; Customs records to give the applicant an instant answer as to whether their application has been successful. However, it has emerged that because Apple will not enable its technology to read the chip on modern passports, the registration can only be completed on an Android phone. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, said he would be writing to Theresa May this week about a series of wider concerns, including the £72 cost of registering, and the need for every member of a family to individually apply for settled status. Verhofstadt said: “The treatment of the Windrush generation under UK immigration law has unfortunately created renewed anxiety among EU citizens in the UK and shows why we have to get this right. The European parliament will closely scrutinise developments and work to ensure sufficient guarantees are in place to avoid the repetition of such a situation for EU citizens.” The London MEP Claude Moraes, chair of the European parliament’s civil liberties committee, said: “In my opinion, there is a need for more investment. They need to understand the political immensity of this, they need to understand that there is no history globally of registration systems based on this technology working.” One person in the meeting is said to have quipped: “It’s like the Irish border – they are trying to solve the problem with technology and we know it won’t work.” Moraes added that he was deeply concerned that the government was registering EU citizens on the basis of secondary rather than primary legislation, allowing the laws to be changed in the future. Under the withdrawal agreement, EU nationals will have recourse to the European court of justice should they have complaints about their treatment, but the scandal over the Windrush generation has illustrated the dangers in the longer term, Verhofstadt said. It is understood that the iPhone compatibility issue was known about at the app’s inception. “We’re speaking to Apple to try and get this resolved,” a Home Office spokesman said. In its statement, the department added that “technology will play an important role” in the identification element of registration, but it was also making “non-digital” routes available to all applicants, including sending a passport through the post."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/28/instagram-at-the-crossroads-profits-facebook-data-scandal-politics-influencers-mental-health","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T17:00:20Z","webTitle":"Can Instagram keep its nose clean?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/28/instagram-at-the-crossroads-profits-facebook-data-scandal-politics-influencers-mental-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/28/instagram-at-the-crossroads-profits-facebook-data-scandal-politics-influencers-mental-health","fields":{"headline":"Can Instagram keep its nose clean?","bodyText":"It has been a rough few weeks for Facebook since the Observer reported the Cambridge Analytica data breach. The scandal revealed how the political consulting firm might have raked up the personal information of at least 87 million Facebook users in order to influence them with tailored political ads, sent the social network’s stocks into a tailspin, triggered the #DeleteFacebook movement – and regaled the planet with the cringefest that was CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony before the US Senate. But if Facebook’s reputation has seen better days, one of the company’s most valuable assets has come out of the kerfuffle practically unscathed. Instagram, the photo-sharing platform Facebook acquired in 2012 for $715m, has not yet come up in the debate over Facebook’s cavalier attitude to user data protection, despite being of a piece with the longer-running social network (and being headquartered just a few blocks from Facebook’s Menlo Park campus in California). Prominent members of the #DeleteFacebook campaign, such as SpaceX’s Elon Musk, singer Cher, and Playboy magazine, are still pretty much present and active on Instagram. The app’s apparent immunity to whatever befalls its owner, and the possibility that this might not last, even led a Reuters analyst to recommend that Facebook spin off Instagram as a separate company, to shield it from reputational contagion. Instagram’s cast-iron popularity confirms its emerging status as Facebook’s crown jewel. The app is gaining users at a breakneck pace: it only took it five months to leap from 700 million users in April 2017 to 800 million in September. It is especially popular with younger people: in March 2018, a survey by the Pew Research Center found that 71% of Americans aged 18 to 24 were on Instagram, and that more than half of them visited it daily. And it trounces other platforms at the engagement game: 2017 research by business intelligence firm L2 revealed that Instagram accounted for 92% of interactions taking place on social media, if only Facebook, Twitter and Instagram itself were considered; that dropped to a still whopping 42% if YouTube was also taken into account. According to consumer data firm Statista, this year Instagram is expected to make up almost 28% of Facebook’s net mobile advertising revenue. “If you measure success through the size of a community and then multiply it for engagement, Instagram gets 10 times the engagement that Facebook gets,” says L2 founder and New York University professor Scott Galloway. “In many ways, it’s currently the most successful platform in the world.” Part of that success boils down to Instagram’s intrinsic qualities. Its visual-first model may be more appealing than Twitter’s or Facebook’s text-heavy makeup. In the absence of a share function, users only post their own pictures and videos, so there’s no angsty clutter of links and reposts that took the joy out of other social networks. “The genius of Facebook was the same [as Instagram’s] core habit: seeing other people’s photos,” says Nir Eyal, an angel investor, and author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products. “On Facebook, that core habit was polluted with all the other junk in our feed. That’s causing a lot of the move to Instagram: people don’t want all the news, debate and politics.” On the other hand, it’s hard not to feel that Instagram lucked out, effectively airbrushing its public image amid Facebook’s whirlwind of scandals. It is worth noting, too, that many people do not know that Instagram belongs to Facebook: according to a recent DuckDuckGo survey, 56.9% of Americans are unaware of the connection. Not that Facebook or Instagram were ever keen on emphasising that connection in their marketing material – a stance that, in retrospect, has paid off. Yet Instagram shares many of the problems and flaws that have catapulted Facebook into the spotlight. The blight of fake news and foreign interference has marred Instagram at least as much as it has Facebook: according to Facebook’s own testimony before the US Congress, last year, 170 Instagram accounts were found to have spread propaganda from Russia’s Internet Research Agency, compared to only 120 Facebook pages. “Instagram is as large a component of election propaganda as Facebook, if not larger,” says Jonathan Albright, a data journalist and research director at Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism. Although Instagram has not cropped up in the Cambridge Analytica affair, the ads appearing on the platform can be tailored for custom audiences directly from Facebook’s advertising dashboard – by leveraging Facebook data. In the wake of the scandal, Facebook has hastened to make sure that Instagram’s data privacy practices were improved. In early April, Instagram suddenly shut down access to its application programming interface (API), disrupting several third-party apps relying on it to glean user analytics. Days later, Instagram announced it was creating a tool that would enable users to download all the data they have shared on the platform – a move that brought it in line with Facebook (which made data portability possible in 2010) and with the EU’s soon-to-be-implemented General Data Protection Regulation. In time, Instagram is also likely to come under increased scrutiny for other long-running but unsolved issues, such as its impact on young users’ mental health, and the rise of Instagram influencers – people who make a living by featuring brands and products in their pictures for a fee. The field is unregulated, lacks transparency and is prone to abuse and fraud. But Instagram could be in the process of sorting the issue out, and possibly even making some money along the way. Instagram’s artsy vibe and relative independence protected it from the flak lobbed at its parent company. But as the photo-sharing service coasts towards a billion users, its shortcomings cannot just be covered with a dreamy filter: the way Instagram handles these challenges will come to define it. Potential pitfalls for Instagram Russian roulette According to Tow Center’s Jonathan Albright, Instagram was one of Russia’s platforms of choice for sharing propaganda memes and videos ahead of the US presidential election in 2016. And while Facebook pegged the number of American Instagram users reached by propaganda at around 20 million, Albright thinks that number could be much higher, as trolls resorted to third-party apps such as Regrann to repost content multiple times. Posts on Instagram might also have been more engaging than those shared on Facebook, possibly because of Instagram’s sleeker interface. “Instagram had better engagement for these posts versus Facebook,” Albright says. “Facebook gets messy, people post their pictures, embeds, previews, and the comments on the post get really disorganised. Instagram had better engagement for outrage, for people really getting angry and commenting more on-topic.” While Instagram has removed the 170 profiles thought to be linked to Russia, Albright says that it has not actually got rid of all the propaganda disseminated on the platform. “The only things that were taken down were the original accounts, so if there’s any kind of screenshot or repost, it’s still around,” he says. “[Instagram] didn’t go back and filter or search anything.” He says that, as of last month, some of the Russian-made memes could still be found lurking on Instagram. Celebs for sale The airbrushed world of Instagram has helped bring about a new profession – that of online influencers. Influencers are social media users who, having commanded a high follower count, partner with brands to feature products in their posts, in exchange for freebies or money. While many niche “micro-influencers” ask brands for relatively small amounts, Instagram-famous personalities can make thousands of pounds for every picture, with celebrities such as Kim Kardashian charging up to $500,000 a post. Influencers’ activity on Instagram increased by 198% between 2016 and 2017, according to online marketing research firm Klear. The irresistible rise of this new category has created a host of new problems. Brands started fretting about “fake influencers”, followed by spurious armies of bots. Advertising authorities in various countries requested that influencers acknowledge that they are paid for promoting products, by adding the hashtag #ad to their posts. Last year, Instagram launched a branded content tool, which allows influencers to tag their partner brands more visibly in their posts. The feature was officially rolled out to enhance transparency, and to provide brands with insights about the performance of influencers’ posts online. But according to Callum McCahon, strategy director at social media firm Born Social, it could end up changing the way the influencer industry works. “Brands could be asked to pay for promoting their influencers’ posts and increasing their reach,” he said. “Instagram could then make money from brands boosting their influencers’ pictures. That’s not officially confirmed as of today, but that’s what Facebook did in the past.” Mental health In May 2017, the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) published a report on social media’s impact on the mental health of young people. Instagram was labelled as the platform with the worst impact on its young users’ mental wellbeing. Problems ranged from anxiety- and depression-inducing imagery, to bullying, to body image issues. A more recent study from the University of Notre Dame in Fremantle, Western Australia revealed that young women exposed to the luridly filtered existences of Instagrammers were likely to feel bad about both their appearance and their general lifestyle and career. Over the past few months, Instagram seems to have taken notice, introducing new tools, such as comment filters and pop-up alerts for problematic hashtags, that could help alleviate some of the mental health problems highlighted by researchers. Then, in April 2018, during a Bloomberg event, the company announced the launch of a dedicated “wellbeing team” with the goal of making Instagram a “safer place, a place where people feel good”. The group’s strategy is still unclear, but at least it seems that Instagram has acknowledged that with greater power comes greater responsibility. “It is surprising that Instagram has only recently launched the wellbeing team,” said Dr Becky Inkster, an honorary research fellow at the University of Cambridge, who contributed to the RSPH study. “They need to be far more proactive with how they handle potential negative effect and harm.” Inkster is optimistic, however, about Instagram leading the way to better understanding of how images affect our mental welfare. “Instagram can be a big player, and help in this area,” she says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/24/fears-raised-windrush-hotline-will-be-used-for-data-gathering","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T18:04:01Z","webTitle":"Windrush generation fear hotline will be used for data gathering","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/24/fears-raised-windrush-hotline-will-be-used-for-data-gathering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/24/fears-raised-windrush-hotline-will-be-used-for-data-gathering","fields":{"headline":"Windrush generation fear hotline will be used for data gathering","bodyText":"Amber Rudd’s pledges of help for the Windrush generation have failed to reassure them that they will be safe from deportation if they use the hotline but cannot meet the standard of proof required to remain in the UK. David Lammy, the Tottenham MP who has led the campaign at Westminster, said he was hearing from people who were still afraid. “They have feared detention and deportation if they raise their cases with the Home Office. Windrush children need a guarantee that this helpline will not be used as an information-gathering service for immigration enforcement,” he said. Rudd came under pressure to make more detailed promises of protection as MPs on the cross-party home affairs select committee prepared to question her on Wednesday. One committee member, Stephen Doughty, said his casework had got much worse as the government’s “hostile environment” strategy on immigration was ratcheted up. “There are repeated errors, mistakes and misjudgments as a result of the hostile environment policy, and this has impacted on real people’s lives and that of their families. It is not just a simple error that can be brushed away. It can be literally life-changing.” In her Commons statement, Rudd insisted that the information gathered in the helpline would not be used to remove people from the country, saying its purpose was to “help and support”. Ministers discussed the fallout from the Windrush scandal at the weekly cabinet meeting on Tuesday, with Boris Johnson understood to have called for a broader immigration “amnesty” for longstanding Commonwealth migrants. The foreign secretary told colleagues that the move – which did not include those with criminal records – would exempt other groups of migrants from having to produce reams of paperwork to prove that they had been living in Britain for years. Theresa May was said to have responded “acidly” by pointing out that Johnson had previously called for an amnesty for people in the UK illegally, both during his time as London mayor and during the EU referendum campaign. May ruled out an amnesty during her time as home secretary, claiming it would send “the wrong message”. The Home Office has also discounted the possibility. Lammy said on Tuesday afternoon that had been approached by at least nine Windrush-era migrants in his constituency in the previous 12 hours. One was a man who had arrived from Jamaica at the age of six. His documentation failed to satisfy Home Office checks, and he had been warned that he could be deported any time after seven days had elapsed. Lammy tweeted: “Why is my constituent being treated like an illegal immigrant despite providing documentation from 1964? This is an outrageous miscarriage of justice. Grant him his citizenship and passport.” Rudd promised to speed up the process of applying for citizenship, and waive the fees and knowledge test for migrants from Commonwealth countries who could show they had been in Britain before 1988. Most of the new cases sent to Lammy were from the Caribbean, but migrants from other Commonwealth countries who have been in the UK for almost all their lives are coming forward. He said the rush of cases demonstrated that Windrush-era people had been too scared to come forward. The home secretary needed to be clear about what she meant when she said the burden of proof would be shifted from the applicant, he said. “Windrush children urgently need details about what this means in practice. What exactly is the burden of proof? “What happens if an individual does not meet this threshold? Are their details going to be passed to immigration enforcement so they can be detained or deported?” There is also concern about Rudd’s promise to expand the use of discretion by Home Office officials. Although it indicates less of a tick-box approach, it also offers less certainty. Chai Patel, of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said people should seek legal advice before contacting the Home Office. He said Rudd’s promise that there would be no removals was not one that the Home Office could make, particularly while it was uncertain about the new threshold of proof. “Of course relaxing the standards will help some people, but there are still some people who won’t be able to prove what’s being asked of them. For those people who are then ultimately told, ‘You haven’t met the requirements’ – what’s going to happen to their data? “We don’t want people to panic. We think the helpline will help, but we think it is really important that people get independent legal advice.” Patel said one solution would be for the Home Office to undertake to destroy the data of any applicants ultimately unable to prove their right to become British citizens. MPs are putting Rudd under pressure to reveal her plans for compensation. Home Office insiders said officials had been trying to come up with a solution for those who had suffered financial loss. The resulting scheme is likely to include payments for loss of income and benefits, legal fees, air fares and accommodation costs. However, tailoring compensation to individuals would almost certainly slow down the process. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, told MPs that compensation must be more than just a “token amount” paid to every victim. Government insiders are thought to agree."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/01/tamal-ray-recipe-apple-marzipan-cake","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T05:00:35Z","webTitle":"Tamal Ray’s recipe for apple and marzipan cake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/01/tamal-ray-recipe-apple-marzipan-cake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/01/tamal-ray-recipe-apple-marzipan-cake","fields":{"headline":"Tamal Ray’s recipe for apple and marzipan cake","bodyText":"It’s strange where the path of experimentation can take you in the kitchen. Today’s recipe started as an attempt at recreating a German apple cake my friend’s mother had made. But, as so often happens in our kitchen, its shelves buckling under the weight of ingredients bought in a fit of hunger, things took a different turn. The chunks of marzipan melt as the cake cooks, giving it a chewy crust of caramelised sweetness that’s cut through by the acidic tang of the apples. This improves with a day or two of rest after baking, although it’s perhaps best kept out of sight, lest you find yourself breaking off little pieces to nibble every time you walk past. Prep 15 min Cook 25 min Serves 2 2 granny smith apples (or any other tart variety) 125g marzipan 150g unsalted butter, plus 2 tbsp extra for greasing 30g caster sugar 30g brown sugar, plus extra for dusting 2 medium eggs 45g plain flour 60g ground almonds 1½ tsp baking powder 1½ tsp ground cinnamon ¼ tsp ground cloves To serve Natural yoghurt Peel and core the apples, then use a sharp knife to cut one of them into about 20 thin slices. Chop the remaining apple into chunks about 1.5cm across. Cut the marzipan into similar sized chunks and heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas 6. Cream together the butter and sugars until pale, then add the eggs, flour, almonds, baking powder and spices, and beat together to form a smooth batter. Liberally grease the sides and base of a 24cm round cake tin with butter, then put a disc of greaseproof paper on the bottom. The butter between the paper and tin will stop the paper moving about as you assemble the cake. Put two tablespoons of the batter into the prepared tin and spread thinly to cover the entire base. Evenly scatter over the marzipan chunks, followed by half the remaining batter. Next, scatter over the apple chunks, pushing them down gently into the batter, and cover with the rest of the batter. Melt two tablespoons of butter and use to coat the apple slices, then arrange them over the top of the cake, followed by a sprinkling of brown sugar. Bake for 25 minutes, until the cake is a rich, nutty brown and a skewer inserted into the middle emerges clean. Serve with a dollop of natural yoghurt. Food styling: Emily Kydd.

Without robots or blast suits, he disarmed thousands of mines; first in the aftermath of the second Gulf war, then, after a layoff enforced by the loss of his right leg, during the reconquest of Iraq from the Islamic State. The latter was more dangerous: Isis packed abandoned houses with IEDs in entranceways, under rubble, inside furniture. We see the colonel teetering from fatigue, but always ready to go the extra mile. “Fakhir knew he was the fastest and the most experienced,” says Hogir Hirori, director of The Deminer. “If he didn’t do it, then many more people would die.” The Deminer makes for nervous viewing. Each of the four detonations we see ratchets up the sense of inevitability. It’s not quite a snuff movie, though haunted by a similar balefulness. What moral responsibilities do documentary-makers have when their subject is a danger to himself? With Berwari, the film-makers seem in the clear; it seems certain the colonel would have carried on regardless, whether or not a camera was present. So, as with Restrepo, Last Men in Aleppo, Armadillo, Point and Shoot and other recent works sticking their head above the parapet in the Middle East, the prime responsibility for the film-makers would appear to be safeguarding the crew. Berwari always made the ultimate call on whether filming was OK, says Hirori. “Working with him always felt safe. His decisions about whether a situation was safe could always be trusted.” Ethically, The Deminer is also affected by the fact that Berwari had begun documenting himself, as part of an attempt to archive his work for educational purposes. So it falls into the category – like the 2015 mountain-climbing ordeal Meru and many extreme-sports films – where the film-makers in jeopardy are on the screen. Which largely exempts them from the documentarian’s unspoken rule of care: not to exploit, goad on or unduly put subjects under duress. Not everyone passes: 2006’s The Bridge, a film about Golden Gate suicides, earned a black flag when its director, Eric Steel, chose not to inform family members later interviewed that footage of their relatives’ deaths would be part of the film (itself a highly contentious choice). Still, the omnipresent camera trained on the Golden Gate’s rust-red guard-rail, waiting for loiterers, left uncomfortable questions about our role watching such moments. The same uneasy feeling, that we are somehow implicated, hangs over The Deminer. The camera is not an obvious colluder or coaxer that may betray its subject – such as in The Act of Killing, Borat or Capturing the Friedmans – but we are still emotional participants. With no first-person interviews and little personal or cultural background other than what is gleaned from scenes with Berwari’s family, The Deminer doesn’t chip away much at why he takes such extraordinary risks. Without this deeper understanding, the film’s hair-trigger mechanics come close to enabling a voyeuristic experience, like a real-life Hurt Locker. Hirori suggests this non-reflective approach is true to the environment in which the colonel had to operate: “That is the way reality is in conflict areas. You don’t have the time to think: ‘Should I be doing this? Is this worth it?’ You just act.” On the other hand, Hirori excised material that might have given his film stronger insight into Berwari’s almost absurdly selfless diligence: an interview with the colonel was cut because it didn’t fit with the decision to structure the piece around Berwari’s son, Abdullah, discovering the first cache of video material. Hirori also removed a strand showing Abdullah following in his father’s footsteps. “He was teaching Abdullah to disarm mines from a very young age,” says Hirori, “Once Fakhir realised that the situation was far worse than he thought, he made a decision [Abdullah] couldn’t come.” Hirori says it pulled the focus away from Berwari, but it could have deepened our understanding of ideas of duty in Kurdish patriarchal society, and whether Fakhir had a martyrdom complex. Such questions about context, which weigh on all documentaries, press heaviest when a work has to pass judgment, or act as an epitaph. Werner Herzog’s Grizzly Man is another documentary in which the director had to decide how to frame a footage-cache overspilling with courage-cum-foolhardiness. Its subject, Timothy Treadwell, was a compulsive talker, and Herzog opts to press fearlessly into the far terrain of Treadwell’s psychology. Above all, Treadwell is aware of the camera. “It was [Treadwell’s] instrument to explore the world around him, but increasingly it became something more,” says Herzog. “It started to scrutinise his innermost being, his demons, his exhilarations. Facing the lens of the camera took on the quality of a confessional.” Becoming the custodian of Treadwell’s tale, he never forgets the camera’s complicit hold, making it visible in the story as he shapes the bookends of Treadwell’s tale. Portraying characters on the edge, it’s up to every director to decide if the greater obligation is to the subject or the audience. The line that marks where a documentary should stop is fuzzy, often vanishingly so. In the defence of The Deminer – a film undeniably the product of great physical bravery – it must be even harder to locate in war. The Deminer is out in the UK on 27 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/26/lynchings-sadism-white-men-why-america-must-atone","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"The sadism of white men: why America must atone for its lynchings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/26/lynchings-sadism-white-men-why-america-must-atone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/26/lynchings-sadism-white-men-why-america-must-atone","fields":{"headline":"The sadism of white men: why America must atone for its lynchings","bodyText":"Vanessa Croft was driving home after work in Gadsden, Alabama last month when she noticed something strange in her rear-view mirror. There were two huge flags bearing the starred cross of the Confederacy fluttering angrily behind her from the back of a menacing black pickup truck. She had seen plenty of Confederate flags – almost every day she spots them on car licence plates or in windows in town. But this was different. It was after midnight, and as she drove the flags stayed behind her. She drove some more, they followed. She turned into a McDonald’s, hoping that its surveillance cameras would protect her – they turned too, drawing up alongside her. Inside the truck were two white men who sat and stared at her. Croft, a 57-year-old black woman, stared back. The truck kept trailing her all the way to her street, then disappeared as suddenly as it had come. But a chill lingered. “Two huge Confederate flags flapping in the night following me home. In Gadsden. In 2018. It still happens.” The incident got her thinking about the secret that lay deep inside her family until just a few years ago. It concerned Uncle Fred, a beloved figure in her childhood who lived in New York. She knew him as her New York uncle, that’s all. Until her father told her the story. It was in the mid-1930s, and Fred was 15. He was out at work one day when a posse of white men turned up at the family home. Where was the boy, they demanded. A little white girl had been pushed off a porch and her father, incensed by such disrespect, had decided it was Fred who did it and had to pay, even though the girl swore it was someone else. When the men were told that Fred wasn’t there, they left a message. Tell the boy we’ll be back for him tonight. There was no doubt what they meant. Fred’s father knew, as all black townsfolk in Gadsden knew, what had happened to Bunk Richardson. The 28-year-old had been seized a few years back by a local mob of white men in relation to the murder of a white woman in which he had played no part. They took him to a railroad bridge over the Coosa river on the edge of town and flung him over, leaving him hanging from a rope for several days for all to see. Fearful that the same fate awaited him, Fred Croft fled. His father told him to leave town as darkness fell and never come back. And he never did. At the age of 15 Uncle Fred fled north, never to return. * * * Vanessa Croft relates the stories of Fred Croft and Bunk Richardson – the teenager who escaped a lynching and the man who didn’t – at a spot that has profound resonance to her narrative. We are standing in the middle of a memorial square in Montgomery, Alabama, surrounded on all sides by brown metal cylinders of weathered corten steel. On each of the cylinders, names have been engraved along with the counties in which they met their end. Some have just a few names, others 20. The particular box under which we are standing, Etowah county, Alabama, in which Gadsden lies, has just one name: Bunk Richardson. Under it has been etched 02.11.1906, the date they placed the noose around his neck. The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which opens on Thursday, is a place unlike any other in the United States. Together with a new Legacy Museum which also opens this week, it addresses head on a subject that has been marked by a booming silence until now – the enforcement of white supremacy in America through racial terrorism in the form of lynching, as well as its other guises: slavery, segregation and modern mass incarceration. The memorial records and honors the more than 4,000 people of color, Bunk Richardson among them, who lost their lives to terror lynching. It is the brainchild of Bryan Stevenson, a civil rights lawyer who for the past 25 years has been a firebrand for justice in a region that is so often resistant to it. He has championed the most desperate and vulnerable in the deep south, from 125 death row inmates he has helped avoid execution to children as young as 13 condemned to die behind bars. Having made his name through his not-for-profit group Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) fighting on the toughest frontline of the US criminal justice system, Stevenson has now turned his energies to exposing the historical causes of the country’s enduring racial wounds. “I’ve been persuaded that the law will be insufficient to create justice if we don’t also create a consciousness about our history and address the burden that so many Americans carry,” he told the Guardian in Montgomery ahead of the opening. Stevenson has never done anything by half measures, and his twin memorial and museum are no exceptions. The memorial sits audaciously atop a hill overlooking the heart of Montgomery. From its grounds you look down on the state capitol, the legislative beating heart of Alabama that acted as the first capital of the Confederacy and presides over a state constitution that to this day outlaws white and black kids going to school together: in 2004 and 2012 Alabamans held referendums on whether to remove the racist ban; both times the overwhelmingly white majority voted to keep it. * * * You enter the memorial through a swath of lush grass, which lulls you into a false sense that the journey you are about to embark on will be soothing and serene. It is neither. As you walk through the four corridors that form the memorial square the sheer number of engraved names representing lynching victims begins to well up around you like swirling tides. Then the floor begins to descend, giving the impression that the rusted steel monuments are rising up in front of you like so many bodies strung from a tree. They dangle above your head, swaying slightly in the wind, mimicking the bare feet of the lynched men that similarly swung above the heads of their white assailants standing beneath them grinning into the camera. “We wanted to lift up this violence because that’s precisely what the perpetrators of lynching themselves wanted,” Stevenson said. “They wanted to lift it up because only by doing so did they have the power to terrorise, to taunt and torment entire communities of colour.” Once the steel boxes have risen up high in the air, you turn a corner and come, with a jolt, face to face with the horrifying scale of lynching in America. Hundreds of monuments to the victims are hanging before you, neatly arranged in columns like the headstones of national heroes at Arlington cemetery, except these national heroes have never been recognised before today. EJI has identified more than 4,384 lynchings by white people of people of colour in the main era when such racial terrorism stalked the land, 1877 to 1950. They spanned 800 counties, mainly in the deep south, each one of which is represented at the memorial with its own steel monument. One of the myths of the lynching era was that black people were targeted for raping white women or for murder. But EJI’s research suggests that only a quarter of the lynchings involved sexual relations and less than a third related to allegations of violence. Most frequently, the “crimes” committed were breathtakingly minor. Like shoving a girl off a porch, as Fred Croft found when he was forced to flee for his life. Jack Turner was lynched in Alabama in 1882 for organizing black voters. Bud Spears raised objections to the lynching of a black man in Mississippi in 1888, and for his pains was himself lynched. Many of the two dozen or so women who were lynched died because a mob couldn’t find their husbands or sons at home so grabbed them instead. One of the most heartbreaking names in the memorial is that of General Lee. Not much is known about him, but it is likely that as a black man he took the name of Robert E Lee, commander of the Confederate States army that fought to keep his race enslaved, because he was under the delusion that it would somehow save his skin. It didn’t. Lee was lynched in 1904 in South Carolina for knocking on the door of a white woman. Huge crowds often turned out: 10,000 to watch Henry Smith, 17, tortured and burned on a 10ft-high stage in Paris, Texas in 1893; 20,000 at the burning alive of Willy Brown in Omaha, Nebraska in 1919. Such was the communal complicity that sometimes entire white communities would attend – to a man, woman and child. Sherrilyn Ifill, author of the definitive lynching history On the Courthouse Lawn, describes a common pattern: as soon as the public spectacle of the killing was over, white townsfolk would suddenly lose all memory of the event. No, they hadn’t seen anything, no they didn’t know who was responsible, and yes it was strangers from out of town who did it. “It was understood as an act of loyalty to be silent about the lynchings and who did them, and that act of loyalty was passed down, becoming a part of the community.” As you walk around the memorial these stories roil around you. The space is quiet, but feels as though it should resound with ear-splitting, unearthly howling or wailing. Each name on every single metal monument stretching out before you represents a moment of unconscionable inhumanity and suffering. It would be prurient to dwell on the details, yet nor should they be glossed over, as to do so would be to sustain the collective amnesia that has characterised America’s relationship with racial terrorism. * * * Here is the entry for Coweta county, Georgia, tucked away in one of the memorial’s corners. On it is stamped: “Sam Hose 04.23.1899.” Look behind those two words and three numbers and you discover that the lynching of Sam Hose was planned days in advance and witnessed by a crowd of about 2,000 white people. Many had travelled on trains laid on for the occasion from Atlanta, some custom-provided for people coming straight from church. Platform criers hurried passengers along with the refrain: “Special train! All aboard for the burning!” Hose was accused of murdering his white employer before assaulting the wife – claims that were all thoroughly debunked by an investigation launched by the great anti-lynching advocate and journalist Ida B Wells. In truth, the 23-year-old had acted in self-defence when his employer put a loaded gun to his head. The classic image of the lynch crowd is of a mob of “white trash”, the unrestrained and uneducated dregs of society who knew no better. Incorrect. As Wells’s research revealed, Hose’s death was actively instigated by many of white society’s most upstanding Christian leaders: the banker who urged his customers to “make an example of Sam”, the manager of one of the largest mills who called for a burning, the governor of Georgia who refused to stop it, the local newspaper that advertised it and egged on its readers. They tied Hose to a sapling and laid kindling at his feet. As the flames began to lick, first they cut off his left ear, then his right. Next they cut the skin off his face, hacked off his fingers, slashed his legs and opened up his stomach to pull out his entrails. They did so slowly, meticulously, so as to ensure that he remained conscious throughout. Then they poured oil on the fire and watched him burn. The crowd, which included many women and children, looked as though it was having great fun. The only disappointment, as Wells’s investigation noted, was that the black man declined to give the participants the pleasure of hearing him beg for mercy. He never once cried out. His only utterance was a quiet groan: “Oh, Lord Jesus,” he said. When it was all over, children and adults scrabbled among his remains for relics to be later cherished or sold, including his charred liver and bones. For Bryan Stevenson, such barbarism, such sadism, served a purpose. It also exacted a heavy price. “People were being asked to prove their commitment to white supremacy by their willingness to engage in ever more extreme forms of violence,” the lawyer said. “The problem with that is you get disconnected from decency and kindness, you get lost in it. Whether you were the person cutting off fingers or the person enjoying deviled eggs and lemonade as the spectacle unfolded, something tragic and destructive was happening to you.” As he speaks, the exceptional nature of what Stevenson has created on top of the hill becomes clear. This is not another conventional addition to black historiography. Certainly, it explores and commemorates black experience. But it also powerfully dives into the warped psyche of white Americans prepared to participate in the gruesome mutilation of other human beings. This is not academic history, it is red-hot political challenge. It challenges the state capitol down the hill, it challenges white-dominated towns and cities across the American south and beyond, and, yes, it challenges the current occupant of the White House. It is time, the new memorial says, to confront the sins of the past and recognise the tragic consequences of white supremacy. It’s a provocative posture, and Stevenson knows it. “There are clearly going to be people who are provoked and disrupted and challenged by this, sure there will be. A lot of people will never come here, they are angered by the idea that this is something we have to talk about.” Stevenson, standing on a mound at the center of the memorial, looked around the more than 4,000 names honoured here, and said: “People brought their children. They made their little kids watch human beings be burned or drowned or beaten. That has created a disease where we have become indifferent to the victimisation of black people. We have to treat that disease.” The treatment continues down the hill in downtown Montgomery at the new Legacy Museum which traces the unbroken path of racial violence from slavery, through lynching and Jim Crow segregation to the modern era of drug wars and mass incarceration. The exhibition is fittingly located in a slave warehouse on Commerce Street (the commerce in question having been trade in slaves) just two blocks away from the auction house where black people were sold along with mules, carts and wagons. Stevenson’s conviction is that slavery didn’t end in 1865, it evolved into lynching, then segregation and now into a modern dystopia where 2.3 million Americans are incarcerated and one in three black males born in America can expect at some point to go to prison. He draws a single unbroken thread uniting all these manifestations of racial dominance: “The idea that black people are not the same as white people, they aren’t fully human or evolved, and are presumed dangerous and guilty. That’s why American society today is so non-responsive to shootings of unarmed black people, to disproportionate expulsion rates of black kids, to putting handcuffs on four- or five-year-old black girls – we’ve been acculturated to not valuing the victimisation of black people.” Perhaps most controversially, he invokes a comparison with 9/11. On 11 September 2001 international terrorists killed 2,976 people. In response memorials were erected at Ground Zero, the Pentagon and Shanksville, Pennsylvania; Osama bin Laden and many of his henchmen were killed or imprisoned indefinitely in Guantanamo and around the world; the US military was mobilized for a war on terror that continues almost 17 years later. In the lynching era, domestic terrorists killed at least 4,308 people. In response there have been no memorials until this day. Convictions for murder relating to racial lynchings were extremely rare. “Many people of colour are left questioning,” Stevenson said. “Wait a minute, they say. I didn’t realise we had the capacity to fight a war on terror. Where were the soldiers, the planes, the tanks back when we were being terrorised?” Stevenson hopes the memorial and museum will be the first step towards a process of truth and reconciliation on the model of South Africa and apartheid or Germany and the Holocaust. His ambition is that each of the 800 counties where lynchings occurred will set up their own copy of the rusted steel monument, which in turn will encourage an end to the silence and the beginning of discussion and healing. There is undoubtedly healing needed in the Alabama town of Gadsden. Vanessa Croft said that the impact of her uncle’s flight had a lasting impact on her family. Six of her other uncles followed Fred’s example and exiled themselves from the state, joining the Great Migration in which 6 million black people fled north and west in part to avoid the lynching terror to cities such as New York, Detroit, Milwaukee or Los Angeles. The Great Migration: states’ changing black population over six decades Vanessa’s father was the only one of seven brothers who remained in Alabama. Fred went on to have a good life in New York. He loved Harlem, worked in hotels, raised three boys of his own. He died in 1977, before Vanessa Croft had learned about his reason for leaving. When Croft heard the story of what had happened to her uncle, and to Bunk Richardson before him, she was shaken up. “Gadsden is a beautiful place. But this was horrifying. How could people be so cruel?” Details of Richardson’s death in particular haunted her. She kept turning over in her mind the knowledge that he had been so terrified when the mob dragged him to the bridge that his legs buckled beneath him. “I started to think and look at the people of my town differently,” she said. “This mob, it was made up of the leaders of our town, the doctors, the lawyers, the teachers. To do something this terrible, you wonder where does that come from.” And you wonder where did it go. “I think of the people I interact with on a daily basis, and I think to myself. Could you still do that today? Could you do that to me?” • This article was amended on 18 May 2018.

That’s when lunch starts for the youngest children and it is pure excitement; the kind you used to have when horizons were short, days were long and nothing else needed bothering about. First comes the babble of voices, far bigger than the little bodies that follow, swaddled in plump anoraks despite the sun outside. They take crockery, these four- and five-year-olds who, back in September, didn’t know how to hold a knife and fork – and get down to the serious business of choosing. Behind the counter stands Sheena Fineran: black hat, big specs, magenta polo and, after 30 years as a dinner lady, in complete mastery of her domain. “When I started, it was lumpy mash. It was liver. It was cheap, fried, nasty food. “Today we’re the best.” Oldham’s school meals are high quality, wholesome and prize-winning. “What I see now – that’s what I’d give my family.” Almost everything in these serving trays has been cooked from scratch this morning in the school’s own kitchen. That roast chicken comes from one of 14 birds that Fineran came in at 6am to roast and strip, singeing her own fingers as she did so. The fish cake is baked with catch certified by the Marine Stewardship Council. More options are laid out here than in most office canteens I’ve visited and, from the carrots up, as much of the food as possible is organic and locally sourced. Then a boy far shorter and shyer than the rest reaches the front of the queue. “How are you, sweetie?” Fineran crouches to infant eye level. Asif (not his real name) had a kidney transplant two years ago and she looks out for him. “Would you like … ” – a pause, as all good treats deserve – “a flapjack? Or would you like … a biscuit? Or would you like … ” and she reels off practically a stall’s worth of fresh fruit. A whisper comes back: “Pineapple.” “I bet there’s some hiding,” laughs a colleague, and Fineran bustles off to root it out. Any council would be proud of serving meals that prompt children to present teachers their cleaned-out plates as if they were sports day trophies – but to see what makes this daily ballet such a vast achievement you need to contrast it with those carrying lunchboxes. From one, a boy of seven pulls out some kebab and processed cheese. A few tables down sits a girl chewing stiff chicken nuggets. Others turn up with cold toast or last night’s chips. Some children come to school on an empty stomach and go home to no supper. Headteacher Rebecca Howarth runs a breakfast club and makes sure they get double lunches, even though it comes out of her shrinking budget. “We’ll find some way to do it. You can’t have children going hungry. I can’t.” In 2016 the Office for National Statistics found Oldham to be the poorest town in England . In some of its neighbourhoods, a boy born today can expect to die soon after he hits 70. His counterpart raised just off London’s swanky Brompton Road would be forecast to live until he is 96. In one of the richest societies in human history, something as simple as being born into the wrong class in the wrong town can knock more than 25 years off your life. As mementoes of its industrial, radical past, Oldham has some beautiful redbrick buildings. What it lacks is cash. While Fineran and I are chatting, one of her colleagues comes over to ask whether it’s true that Theresa May is going to scrap free school meals for the under-sevens. When she hears not, her relief is like the sun breaking through clouds: her own boy starts reception this September. What are poor children worth? What do they deserve? The official answer is everything, just like every other child. The reality is that hundreds of thousands of children across Britain go hungry now. Headteachers report grey-skinned pupils “filling their pockets” at the school canteen, while London GPs treat youngsters with that Victorian disease caused by poor diet, rickets. Yet in Oldham the school dinner service runs on the principle that those who have the least also deserve the best possible. It delivers that within very tight budgets, spending a rock-bottom 65p on food for every meal and charging a mere £2.10. For that price it serves up a menu that’s about 20% organic, with much else sourced regionally. The department runs community cookery classes for parents. Among the awards for the quality and sustainability of its produce, it’s the only council in the north-west to have won the Food for Life gold mark, “the Michelin stars for ingredient quality”, according to Rob Percival of the Soil Association. Even Jamie Oliver, who almost single-handedly killed the Turkey Twizzler, has sighed: “Feeding your kid right is all considered very posh and middle class.” Yet here it is, happening in the poorest nook of England – and not in some bijou cafe serving 20 foodies and their Instagram accounts, but a municipal office with 86 school kitchens dishing out 17,000 meals a day. Without a council subsidy, the service has to pay its way and it competes with the likes of Compass, also tendering for local school contracts. So what’s the magic formula? Whoever you ask, it comes down to two words: Anne Burns. Head of Oldham’s school dinner department, she’s also “a force of nature”, says public food academic Kevin Morgan. Visitors from Manchester mayor Andy Burnham’s office, who want the rest of the area to learn from Oldham’s example on school meals, tell her: “If only we could cut you up into pieces and spread you around.” Anyone slicing into Burns would immediately find two things: an expertise on food and a love of animals. Having done school dinners for 40 years, since training as a cook aged 16, she abhors “ping meals” and “plastic food”. When “Jamie started shaking the tree” and campaigning for better school meals in the middle of the last decade, he found a ready audience in the recently-promoted Burns. On the office noticeboard is a page from Chat magazine headlined “Saved by my dog!” It tells the story of how, early one morning three years ago, Burns began spewing blood and mucus before passing out. Only her sleek brown weimaraner, Alice (one of her six dogs and seven cats at the time) brought her round by licking her face and smacking her with her paws. Rushing her into hospital theatre, the surgeon declared: “I should be signing your death certificate.” She needs that toughness, arguing for better food in a council that can always find uses for spare money and is staffed largely by men in suits. As if to exemplify their outsider status, she and her team of women, with 125 years’ catering experience between them, work out of a bungalow plonked next to the town hall. It’s a Cinderella service, as school catering is across the country, but as she tells her team: “Tonight, girls, Cinderella’s off to the ball!” More profoundly, Burns is a public servant who looks, sounds and understands the public she serves. Born just down the road in Rochdale, she still lives there – and in over four decades she’s only ever worked for two local authorities. Mum a housewife, dad a painter-decorator who, at 80, still does the odd job. The family home had no phone, but when she remembers her “normal working-class” childhood, it’s of camping all summer long and cricket matches that lasted weeks. She wasn’t raised to be second best, nor does she expect it of the children she feeds. “Those kiddies are our future,” she says. “They’re the most important people. Without them, where do we go?” Contrast that plaintiveness with the high-flier who hops from council to consultancy and whose main job is to tell the residents who pay his salary how terrible their lifestyles are and how their homes need to be replaced with luxury flats. When Burns began altering her menu, by far and away her department’s main supplier was Brakes. Yet the giant multinational was far too big to accommodate the diet fads of some new manager at a town council. Organic wholemeal flour? Brakes was never going to keep a pallet exclusively for Oldham’s use. Which left a gap in the market for small independents, such as TC Meats. Walk into its offices and you’re in no doubt about the chief topic of conversation. Above the factory is a shrine to Manchester United’s Wayne Rooney that presumably doubles as a workplace: a giant poster hails ‘The Maradona of Manchester’, a signed shirt is on the wall, and his neon-yellow boots sit in a glass box on the boss’s coffee table. Some faceless conglomerate this is not. TC Meats sorted out Burns with organic beef and milk and, after a bit of phoning around, it also found a farm selling organic eggs. And why wouldn’t they make the effort? Unlike at Brakes, TC Meats needs Oldham for a big chunk of business. Together with a fruit and veg distributor in Preston, these two relatively local firms have taken a far bigger share of Burns’ budget – while she knows exactly where her produce is coming from. The depth of those partnerships means that Burns can sometimes lean on her suppliers to keep her costs within budget. This is localism with a small “l”. It keeps public money close to home and uses it to grow the local economy; and it’s why Morgan describes Burns as “a heroine of public-sector innovation”. For Burns, it’s a choice made not out of ideology but pragmatism. “When the horsemeat scandal came, I slept soundly in my bed,” she says. “We don’t serve stuff from the other side of the world. We know exactly where it comes from.” This can be hard, especially now that the recent Brexit-induced swoon of the pound is pushing up food prices. Soil Association surveys suggest that fresh veg prices have gone up 20% over the past 12 months, while some yoghurt has jumped 60%. Burns moans about “crazy, crazy” prices for cheese and is having to trim the proportion of organic product she serves in her meals. And while making everything from scratch is now a given, she remembers the first time the kitchen staff tried to make sponge cakes. “Oh my god! We had sponges this high [her hand rises to the level of a toddler]. We had them this low [half an inch off her desk]. But now it’s the norm. Home-baked biscuits, lasagnes, curries. We take pride in what we’re producing.” At Stanley Road primary, Fineran and her team are dishing out for the 10-year-olds. Do the students really care whether their potatoes are organic or their fish is sustainably sourced? “For me, it’s an expense; for them it’s an education. We’re giving these kids a good start here,” says Fineran. “I see them come in aged four and go at 11, and it’s an absolute joy to see them doing brilliantly in maths and English and socialising. It’s like watching my children. It’s an achievement to which I’ve contributed a small part. “We’re deprived – but we’re not.” • Aditya Chakrabortty is senior economics commentator for the Guardian Join Aditya below the line at noon (BST) today (Wednesday 25 April) for a special discussion of this piece and the Alternatives series."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"education/2018/apr/24/minister-vows-to-focus-laser-like-on-vice-chancellor-pay-university-renumeration","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T18:00:46Z","webTitle":"Minister vows to focus 'laser-like' on vice-chancellor pay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/24/minister-vows-to-focus-laser-like-on-vice-chancellor-pay-university-renumeration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/apr/24/minister-vows-to-focus-laser-like-on-vice-chancellor-pay-university-renumeration","fields":{"headline":"Minister vows to focus 'laser-like' on vice-chancellor pay","bodyText":"The universities minister, Sam Gyimah, has pledged to focus “laser-like” on the issue of vice-chancellor pay during questioning from MPs. He was giving evidence to the education select committee as part of its inquiry into value for money in higher education amid mounting concern about the inflated salaries of university leaders and the growing debts burden on graduates. Gyimah told MPs that steps were being taken to remove university leaders from remuneration committees to prevent them setting their own pay. “What happened before was that vice-chancellors sat on the remuneration committee and they would obviously recuse themselves when their own pay was being discussed,” he said. “But even in FTSE 100 companies you can’t sit on a remuneration panel and say: ‘I wasn’t in the room so it’s nothing to do with me.’ They should not be allowed to set their own pay – and that’s action on pay.” The issue of vice-chancellor pay has been a source of growing irritation for the government, which has been accused of not doing enough to cap excessive salaries by many commentators including Labour’s former education minister Andrew Adonis. Last November, Dame Glynis Breakwell announced her resignation as vice-chancellor of the University of Bath after it emerged she earned £475,000 in salary and benefits last year. Gyimah told the committee on Tuesday: “I’m not going to defend vice-chancellor pay. What I have said is that personally I’m intensely relaxed about vice-chancellors earning more than I do as the universities minister. I understand that. “They run large complex organisations and we need people who are capable of doing that. But they are also public institutions. They are in receipt of tax payers’ funds and they should be mindful of that.” Guardian research shows that vice-chancellor pay far outstrips that of their peers in senior leadership roles in the public sector, including NHS hospital trusts and local authorities. The £185,000 pay of the chief executive of Birmingham city council – the largest local authority in Europe, with gross annual expenditure of £3bn – was found to be less than half that of the University of Birmingham’s vice-chancellor, Sir David Eastwood, on £378,000. The minister told the committee the newly established Office for Students had “a real focus” on top pay. He added that universities would in future be required to publish the number of staff earning a basic salary of more than £100,000 as part of their audited financial statements, with details of bonuses, pension contributions and taxable benefits of anyone earning more than £150,000. “It’s not just transparency in terms of sharing the numbers, we want to see a justification for the total remuneration package for the head of the provider and the provider’s most senior staff, so they’ve got to explain why that person deserves that pay package.” The committee, including its Conservative chair, Robert Halfon, pressed the minister on continuing deep-seated inequalities in the sector and low graduate salaries. Gyimah acknowledged there were problems within the system and that these were being looked at in the government’s post-18 review. But he defended the continuing value of a degree and claimed that new figures for graduate salaries show “the graduate premium is still strong and still holds”. He told MPs that Department for Education statistics published on Tuesday showed that graduate salaries were holding up, increasing by £1,000 to £33,000 over the course of last year. He also revealed that 65.5% of graduates were in high-skilled employment in 2017 compared with 22.2% of non-graduates, and that graduates earned an average of £10,000 more than non-graduates, while postgraduates earned an average of £6,000 more than graduates."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/apr/21/should-we-get-a-two-year-fixed-rate-mortgage","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"Should we get a two-year fixed-rate mortgage?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/21/should-we-get-a-two-year-fixed-rate-mortgage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/apr/21/should-we-get-a-two-year-fixed-rate-mortgage","fields":{"headline":"Should we get a two-year fixed-rate mortgage?","bodyText":"Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.

The manufacturer would not confirm any job losses, although local reports suggested long-serving staff could be asked to take voluntary redundancy. The Unite union said it had been assured there would be no compulsory redundancies at the site, which employs 7,000 people. A source with knowledge of the situation said “hundreds” of jobs were likely to go at Sunderland, which makes Nissan’s Qashqai and Juke models, as well as the electric Leaf. Nissan sales in Britain have fallen by more than a third so far in 2018, a substantial drop even in a dismal year for the industry, where overall demand has declined by 12%. European sales figures released this week showed Nissan, which exports eight out of 10 of its UK-made cars, had sold only 75,000 vehicles across the continent in March, down from 91,000 in the same month in 2017. Across the UK car industry, diesel sales have dropped by a third this year. Nissan said that the job cuts would be short-term as it prepared to build versions of its Qashqi, Juke, Infinity and the new X-Trail using new technology. A spokeswoman said: “As previously communicated, we are transitioning to a new range of powertrains over the next year. As we make the operational changes required to support this, we will be managing a planned short-term reduction in powertrain supply and plant volumes in line with our 2018 business plan. We are now discussing these operational changes with our employees.” Steve Bush, a Unite official, said: “Unite has been assured that any job reductions will be on a voluntary basis and on enhanced terms. “Over the coming weeks, we will be giving our members maximum support and ensuring that they can make informed choices about their future. We expect to see temporary workers at the plant move into permanent positions as volumes pick up again in future years.” The Nissan spokeswoman said the move was “absolutely nothing to do with Brexit. We do expect volumes to increase again”. Last week, Jaguar Land Rover said it would be cutting around 1,000 jobs and reducing the output of two of its factories in the West Midlands, a decision it attributed to the “continuing headwinds” affecting the industry, namely Brexit and diesel. JLR’s sales across Europe have fallen proportionately more than Nissan’s in the past year, down from 45,000 to 35,000 this March. Also last week, Vauxhall said it was terminating the contracts of all its 326 dealerships in Britain – which employ 12,000 people – amid falling sales, including diesel cars, although it said it did not expect heavy job losses from the move. The motor industry has repeatedly warned that Brexit uncertainty would lead to reduced investment and production decisions being deferred. However, Nissan was one of the first manufacturers after the referendum to announce it would continue to make new models in Britain, despite industry fears over tariffs and frictionless trade with Europe. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has blamed the sharp drop in sales partly on what it describes as the “demonisation” of diesel and government tax policy deterring consumers from buying new diesels. A small tax increase on diesels that came into force this month appears to have signalled the fuel’s fall from favour, as concerns over air quality have come to the fore. Restrictions on diesels are expected to be be brought in for several cities in Britain, along with outright bans in some European urban areas, within the next five to seven years. David Bailey, a professor of industrial strategy at Aston University, said: “Certainly there is a massive shift away from diesels across Europe. There is a perfect storm combining dieselgate, legislative changes and the reduction in resale values for owners of the cars. “Nissan are exposed to that, as about 25% of what Nissan produce up in Sunderland is diesel. But they have a lot of hybrid technology after the takeover of Mitsubishi which we can expect to see more of, as well as the electric technology behind the Leaf, so I think they are well positioned to see through this temporary shock.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/20/manchester-united-tottenham-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T14:27:27Z","webTitle":"Manchester United v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/20/manchester-united-tottenham-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/20/manchester-united-tottenham-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview","bodyText":"This is it for Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur as José Mourinho and Mauricio Pochettino’s men hope to reach the FA Cup final and claim an all-important trophy.

The disclosure came following the release of memos written by former FBI director James Comey late on Thursday, which detailed his interactions with Trump over the four-month period before he was fired by the president while overseeing the federal investigation into Russian interference in the US election. In the memos, which were released to Congress by the justice department at the request of Republican investigators, Comey wrote that Trump criticized Flynn during a private dinner for having “serious judgment issues”. Trump cited Flynn’s failure to immediately inform him of a call from a world leader, whose identity was redacted in the memos but confirmed to be Putin on Friday by the Associated Press and other outlets. According to Comey’s account, Putin’s call was brought to Trump’s attention during a lunch with the British prime minister, Theresa May. Trump had just thanked May for being the first foreign leader to call and congratulate him following his inauguration when Flynn interjected to say Putin had been first to call. Flynn said a return call to Putin had been scheduled, Comey wrote, but that Trump was furious over the delay. “Flynn said the return call was scheduled for Saturday, which prompted a heated reply from the president that six days was not an appropriate period of time to return a call from the [redacted] of a country like [redacted],” Comey wrote. “This isn’t [redacted] we’re talking about,” added Trump. The New York Times had previously reported that Flynn scheduled Trump’s meeting with May before his return call to Putin out of “protocol” to accommodate a US ally. Flynn was forced to resign as Trump’s national security adviser in February 2017 after misleading the vice-president over the nature of his communications with Sergey Kislyak, who at the time served as the Russian ambassador to the US. Flynn has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is said to be cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. In his memos, Comey documented what he interpreted as a request from Trump that the FBI drop its investigation into Flynn. Comey also recalls being asked by the then White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, if Flynn was under surveillance. Comey wrote that he urged the White House to ask such questions through proper channels. The Comey memos are a critical piece of Mueller’s investigation, which centers not only on Russian meddling in the election but also whether the president sought to obstruct justice. Trump has denied Comey’s version of events, but also acknowledged that his decision to fire the former FBI director was made in part due to “this Russia thing”. After the memos were made public, Trump defended Flynn on Twitter while continuing to denounce Comey. “So General Michael Flynn’s life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written),” Trump wrote on Friday. He added: “Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don’t think so!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/12/the-secret-to-sharing-household-chores-fairly-with-your-partner","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T08:29:25Z","webTitle":"The secret to… sharing household chores fairly with your partner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/12/the-secret-to-sharing-household-chores-fairly-with-your-partner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/12/the-secret-to-sharing-household-chores-fairly-with-your-partner","fields":{"headline":"The secret to… sharing household chores fairly with your partner","bodyText":"When you first move in together you’re often too caught up with all the loveliness to talk about who does what. But it’s often the first thing to cause trouble. So, talk about what you grew up with. This might help you realise that the other person isn’t being annoying or thoughtless. Decide on the basic necessities that need to be done, and how often. Pinpoint any differences. It’s not fair that one person cooks every night just because they get home before the other. If one of you is at home full-time, it’s not fair to expect them to do it all either. Set a time and a limit for chores. Don’t hover – let them get on with it. Even allow them to do it badly. Acceptance and flexibility are important. Have realistic expectations. If you want the silver polished, but you’re the only one who cares, that’s your job. Don’t play games – if your partner isn’t pulling their weight, tell them and ask for help. Starting your own game of “Let’s See If They Notice How Filthy The Bathroom Is” won’t work. You’ll end up doing it. Then you’ll be cross with yourself – and your partner. If you have children, get them to do chores, but never pay them. Don’t try to make it fun, because it probably won’t be. They might moan, but it’s important they understand how to contribute to the running of the house. Don’t feel guilty if you can afford to pay for a cleaner. Stop being a martyr. And if you don’t have a dishwasher, get one. Just don’t interfere when it’s not your turn to load it.

We are sitting at a small table in the middle of an otherwise empty room in a stylish Paris hotel. Eyes closed, her hand tracing a repeated arc in the air, she enunciates every word as if teaching a hapless pupil – “J’avoue j’en ai bavé, pas vous…” she intones softly, “Avant d’avoir eu vent de vous…” These seductive lines, she says, are the perfect example of the “sonority” of a song lyric, the elusive element she values above almost all else in her music. “For me, everything begins with the melody,” she says, growing animated. “Without the melody, there can be no words, but I also need this sonority, this poetic sound that the words make when they combine with the melody. This has always been my obsession. I know that I am very limited vocally, but I also know why I am still here – it is purely because I am so selective when finding the melodies.” As the sad, sonorous songs on her new album, Personne d’Autre, attest, Françoise Hardy is very much still here. At 74, she occupies a singular place in pop culture, being both an enduring style icon – in January this year, Vogue celebrated her birthday with a feature entitled “10 style lessons to take from Françoise Hardy for the season ahead” – and a singer whose songs have lent themselves to constant re-evaluation by several generations of fans and critics alike. She has collaborated with Blur and Iggy Pop and has a fondness for the music of the Jesus and Mary Chain and cult Brooklyn band Cigarettes After Sex, whose sound, she says, “I have been looking for all my life”. She cites her 1971 album, La question, a collaboration with the late Brazilian musician Tuca, as her personal favourite of her own recordings, and it remains a classic among her fans for its lyrical sensuality and sophisticated arrangements. Her songs and her limited voice have taken her further than she ever expected to go, given that she was a somewhat reluctant pop star from the start, a singer who hated many of the early recordings that made her name. Hardy shot to fame in the mid-1960s with a million-selling debut single, Tous les garçons et les filles, a song whose chorus, I suggest, had that lyrical sonority she rates so highly. “Oh no!” she exclaims, looking momentarily horrified. “I was so young then and untutored. I did not know anything about this stuff. Absolutely nothing. Some of those early songs are just terrible. At that time, musical sophistication was really very far from my mind.” Nevertheless, the hit singles flowed throughout the decade, she released a dozen bestselling albums in France, and her face appeared on Paris Match and other magazines so regularly that she became the French cover girl of the 1960s. Fifty years on, she still exudes a quintessentially French elegance. She is dressed in a simple black T-shirt and tailored black jacket over dark blue jeans. Her signature fringe and long hair having long since given way to a chic, snow-white bob, and a crimson silk kerchief offsets her ivory pale skin. There is a calmness about her that is palpable and perhaps spiritual – in response to my proffered hand, she responds with a Zen-like bow, her hands clasped together as if in prayer. She is a survivor in more ways than one, having come through a long battle with lymphoma that, four years ago, saw her taken to hospital in a coma after a fall. Her life hung in the balance for several weeks until, with her son’s permission, the doctors tried a new kind of chemotherapy. Last year, in a television interview, she spoke of her almost miraculous recovery with mixed feelings: “I regretted waking up because I almost had the death I was dreaming about. So the question I asked myself when I woke up was: ‘Why this reprieve?’” Today, she looks thin but healthy, her eyes radiating a quizzical alertness that can be almost unsettling when she occasionally fixes you with a slightly reproving stare. “I don’t really like what journalists do with what I tell them,” she tells me as if by way of warning, “but it’s not a problem and, anyway, it makes for an entertaining break.” Hardy’s new album is an unapologetically melancholic affair, that sonorous voice delivering songs that, in her characteristically impressionistic way, articulate love lost, regret and mortality. “Time is accelerating nowhere,” she sings on Un seul geste (A Single Gesture), while both Train spécial and Le large (Sail Away) sound like wistful goodbyes. Is it an album about growing older? “Not intentionally,” she says after a pause, “but, in a way, yes, since that is what is happening. I always write about the same subjects, but when you are 74 you become more reflective. Also, you cannot sing the same kind of lyrics as when you were 20 or 30. That would be somehow undignified. For some people, of course, it does not matter, but for me it does.” There are a couple of songs, I suggest, that seem to deal directly with mortality and her acceptance of the same. “Yes,” she says, “but I sing about death in a very symbolic and even positive way. There is an acceptance there, too. For instance, there is a song called Special Train, which I like very much, but at my age, I can really only sing about that one very special train that will take me out of this world. But, of course, I am also hoping that it will send me to the stars and help me discover the mystery of the cosmos.” (Hardy’s other abiding interest is astrology: she has written two books on the subject and also gives readings based on an individual’s astrological birth charts.) On other songs, particularly the regretful A cache cache (Hide and Seek) and the plaintive Seras tu la? (Will You Be There?), written by the late Michel Berger, she seems to be addressing her lyrics to an absent partner. She mulls this over for a long moment. “They are maybe not directed at someone in particular,” she says, “but often I think of the past I had with my husband. What inspires me is a mixture of the memories of the past I had with him and the feelings I have today.” She is referring to the 1960s pop heart-throb turned actor Jacques Dutronc, from whom she is separated but not divorced, and who spends most of his time in their Corsican villa. They have a son, Thomas, who is an accomplished guitarist and her sometime collaborator. “The songs are not always biographical,” she elaborates, “but sometimes the melody can take you to places you did not mean to go – or even want to go.” From the very beginning of her career, Hardy exuded an indefinable otherness, which set her apart from her contemporaries, singers like Johnny Hallyday and France Gall, whose manufactured sound defined the yé-yé style that characterised French pop in the early 1960s. Her songs, however jaunty they sounded, often evinced a kind of dreamy sadness – “I walk down the streets, my soul in sorrow” runs a line in her debut hit single, Tous les garçons et les filles. That wistfulness contrasted nicely with her perfectly pitched style, poise and captivating beauty. It was a combination that caused a generation of male adolescents on both sides of the Channel to fall head over heels in love with her – or, more precisely, with the idea of her that the songs suggested. That she seemed to be blithely unconcerned by their adoration, and apparently unaware of her own beauty, only added to her allure. Hardy’s classic record covers from the 1960s, styled and shot by her then partner, photographer Jean-Marie Périer, often feature her unsmiling face, hair falling over her shoulders, eyes fixed on some distant point beyond the camera. Though she did not hang out with the bohemians and intellectuals of the rive gauche, there was nevertheless something about her persona that chimed with the romantic existentialism of the time. In 1966, Jean-Luc Godard cast her in a cameo in Masculin féminin, a defining New Wave film brimming with contemporary pop culture references, from Bob Dylan to James Bond. As her fame grew, she drew the attention of Mick Jagger, who described her in an interview as his ideal woman, and Bob Dylan, who included a beat poem to her on the sleeve of his fourth album, 1964’s Another Side of Bob Dylan – “for françoise hardy/at the seine’s edge/a giant shadow/of notre dame/seeks t’ grab my foot/sorbonne students/whirl by on thin bicycles...” For women, she was a role model of a different kind. “There was a French singer, Françoise Hardy,” the New York-born singer-songwriter Carly Simon recalled later. “I used to look at her pictures and try to dress like her.” Her otherness, Hardy says, began in childhood. Born in Nazi-occupied Paris in 1944, her early years were marked by an absent, emotionally withdrawn father, and a mother who, she says, “lived the life of a nun”. In the immediate postwar years, after her parents’ separation, her mother worked long hours to pay for her daughter’s convent education. “My mother was a solitary figure who did not really have any friends,” she tells me, matter-of-factly. “At the weekends, my sister and I were sent to my grandparents’ house and that was it. The atmosphere was so strict and there was a lot of shame perhaps to do with my parents’ separation. My grandmother told me repeatedly that I was unattractive and a very bad person, which makes you think as a child that you will never meet anyone. It is hard even now for me to understand why she was like that.” Was pop music initially an escape from that cloistered, claustrophobic family dynamic? “No, it was more what we call in France a coup de foudre [thunderbolt] in every sense of the word. It was unexpected and it was love at first sight.” She recounts how her mother pressurised her absent father to buy her a gift as a reward for excelling at the baccalaureate [the French school diploma]. “I was younger than any pupil in my year and yet I somehow achieved the highest marks.” At that time, in her mid-teens, she was “obsessed” with Radio Luxembourg, listening nightly to the pop songs it broadcast from Britain and America, in thrall to the stars of the pre-Beatles era: Elvis, Brenda Lee, Rosemary Clooney, Marty Wilde, Billy Fury and Cliff Richard. “I will never know why I chose a guitar because a transistor radio was all I ever wanted,” she says, still looking perplexed. “Plus, I knew absolutely nothing about how to play the guitar, so I was astonished to find that I could make so much from just three chords.” She began writing songs obsessively in her bedroom, sometimes knocking out three or four in a week. “Really, those three chords produced most of my songs for the next 10 years.” Despite her acute shyness and lack of confidence, she willed herself to attend an open audition hosted by Pathé Marconi, then France’s premier record label. “It’s difficult to explain,” she says, frowning, “but even though I did not think I was very good, I somehow needed to have that confirmed. I needed to be told that I should give up. Also, I knew that if I did not take this chance, however humiliating the result might be, that I would regret it for the rest of my life. That is really how I found the courage to go.” The audition was not a success, but neither was it the failure she anticipated – “I left feeling so happy that I had not been thrown out quickly.” She persevered, attending other auditions and soon afterwards, in 1961, she was offered a contract by the Disques Vogue record label. Her initial studio session lasted less than four hours and produced five finished songs. To her horror, the label chose a lightweight pop confection, Oh oh chéri, composed by Johnny Hallyday’s songwriting team, as the A-side of her debut single. But it was her self-penned song, Tous les garçons et les filles, that the radio stations and the public responded to. Released in 1962, it sold 2m copies in France and in Britain it just failed to make the top 20. Suddenly, aged 18 and still a shy convent schoolgirl at heart, Hardy became France’s biggest pop star. “I listened to that record and I was so dissatisfied,” she says, “and I have been dissatisfied very often ever since.” In 1963, her frustration with the formulaic nature of French pop was such that she insisted on recording in London. There, she found a producer, Charles Blackwell, and a group of session musicians who listened to what she had to say. “I was happy from that moment,” she says. “I was free to make another kind of music, not this mechanical music I had been trapped in.” She returned to London over the next few years to record and also to play a concert at the Savoy, where she made one of her last ever live appearances in 1968. “If I could sing like Céline Dion, it would have been different,” she said years later. In London, too, she mixed with the new pop royalty, having dinner “with two Beatles” and receiving regular visits at her hotel from a smitten Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones. Her then partner, Jean-Marie Périer, knew everyone on the London pop scene, but was seldom around due to his busy schedule. “I think I was a source of fascination for the English pop musicians,” she says, laughing her still girlish laugh. “I heard much later that there was a rumour that I was a lesbian, but really I was just shy and unsure. When Brian Jones introduced me to his girlfriend, Anita Pallenberg, I was very flattered and charmed, but then I heard that they were each trying to figure out which one of them I was interested in sexually. Of course, this was the very last thing I was interested in. I was unbelievably innocent.” In Paris, in 1966, two years after Dylan had penned his mysterious poem to her, she famously crossed paths with him when he played the Olympia theatre on his first electric tour. Afterwards, she and Johnny Hallyday went to a gathering in Dylan’s suite at the opulent George V hotel. “It was truly a shock to see him,” she says, still looking perturbed after all these years. “He looked even worse than he did backstage. So thin, so pale, so strange. I honestly thought he did not have long to live.” At one point, a very strung-out Dylan beckoned her into his bedroom, where he placed his latest record, Blonde on Blonde, on the turntable and played her two songs: I Want You and Just Like a Woman. His intentions, I suggest, could hardly have been clearer. “I know,” she says, hooting with laughter, “but I was too busy listening intently to the songs, which sounded like something entirely different to anything I had heard before. Plus, I was so impressed and petrified to meet him. Maybe if he had sung the songs to me, I would have got it.” She then tells me a remarkable story. A few years ago, she says, an American couple made contact with her after years of trying. Back in the 1960s, they had owned a cafe in New York where Dylan used to go daily to compose lyrics. They told her that he had left behind some typewritten drafts, and two of them were letters about her. She now has them in her possession. “So, this is how, only a year or so ago, I realise that in the early 60s, Bob Dylan maybe really had a romantic fixation on me – as only young people can have.” Can she reveal anything of what he wrote to her? “Oh, no, no. Never could I do that. I can say that the two drafts are very moving, but I cannot reveal what they say. Also I don’t understand everything of what he has written. I do think, from the poem he wrote, which I did not take too seriously at the time, and now these letters, that I had quite a place in his mind at that time and even in his heart. I think maybe I was very serious for him. And, it moves me very much.” Françoise Hardy still remains something of an enigma, a singer still unconvinced of her singular gift and the effect it has had on those who fell under her spell. “It has always been a big surprise to me that people, even very good musicians, were moved by my voice,” she says. “I know its limitations, I always have. But I have chosen carefully. What a person sings is an expression of what they are. Luckily for me, the most beautiful songs are not happy songs. The songs we remember are the sad, romantic songs.” Personne d’autre is out now on Parlophone France"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/20/rugby-union-leinster-munster-james-ryan-racing-92-scarlets","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T21:00:33Z","webTitle":"Leinster’s James Ryan spearheads twin Irish assault on Champions Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/20/rugby-union-leinster-munster-james-ryan-racing-92-scarlets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/20/rugby-union-leinster-munster-james-ryan-racing-92-scarlets","fields":{"headline":"Leinster’s James Ryan spearheads twin Irish assault on Champions Cup","bodyText":"It bears repeating that James Ryan, the Leinster and Ireland lock, is yet to lose a senior first-team match for club or country. It is now 19 and counting for the 21-year-old who began the season with more Ireland caps than Leinster appearances, and may finish it with a grand slam, Pro14 title and a Champions Cup winners medal. Ryan is part of the crop of Irish youngsters emerging from age-grade level tailor-made for the big stage. Not all have his impeccable record but they do not experience defeat often and, having swept all before them in the pool stages and overpowered Saracens in the last eight, Leinster face Scarlets in Saturday’s semi-final as the favourites, not least because it takes place at the Aviva Stadium, their second home. Ryan has dismissed any suggestions he is a lucky charm but considering he attended all three of Leinster’s European Cup final wins – in 2009, 2011 and 2012 – as a supporter, there is a sizeable body of evidence to the contrary. “We’re lucky at Leinster at the moment in that there are a lot of lads coming through, it’s all over the country,” said Ryan. “It’s very positive to have the younger lads coming through to push the older heads. There’s a lot of work being done at the moment on the schools game and the club game, a lot of people put a lot of time into that.” Much has been made of their “home advantage” – the Scarlets centre Scott Williams described it as “not exactly a neutral venue, it’s basically Leinster’s home ground” – and while Ryan acknowledges it works in his side’s favour, he knows better than to look towards Bilbao and a potential showdown against Munster in what would be a further demonstration of Irish rugby’s current might. After the two-times defending champions Saracens were knocked out, English involvement is conspicuous by its absence but the flag is flown by Stuart Lancaster, whose renaissance since carrying the can for the 2015 World Cup debacle continues apace. “He’s had a big influence on the squad,” added Ryan. “He likes us to express ourselves and play that ball-in-hand Leinster rugby. He wants us to show people what we can do and what we’ve got. He encourages us to back ourselves and when it’s on to have a go. He tells us to go for it.” Robbie Henshaw returns for Leinster but the New Zealand wing James Lowe is omitted because of restrictions on non-European players. For the Scarlets, Rhys Patchell lines up at full-back with Leigh Halfpenny on the wing and Dan Jones named at fly-half. Munster, meanwhile, face Racing 92 in Bordeaux after both teams emerged from the same pool, each winning their home matches against the other. Munster, who were beaten in the semi-finals last year and who last reached the final in 2008, welcome back Keith Earls from a knee injury. Simon Zebo, who joins Racing next season, is on the bench while Dan Carter also has to make do with a place among the replacements for the French side with Pat Lambie preferred at fly-half."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/20/hammond-brexit-transition-deal-city-job-losses-uk-economy-imf","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T16:04:02Z","webTitle":"Hammond: Brexit transition deal has averted City job losses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/20/hammond-brexit-transition-deal-city-job-losses-uk-economy-imf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/20/hammond-brexit-transition-deal-city-job-losses-uk-economy-imf","fields":{"headline":"Hammond: Brexit transition deal has averted City job losses","bodyText":"A damaging haemorrhage of jobs from the City has been averted by the signing of a Brexit transition agreement between the UK and the EU, according to an upbeat assessment of the economy’s prospects from Philip Hammond. Speaking in Washington, the chancellor said the mood among big US-owned financial institutions was much more positive than it had been before London and Brussels agreed to a 21-month implementation period after the UK officially leaves the EU next March. “I have been in New York this week meeting the major players in the financial sector,” said Hammond. “We have been in constant contact since autumn 2016. They are not putting out the bunting but they are much more relaxed.” Hammond said firms had taken precautionary measures but were delaying taking any further steps. “They have seen the commitments on an implementation period and they are waiting to see how we deliver that,” he added. “We have dammed the flow and avoided what could have been a haemorrhaging of jobs from the UK into the EU.” The chancellor said the implementation period was especially important for regulated sectors of the UK economy such as financial services, pharmaceuticals and aviation. Hammond’s comments came during the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund. The IMF said this week that the UK was one of the few developed countries not to be benefiting from the global upswing in growth. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, dampened expectations of an increase in official interest rates next month by pointing out that the recent economic data had been softer than expected. Carney’s comments led to a fall in the value of the pound. Hammond, who has faced criticism since becoming chancellor for being too downbeat about the economy, said he was optimistic that the UK would outperform the forecasts for growth of about 1.5% from both the IMF and the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. “I am Tigger-ish,” Hammond said. “We have passed an important milestone. Debt is falling as a percentage of GDP. At last we have got to the point where debt is going down. Inflation has fallen sharply and earnings are continuing to rise so we are back to rising real wages. The most important metric for ordinary families is real wage growth.” Hammond, who backed remain during the 2016 referendum, said Brexit had led to a dampening of UK growth. “I have constantly said that the Brexit vote and the process that flows from it is a source of uncertainty,” he said. “The reaction to that uncertainty is to slow investment and that’s what we’ve seen. “Business investment is lower than it would otherwise have been. Consumers have been more cautious than they otherwise would have been. We have a very tight labour market but wage pressures are lower than might have been expected. “I recognise that forecasts for the economy reflect that uncertainty. Our challenge is to deliver a positive shock, a better outcome than is priced in to the OBR forecast. I am confident that later in the year we will be able to do that.” In the wake of this week’s House of Lords vote calling on the government to investigate the possibility of the UK staying in a customs union with the EU, Hammond said: “I do not think staying in the customs union or a customs union is the solution for the UK, but a very close customs relationship with the EU should be part of any future agreement to avoid tariff barriers.” The chancellor said there were two constraints for the government – avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and ensuring the free flow of goods between Dover and Calais. “How we do that is a subject of discussions,” he said. “We have put forward two proposals and we are seeking to evolve them, both at a negotiating level and at a technical level.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/20/west-brom-liverpool-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T12:32:56Z","webTitle":"West Bromwich Albion v Liverpool: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/20/west-brom-liverpool-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/20/west-brom-liverpool-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"West Bromwich Albion v Liverpool: match preview","bodyText":"Can West Brom cause another upset?

So what would happen to your mortgage (and savings) if and when rates are hiked? The base rate is currently 0.5%, so a rise to 2% implies an extra 1.5 percentage points on your annual interest payments. While that sounds low, it is equal to an extra £138 a month if you are the average homebuyer with the typical mortgage in Britain of £175,000. The 500,000 borrowers on one of the most popular deals, Nationwide’s base mortgage rate tracker, would likely see their interest rise from 2.5% to 4%, taking the monthly bill from £785 to £923 on a £175,000 loan. Things get hairier if the base rate rises to 3%, a level that the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has previously suggested could be the “new normal”. That would imply a Nationwide borrower paying £1,023 a month, or £238 more. If you have fixed your mortgage – and 57% of borrowers have done so – then your monthly bill will stay the same until the end of the term on the deal. At that point, borrowers could be in for a “payment shock” if they fell back on their lender’s standard variable rate. Already there are signs that new fixed-rate deals are rising in anticipation of a rate rise. But analysis by the Resolution Foundation has found that in reality as few as one in 10 households would be immediately affected by any rate rise because home ownership has declined, and so many of those with mortgages are now on fixed rates. A more dramatic impact could be on house prices – and in turn on economic confidence. House prices have begun falling in London and parts of the south-east, and rate rises could push that decline into the Midlands and north. But the good news is that interest paid on savings rates will finally move out of the doldrums. Britain’s biggest bank, Lloyds, currently pays a miserable 0.35% on its main cash Isa product, which will certainly rise if the base rate moves to 2%, although banks have a habit of delaying passing on any rise in interest rates."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/20/asia-argento-metoo-harvey-weinstein-italy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T12:52:35Z","webTitle":"I’ve been called a whore for my part in the #MeToo campaign.

It won’t stop me","bodyText":"Whore. Liar. Traitor. Opportunist. I have been called all of these things and more since I first began to speak out last October about being raped in 1997, when I was 21 years old, by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. For speaking my truth, I have been slut-shamed, victim-blamed, bullied, and threatened on a daily basis. And I am not alone. Women everywhere, emboldened by the #MeToo movement, have had the courage to share their most painful private traumas in public, only to face blanket denials and further assaults, this time on their character, their credibility, their dignity. Six months after the Weinstein story broke in the New York Times and the New Yorker, more and more high-profile establishment figures, from motivational speaker Tony Robbins to Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, are also feeling emboldened – not to confess their cowardice as shameless spectators but to denounce the #MeToo movement. It’s open season on survivors. The larger our number, and the more outspoken we are, it seems, the greater the ferocity and frequency of attacks. The most brutal and vicious response to this flowering of female political thought and action is taking place in my home country, Italy, but the poison seeps out. That is why I spoke last week alongside two formidable and outspoken Italian women: Laura Boldrini and Ambra Battilana Gutierrez at the Women in the World summit in New York. For defending women’s rights in Italy, Boldrini has been subjected to outrageous and at times violent intimidation. Her effigy has been burned in the street. One small-town rightwing mayor suggested that she should be raped by migrants. Matteo Salvini, the extreme rightwing leader of the Northern League, brought an inflatable sex doll that he referred to as “Boldrini” to a political rally. This scurrilous defamer may yet become Italy’s next prime minister. Another member of the Northern League called for her “physical elimination”. Beppe Grillo, founder of the Five Star Movement, is barred from running for election himself because of a manslaughter conviction. But his party won the largest share of the vote in Italy’s recent election, and he asked his two million Facebook followers: “What would you do if you found Boldrini in a car?” Gutierrez is the fearless young model who went up against Silvio Berlusconi and Weinstein. She testified about what she saw and experienced at Berlusconi’s “bunga bunga” parties during the infamous “prostitution trial” in 2011. Two years later, the NYPD asked Gutierrez to wear a wire during an encounter with Weinstein. She recorded what turned out to be an explosive piece of audio. For this, the tabloids smeared her as a prostitute and blackmailer. We have a message for these predatory enablers. What began in Italy is now manifest in the US and beyond, public discourse degraded into a sick tabloid fantasy, of sex, corruption, violence and lies. What began with Berlusconi continues with Trump and Weinstein. All are men in positions of power and of a now all-too-familiar type, who view women as chattels to serve their sexual lust and to puff up their fragile egos, and who then, later, try to cover up their crimes with bribery, threats and intimidation. The exploitation of women has been central to each of their paths to power. Weinstein used his company to hunt for prey. Trump used the Miss USA Pageant to gain power and influence in the business and media world. Berlusconi showed them both the way. He corrupted Italy by degrees through a vast media empire that includes three national TV channels, Italy’s largest book and magazine publisher, Mondadori, and a daily newspaper, Il Giornale. Striscia la Notizia, a weekly TV show on Berlusconi’s Canale 5 featuring half-naked showgirls, makes a mockery of the news, yet it has been the highest-rated and most-watched TV show in Italy since the late 1980s. Over time, the exploitation of women as mindless, unspeaking, submissive sex objects has proliferated across Italian TV. These images of women insinuated themselves into the subconscious of the nation, colonising the culture like a fungus and distorting the ambitions of young Italian women. This, they were told, was how to be admired and to succeed: play dumb, be silent, act sexy. An object of desire without a voice. And Berlusconi was able to achieve this because, in Italy, women were already worth less than nothing, forced into one of two roles: the mother or the whore. Italy has long been sexist to the bone. Misogyny, it seems, is the rule of law, femicide a fact of life. In Italy, one woman is killed by a man every 60 hours. One out of every three women has been subjected in their lifetimes to some form of sexual violence. One in three! Until 1981, charges of rape could be dropped by Italian legal authorities if a rape victim agreed to marry her rapist. That horrendous practice was known as “reparatory marriage”. Until the same year, a husband could kill his wife if he believed she had committed adultery and receive only a minor sentence. Until 1996, rape was not even considered a crime against a person, only a crime against the “public morals”. Think about that. And even after the law was changed, the statute of limitations for reporting a rape runs out after six months. After that, it’s not possible to secure justice. It’s as if the law was enacted to prevent the reporting and prosecution of rape. To pretend it is not even happening. A law written by men, for men. A law designed to protect the rapist. And so, not surprisingly, when I spoke out about Weinstein, Italy was the only place where my story was not accepted or believed. Instead, my reputation was traduced, my story distorted, my credibility made hostage to smears. Almost daily, Italian television featured a discussion panel made up of people who did not know me, people I had never met, who felt qualified to argue whether I had been raped or not; dissecting my story, my life, as if they were detectives at a scene that existed only in their salacious imaginations. And the conclusion these great detectives came to was that not only was I asking for it, but I wanted it and benefited from it. What happened to me was not rape, they said, it was prostitution. In their eyes, I was not even worthy of being a victim of this monstrous crime. In their eyes, I was not even good enough to be raped. This relentless dehumanisation in the Italian media eventually gave others beyond Italy the idea they could vilify and slander me with impunity also. Some of the cruellest and most hurtful comments came from those I do happen to have known. The director Catherine Breillat calls herself a feminist but puts her own interests above those of women. In a recent interview she mourned the loss of Harvey Weinstein for European cinema and said not a word in support of the scores of women he raped, assaulted and harassed. By launching a truly vicious character assassination of me, she tried to tarnish the credibility of all Weinstein accusers. Then consider the actor and male model Vincent Gallo. To promote himself and the men’s fashion line he was paid to wear, he used the pages of a British fashion magazine, Another Man, to make a malicious, unprovoked attack on me and Rose McGowan. (I hardly know Gallo, and was only briefly acquainted with him almost two decades ago.) He brought shame on Yves Saint Laurent and its creative director Anthony Vaccarello, who allowed its model to sell its clothes while doing a hatchet job on two survivors of sexual assault. Yves Saint Laurent and Another Man publisher Jefferson Hack shamed themselves by allowing Gallo to do this in their name without censure, or question or qualification, and silently profiting from the publicity. And they call us prostitutes? I will not allow these squalid gaslighters to go unchecked in their character assassinations. Of me, of #MeToo, of anybody. None of us should tolerate them. By contrast, we might all celebrate Nanine McCool. This brave woman stood up in a packed arena before tens of thousands people and faced down the self-styled self-help guru Tony Robbins. This man, a ludicrous, Ken doll manbot stereotype of strutting male machismo, towered over her and attempted to use his physical presence to intimidate her. McCool stood her ground, and did not back down. She won the argument, and unmasked this giant as a naked pygmy. This he clearly regretted only when a video of their interaction went viral online, threatening to hit him where it hurt – his bottom line. It forced him to issue a PR-scripted “apology”. We are all Nanine McCool. I stand with her and all survivors. Their pain is my pain. Their trauma, my trauma. Their fight is my fight. Their voice, my voice. My own experience, my own pain, turned me into an activist, and gave me a calling, a mission and a message, something far more valuable for my self-respect than any career in movies. Six months ago, the world changed, definitively and irrevocably. The balance of power tipped, at last, in favour of the survivors who have been given a voice and platform to speak their truths to the world. If we remain strong, determined, vigilant – if we support each other – the intimidators will fail. What has been done cannot be undone. What has been revealed can no longer be hidden. What has been said can no longer be unspoken. For speaking truth to power, I have been called a whore, a liar, a traitor and an opportunist. The one thing I will not be though, the one thing none us will be, is silenced. • Asia Argento is an Italian actor, director and activist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/27/country-diary-on-the-trail-of-elusive-wood-anemones","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T04:30:37Z","webTitle":"Country diary: on the trail of elusive wood anemones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/27/country-diary-on-the-trail-of-elusive-wood-anemones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/27/country-diary-on-the-trail-of-elusive-wood-anemones","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: on the trail of elusive wood anemones","bodyText":"When our children were young, we’d take them on voyages of exploration to an extensive patch near our home of what is sometimes called the unofficial countryside, and by unofficial I mean of course forbidden. Trespassing wasn’t mentioned, but children know when parents are being shifty. The subterfuge only added to their excitement, and having to ford a river to reach this lost Eden was very heaven. One April we stumbled across a large patch of wood anemones that hardly anyone would ever see, treasure that could never be moved. So when this past winter suddenly gave way to blazing sunshine, I wondered: could I find it again? Despite the sun, the moors were still heavy with rain, so the water flowed deep and fast. I threw my boots to the far bank and teetered across, immediately rewarded with a thick spread of ramsons, still fresh with dew. This is a plant almost designed to please children. It stinks and you can make up stories about the bears that grub for the bulbs, wild garlic’s Latin name being Allium ursinum. I stepped carefully, bathing in pungent draughts of scent, toes pushing into the warm earth. On top of this sensuous richness was a wall of sound, a depth of birdsong increasingly hard to find on these fringes of the Peak District: chiffchaffs and blackcaps, angry wrens and raucous nuthatches, wagtails zipping down the river and the trees full of jays. A woodpecker, head cocked like the hammer of a pistol, chattered to its mate on a neighbouring oak before both fled at my approach: so elongated against a tree, so stubby-tailed and compact in flight. Of the anemones there was no sign. Was I in the wrong place? Ahead of me was an expanse of brambles so thick that I put my boots back on. As I stepped cautiously, the thorny mass finally cleared to reveal a patch of bone-white flowers turned towards the warm sunshine. It was much as I remembered, certainly no bigger. Wood anemones spread so slowly, rhizomes creeping through the soil, their presence a drift of time deeper than the oldest trees around me."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/20/commonwealth-summit-leaders-royal-family-prince-charles-winner","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T17:29:40Z","webTitle":"Royal family the real winners as summit draws to a close","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/20/commonwealth-summit-leaders-royal-family-prince-charles-winner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/20/commonwealth-summit-leaders-royal-family-prince-charles-winner","fields":{"headline":"Royal family the real winners as summit draws to a close","bodyText":"It was billed as the biggest intergovernmental summit ever held in the United Kingdom; the near week-long, 53-country Commonwealth conference whose costs are likely to amount to more than £10m and whose global influence remains limited despite the fanfare. The long agenda of events in theory presented repeated opportunities for Theresa May to talk about issues ranging from banning plastic straws to gay rights overseas, highlighting anything other than Brexit – but in reality required a panicked response to a Windrush immigration crisis. Its real winners though were the royal family – deploying the full trappings of the crown to ensure a success for Prince Charles as head of the organisation at what will almost certainly be the last summit attended by the Queen, at an event at which every serving member played a role. “The Commonwealth secretariat knows that the monarchy is its life-support system and the Queen recognises the importance of its headship,” said Philip Murphy, professor of Commonwealth studies at the University of London. “They knew that the issue of succession would dominate the news and for the UK government it would look like a win for Britain.” The engagement of the Queen was clearly also a draw. Previous Commonwealth summits in Sri Lanka and Malta only saw roughly half the heads of government turn up, but London had a very high turnout, including India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, with delegates staying en masse at the five-star InterContinental hotel in Park Lane. Costs for the summit are being met by the UK government, though ministers will not disclose how much has been spent on policing, security and the rest of the sprawling event until some time later. But as a benchmark, the previous summit in Valletta, the capital of Malta, cost €13.5m (£11.8m), with the costs of food and other hospitality alone amounting to €4.8m. Yet it began disastrously: with No 10 forced at Monday’s mid-morning lobby briefing to announce an emergency taskforce to deal with the problem faced by Windrush migrants in the UK, an issue that had been dragging on for five months but only became critical for the government after Caribbean countries complained they could not get the issue on the Commonwealth summit agenda. “The problem for the Commonwealth is that it isn’t able to generate its own news story so its agenda gets dominated by external rows,” Murphy said. “The agenda amounts to a confetti of good intentions, but issues like plastic straws are a drop in the ocean compared with the time when the organisation was dominated by the struggle against apartheid.” Some leaders took advantage to press a diplomatic case. Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, is seeking a seat on the UN security council. May met Modi to discuss trade after Brexit, and the Indian leader was also hosted by Prince Charles at the Science Museum, where a Tata-owned, zero-emissions Jaguar was displayed. Streets in London were repeatedly closed for a string of events as motorcades ferried presidents and prime ministers past, with the first forums beginning on Tuesday with a plenary session where May spoke at a roundtable event addressed by business magnate Bill Gates. On Wednesday evening, May hosted a welcome reception and dinner at the Sky Garden atop the Walkie Talkie building in the City of London. On Thursday, the action moved to the Buckingham Palace ballroom, where the pop singer Emeli Sandé sang the national anthem to open proceedings at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting. The Queen pleaded that it was her “sincere wish” that one day “the Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in 1949”. The opening ceremony was followed up with a three-course, black-tie banquet for 130 in thepalace’s picture gallery. Friday, the last formal day of the summit, saw leaders and the organisation’s secretary general, Lady Scotland, take over Windsor Castle without the royal family present for a summit “retreat” in which no advisers were present. The leaders resolved that Charles would take over, although few believed the succession had ever been seriously in doubt. Then on Saturday, as the Queen turns 92, many leaders are expected to stay on for the Queen’s birthday concert at the Royal Albert Hall, hosted by Zoe Ball and where Sir Tom Jones and Kylie Minogue have been lined up to perform at an event that will be broadcast live on BBC One. May will host her friend from Oxford University the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, at Chequers. “The question is whether Charles’s succession will preserve the Commonwealth. It is more like embalming fluid; the organisation and its summits will certainly keep going, but will it have the urgency to reform itself and make itself relevant,” Murphy said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/shortcuts/2018/apr/23/still-reading-something-you-started-months-ago-youve-got-book-block","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"Still reading something you started months ago?

Actually, it’s more like reader’s block, and 54% of people suffer from it, according to a new survey of 2,000 adults by the Reading Agency. What is that? A charity that wants to make people read more. Don’t people already read their phones all the time? That doesn’t count. It has to be books. Why? What makes books good for you but phones bad? Dunno. Books are old, probably. Anyway, the point is that people sometimes get stuck in the middle of a book they aren’t enjoying for as long as three months. Can’t they just, you know, stop reading it? No, it seems that many of them can’t. Fully 22% of those surveyed insist that you should always finish any book you start. Crikey. Better not start anything too demanding, in that case. Absolutely. The books that caused the most cases of blockage were Fifty Shades of Grey, The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Yes, well, um ... Those are all quite long. But today is World Book Night! What does that mean? It’s when the publishing industry gives away some specially selected books to promote reading. I see. So like a library, except someone else tells you what to read? A bit like that, yes. And it’s why the Reading Agency says now is the time for sufferers from book-block to “quit-lit”. As in, “I’ve had enough of this book. I’m going to quit-lit”? I guess. And these people want to advise me on good writing? Don’t be such a grouch. The point is that people should feel free to give up a book they don’t enjoy and replace it with something better. In the survey, 91% of people said that reading has a positive effect on mental health. That’s a lot. Indeed. “As this research shows,” says Sue Wilkinson, the chief executive of the Reading Agency, “reading can have a hugely positive impact on our health and wellbeing.” It doesn’t show that! It only shows that people think it. She thinks it anyway. Do say: “Wouldn’t ‘boring books’ be a better name for this condition?” Don’t say: “Maybe if people stopped claiming that books were good for you we’d stop feeling like we had to finish them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2018/apr/20/colbert-on-michael-cohen-the-word-innocent-is-nowhere-in-this-conversation","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T15:29:42Z","webTitle":"Colbert on Michael Cohen: 'The word innocent is nowhere in this conversation'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/apr/20/colbert-on-michael-cohen-the-word-innocent-is-nowhere-in-this-conversation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/apr/20/colbert-on-michael-cohen-the-word-innocent-is-nowhere-in-this-conversation","fields":{"headline":"Colbert on Michael Cohen: 'The word innocent is nowhere in this conversation'","bodyText":"Late-night hosts on Thursday discussed the upcoming talks between the Trump administration and the North Korean leader, Kim Jung-un, the likelihood Michael Cohen will flip on Donald Trump, and the arrest of two black men at a Philadelphia Starbucks. Stephen Colbert “Everyone is talking about Donald Trump’s potentially epic summit with Kim Jong-un,” Stephen Colbert began. “It’s the dispute of the ill-fitting suits. It’s the men with the nukes putting up their dukes.” “The stakes are huge,” the host continued, adding that Trump, according to reports, sees the North Korea crisis as his “Great Man” of history moment. “The greatest presidents end up on our currency. Donald Trump could end up on our hush money.” According to a source from Axios, Trump has said of the meeting: “Just get me in the room with the guy and I’ll figure it out.” “He’s going to wing it with a nuclear madman,” replied Colbert. “It’s like your surgeon going, ‘We’re just going to open you up and improvise.’ Moving on to the president’s escalating legal troubles, Colbert said: “There are some doubts about the president’s current attorney and man-who’s-definitely-seen-the-Trump-sex-tape, Michael Cohen. Apparently, Trump and his advisers are increasingly worried that Cohen might be susceptible to cooperating with federal prosecutors. “One Trump team lawyer says Cohen’s loyalty depends on how much prison time he’s facing,” Colbert explained. He quoted from a Politico report in which a source said that, faced with just two to four years in prison, “Michael Cohen would be a stand-up guy. I think he’d tell them to go piss up a rope.” The source added: if “it’s 18 to 22, then how loyal is he?” “Michael Cohen disclosed Sean Hannity’s name in court after being asked twice,” Colbert shot back. “He’s not five minutes loyal. “Let’s just pause a moment to notice that they have jumped immediately to whether Michael Cohen will turn state’s evidence against the president of the United States to avoid jail time, which everybody believes is coming for at least one of these guys,” Colbert concluded. “The word innocent is nowhere in this conversation.” Trevor Noah Meanwhile, Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah discussed the ongoing controversy involving two black men, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson, who were arrested for trespassing at a Starbucks while waiting to meet a friend. “If you’re a black person, you’re probably buzzing from some great news right now,” Noah began. “Kendrick Lamar just won a Pulitzer prize for music, the first time this award has gone to someone not in classical music or jazz. Other great news: Beyoncé tore the roof off Coachella. And guys, this was the blackest performance at the whitest festival. “All in all, it feels like a great couple of days for black America,” the host continued. “But unfortunately, if you’re a black person who is not on stage, not everything is going your way.” Noah then showed news coverage regarding Nelson and Robinson, who arrived at a Philadelphia Starbucks for a business meeting and were denied access to the restroom because it was only for paying customers. Moments later, a white store employee called 911 and police arrived on the scene to arrest the men. “How crazy is this? Two men arrested for waiting to meet someone at Starbucks,” Noah said. “There are some people saying, ‘Well, why were these guys in Starbucks doing nothing?’ Because that’s what Starbucks is for!” Noah continued: “If I can get serious for just a minute here: do you have any idea what it does to a person’s dignity to be arrested … by bike cops? Someone calls the cops on you, and instead of driving up with sirens wailing all bad-ass, they’re like ding, ding, ding ding. “America clearly has a problem with policing and black people,” the host added. “On the one hand, you have people calling the police because they see black people as inherently threatening. And then you have police who only know how to respond to a call with an arrest or violence.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"law/2018/apr/20/alfie-evans-parents-lose-latest-legal-battle-uk-highest-supreme-court","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T15:22:26Z","webTitle":"Alfie Evans' parents lose latest legal battle at UK's highest court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/apr/20/alfie-evans-parents-lose-latest-legal-battle-uk-highest-supreme-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/apr/20/alfie-evans-parents-lose-latest-legal-battle-uk-highest-supreme-court","fields":{"headline":"Alfie Evans' parents lose latest legal battle at UK's highest court","bodyText":"The parents of a seriously ill baby who want to take him to Italy for treatment have lost the latest round of their legal fight after the UK’s highest court ruled that almost all of their son’s brain had been destroyed. Judges at the supreme court have approved a plan for withdrawing treatment to 23-month-old Alfie Evans, who has an undiagnosed degenerative neurological condition. Alfie’s parents, Tom Evans and Kate James, made their second application to the supreme court after losing a second fight at the court of appeal this week. But on Friday three supreme court justices dismissed the pair’s application, agreeing with Alfie’s doctors by saying “there is no hope of him getting better”. Lady Hale, the supreme court president, Lord Kerr and Lord Wilson outlined their reasons in a written explanation. They said a person unable to move because of measures taken in a hospital intensive care unit to keep them alive was not being “deprived of liberty”. There was no reason for further delay, the justices said, adding: “The hospital must be free to do what has been determined to be in Alfie’s best interests.“Alfie looks like a normal baby, but the unanimous opinion of the doctors who have examined him and the scans of his brain is that almost all of his brain has been destroyed. “No one knows why. But that it has happened and is continuing to happen cannot be denied. It means that Alfie cannot breathe, or eat, or drink without sophisticated medical treatment. It also means that there is no hope of his ever getting better.” Alfie’s father responded angrily to the decision. Writing on Facebook he said of his son: “He isn’t suffering, he isn’t in pain. He isn’t diagnosed,” adding that Alfie had been “left” on a feeding tube for 15 months. Evans and James want to move their son from Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool to a clinic in Rome. They say Italian doctors are willing to treat the boy and an air ambulance is available. Alfie’s medical team have successfully argued that his life support should be turned off. He has been seriously ill since having a seizure in December 2016 when he was seven months old. Three appeal court judges had endorsed a plan drawn up by doctors this week. But they said treatment should continue until supreme court justices had made a decision. Judges said no detail of the plan could be made public because Alfie was entitled to privacy as his life came to a close. Alfie’s parents had previously lost one round of fights, in the high court, court of appeal, supreme court and the European court of human rights. In February, Mr Justice Hayden ruled that doctors at Alder Hey could stop treating Alfie against the wishes of his parents, after hearings in the family division of the high court in London and Liverpool. Specialists at Alder Hey said life-support treatment should stop and Mr Justice Hayden said he accepted medical evidence that showed further treatment was futile. He said flying Alfie to a foreign hospital would be wrong and pointless. Court of appeal judges upheld his decisions. The supreme court justices and European court of human rights’ judges refused to intervene. Alfie’s parents had also argued that their son was being wrongly “detained” at Alder Hey and had made a habeas corpus application, which requires a court to examine the legality of a detention. It is a piece of common law which probably dates to Anglo-Saxon times. Hayden dismissed that claim last week; appeal judges upheld his decision. A spokeswoman for the supreme court said: “Having considered submissions from the parties ‘on paper’, in the usual way, the supreme court of the United Kingdom has refused permission for the parents to appeal.” Alfie’s parents would make another appeal to courts in Strasbourg to keep their son alive, their legal representatives said. Andrea Williams, the chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre, which is representing Alfie’s family, said: “We are going to appeal to the European court of human rights in the hope that we can stay the end of life order our courts have made. We are appealing today because we have got to act quickly. The parents are devoted parents.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/20/amber-rudd-boasted-harsher-immigration-strategy-leak-reveals","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T14:21:05Z","webTitle":"Amber Rudd boasted of harsher immigration strategy, leak reveals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/20/amber-rudd-boasted-harsher-immigration-strategy-leak-reveals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/20/amber-rudd-boasted-harsher-immigration-strategy-leak-reveals","fields":{"headline":"Amber Rudd boasted of harsher immigration strategy, leak reveals","bodyText":"Amber Rudd privately boasted to the prime minister that she would give immigration officials more “teeth” to hunt down and deport thousands more illegal migrants and accelerate the UK’s deportation programme, a leaked private letter has revealed. In a robust private memo to Theresa May just months before long-settled Windrush migrants were threatened with deportation, Rudd set out her “ambitious” plan to increase removals and focus officials on “arresting, detaining and forcibly removing illegal migrants” while “ruthlessly” prioritising Home Office resources to that programme . The four-page document, obtained exclusively by the Guardian, reveals Rudd promised the prime minister she would oversee the forced or voluntary departure of 10% more people than May managed when she was home secretary, partly by switching money for crime-fighting to her immigration enforcement programme. Her goal implied she wanted to throw out an extra 4,000 illegal migrants every year. The letter was sent on 30 January 2017. A few months later Paulette Wilson, a grandmother from Jamaica who had lived in Britain for 50 years, became the first of more than 20 Windrush migrants to tell the Guardian how they were facing deportation or a loss of rights to health, housing and work because of Home Office policy. The aggressive language and tone of Rudd’s approach to immigration enforcement emerged after the home secretary attempted to blame officials in her own department for the Windrush scandal in which it emerged up to 50,000 mostly Commonwealth migrants were facing possible deportation despite having lived in Britain for decades. Rudd claimed in parliament on Monday she was “concerned that the Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the individual”. That appeared to be an attempt to suggest she had inherited a hardline system from May, who as home secretary announced a policy to create “a really hostile environment for illegal migrants” across government departments. But in the private memo, Rudd said she believed in the fundamental importance of that hostile environment agenda, which she referred to as the “compliant environment”, an attempted rebranding of the policy by ministers a few months earlier. The culture that agenda inspired has been widely blamed for members of the Windrush-era generation being threatened in recent months with deportation and denied access to housing, healthcare and jobs. In 2016, 39,626 people were deported or left the UK voluntarily, according to the UK Migration Observatory, but Rudd’s letter to May indicates a home secretary determined to make her mark and toughen up even further an immigration enforcement regime which uses liveried vans that have become an increasingly common sight in areas with large migrant communities. She wrote: “Illegal and would-be illegal migrants and the public more widely, need to know that our immigration system has ‘teeth’, and that if people do not comply on their own we will enforce their return, including through arresting and detaining them. That is why I will be refocusing immigration enforcement’s work to concentrate on enforced removals. In particular I will be reallocating £10m (including from low-level crime and intelligence) with the aim of increasing the number of enforced removals by more than 10% over the next few years: something I believe is ambitious, but deliverable.” Rudd told May her proposals to reduce the overall illegal population had been “informed by the review that you commissioned whilst home secretary”. She concluded: “Everything I have outlined above is aimed not just at radically reshaping and refocusing immigration enforcement but at increasing the public’s confidence in our immigration system.” Nowhere in the memo does Rudd mention the possible human cost of getting her immigration policy wrong. Rudd told May that her strategy was “informed by the review that you commissioned as home secretary”. On Thursday, Nick Clegg, who was deputy prime minister from 2010 to 2015, said May’s Home Office had pursued “nasty politics” over immigration. “They kept resorting to these glib silly unproven headline-grabbing gimmicks and that does create the administrative climate when someone somewhere down the food chain thinks … [for example] we won’t take on good faith what the Windrush generation is saying to us.” Rudd’s memo was sent as the government stepped up its attempts to bring net migration down into the tens of thousands. The previous year, the figure was 248,000. Four months earlier, May rebooted the government’s immigration taskforce, chairing a committee of 12 cabinet ministers – including the three key Brexit supporters, Liam Fox, Boris Johnson and David Davis – to ensure a new regime was introduced to slash the net number of arrivals into the UK to below 100,000 a year. Other measures she told May about included obtaining biometric data from countries such as Pakistan, which she said could be “a potential game changer in terms of the numbers we can remove”. She asked for the prime minister’s help to persuade the leaders of other countries to supply such data. Rudd also said she wanted illegal migrants who were being housed in detention centres before removal to either be sent back to their origin country, released into the community on licence, or tagged to free up beds for the new people that her immigration enforcement team will be picking up. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Illegal immigration impacts the whole of society, putting pressure on taxpayer-funded public services, leaving vulnerable people at the mercy of exploitative employers or landlords, and at worst, fuelling the abhorrent crimes of modern slavery and human trafficking. “People from the Windrush generation are of course here legally. The Home Secretary has recognised the huge contribution they have made to our society, and has apologised unreservedly to them. We are taking urgent action to help them to evidence their legal right to live in the UK, and have set up a dedicated taskforce to do so. “It is wilfully misleading to conflate the situation experienced by people from the Windrush generation with measures in place to tackle illegal immigration and protect the UK taxpayer. It is clearly essential that we continue to take action against people who are here illegally.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/20/glasgow-international-review-festival-tai-shani-mark-leckey-sam-keogh","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T15:57:11Z","webTitle":"Interstellar sexual adventures and underground erotica – Glasgow International review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/20/glasgow-international-review-festival-tai-shani-mark-leckey-sam-keogh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/20/glasgow-international-review-festival-tai-shani-mark-leckey-sam-keogh","fields":{"headline":"Interstellar sexual adventures and underground erotica – Glasgow International review","bodyText":"One of my favourite things in this year’s Glasgow International festival is an empty gallery at the Modern Institute, where two fist-sized mechanical snails crawl slowly across the floor. I could watch Urs Fischer’s snails all day, not least because they’re not trying to tell me anything. Lubaina Himid’s deeply underwhelming painted cut-out dragons cross the vast atrium far above our heads at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. They look like leftovers from Chinese New Year. The installation is cumbersome and forced. Why am I here? The eighth edition of GI is full of false steps and wasted journeys. Sam Keogh has just emerged from some sort of cryogenic pod, marooned on the floor of Glasgow’s Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA). Keogh, artist-cum-astronaut, has seen better days, and so have I. He tells a very long tale of space exploration, gallons of human sperm and frozen eggs, as his craft malfunctioned somewhere on its mission to seed distant planets with the human race. Part sculpture, part-performance, with yards of plastic, tons of goo and electrical dreck, Keogh’s Kapton Cadaverine has some good gags, but its vision of the grubbiness of interstellar space travel is a familiar trope, especially to anyone who knows how trashed an airplane cabin looks after a long-haul flight. Richard Parry, formerly director of the Grundy Art Gallery in Blackpool, had less than a year to devise the programme. Cellular World: Cyborg-Human-Avatar-Horror, the group show he has devised in the difficult, overdecorated and pillared ground floor gallery at GoMA, plays on familiar tropes of failed dreams and dystopian futures. Jesse Darling’s washing line festoons the indoor sky with snarls of razor-wire, bunting, dishcloths, toys and babywear. John Russell’s billboard-scaled digital image is a kind of modern baroque version of architectural trompe l’oeil painting, continuing the galleries’ succession of pillars within the image itself, and filling the illusory space with a huge elephant’s head. The eyeless tusker looks back at us bleakly, as well it might. Small paintings are perched on the sofas in the British Heart Foundation charity shop. The faces of two young women smile and pout from under a pile of herbs and flowers and cut-out smiles in Linder’s little movie at the Glasgow Women’s Library. They stick out their tongues. Someone chases a herd of deer. Linder’s Bower of Bliss is an imaginary scene from the life of Mary Queen of Scots as if redone by Pipilotti Rist in the Scottish highlands. Graham Eatough and Stephen Sutcliffe’s reworking of Anthony Burgess’s Enderby novels, at Film City, are accompanied by fragments of the sets for their two films. The sets don’t add much and the films themselves are full of hammy, unfunny acting. Commissioned for last year’s Manchester International festival, the films apparently “cajole our notions of what comprises authenticity, posterity and the character of the artist”. They bring nothing new into the world, and my notions remain uncajoled. Over at Tramway, a deeply troubled figure is spotlit in a huge space. Enlarged from a small figurine in the Wellcome Collection, Mark Leckey’s Nobodaddy (titled after a poem by William Blake) is a seated god, full of wounds, holes and knobbly excrescences. His body hides speakers, and a voice fills the surrounding darkened space. A CGI apparition of the same figure hovers on a large screen across the gallery. We delve into his hollowed out innards. Leckey provides the voice of this abject figure, accompanied by horrible gurglings and rumblings and complaints. What a plight. Talk about the crisis of masculinity. The real strength of the citywide, sprawling festival rests on a few works. A live voice accompanies Tai Shani’s Tramway installation Dark Continent: Semiramis. Topless women wearing Spanx figure-shaping pantyhose walk on stage and pose themselves in a tableaux vivant. It is difficult to keep up with the labyrinthine text, apparently an extrapolation from a 1405 proto-feminist text, Christine de Pizan’s The Book of the City of Ladies. The staging is weird, the set a sort of mix of Joan Miró and new age nonsense, including a giant outstretched hand, hanging things that glow like ceramic jewellery, coloured balls and small platonic solids littering the floor, an orange puddle. A pink worm-like gut writhes across the stage. A female voice declaims, alternately soothing and erupting with sex and violence, pleasure and pain. I thought of Angela Carter’s Sadeian Woman and Pasolini’s Salò. To see one performance in Shani’s 12-part cycle is not enough. I need the text. I feel the whole thing is being snatched away even as I look. One of the bravest, edgiest works in this year’s GI, it repels as much as it compels. Shani’s cumbersome, ambitious and flawed performances led me circuitously to a bedroom in a Pollokshields flat, and an astonishing archival display of 1980s underground lesbian erotica, and then to a show of photographs and short films by the 75-year-old German film-maker Ulrike Ottinger at the Hunterian museum. Transgressive, erotic, alarming, unconscionable and marvellous, Ottinger’s work is a call to artistic freedom and formal rigour. Life-affirming and dangerous, she is an accidental mentor to the best younger artists here, and a rejoinder to mediocrity, to things I prefer not to recall. But as much as it is a showcase, or a baggy curatorial conceit, GI still has vitality, even if it feels spread too thin. Glasgow International is on citywide until 7 May.

Employees were told on Thursday that the organisation, which distributes grants to local civil society groups, will close or drastically reduce operations at its office in the Hungarian capital in July and relocate to Berlin by August, the Guardian has learned from multiple sources. “You might understand if I don’t cry my eyes out,” Orbán said in his regular radio interview on Friday. Since his Fidesz party won a two-thirds majority in parliament this month, Orbán has claimed a political mandate to push ahead with a new law targeting NGOs with foreign funding. The Open Society Foundation, founded by the billionaire philanthropist, said in a statement on Friday it was “closely watching developments around draft legislation that would dramatically restrict the activities of civil society in Hungary”. Its office in Budapest employs about 100 staff and oversees funding to other central and eastern European countries. The proposed “stop Soros” law, which parliament will discuss next week, would enforce a 25% tax on foreign donations to NGOs that back migration to Hungary and allows the interior ministry to reject groups that work on migration-related issues on a national security basis after vetting by security agencies. Voices in Hungary’s shrinking civil sphere say the legislation is designed to silence organisations troublesome to Orbán, who has in recent years been increasingly hostile to Soros. The overwhelmingly anti-immigration-focused election campaign that returned Orbán’s Fidesz government to power this month presented Soros as the personification of open border policies. Since entering Hungary in 1984, the OSF has distributed some $400m in the country _ including to several senior Fidesz politicians and Orbán himself. Its donation of photocopiers to critical samizdat publications played a role in the fall of communism. “Orbán needed a mythical enemy which cannot really fight back and OSF organisations have been consciously demonised,” said Tamás Bodoky, of the investigative journalism website Átlátszó, an OSF-grantee which is also 50% funded from crowdfunding. “The campaign, which has demolished George Soros for over a year, has a dual purpose: to intimidate critical voices and to fund government-friendly coverage from taxpayers’ money. We don’t yet know if this will impact us, since there is no final version of the bill, but we expect that it might affect our funding. “With the departure of the OSF, both goals have been fulfilled: the organisations supported by Soros have panicked and the government propaganda media can list ‘Soros mercenaries’.” Márta Pardavi, co-director of the Helsinki Committee, which receives 28% of its annual income from OSF, said: “This move signals how fast the operational context is deteriorating in Hungary. “We are being attacked for reminding governments that power does have limitations in Europe and people can rely on civil society organisations to protect them when that power is being abused.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/20/the-fiver-arsene-wenger-arsenal-out","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T15:01:24Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Forced to accept that he actually was, even when bad, good","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/20/the-fiver-arsene-wenger-arsenal-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/20/the-fiver-arsene-wenger-arsenal-out","fields":{"headline":"Forced to accept that he actually was, even when bad, good","bodyText":"WENGER OUT “When a club is surrounded by rumours, it’s because they are not strong enough and aren’t in control of things,” Arsène Wenger said when linked with the PSG job in 2012. “Anyway, I always honour my contract.” With crushing inevitability Wenger proceeded to allow his own club to become surrounded by t1ttle-tattle, which dominated last season in its entirety and have continued to bubble in the background thereafter, before finally deciding to leave – one year into a two-year deal. When the news was announced on Friday morning, the football world reacted with shock and awe. After he failed to go at the end of last season, when it appeared blindingly obvious that he should do so, the only possible conclusion was that he was never going to be shifted. From that point on whenever he finally did depart, whatever the circumstances that forced him finally to do so – whether they were footballing failure in the short term or, if he remained into the distant future, having actually been deceased for several decades – it would still come as a massive surprise. And so it was that when the news broke Sol Campbell took to Social Media Disgrace Twitter and wrote simply: “Wow!” Journalists immediately started rifling through their contacts books in search of people with even a slight knowledge of, in order of preference, Arsenal, playing football, watching football, Islington or France. These experts spoke of the outgoing manager in terms so glowing they illuminated the sky and cast warmth upon all of Britain. That could have been the sun, mind. “He’s a gentleman. He’s a really, really nice guy,” oozed former Arsenal keeper David Seaman. “He is without doubt one of the three greatest men I’ve ever met, and I’m not talking just about football but outside as a human being,” gushed another former Gunners stopper Bob Wilson. “If he’s happy, I’m happy. If he’s sad, I’m sad,” parped José Mourinho. “Thank you Arsène Wenger, the glory days were utterly glorious,” cheered David Miliband. “Enough is enough. Thank you Wenger,” wrote Lethal Bizzle. It was not just Britons who got excited. The Orlando Sentinel (“the most comprehensive news source of the Central Florida region”), Radio Citizen (“the home of Kenya’s most popular radio personalities”) and El Pais Cali (“we keep you up to date with events in Cali and the Valle del Cauca” – we’re talking south-western Colombia here) were all tweeting about his departure. By common consensus it was decided to suddenly focus on Wenger’s intelligence, his integrity, the fluid brilliance of his finest teams and the magnificent achievements of his first decade in England rather than the idea that he has for some time been an old bloke who’s not that great at his job any more. This perception will however continue until several other people try it without significant improvement and we are forced to accept that he actually was, even when bad, good. The man himself, having already undertaken his media duties before Sunday’s game against West Ham, didn’t have to say anything to anyone. “After careful consideration I feel it is the right time for me to step down,” he declared in a statement, though in hindsight the right time for him to step down might have been 2006. Arsenal’s majority owner Stan Kroenke said today was “one of the most difficult days we have ever had in all our years in sport”, an apparently wildly overblown statement whose truth presumably lies in the fact that, after 22 years, nobody at Arsenal has a clue how to find a new manager. A word to the wise: get together the team who have been responsible for recruiting a decent defensive midfielder, and make sure they stay well clear. RECOMMENDED VIEWING Au revoir, Arsène.

It is almost six years since Pallotta took charge – by coincidence, his appointment was confirmed before a friendly against Liverpool in 2012 – and in that time the club has undergone a cultural shift. Changes wrought by his ownership group have helped to bring the club to its first European Cup semi-final in 34 years. The Giallorossi are hardly the first to embrace advanced analytics, yet Pallotta’s focus on machine learning was a new departure for Roma. The data team he has nurtured in the US is developing tools that can filter transfer targets by attributes, as well as analysing opponents to see, for example, if habits in possession can be pinpointed and exploited. This work is still relatively new, and Pallotta does not suggest that it has yet had a transformative impact. But Roma’s commitment to it did aid in the hiring of Monchi – renowned for his two decades of success identifying young talent on a modest budget at Sevilla – as sporting director. Monchi, in turn, brought his own expertise. One of his first Roma signings was Cengiz Ünder. The 20-year-old Turkey forward has had a very direct impact on this European run, scoring a crucial away goal at Shakhtar Donetsk in the last 16 before providing the assist for Kostas Manolas’s winner against Barcelona. That sequence of events, while positive, is hardly a blueprint for long-term success. But Roma know perfectly well that they could not expect to beat the La Liga leaders every week. “In any given year, on any given Wednesday, you can knock off one team if you play 94 minutes like we did against Barcelona,” said Pallotta. “But if you want to be a consistent top 10 player in the world, you’ve got to have the revenues.” On that front, the gulf remains vast. According to Deloitte, Roma’s operating revenue (excluding transfer fees and taxes) was €171.8m last season – only the 24th-highest in Europe. Barcelona brought in €648.3m, which placed them third behind Manchester United and Real Madrid. Liverpool were eighth on €424.2m. Changes off the pitch, then, will have the greatest impact on Roma’s ability to compete on it. “We didn’t have a commercial team, we didn’t have a digital team, we didn’t have a TV station, we didn’t have a radio station, we didn’t have studios,” Pallotta said of the situation he inherited. “Now we have those things.” Most visible to fans might be the team’s commitment to social media. Pallotta has reflected before now that if he could persuade 1% of the world’s fans to make Roma their second team, willing to spend $5 a year on merchandise, the financial impact would be transformative. That goal is still a way off but Roma have made strides since hiring Paul Rogers from Liverpool to become their head of digital and social media in 2015. The club’s accounts post with an irreverence and self-awareness that is rare in Europe and lends itself to going viral. Witness the pastiche YouTube highlights reel the club posted to celebrate Ünder’s signing, or the riffing on internet memes during the win over Barcelona. Roma’s following has improved both online and off. Attendances are up by almost 4,000 per game on last year. But all of this pales into insignificance against the ambition to build a new stadium. Roma continue to share the publicly-owned Stadio Olimpico with Lazio. A plan for a new venue on the site of a closed racing track was first presented in 2014 but still awaits formal approval. Pallotta believes it will soon be forthcoming, and that construction will begin late in 2018 on a project featuring not only a football ground but also a vast entertainment complex that could boost revenues substantially. He has also warned, however, that if it is not rubber-stamped this summer then it may not happen at all. “We spend a million dollars a month on keeping staff and drawings and all of this type of thing on it,” he said. “You can’t just sit there and think: ‘Oh, we’re going to get delayed another year.’” No stadium, most likely, would mean no Pallotta in the long term. His first involvement with Roma was as a minority investor in a consortium. He admits he did not even like football in the beginning, believing it “the worst sport in the world”. His past business experiences – he is a shareholder in the NBA’s Boston Celtics – nevertheless lent themselves to taking on the president’s role. He has fallen in love with football since. After the win over Barcelona, Pallotta took a dive into a fountain in Rome’s Piazza del Popolo, as fans celebrated around him. He subsequently made a donation of €230,000 to the city for repair work on another fountain, in front of the Pantheon. The idea that Roma the football club and Rome the city can best succeed together is one that Pallotta has pushed from day one, much to the annoyance of Lazio supporters. Whether at Anfield, or in front of a TV, he will not be the only one minding his superstitions on Tuesday night."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/20/halt-population-slump-easing-access-donor-sperm-eu-urged","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T13:52:21Z","webTitle":"Halt population slump by easing access to donor sperm, EU urged","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/20/halt-population-slump-easing-access-donor-sperm-eu-urged","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/20/halt-population-slump-easing-access-donor-sperm-eu-urged","fields":{"headline":"Halt population slump by easing access to donor sperm, EU urged","bodyText":"The world’s biggest sperm bank has warned the EU that access to donor sperm must be improved to reinvigorate childbirth rates amid the continent’s slump in population growth. Sperm banks across Europe have closed after the enforcement of new EU regulations on staffing levels, executives at the Danish firm Cryos International told European commission officials in a private meeting. Some member states’ insistence on making the identity of donors traceable was cited as a further obstacle to access, released minutes reveal. The executives also raised the 2011 decision by the Danish courts to treat sperm as a “good” liable to VAT. Donor sperm is subject to as much as 25% VAT in some EU countries. “According to Cryos, the demand has increased by around 500% over recent years, but only 10% of those who need access to medical treatment with donated gametes are receiving it,” the minutes record. “They noted that population growth in the EU has slowed down and that it is a priority that the rate of childbirth be increased; this objective would be supported by increasing access to donor sperm.” The 10 fastest-shrinking countries in the world in terms of population are in central and eastern Europe, according to UN projections. Eurostat, the EU’s statistics agency, estimates that only the populations of Ireland, France, Norway and Britain will rise by 2050 without migration, with the rest of the EU in decline. Cryos, the largest company of its kind in the world, which says it supplies sperm to women in all EU member states and beyond, said the requirement that sperm banks employ dedicated staff to deal with EU paperwork was proving a burden too far for many. The different legislative approaches by member states was also making life difficult for banks and stemming sperm supply, the company said. The minutes of the meeting, held last September, say: “They noted that many sperm banks closed down after the legislation was adopted ... In the view of Cryos, the EU should consider the demand and allow an open single market for sperm. “Cryos stated that it was already difficult to recruit adequate numbers of donors but that rules put in place by regulators, eg the dropping of donor anonymity in some member states, had made this situation worse. “At least one member state was reported as not allowing distribution of sperm by Cryos on the basis that they have both anonymous and non-anonymous donors. “They state that other member states ban the import of gametes to their country from Denmark, even though the EU legislation defines this as ‘distribution’ (ie from a tissue establishment to an organisation responsible for human application) rather than ‘import’.” The market for sperm banks is expected to grow by more than 4% by 2021. Cryos told the EU officials: “Access to [non-partner] donated sperm is the key challenge in Europe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/08/would-you-give-a-job-to-this-gangster","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"Would you give a job to this gangster?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/08/would-you-give-a-job-to-this-gangster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/08/would-you-give-a-job-to-this-gangster","fields":{"headline":"Would you give a job to this gangster?","bodyText":"It was a scorching hot day when Carlos Fernando Argueta was interviewed for a job at a clothing factory in western El Salvador, but he still wore a long-sleeved shirt. The tattoos on his arms had cost him jobs before, tell-tale signs of his past life in the notoriously brutal Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) street gang. “Believe me, I’m very ashamed,” says Argueta, 39, who joined the gang when he was 12. “I know that we corrupted many hearts and minds. But if God has his arms open for people like us, then why can’t society give us a job opportunity?” Between 30,000 and 60,000 active gang members in El Salvador, in a population of 6.3 million. It was one of the most dangerous countries in the world last year; in 2015 it recorded one murder every hour, after a truce between the MS-13 and Barrio 18 gangs fell apart and a bloody turf war resumed. The interviewer spotted that Argueta was attempting to hide his past. He gave him the job anyway. Argueta has worked for nine years at League Central America, a clothing factory that produces apparel for US universities including Harvard and Princeton. It’s one of a growing number of firms, at least 10 so far, in El Salvador hiring reformed gang members. Those include energy firm AES Corporation and a tuna packing company, according to the Trabajemos por la Paz (Working for Peace) group, which has found jobs for more than 700 reformed gang members since 2008. Unsurprisingly, research suggests that those who can find regular employment are more likely to escape the cycle of gang violence that has tormented the country. League Central America has employed at least 100 former gangsters since 2009. The company pairs with local churches and community groups to provide job training and facilitate the delicate process of cutting ties, which involves careful negotiation with leaders who view defectors with suspicion. In fact, members are never considered to have truly left, only to have become calmado, or inactive. According to the head of League Central America, Rodrígo Bolaños, none of those who joined his firm have returned to active status. This process of rehabilitation stands in stark contrast to the politically popular mano dura, or iron fist, approach to dealing with the country’s gang violence, which has seen lethal extrajudicial violence meted out by security forces. “We have stopped a tremendous problem by embracing the community, giving them a true opportunity in life. We’re resolving the problem instead of killing them,” says Bolaños. “It sends the message that we have to embrace the community if we want to have a healthy country.” Manuel Oswaldo Henríquez, a 31-year-old employee at League Central America, joined the Barrio 18 gang at 14. “After ninth grade, I didn’t want to study anymore,” Henríquez says. “There was no future for me in this country because I had already tattooed my body.” His teachers were afraid of him, awarding passing grades out of fear. His life consisted of shootouts in rival neighbourhoods, followed by the inevitable retaliation on his own turf. “It’s hard being in the gang. It’s not like your mom telling you to do something. If you don’t follow the orders, there are punishments, beatings. That’s life in the gang.” Now, Henríquez has a respectable job that allows him to provide for his wife and six-year-old son. Not everyone is convinced of the merits of offering jobs to people such as Argueta and Henríquez who have perpetrated terrible crimes. Many Salvadorans bear the scars of years of gang violence. Some firms still refuse to partner with Trabajemos por la Paz, while others are only comfortable offering food for programmes and events. Those that do open their doors also face the task of winning over the existing employees. “It’s a challenge to convince not just the business owners, but all the people working at a company,” said Nelson Morales, the executive director of the group. “But through the years, we’ve realised that people are opening up. Part of our work is making sure that society and business owners understand the [gang] phenomenon.” For Morales there’s a simple logic to the approach. “Any social reintegration programme is incomplete if it can’t provide people with a way of making a living that is respectable and socially accepted,” he says. Henríquez has faced resistance in his new life. “There are many people who don’t believe that gang members can change,” he says. “But they can, I’ve seen it in myself and I’ve seen it in other people as well. If there are opportunities, I know that a gang member can change and be different.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The meeting is still a state secret, unmentioned in official media, unknown to the majority of Kim’s citizens – and far too dangerous for those who have heard whispers to discuss them in public. Days after the CIA chief, Mike Pompeo, met Kim in Pyongyang, official minders shepherding foreign journalists on a highly choreographed trip around the city refused several times to translate questions about Trump’s visit, saying only that “political questions” were not allowed or “not proper”. North Koreans are inundated with propaganda about American aggression from childhood. At one model kindergarten on the outskirts of Pyongyang, visited by journalists last week, a poster warning against imperialists sat alongside murals of birds and butterflies. Plastic guns and tanks sat in classrooms beside model teapots and cooking sets. The people are also surrounded by murals and statues sanctifying the ruling dynasty: Kim, his father Kim Jong-il, and his grandfather and “eternal president” Kim Il-sung. Kim Il-sung’s birthday, 15 April, is a national holiday known as the Day of the Sun, when thousands of Koreans in formal dress flock to murals, statues and his official birthplace to leave flowers and bow in carefully choreographed tribute. Apartments the three leaders have visited, trains they have travelled on – even a coffee shop chair once sat on by the youngest Kim – are marked with plaques or other signs. Formal portraits of the two elder Kims’ photos have a place of honour in every home. Their quotes adorn government buildings, workplaces, schools and universities. This system of indoctrination and propaganda complicates any official announcement of the Trump meeting. An ideological framework must be devised to explain the talks with the enemy; and regardless of how they are presented, there is an uncomfortable margin for the “infallible” leader to be seen to fail in his aims. Trump is a volatile opponent who telegraphed his impatience even before the two men fixed a place to talk, warning he would walk away if he thought the preparations weren’t going anywhere. But this unpredictability is the reason there are talks at all. Trump’s barrage of verbal and Twitter attacks on North Koreans – which have been reported there – led Pyongyang to question if it was, for the first time in a generation, facing a US president willing to attack them, experts say. The bluster of decades of North Korean threats against America was based in no small part on the very real threat the regime poses to the people of Seoul. Millions live in the South Korean capital, which is barely 50km from the de facto border with the north. That it is well within range of artillery and other weapons means the city effectively serves as a human shield for Pyongyang’s nuclear programme. Officials there have long calculated that no US president would risk lives in Seoul with an attack on the North. But under Trump that is no longer a safe assumption, says Andrei Lankov, professor of Korean Studies at Kookmin University. “[North Korea] is facing a pretty unprecedented situation,” said Lankov, the author of Real North Korea. “A US president who appears willing to initiate a strike against them no matter what damage it will do to Seoul, and sanctions seriously affecting their economy.” In Pyongyang, the minders who barred questions from western journalists about the summit were frank about Trump himself. “He is crazy,” said one, referring to Trump’s belligerent speech to the United Nations. “[North Koreans] could not believe it when he actually threatened the annihilation of an entire nation of 25 million people.” Adding to pressure on Kim, international trade vital to the economy has been stifled after China’s unexpected decision to implement harsh sanctions approved by the United Nations. For years the Chinese government paid little more than lip service to various tranches of sanctions aimed at reining in the nuclear programme. North Koreans sent seafood, coal and the country’s esoteric range of other legal exports across the border and brought oil, consumer goods and desperately needed hard currency home. But last autumn that changed. Not all trade has been cut off. China was still buying at least one type of sanctioned iron this spring, the website NK News reported. But from factories forced to ration power, to the silent testimony of idle construction sites, a sudden flood of seafood into the domestic market, and countless other small signs, there is widespread consensus that Beijing has decided to crack down in an unprecedented way. China’s motives are opaque; they too may be worried about the prospect of a war on their doorstep given Trump’s belligerence, or share worries about nuclear weapons spreading in a region where they have until now been the only nuclear power. But their impact is unquestionable. North Korea is officially committed to self-reliance, and says it can survive controls on trade. In a place where ideology often trumps reality, it is hard to have a frank discussion about the effect of China closing the border. At one shoe factory in Pyongyang, the manager strenuously insisted all their raw materials were produced inside North Korea, as workers standing just metres away opened sacks of plastic pellets stamped “made in China” to feed the production line. But the effects have been severe and widespread enough to merit some official reference. “Its true that these sanctions are giving some obstacles to the development of the economy,” said Ri Gi-song, a professor at the Academy of Social Sciences in Pyongyang in a rare interview. That was a week after the prime minister, Pak Pong-ju, attacked “vicious sanctions and pressure manoeuvres”, and warned of “unprecedented massive challenges” in an April report to North Korea’s rubber-stamp parliament, the website 38 Degrees reported. The squeeze from China is likely affecting government coffers, which are bolstered by funds from private enterprise even though there is officially no tax in North Korea. And Kim may be worried that as the economy suffers, austerity may erode support from the small elite who have grown accustomed to the modest luxuries that constitute a high-end lifestyle in North Korea: eating out and drinking in pubs, Karaoke nights, and occasional trip to funfairs and water parks. Kim, like his predecessors, has proved adept at manipulating regional and world powers into providing aid and political support while offering little in return. Now Kim may at last be forced into making real changes to stave off looming political and economic crises. “They are going to make concessions in order not to be shot at, and have parts of the sanctions lifted,” Lankov said, suggesting they could include a moratorium on missile and nuclear tests. But he believes neither domestic nor international pressure will persuade the government to fully give up its nuclear programme. “They are not suicidal and if they lose the nuclear weapons, they become extremely vulnerable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2018/apr/20/rise-in-assaults-on-staff-reveals-intolerable-pressure-on-nhs","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T12:35:27Z","webTitle":"Rise in assaults on staff reveals intolerable pressure on NHS","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2018/apr/20/rise-in-assaults-on-staff-reveals-intolerable-pressure-on-nhs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/2018/apr/20/rise-in-assaults-on-staff-reveals-intolerable-pressure-on-nhs","fields":{"headline":"Rise in assaults on staff reveals intolerable pressure on NHS","bodyText":"The revelation of the sharp increase in attacks on NHS staff highlights a problem which is serious, global and growing. The survey by the Health Service Journal and Unison showed assaults in 2016-17 were almost 10% up on the previous year, driven by big increases in hospitals that were missing treatment targets or seriously in debt. Staff in mental health trusts were more than seven times more likely to be attacked than those in other trusts. The World Health Organization says health workers are at a high risk of physical violence all over the globe, and estimates that between 8% and 38% of staff in different countries suffer at some point in their careers. A study by the International Council of Nurses concluded that healthcare workers were more likely to be attacked at work than prison guards or police officers, and that female nurses were most at risk. On top of these attacks during day-to-day work, healthcare staff dealing with health emergencies such as wars are in enormous danger. WHO figures indicate that over the two-year period to 2015, 959 such healthcare workers were killed and 1,561 injured across 19 countries.) A global study by the University of South Florida found that attacks on nurses tended to be concentrated in emergency departments and geriatric and psychiatric units. What unites these areas is that staff are working with patients who are in pain or distress, anxious and likely to feel that they have lost control of their lives. The author pointed out that geriatric and psychiatric patients are more likely to have poor impulse control. This study uncovered striking differences across the world, with the highest rate of attacks occurring in the “anglo” countries, which included Australia, Canada, England, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland and the US, at a rate almost double that in the Middle East. Underreporting may be a factor, but the difference appears stark. Nurses working in Asia and the Middle East are more likely to be attacked by relatives and friends of the patient, showing how prevention strategies need to be tailored to local circumstances. Of course, if there is violence all around you, it will come into the hospital. In the first six months after the Henry Ford hospital in Detroit installed metal detectors, staff confiscated 33 handguns, 1,324 knives and 97 chemical sprays. The emotional and physical impact on staff who have been attacked includes headaches, loneliness, irritability, anger, insecurity, sadness, low self-esteem, sleeping disorders, stress and depression. Staff can become fearful of patients and it can cause difficulties with colleagues and family. The psychological impact is often magnified by the feeling that their profession is not respected. Many need time off work. Some simply quit. Patients also suffer. It takes extraordinary professionalism to refuse to allow an awful experience with one intoxicated patient to cloud judgment about the next, while there are serious risks inherent in a loss of empathy for psychiatric patients. The marked increase in violence in the trusts in England under financial and performance pressure hints at how a fraught, tense working environment can put staff and patients on edge. It is easy to understand how combining long waits for patients with stressed staff trying to run a system only kept on the rails through frantic activity creates an atmosphere where tensions and frustration escalate to assaults. Potentially even more traumatic are attacks on staff working in the community, often alone. At least in a hospital someone will come to your aid. A Royal College of Nursing survey revealed that half of community nurses felt vulnerable, one in 10 had been assaulted and less than a quarter said their managers always knew when they were working alone. The government must face up to the issue of staff being attacked. It needs to start collecting data on assaults again (having stopped last year) and recognise that – just as much as financial returns or performance figures – it reveals where the NHS is under intolerable pressure.

He has released four studio albums, including the 2013 critical smash Immunity, and has collaborated with artists as diverse as Brian Eno, King Creosote and Coldplay. Hopkins’s mind-bending fifth album, Singularity, is out this Friday on Domino. He plays London’s Village Underground on 10 May. You said on Instagram recently that you knew you’d make this record 15 years ago but only figured out how to make it in the past couple of years. What twigged? I knew a few things in advance, including the title and the idea of the album starting and ending with a really simple tone. I also wanted there to be a symbiotic relationship between all the sounds, so that everything would seem to grow out of everything else. But I was still figuring things out back then – if I was a visual artist, you would say I was still learning how to draw – so I needed to get the basics right before trying to be conceptual and ambitious. Were you also waiting for technology to catch up with your ideas? Yes. With the program I use now, Ableton, it’s quite easy to imagine how one sound could lead to the birth of another. On the track Feel First Life, I have a synth sound that gradually morphs into a choral sound. That idea of a 15-part choir appearing out of the fabric of electronic sounds was what I was looking to do all those years ago. Trying to work out how to get that on to an electronic album without it sounding ridiculous was one of the fun challenges. You also said that the album “is designed to follow the build, peak and release of a psychedelic experience”. Yeah, that was definitely one of the primary inspirations for how it turned out sonically. It’s something I’ve only recently become interested in; I didn’t really feel ready to go deep into the psychedelic space until a couple of years ago. What kind of psychedelics are we talking about? Quite specifically, the naturally occurring ones. I’m fascinated by the idea that I can eat a mushroom that grows in the ground and have these crazy cosmic experiences that will then appear in the music and then possibly affect other people. I like to have an album arc that comes from an experience rather than a story. Immunity was more of an MDMA-type album, with the melancholy and the tinge of mild dystopia you get with huge, adventurous nights out. This album is more wholesome, in that it’s geared towards naturally occurring things. Is the album title referring to the technological singularity – the moment when artificial superintelligence comes of age? Not really, though possibly the title track is about that. How do you feel about robots taking over? I’m a massive catastrophist by nature. I’m not keen on interfering with nature; I don’t want to edit my genome. I checked into a hotel recently and got text messages from a virtual assistant called Edward. I just texted back saying: “Fuck off.” I’m looking forward to the moment when people will finally twig that filming a concert is actually less fun than watching a concert. What did you learn from working with Brian Eno? I learned so much. It wasn’t really technical stuff – it was more about disrupting your natural processes, about enjoying [making music] more and not getting bogged down in the minutiae. Eno really broke down my idea of electronic music as a perfectly structured thing. It made me a little more loose and more human in how I approached it. Have you seen or heard anything good recently? I did enjoy [Alex Garland’s] film Annihilation. Maybe not in the way it was intended to be enjoyed – I didn’t really like the large mutant CG monster – but it had an incredible visual aesthetic. The way it looks is unbelievably dreamlike, beautiful – I was really hypnotised. And it has an incredible score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury. For me, the score is one of the main characters of a film."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/22/shakespeare-sceptrd-isle-part-europe-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T06:00:15Z","webTitle":"Shakespeare’s sceptr’d isle has always been a part of Europe | William Keegan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/22/shakespeare-sceptrd-isle-part-europe-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/22/shakespeare-sceptrd-isle-part-europe-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Shakespeare’s sceptr’d isle has always been a part of Europe","bodyText":"We know that the Brexiters want to recapture a lost Britain; and few Britons can rival William Shakespeare in the patriotism stakes. It intrigued me, therefore, to hear the following from a Shakespearean scholar who recently delivered a Bardic talk in – where else? – Stratford-upon-Avon. Stratford-upon-Avon is as near to Middle England as any Brexiter could wish. When it came to questions, my acquaintance was slightly surprised by the first one: which way would Shakespeare have voted in the referendum? But, mindful of the fact that so many of Shakespeare’s plays are set in continental Europe, he immediately answered Remain. As Andrew Adonis and my colleague Will Hutton note in their forthcoming book Saving Britain, Shakespeare said “all the world’s a stage”, but Europe was his actual stage. My brother Victor once noted that, on a rail journey west from Venice, three stations are in places immortalised in five Shakespeare plays: Venice itself (Othello and The Merchant of Venice); Padua (The Taming of the Shrew); Verona (Romeo and Juliet and The Two Gentlemen of Verona). Indeed, most of his plays are set on the continent. As one of his greatest admirers, Ben Jonson, wrote about the homage Europe owes to him: “Triumph my Britain, thou hast one to show/To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.” As Winston Churchill, hero of Remainers and Brexiters alike, knew only too well, we are European. We went to war to save Europe. Under the Brexiters’ heroine, Margaret Thatcher, we were the driving force behind extending the boundaries of the EU to embrace eastern European countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, whom we had helped to save from Hitler and who had then fallen into the hands of our wartime ally, Stalin. The UK is an integral part of the European economy. Large segments of our public and private sectors are in fact owned by continental entities – not least our transport network and public utilities. There is much talk these days of “globalisation”, but the key economic development of the British economy in recent decades has been Europeanisation. One hears almost daily reports of how the manufacture of familiar products – cars, refrigerators, washing machines etc – involves criss-crossing national boundaries with minimum disruption, thanks to the combination of the customs union and the single market. The young, and those of us who are not so young, have got used to freedom of movement around Europe, which would almost certainly be threatened if Brexit is allowed to go ahead. Although it is easy to criticise their occasional excesses, the advent of cheap airlines has been a boon to citizens who can fly all over Europe at bargain prices. It is not for nothing that Michael O’Leary of Ryanair is such a formidable Remain campaigner. I have said before, but it is important to say again, that the problem for the Remain campaign, and therefore for the country, is that the serious economic and social damage from Brexit would not be fully apparent until after March next year, when our misguided prime minister has set the date for leaving the EU. Now, I did not get where I am today without quite a good network of contacts. What is coming across to me loud and clear is the extent to which so many multinationals and smaller businesses are making contingency plans to relocate to mainland Europe. Most of our elected representatives are in politics with the object of doing some public good. They will have failed if they do not put a stop to Brexit. How will they answer their children and grandchildren during the 2020s when asked: “What did you do during the biggest economic threat to our nation of your career?” Will they lamely answer: “Oh, I went along with what I thought was the will of the people?” It would be good if those of our elected representatives who have been too hesitant to say what they feel – which is that Brexit is crazy – were to consult the research of Bettergovgroup. As Timothy Clarke of that research group has pointed out, analysis of voters’ motivations during the referendum “reveals that a significant proportion of those voting Leave were simply protesting about the state of politics within the UK … Most of those who voted in the referendum wished to stay in the single market … “While parliamentarians and much of the press have been insisting that Brexit is ‘the will of the people’, the people are far from convinced. There is now a widespread public recognition that the referendum was flawed and that people were not given the relevant facts.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/20/royal-mail-moya-greene-to-step-down-as-chief-executive-rico-back","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T11:42:44Z","webTitle":"Moya Greene to step down as Royal Mail’s chief executive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/20/royal-mail-moya-greene-to-step-down-as-chief-executive-rico-back","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/20/royal-mail-moya-greene-to-step-down-as-chief-executive-rico-back","fields":{"headline":"Moya Greene to step down as Royal Mail’s chief executive","bodyText":"Moya Greene, one of the FTSE 100’s few female bosses, is to step down from the helm of Royal Mail. Greene will retire as chief executive later this year after an eight-year tenure that included the controversial privatisation of Britain’s postal service in 2013. She will be replaced in June by Rico Back, a Swiss-domiciled German who runs the group’s European subsidiary General Logistics Systems (GLS). The departure of Greene, who will formally step down from the board in the summer but stay on until September to ensure an “orderly handover”, will leave just six women in charge of FTSE 100 firms. Royal Mail said Greene, a Canadian national who will leave with a near-£1m payoff, had transformed the business, which had been struggling after services were opened up to competition in 2006. The group’s chairman, Peter Long, said: “When Moya joined in the summer of 2010, the company was balance sheet insolvent. Since then, Royal Mail has been transformed, including our privatisation in 2013 and two significant, groundbreaking agreements with the CWU [Communications Workers Union]. “Alongside the strong financial position Moya has secured for the company, we have invested over £1.5bn in our UK operation in recent years.” Royal Mail shares were up nearly 0.4% in morning trading after the announcement. Its share price soared by 40% on the first day of trading in October 2013, fuelling complaints that the government had sold off a national asset to private investors on the cheap. Greene, who led Canada Post for five years before joining Royal Mail, said it had been a privilege to serve “this cherished UK institution”. She is currently a non-executive at easyJet and a trustee of Tate, and will become a non-executive director of Rio Tinto later this year. Back has been a senior executive in the group for 18 years. He was a founding member of German Parcel in 1989, which was bought by Royal Mail in 1999 and later rebranded as GLS. Royal Mail said Back would receive the same total £790,000 pay and benefits as Greene, with a possible £1.3m bonus, and would pay UK tax. The company also announced the appointment of Sue Whalley as chief executive of post and parcels at Royal Mail UK, with responsibility for most British revenue and operations. The six remaining female chief executives of FTSE 100 firms are: Alison Cooper of Imperial Brands; Alison Brittain of Whitbread; Liv Garfield of Severn Trent; Véronique Laury of Kingfisher; Emma Walmsley of GlaxoSmithKline; and Carolyn McCall, who recently moved from easyJet to ITV."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/22/anthony-burgess-essays--clockwork-orange-hemingway-jb-priestley-fitz-lang-metropolis","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T23:05:05Z","webTitle":"Lost Anthony Burgess essays reveal his hidden inspirations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/22/anthony-burgess-essays--clockwork-orange-hemingway-jb-priestley-fitz-lang-metropolis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/22/anthony-burgess-essays--clockwork-orange-hemingway-jb-priestley-fitz-lang-metropolis","fields":{"headline":"Lost Anthony Burgess essays reveal his hidden inspirations","bodyText":"Previously unpublished essays by Anthony Burgess have been discovered almost 25 years after his death. The writings cover a range of subjects, including Metropolis, Fritz Lang’s classic 1927 film, and fellow writers Ernest Hemingway and JB Priestley. They also include an unpublished 1991 lecture on censorship. Some of the material was discovered in the archives of the International Anthony Burgess Foundation, an educational charity in Manchester, the city in which the writer was born in 1917. Will Carr, the foundation’s deputy director, told the Observer: “Some of the approaches [within the unpublished writings] … may have been considered too personal and reflective, but in retrospect I believe offer fascinating new insights into Burgess’s work.” Carr has included the essays in a forthcoming book, titled Anthony Burgess, The Ink Trade: Selected Journalism 1961-1993, which will be published next month. Burgess made his name as a satirical novelist with the 1962 publication of A Clockwork Orange, a savage social satire that inspired Stanley Kubrick’s 1971 screen adaptation, known for its violent and sexually explicit scenes. Burgess was a prolific journalist, writing in the Observer for more than 30 years. In the introduction to The Ink Trade, Carr writes that Burgess’s “greatest loyalty was perhaps to the Observer – ‘my paper’, as he called it”. As the book’s editor, Carr notes the “astonishing” breadth of subjects treated by Burgess – from anthropology to the evils of taxation – and observes that this “vast storehouse” of journalism is “as rewarding as the best of his novels”. In the undated essay on Metropolis, Lang’s vision of a futuristic society, Burgess wrote: “If any movie got near to changing my life, it was this.” Carr said: “Burgess’s love for the film and its ideas is well known as it appears in his autobiography, but this new piece offers a far more detailed engagement with it than elsewhere and says something new about the influence of cinema on his writing.” The Hemingway essay was written in 1979. Carr said: “Burgess wrote a lot on Hemingway – a whole book, and also a television film, but this piece is a highly personal and somewhat melancholy account of his attitude to his work. Burgess says things here that he doesn’t say anywhere else.” Burgess writes that Hemingway’s readers expected that the author should be at least as virile as his own creations: “Hemingway obliged them with the Hemingway myth. This myth helped to kill him.” He continued: “How can you explain to the great public that one of the most important things in the world is to invent a new way of saying things? But nobody cares about style, language, the power of the word. They prefer to hear about failure really being success, about a great writer killing himself at the early age (my age) of 62.” The essays span Burgess’s journalistic career, including the Yorkshire Post, from which he was sacked after reviewing one of his own books – Inside Mister Enderby, published under the pseudonym Joseph Kell. Apparently assuming that the paper had sent it to him as a joke, he gave it an unflattering review, writing: “It turns sex, religion, the state into a series of laughing stocks. The book itself is a laughing stock.” The review, dated 1963, is included in The Ink Trade. The Yorkshire Post’s humourless response prompted writer Gore Vidal to quip at the time: “At least, he is the first novelist in England to know that a reviewer has actually read the book under review.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/27/frank-miller-xerxes-cursed-sin-city-the-dark-knight-returns","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"Frank Miller: 'I wasn't thinking clearly when I said those things'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/27/frank-miller-xerxes-cursed-sin-city-the-dark-knight-returns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/27/frank-miller-xerxes-cursed-sin-city-the-dark-knight-returns","fields":{"headline":"Frank Miller: 'I wasn't thinking clearly when I said those things'","bodyText":"As far back as he can remember, Frank Miller always wanted to draw a gangster. “I decided that I wanted to make comic books when I was five years old,” the cartoonist says. “I declared to my parents that I was going to do that for the rest of my life.” He’s wearing a black T-shirt with a drawing of Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and the words “high-functioning sociopath”, a white beard that makes him look older than his 61 years, and a near-constant smile. In photos, Miller scowls heavily into the camera, the very image of the kind of grizzled tough he might have drawn in Sin City. But in conversation he is very clearly not a sociopath: in fact, he is a little anxious and very friendly and eager to talk about all his titanically influential works: Sin City, Batman, Daredevil. After a long absence from the public eye, he is suddenly everywhere again. In March he signed a five-project deal with DC Comics that includes penning a new Superman graphic novel. He bagged another deal, with Netflix and Simon &amp; Schuster, for an Arthurian-themed project called Cursed. And his latest graphic novel is already underway: Xerxes, a prequel to 300, his tale of the ancient battle of Thermopylae, adapted for film by Zack Snyder in 2006. The new series is set to span the rise and fall of the Persian empire: from before the birth of the ambitious and bloodthirsty titular king, to the life of his son and the rise of Alexander. Miller is fascinated by the period. “The Spartans were strange catalysts of democracy,” he says. “They were utter fascists. They had the best land in Greece, and it was tilled by slaves and the citizens were all soldiers to defend the territory. The Athenians were the ones who gave birth to democracy, but the Spartans made it all possible.” These are the first substantial projects Miller has had in several years, barring a halting return to comics in 2015, when he worked on a Batman graphic novel. His writing is sometimes criticised as unsubtle – his villains tend to be terribly bad and his heroes tremendously good – but his visual style is unmistakable, even as it has changed radically over his 40-year career. During a long run on Marvel’s Daredevil, his subjects’ anatomy evolved from conventional superhero fodder. His almost caricature figures in The Dark Knight Returns, posed against intricate backgrounds, made his take on Batman an instant classic. When he drew Sin City, he changed again: drowning his pages in black ink and rendering cityscapes with only flecks of light—its last arc is almost hallucinatory, a black-and-white series that explodes into full colour after the hero is pumped full of a toxin by his enemies. Miller’s politics seemed to become more eccentric as his drawing did the same. In 2011, he published what he called “a propaganda comic”: Holy Terror, a gory tale of a caped superhero taking on al-Qaida. In one scene, the hero tortures a suicide bomber as his Catwomanish girlfriend observes that she’s “OK with that.” It’s just one of the book’s many other acts of gory revenge on Miller’s Muslims, who stone and behead people and scream, “Praise Allah!” Readers and critics responded with bafflement and anger; one critic called it “one of the most appalling, offensive and vindictive comics of all time”. That same year, Miller went on a tirade against the Occupy Wall Street movement, describing it in a blog as “a pack of louts, thieves, and rapists … Wake up, pond scum. America is at war against a ruthless enemy. Maybe, between bouts of self-pity and all the other tasty tidbits of narcissism you’ve been served up in your sheltered, comfy little worlds, you’ve heard terms like al-Qaida and Islamicism.” Miller was again branded a reactionary. “My stuff always represents what I’m going through,” Miller says today. “Whenever I look at any of my work I can feel what my mindset was and I remember who I was with at the time. When I look at Holy Terror, which I really don’t do all that often, I can really feel the anger ripple out of the pages. There are places where it is bloodthirsty beyond belief.” Does he have any regrets? “I don’t want to go back and start erasing books I did,” he replies. “I don’t want to wipe out chapters of my own biography. But I’m not capable of that book again.” It’s worth noting that whatever his detractors may think of his politics, Miller still happily inveighs against “white, heterosexual family values” and has no interest in defending his views on Occupy Wall Street. “I wasn’t thinking clearly,” he confesses. Does he support Donald Trump? “Real men stay bald,” he says with a grin, lifting his hat to run a hand over his bare scalp. Miller got his start in comics in the late 1970s, when he was in his early 20s, after his dad helped him move to New York City to chase his dream of making it as a comic-book illustrator. Eager to get started, he made three calls: one each to DC and Marvel, and a third to his hero: Neal Adams, whose Batman and Green Lantern comics had made him a superstar. Adams’s daughter answered the phone; Miller convinced his idol to take a look at his portfolio. Adams credits his daughter with his decision to give Miller a chance. “Obviously she felt sorry for him because he was a skinny kid who looked like Ichabod Crane,” he says. Miller’s portfolio was “awful,” he says, laughing. “It was so bad. My heart sunk, and I was like, ‘Oh my God, one of these guys.’” Many artists were so humiliated by the harsh feedback Adams gave that they never came back – not Miller. (“Anything but!” Miller exclaims. “It was exhilarating that my idol was that generous with his time!”) But Miller’s subsequent success, Adams says, is not his doing. “Whatever you do, don’t say that I’m responsible for Frank Miller,” he warns. “I’ve done the same thing for a hundred guys and nobody responded the way Frank did. Nobody advanced that quickly. And I made it hard for him! If you’d gone through it, you’d have gone home crying. I never would have thought that he’d turn out to be what he is. He’s become like a son to me. I didn’t teach him any other of life’s lessons, unfortunately, and I should have. That was the bad part.” Why did Miller take a years-long sabbatical from the medium he’d pursued his whole life? Adams blames the traditional trappings of fame – bad influences and alcohol. When asked about his absence, the limit to Miller’s candour is revealed. “I just got very distracted by real life,” he says. “I’d rather not go into it.” Through a publicist, he declined to respond to his mentor’s assessment. Adams wishes he’d told Miller that life wasn’t just work. “We just talked about work. And if you don’t teach family or good health to somebody, then suddenly you turn around and go, ‘Oh, my God. We didn’t have that conversation.’ And you feel like shit, because Frank didn’t. And now he’s having to learn it.” In part, he blames Miller’s success for the years he says his friend sacrificed to that lesson. “You cannot accept other people’s view of you. You cannot believe when other people say, ‘Oh my God, you’re great, you’re a legend.’ You cannot accept that. It’s no way to live. And as soon as you do, you start convincing yourself that you’re something that you’re not, that somehow you can drink two bottles of whiskey and nothing will happen to you.” In his last conversation with Miller, Adams says he told his protege he was going to die. “I told him he was white trash, and I’d be surprised if he makes it for six months, because he’s taken his life and ruined it, and he said, ‘Well, I’d like to show you I’m not that way,’ and I said, ‘If you recover, I’ll see you in six months, maybe a year.’” “‘I think of you like a son,’” Adams remembers saying, “‘and I’m gonna lose you.’” Now he believes Miller “will mend”. Forty years in the business – even with the break – and Miller is still here, having his makeup adjusted in between sips of tea in a photography studio in Manhattan, the city that has been his most reliable and consistent source of inspiration. Perhaps the best evidence that Adams is right is also fairly simple. Frank Miller’s drawing again. Due to an editing error, this piece conflated Sin City and 300; this has been corrected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/23/turkey-tunisia-egypt-bounce-summer-back-package-holiday-favourites","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T08:00:06Z","webTitle":"Turkey bounces back as package holiday favourite","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/23/turkey-tunisia-egypt-bounce-summer-back-package-holiday-favourites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/23/turkey-tunisia-egypt-bounce-summer-back-package-holiday-favourites","fields":{"headline":"Turkey bounces back as package holiday favourite","bodyText":"Turkey is outselling mainland Spain and the Canary islands as British holidaymakers return to the destination in big numbers. Package holidays to Turkey are up 84% year on year, according to Thomas Cook – a growth being fuelled by families, who account for 61% of bookings. The country is also seeing the highest number of return customers of any of Thomas Cook’s destinations. Visitor numbers to Turkey nosedived in 2016 following a series of terrorist attacks and a failed coup, but following a recovery in 2017, it is the “standout destination for summer 2018”, said Thomas Cook managing director Chris Mottershead. The top five most popular destinations in the Thomas Cook Holiday Report, released today, are Spain (which remains the most popular destination), Greece, Turkey, the USA and the Caribbean. But Spain is only in the top slot when the Balearic islands are included, and the gap between Greece and Turkey is closing. Outside Europe, Egypt’s shattered tourism industry is looking its healthiest since 2011, with bookings up 89% year on year, despite the fact that there are still no direct flights to the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh, in accordance with current FCO advice. Instead, Thomas Cook flies to the resort of Hurgharda, and Marsa Alam, 300km further south. Tunisia is also welcoming back tourists after the 2015 Sousse attacks effectively put an end to tourism in the country, a development that had devastating effect on its economy. Since the FCO lifted its ban on visiting the country in July 2017, tour operators have started to sell holidays there again and bookings are healthy enough for Thomas Cook to increase its flights to 11 a week. Despite the trend for more adventurous, experiential trips, the package holiday is far from over. A report by the Association of British Travel Agents last year said packages “remain the single most popular booking option for foreign holidays” and, according to Mintel, the package market is expected to grow 7.5% by 2022. Their continued popularity in the era of low-cost flights and airbnb is being fuelled in part by economic uncertainty – all-inclusives may not be fashionable but they are popular, up 10% year on year – but also by a shift away from the standard bucket and spade trip. Two years ago Thomas Cook introduced Casa Cook, an upmarket boutique brand targetting a new, younger market. This year sees the launch of Cook’s Club, similarly design-focused hotels aimed at a more budget-conscious travellers. The first Cook’s Club opens on 1 June in Hersonissos on Crete’s north coast. Introducing more choice has ensured the continued success of the package. Thomas Cook struck publicity gold when it introduced “pre-book your sunbed” option in January this year. It also offers a “choose your room” service."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/20/broccoli-for-bulldogs-how-arsene-wenger-transformed-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T17:39:40Z","webTitle":"Broccoli for bulldogs: how Arsène Wenger transformed Arsenal | Clive Anderson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/20/broccoli-for-bulldogs-how-arsene-wenger-transformed-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/20/broccoli-for-bulldogs-how-arsene-wenger-transformed-arsenal","fields":{"headline":"Broccoli for bulldogs: how Arsène Wenger transformed Arsenal","bodyText":"I was there right at the beginning of Arsène Wenger’s extraordinary 22-year reign at Arsenal FC. Twenty-two years when the average time in charge of a Premier League manager has become less than 22 months. At the old Highbury stadium I was recording a history of Arsenal for a VHS, if you can remember what they were. Late in the day I was given an extra bit of script to tack on to the end. Arsenal were struggling. The successful George Graham era had come to an unhappy end with allegations of financial shenanigans. Graham’s replacement, Bruce Rioch, hadn’t quite cut the mustard. So, looking forward I was to link to a new appointment – a Frenchman currently working in Japan. French? Japan! The insular world of English football was flabbergasted. So Arsène Wenger was known at first as Arsène Who. But not for long. When he arrived, Arsenal had only one foreign superstar, Dennis Bergkamp, a cramped stadium and a training ground shared with a university sports club. Players ate steak and chips before the game and drank pints of beer afterwards. Monsieur Wenger changed all that. An array of French and Francophone footballers were brought in to enliven the midfield and attack. Solid British bulldogs were introduced to the joys of steamed broccoli and yoga. State of the art facilities were installed at London Colney and eventually a state of the art stadium became Arsenal’s new home. Boring boring Arsenal became Double winners, Invincibles and a joy to watch. In 2006 Arsenal even got to the Champions League final, but just couldn’t overcome Barcelona. But who was Arsène Who? On a handful occasions at dinners and special events I have had the chance to interview him or have a chat. He politely engages with conversations with enthusiastic fans, however ill-informed. He gives you his attention but gives nothing away. At one pre-season dinner I thought I was getting the lowdown on the upcoming campaign, but days later he sold the club captain Patrick Vieira. Maybe it slipped his mind. An absent-minded professor? Probably not Of course, there have been fans, ill-informed or otherwise, clamouring for him to leave in the last few years when top four in the league and several FA Cup wins was all his teams could manage. Piers Morgan has been demanding Arsène’s head for years. It is not a bad approach in most aspects of life to find out what Piers Morgan thinks, and think the opposite. But all good things come to an end, and Arsène has been a very good thing, and this is where it ends. I hope they make him the manager of the French national team when the job becomes available. Whoever replaces him at Arsenal, you can be sure won’t last for more than 20 years. I fear they won’t be anything like as successful as Arsène. They certainly won’t have such a big impact on English football. Adieu, or is it au revoir, Arsène? You will certainly be welcome back when we unveil your statue outside the Emirates. So, as Douglas Adams very nearly put it, so long, Arsène, and thanks for all the trophies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/20/avicii-appreciation-the-poster-boy-for-edm-who-struggled-with-the-spotlight","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T15:46:25Z","webTitle":"Avicii: the poster boy for EDM who struggled with the spotlight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/20/avicii-appreciation-the-poster-boy-for-edm-who-struggled-with-the-spotlight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/20/avicii-appreciation-the-poster-boy-for-edm-who-struggled-with-the-spotlight","fields":{"headline":"Avicii: the poster boy for EDM who struggled with the spotlight","bodyText":"Avicii was an avatar as much as he was a producer. Exploding on to the scene in 2011 with his unabashedly saccharine hit Levels, the Swedish musician born Tim Bergling represented, depending on where one stood, either the best or worst of dance music’s rise in the United States. Just 21 years old at the time of his breakthrough, Bergling was perhaps an unlikely star. All cheekbones and platinum hair, he never seemed entirely comfortable in the spotlight. Friends and colleagues described him as shy and quiet, a sweet kid with the heart of a technician. In interviews, his responses could come off as canned or reticent, as reporters probed for answers from an artist seemingly more comfortable at his computer assembling tracks. But his music was a different story. Avicii was one of the first EDM stars to arrive on the scene fully formed, and he hit just as dance music was for the first time gaining mainstream popularity in the US. Discovered on MySpace by veteran Dutch producer Laidback Luke, Bergling took his name from the Buddhist term for hell, avīci, and began pumping out an arsenal of hits that quickly defined a burgeoning genre. Tracks including Levels, Fade Into Darkness and Silhouettes were slick, massive, earnest and unapologetically pop-oriented. With them, Avicii paid homage to influences like Swedish House Mafia and Daft Punk while at the same time creating the tension build and release template still being replicated nearly a decade later. These tracks became anthems for the millions of millennials gathering at massive festivals to partake in the relentlessly escapist electronic music scene of the late aughts. Avicii’s music was wildly popular among a generation coming of age in the post 9/11 era of perpetual war and economic uncertainty. While grunge and hip-hop had been the bluntly angry clarion calls for previous generations, EDM provided these kids with the spirit of celebration and unity that ran counter to headlines on the nightly news. EDM was collective catharsis, and Avicii was, for a time, the biggest artist delivering it. He was anti-politic, existing in a bubble of champagne and confetti bursts, and his music served as a sonic antidepressant for listeners around the world. It was a dance dance revolution that didn’t sit well with many veteran scenesters who had been plugging away in the electronic music underground since the late 70s. Shiny, populist and capitalist to its core, EDM ran counter to the defining values held dear by many fringe-dwelling old school scenesters. The kids didn’t care. And neither did Avicii, who crisscrossed the globe headlining the world’s biggest dance music and mainstream pop festivals – Tomorrowland, Ultra Miami, EDC Las Vegas, Coachella and more – and signing on for massively lucrative Las Vegas residences just as the city was establishing itself as the United States’ EDM hub. Through the guidance of his manager Ash Pournouri, a Svengali type with whom Avicii was deeply close, Avicii raised the pay grade for DJs throughout the scene, pushing into the mid six figures for festival and club sets. With his head floating on billboards along the interstate from Los Angeles to Vegas, he was literally the EDM poster boy. Onstage, Bergling typically sported jeans, a T-shirt and a backwards baseball cap, with his right hand lifted and moving along to the music while he happily shuffled behind the decks. If he was uncomfortable in the media, the stage seemed to be a sweet spot. He once called attention the worst part of his job, saying, “I love what I do, but I’ve never liked being recognized or being in the spotlight.” His music earned him a pair of Grammy nominations, one for his work on David Guetta’s Sunshine and another in 2013 for Levels. In a 2013 interview, he told me these nominations were the proudest moments of his career. The freshness and crossover appeal of his sound also brought a line of superstars eager for EDM crossover plays to his door. He co-produced a track on Madonna’s 2015 LP Rebel Heart while Sky Full of Stars, a 2014 collaboration with Coldplay, was a worldwide radio hit. His own biggest smash was 2013’s Wake Me Up, a folk music crossover that was booed by the audience at Ultra when Avicii debuted it at the festival in 2013. No matter. Featuring singer Aloe Blacc, the urgently uplifting track hit No 1 in more than 40 countries and presciently tapped into the market potential of mixing EDM and country, a template many artists have since recreated. The song appeared on his 2013 solo debut album True, which hit the top 10 in more than 15 countries. But there were signs of wear and tear too. The tour schedule of the Avicii juggernaut was intense, with him hitting clubs and festivals on every continent except Antarctica and often playing two shows a night. Bergling cancelled his headlining set at Ultra 2014 in order to have emergency gallbladder and appendix surgery. (Deadmau5 stepped in to take his place.) A 2013 GQ profile captured the alcohol-soaked hedonism of his life as the boy king of EDM and found Bergling “subsisting on a diet of Red Bull, nicotine, and airport food”. (The article was widely slammed by Avicii fans, with Bergling himself calling it “truly unfair and incorrect”.) In 2014, the addiction rumors were substantiated when Avicii cancelled all of his scheduled concerts due to health problems. “In the beginning, I’d party a lot … every night was a party,” he told me in 2013. “But I just realized that for me personally, my body and mind couldn’t handle it any more.” He officially retired from performing live in 2016, at the age of 26. Two years later and Avicii’s publicist has announced that Bergling was found dead on the Arabian peninsula, thousands of miles from his home in Stockholm. “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the loss of Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii,” Diana Baron said in a statement. “He was found dead in Muscat, Oman this Friday afternoon local time, April 20th. The family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time. No further statements will be given.” Mainstream popularity can often feel like ritual sacrifice, as we build people up only to stand captivated as they descend – into addiction, into turmoil, into avīci. Tim Bergling’s story has come to a tragic if not entirely unpredictable end, one at odds with the joy of the music he so expertly produced during his brief but influential moment at the top. It’s hard to mourn to a song like Levels that so adamantly denies the darkness. EDM is about joyful celebration in the face of conflict. Perhaps this was Bergling’s undoing.

In fact, I had no idea about either the question or the answer when I submitted a “subject access request” to Eldon Insurance Services in December last year. Or that my car – a vehicle that dates from the last millennium – could hold any sort of clue to anything. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, however, in pursuing the Cambridge Analytica scandal, it’s that however weird things look, they can always get weirder. Because I was simply seeking information, as I have for the last 16-plus months, about what the Leave campaigns did during the referendum – specifically, what they did with data. And the subject access request – a legal mechanism I’d learned about from Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a Swiss mathematician and data expert – was a shot in the dark. Under British data protection laws, “data subjects” – you and me – have the right to ask companies or organisations what personal information about them they hold. And, a series of incidents had led me to wonder what, if any, personal information Leave.EU – the campaign headed by Nigel Farage and bankrolled by Arron Banks, a Bristol-based businessman – may have held on me. By the time I submitted my request in December, I’d already been writing about them and their relationship with Cambridge Analytica for almost a year – the first piece in February triggering two investigations by the Electoral Commission and Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). But, in November, I appeared to touch a nerve. Leave.EU’s persistent but mostly lighthearted attacks on my work began to change in tone. Conservative MPs had started to criticise the government’s Brexit plans, it had been revealed that Robert Mueller was investigating Cambridge Analytica, and it was in the middle of this that Leave.EU put out a video: a spoof video that showed me being beaten up and threatened with a gun. It was intended to creep me out. And it did. What else, I wondered, did Leave.EU have planned? What else did it know about me? And where had it come from? Companies House shows dozens of companies registered in Banks’s name and variants of his name – Aaron Banks, Aron Fraser Andrew Banks, Arron Andrew Fraser Banks, to name three – including a private investigations firm, Precision Risk and Intelligence Ltd. Andy Wigmore – a director of Eldon and Leave.EU’s spokesman – had told me previously that all insurance firms had access to police databases for fraud prevention purposes. So, on 17 December last year I submitted a request to Liz Bilney, chief executive of both Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance Services, that asked for the personal information held on me by 19 of Banks’s companies. The letter triggered a steam of abuse, Banks and Wigmore revealing the contents of my letter in a series of tweets. The next day, I complained to the ICO that my attempt to access my private data, as is my right under British law, had been disclosed publicly and used as the basis to attack me further. The ICO found them to be “likely” in breach of the Data Protection Act and said it had written to notify them. Bilney asked me to pay £170 – you can charge up to £10 for each request by law – and just over a month later I received two folders of data, one relating to the personal information held on me by Leave.EU and the other by Eldon Insurance Services. The second folder was a surprise. And not just to me. “We have no information on you dopey! You are a political adversary not a customer…” Banks had tweeted at me. And when I’d complained, he said: “You aren’t a customer, we don’t hold any data on you and frankly a journalist asking questions isn’t private, dopey!” He was right: I wasn’t an Eldon customer. But there it was: my Eldon data, a spreadsheet, that showed it had gathered 12 different sets of data on me from three different sources. These were identified by different codes and a legend supplied with the spreadsheet revealed the codes represented software companies. And there was my data: Eldon had my name, age, address, email address, friends and family who had been on my car insurance and how I had been scored for risk. How did Eldon have it? And where did it come from? Was I – or had I been – a customer of Eldon at some point? I hadn’t, it turned out, but a search of my inbox revealed that on 27 July last year, I’d taken out car insurance on the basis of a quote I’d obtained from Moneysupermarket.com. The telling detail was that it was sent at 13.34, the same time as the final entry on the spreadsheet. I had given Moneysupermarket.com all sorts of private information: my home, car, personal relationships, and it had passed that private, sensitive information on to Eldon. Going back to Moneysupermarket, I could see that I’d consented to my data being shared with its partners when I sought quotes and that, according to the terms and conditions it had set out, it could share it if it wanted. Two months earlier, I’d spent 72 hours getting increasingly unsettled by the video Leave.EU put out and which, despite hundreds of complaints from people, it had refused to take down. Banks had previously told me that “I wouldn’t be so lippy in Russia” and both he and Leave.EU had made a habit of retweeting personal attacks directed at me by the Russian Embassy’s Twitter account. The video, showing a photoshopped image of me being hit in the face to the music of the Russian national anthem, went up the same week the Telegraph launched an attack on “Brexit mutineers”. Brendan Cox – the widow of Jo Cox – said that it created “a context where violence is more likely”. Another Leave.EU tweet called them a “cancer”. The atmosphere was ugly. And the video felt threatening. I felt threatened. It wasn’t so much that it had been put up, but that it stayed up – only coming down, eventually, when the Observer’s editors intervened. I tell the story at length because this is the context in which I found out this information. And because it turns out that my experience may not be unique. Moneysupermarket responded: “Our providers use the personal information from our customers to generate personalised quotes for the service they have asked for (such as quoting for car insurance) and are not allowed to use this information for anything else unless they have permission from the customer.” But I had given my consent and it shared my information in accordance with its privacy policy. In its annual report, it reveals it holds data on 24.9 million people – half the British electorate. My disquiet about what information companies and organisations hold on me, and how it might be used, is a disquiet that, in the light of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, should perhaps be felt by everyone. Or at least raise questions. Questions, such as: what private information do Banks’s companies hold on you? Where did it come from? How might it have been used? Last week an ex-director of Cambridge Analytica, Brittany Kaiser, made explosive new claims in testimony to MPs. She appeared before the select committee for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and told MPs that, despite ferocious denials repeated for more than a year, Cambridge Analytica did process data for Leave.EU and Ukip. It did carry out work for the campaign, she said. But she also told MPs – and submitted evidence – that she had been asked to devise a strategy to combine Ukip, Leave.EU and Eldon insurance data to politically profile people. What’s more, she said, she visited Eldon’s call centre and HQ in Bristol, which had also served as the campaign HQ for Leave.EU, and seen with her “own eyes” how Eldon employees used Eldon data to target people with political messages. If true, Ravi Naik, a human rights lawyer who specialises in data rights, says it would be a scandal on the level of the one now engulfing Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. Because my attempt to find something as benign and unavoidable as a new insurance deal – just like millions of others – for my Peugeot had inadvertently revealed personal data they potentially had access to. “It’s what Christopher Wylie has been saying about the weaponisation of data,” says Naik. “The idea that by doing something fundamental to your day-to-day life could have led to sensitive personal information being used in ways you don’t know about, let alone consented to.” Banks told the Observer that Kaiser’s evidence “was a tissue of lies”, that she had visited Eldon’s offices only once, that the call centre handled calls from the public or those who followed Leave.EU on social media, and that the company “absolutely refutes” that any insurance data was used in the campaign. He said: “Eldon has never given... any data to Leave.EU, they are separate entities with strong data control rules. And vice versa.” The folder containing my Eldon data was one of two I received back. The other marked Leave.EU contained all sorts of odd material: emails I’d sent Banks and Wigmore, and replies they’d sent to me. Emails they’d sent employees about me. Emails about mocking up Photoshopped images of me to put out on Twitter. Typical is this one from 13 December, in which Wigmore writes: “Can we get a picture of carole codswallop accepting her award Oscar style thanking the Russians, Facebook Arron and myself with caption only 75p spent on Brexit etc – make it funny.” Or this one from May last year, four days after the Observer published the first story that used Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, as an anonymous source: “Can you do a tile of Carole Cadwalladr with a tin foil hat on, looking manic at a computer with a big whiteboard with illuminati triangles with a big chalkboard filled with formulae etc. No copy. She’s looking into the campaign trying to find a big global conspiracy and we want to take the piss out of her…” He did. The image – flatearth.jpg – is attached in the next email and later @LeaveEUOfficial put it out on Twitter. “Madwoman @carolecadwalla is desperate to unearth some global conspiracy to undermine the #EURef. There isn’t one. Leave won, get over it!” So far, so predictable. The “piss taking” was – until November’s video – the main mode of communication from Leave.EU to me. But the email chain and others in the folder pose more questions. Questions about the relationship between Banks and Leave.EU. About the relationship of Banks with Eldon insurance. And their relationship to each other. Questions that urgently need answers. Because the request to Leave.EU was assigned to an employee whose email states “(Eldon Insurance Services)” and who has worked for Eldon Insurance Services Ltd since October 2016. He was assigned the “task” by someone with a Leave.EU email address and the email links through to a password-protected website called www.eldoninsuranceservices.eu.teamwork.com. Also cc-ed is another employee who Kaiser’s emails, released via parliament last week, show was involved with the work that Cambridge Analytica did for the campaign. His LinkedIn profile describes him as doing political work on behalf of Eldon Insurance. Other employees are listed as working for working both companies. Eldon’s operations manager, for example, is also Leave.EU’s operations manager. When asked about this crossover of employees, directors and projects, Banks said: “During the campaign a small number of managers were allocated, expensed in the EC [electoral commission] return and worked on Leave.EU.” When asked about current employees, including current employees who were working for both organisations concurrently, he gave no reply. Leave.EU was, and still is, based within Eldon Insurance’s HQ. Westmonster, the political news site Banks founded and funded, is registered to an Eldon Insurance address. Adverts for his firm GoSkippy are routinely sent to people on Leave.EU’s mailing list. Last year, Banks defended the practice, saying: “Why shouldn’t I? It’s my data.” When asked again last week, he said: “Leave.EU after the referendum campaign carried the occasional ad for insurance, so what?” In an email a day later, he said: “Eldon has never given ... any data to Leave.EU.” Last week, the Observer revealed that in the same week that the ICO had raided Cambridge Analytica’s office and seized evidence, it had issued “information notices” to both Leave.EU and Banks, a regulatory action that asks for information to be provided, for which non-compliance is a criminal offence. The questions are being asked, it seems. However, Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, told a conference last week that it urgently needed stronger powers to conduct its investigations. “We need the regime to reflect that data crimes are real crimes,” she said. The questions are out there. Whether the ICO has the power to get the answers – or whether we’re going to continue to rely on clues obtained by a parliamentary committee and a 29-year-old Peugeot – remains to be seen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/20/wigan-warriors-castleford-super-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T23:18:00Z","webTitle":"Eddie Jones watches on as Wigan score five tries in victory over Castleford\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/20/wigan-warriors-castleford-super-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/20/wigan-warriors-castleford-super-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Eddie Jones watches on as Wigan score five tries in victory over Castleford\r\n","bodyText":"Perhaps the biggest positive here for Wigan was the manner in which they extended their fine start to the season against one of their likely rivals for the title come autumn. The last eight days have produced victories against Leeds and now Castleford but the differing manner in the way those wins have come about should provide the greatest optimism yet that the woes of 2017 are firmly behind the Warriors this season. While last week they scraped home against Leeds courtesy of Sam Tomkins’s drop goal, there could be no argument about the worthy winners here, as the Warriors took full advantage of a Castleford side below the standards Super League has come to expect from them in recent years. The latter half of last season was the nadir of Shaun Wane’s six-year reign as Wigan coach; but in the aftermath of that poor ending, which left the Warriors sixth and outside the play-off places for the first time in years, there was a defiant message from Wane that they would learn from those mistakes before this season. With nine wins now from their opening 11 league games, all the evidence suggests Wane’s prediction is a decent one. “We can get miles better, though,” was his defiant post-match message to the rest of the competition. “I think there’s loads of improvement left in us: I’m never truly happy with things.” For Castleford this defeat – only their third of 2018 – was a rare off-night for last season’s Grand Finalists who, by and large, have maintained the momentum that took them to a maiden appearance at Old Trafford last October, even if without the same level of attacking panache they displayed for large periods last year. “I don’t think we showed the best of ourselves tonight,” said their coach, Daryl Powell. Castleford’s scrum-half, Luke Gale, had kicked them into an early lead but after Tomkins had replied from the tee, tries by Oliver Gildart and Liam Farrell put the hosts into a commanding 14-2 lead. Farrell’s try in particular raised a wry smile from Wigan’s guest for the night, the England rugby coach, Eddie Jones. “I didn’t speak to him – I had a game to go and win,” Wane joked afterwards. Castleford responded to those early setbacks well, though, and, after Oliver Holmes reduced the deficit, a wonderful set move ended with a debut try for the wing, Garry Lo, to make it 14-12. The Papua New Guinean was one of Castleford’s biggest positives in a below-par performance – and Wigan quickly asserted their dominance after half-time when a scintillating break from Joe Burgess laid the platform for Gildart’s second try. When George Williams stretched out on the hour mark to open up a two-score lead, it was clear who the winner would be and Tony Clubb’s try four minutes from time merely rubbed it in on another successful night for Wigan. Wigan remain two points behind the leaders, St Helens, after they posted the highest score of the season so far to inflict more misery on Huddersfield. Justin Holbrook’s side ran in 12 tries – including a hat-trick for the sensational Ben Barba – in their 66-4 victory as they solidified their position at the summit and ensured the Giants remain second from bottom. The night’s other result saw Salford further strengthen their claims for a top-eight finish with a convincing victory over Wakefield, who the Red Devils moved above into seventh place. Jake Bibby scored twice as the hosts beat Trinity 38-4."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/20/jack-brooks-yorkshire-nottinghamshire-county-championship-cricket-round-up","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T20:06:47Z","webTitle":"Jack Brooks stars with bat and ball as Yorkshire make Nottinghamshire suffer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/20/jack-brooks-yorkshire-nottinghamshire-county-championship-cricket-round-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/20/jack-brooks-yorkshire-nottinghamshire-county-championship-cricket-round-up","fields":{"headline":"Jack Brooks stars with bat and ball as Yorkshire make Nottinghamshire suffer","bodyText":"Jack Brooks lit up a feverish evening session at Headingley as Yorkshire recovered from early strife against Nottinghamshire to edge proceedings on the opening day. After posting an unbeaten 30 from No 10, helping his team recover from 93 for five to 256, Brooks wreaked havoc with the new ball. Notts closed on 53 for four, with only the New Zealander Ross Taylor resisting in helpful bowling conditions. Brooks struck three times, including twice in his first two overs as Notts slipped to six for three. After seven successive washed out days here, this was worth the wait for the Yorkshire membership. Notts, who beat Lancashire last weekend, started in fine fashion following an uncontested toss. Yorkshire’s loss of five wickets contributed to 37 falling across nine games before lunch. Make no mistake, this was a bowling day. Seven of the nine games are already into their second innings and another into its third at Chester-le-Street, where Durham were bowled out for 91, Kent replied with 169 and the hosts are 13 for one second time round. At Headingley Luke Fletcher was the pick for Notts with four for 47, including India’s Che Pujara lbw for two. His new ball partner Jake Ball had Alex Lees caught at third slip and Gary Ballance caught at point for a duck inside the first hour. Both were soft dismissals, owing little to favourable bowling conditions. The wicketkeeper Andrew Hodd contributed significantly to Yorkshire’s recovery with a determined 62. He shared 44 for the sixth wicket with Jack Leaning and 36 for the eighth with Josh Shaw. Yorkshire’s chances of one batting point were slim, never mind two. But Brooks and Ben Coad (18) added 44 for the last wicket. Then they put the skids under the Notts reply, with Brooks forcing Steven Mullaney to chop on for a duck and Chris Nash to glove behind. Coad then trapped Jake Libby lbw at the start of the fourth over. That soon became 39 for four as Brooks trapped Samit Patel lbw. Eighteen wickets fell at Chelmsford, where it is anyone’s game between last season’s two top in Division One, Essex and Lancashire. Peter Siddle did his best to match Brooks with 33 from No 10 in Essex’s 150 before Jamie Porter and Simon Harmer claimed four wickets each in Lancashire’s 141 for eight.Porter and Harmer were Essex’s standout performers with the ball last year, so this was no surprise. However, there will be a few raised eyebrows at Lancashire’s early-season batting woes given their strength. At Taunton it was a day for Australian batsmen and English seamers. Matt Renshaw, the Yorkshire-born Australian Test player, drafted into Somerset’s squad after the curious incident in Cape Town, was announced as a replacement for Cameron Bancroft only a week ago. Batting at No 3 rather than at the top of the order, he hit a battling unbeaten century on a pitch somewhat greener than those he is accustomed to in Brisbane. Renshaw’s debut innings against Worcestershire’s persistent seamers enabled Somerset to reach 202. Ed Barnard, the mini-Woakes, finished with career best figures of five for 52. For a while Renshaw was matched by Travis Head, another Australian left-hander, who struck a belligerent a belligerent 49 after Lewis Gregory had snatched three early wickets. In front of more than 2000 sun-drenched onlookers Worcestershire ended the day 49 behind with two wickets remaining."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/20/matildas-left-to-rue-missed-chances-after-japan-win-asian-cup-final-with-late-goal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T19:41:39Z","webTitle":"Matildas left to rue missed chances after Japan win Asian Cup final with late goal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/20/matildas-left-to-rue-missed-chances-after-japan-win-asian-cup-final-with-late-goal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/20/matildas-left-to-rue-missed-chances-after-japan-win-asian-cup-final-with-late-goal","fields":{"headline":"Matildas left to rue missed chances after Japan win Asian Cup final with late goal","bodyText":"The Matildas were left ruing numerous missed chances after losing the Asian Cup final 1-0 to Japan. After dominating for the majority of the match, Australia were left shattered as Frankfurt forward Kumi Yokoyama raced clear on the break to score the winner in the 84th minute. Getting to the final had not been plain sailing for either side, who drew 1-1 in their final Group B game to progress on goal difference. While Japan dispatched China in their semi-final, Alen Stacic’s much-changed side needed a 91st-minute equaliser from Alanna Kennedy before beating minnows Thailand on penalties. If concerns about the Matildas’ erratic form throughout the tournament had dominated the build-up, then Australia quickly put those worries to bed in the showpiece game in Amman. Stacic’s star players were on the pitch from the off and their strength showed. Bursting out of the blocks, they were more recognisable as the buccaneering side of recent years. Defending champions Japan proved equal to the task though, and what resulted was an end-to-end battle from start to finish. After just 14 minutes, a high ball into the area was fumbled by Japanese goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita and Tameka Butt blasted the ball at defender Saki Kumagai’s arm. The referee pointed to the spot but Yamashita made amends, saving Elise Kellond-Knight’s penalty to keep the scores level. Both sides missed plenty of chances in the remainder of the first half. Forward Mana Iwabuchi was the linchpin of the Japanese attack but Emi Nakajima and Aya Sameshima were both caught offside when racing onto her pinpoint through balls. Portland Thorns’ Clare Polkinghorne was magnificent at the back for Australia, nullifying the direct threat of Iwabuchi. The second half got off to a cagey start, but after five minutes the Matildas started to stretch their legs and push at the Japanese defence. After 52 minutes Emily van Egmond caught Yamashita off her line but her stunning long-range strike struck the crossbar. Sam Kerr struggled to find space in the box as Nana Ichise and Kumagai kept her crowded out. With Japan defending deep, space was at a premium and Seattle Reign’s Steph Catley epitomised the effort of the Aussie side as a smart step-over and nutmeg saw her weave her way past three players. With the Matildas creating chance after chance, they ran the risk of being punished for their wastefulness up front. With 10 minutes left on the clock the game started to open up, Kellond-Knight going in the book as she stopped Yokoyama – a substitute who came on for Yuika Sagasawa and had three goals in the tournament already – from racing clear on the break. From another breakaway four minutes later, Australia were punished. With just six minutes of normal time to play Yokoyama sped away and then cut inside, leaving Polkinghorne and Kennedy in her wake, and fired a screamer past the outstretched Lydia Williams to put Japan ahead against the run of play. The Matildas piled forward in the closing minutes but were unable to find the reply to Yokoyama’s fourth goal of the competition – and a goal worthy of winning the tournament – as the holders retained their trophy with an incredible defensive display. Despite the defeat, Australia played their part in a thrilling game, and can take plenty of positives from a performance where they dominated possession. Onwards to the 2019 World Cup."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/21/stoke-burnley-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T07:59:08Z","webTitle":"Stoke City v Burnley: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/21/stoke-burnley-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/21/stoke-burnley-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Stoke City v Burnley: match preview","bodyText":"Stoke have left it very late to start a surge for safety, and if it does not begin against Burnley, it will probably not materialise at all.

But this peaceful, secluded corner of Österlen, the southeastern corner of the Swedish county of Skåne, will on Saturday be crawling with specialist security officers, diplomats and journalists as the UN security council meets for its annual retreat. With just six small windows built into the white, lime-washed walls of the farmhouse, it is hard to see how 15 council representatives and 10 UN officials will fit inside. Speaking in New York before his departure for Sweden, Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, appeared concerned at being forced into such close proximity with his counterparts from the United States, France and Britain. The week running up the meeting saw the two sides accusing each other of lying about the chemical attack in Syria. “I will see how they feel about dealing with me after all what happened,” Nebenzia said. Should diplomatic tensions rise, the only easy escape will be to a meditation circle 300 metres away built at the instigation of Dag Hammarskjöld, the legendary Swedish secretary general of the United Nations, who was killed when his plane crashed in unexplained circumstances in Zambia in 1961. Hammarskjöld, who bought this farmhouse four years before he died, is the reason that Sweden has chosen to drag the world’s top diplomats so deep into the countryside as part of its two-year term on the council. After a recent refurbishment, the house was reopened this May for what Karin Erlandsson, its manager, describes as “highly exclusive conferences for companies and organisations who share Dag’s spirit”. Sweden’s foreign minister, Margot Wallström, said at a press conference on Friday that she hoped the presence of Hammarskjöld’s books, furniture and writings at the house would inspire today’s council members. “He was an extremely brave person with great relevance to the security council,” she said. The council has been paralysed by acrimonious rifts in the six meetings it has held since the chemical weapons attack on the rebel Damascus suburb of Douma on 7 April. “I don’t think anyone should have any exaggerated expectations that this whole issue will be solved here,” Wallström said. “It takes time. What we hope is that we will create an opportunity for them to have time to hang out here and to do it in the informal way that such an environment allows.” The council is also expected to discuss the refugee question and the future of its peacekeeping efforts. The British ambassador, Karen Pierce, has said she hopes the retreat would at least begin a political process that could eventually lead to peace in Syria. “That’s the most important thing,” she said. “I do hope that the retreat will be able to make progress on that.” Jill and Jan, two locals out for their morning walk, said that a taste of the Österlen countryside might indeed help Nebenzia and his US counterpart Nikki Haley thrash out their differences. “Maybe they will have more nice earthy thoughts here,” Jill says. “If you are here, you can let your thoughts wander. You can see the horizon.” The only time they could remember the village hosting anything similar was when Sweden’s King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia visited the farm in 2005 to celebrate the centenary of Hammarskjöld’s birth. Then, they say, it poured with rain and, as the party made their way across the field to pay their respect at the meditation circle, Queen Sylvia’s dress became near transparent while another attendee stepped in a cow pat, which went straight through her sandals.

Some critics made the point that most citizens are immigrants or their descendants, while others noted that most Americans believed that immigration should remain stable or increase. Yet the problem with the change in language lies deeper. According to our own legal tradition, Americans claim sovereignty over the territory of the US as immigrants, precisely because the territories in question were someone else’s homeland: the Native Americans’. Since our country exists, we don’t ask ourselves how or why. The legal foundation of the federal claim to dominion over territory is something called the Doctrine of Discovery, a notion that goes back five centuries. As European explorers sought new maritime passages and found new lands, popes granted European powers the authority to “invade, search out, capture, vanquish and subdue” the people they found. Portugal, Spain, France and England claimed territory by planting a flag, a symbolic action known as “discovery”. It made no difference whether the land in question was inhabited or not, since only Christians had conferred upon themselves the right to “discover” in this sense. By the logic of the papal bulls, and that of later charters to English explorers made by the English king or queen, indigenous peoples had no rights to land or to legal recognition of any kind. Only immigrants did. The young American republic preserved this European doctrine. The US supreme court formalized the Doctrine of Discovery in three famous cases of 1823, 1831 and 1832. Chief Justice John Marshall took for granted the obvious fact that America was the homeland of the Native Americans, “the rightful occupants of the soil”. By the logic of “discovery”, Native Americans had no rights because America was their homeland: “Their power to dispose of the soil at their own will to whomsoever they pleased was denied by the original fundamental principle that discovery gave exclusive title to those who made it.” In American law, to have a homeland established no sovereignty over territory; only immigration created such authority. According to Marshall, English charters and claims had established an “absolute and complete” title to the land of North America, which then “passed to the United States” in 1776. The judicial magic of creating sovereignty and property is performed on behalf of immigrants and only on behalf of immigrants. From the perspective of modern human rights, or even of simple logic, there is much to criticize in the Doctrine of Discovery and in these rulings. In light of the first amendment of the constitution, separating church and state, papal bulls seem untenable as a source of American jurisprudence. When Marshall writes that “conquest gives a title that the courts of the conqueror cannot deny”, it is easy to wonder whether anything more is being claimed in his rulings than that might makes right. Native American scholars have made all of these points, and aboriginal activists here and around the world have asked the pope to repeal the original bulls. However flawed it may be, the Doctrine of Discovery is the law of the land, affirmed regularly by our highest court. In the 21st century, in New York v Oneida Indian Nation of New York, the supreme court cited Marshall’s rulings and relied upon the Doctrine of Discovery as the basis of the federal government’s dominion over land once controlled by Native Americans – which is to say, the entirety of the United States of America. The American claim to American land is that Native Americans had a homeland but no dominion over it, since sovereignty automatically shifted to immigrants. If the federal government no longer defines the America as a “nation of immigrants”, it abandons, by its own logic, the claim to sovereignty over the land. If US policy is now, instead, to protect a “homeland”, that would mean restoring the rights of the Native Americans to the entirety of the US. To be sure, a mission statement does not itself make law. But it expresses an attitude that is quite common in the Trump administration and indeed in both houses of Congress, one that denies the premise of the Doctrine of Discovery, disables the rulings of the supreme court, and reopens the question of the sovereignty of the US over territory. Marshall admitted that territorial control by immigration, the “pretension of converting the discovery of an inhabited territory into conquest” might appear “extravagant”. Yet the Doctrine of Discovery prevails, he asserts, so long as the “principle has been asserted in the first instance, and afterwards sustained”. If the federal government claims that the US is a nation of natives rather than immigrants, that test is no longer met. If the federal government no longer asserts the principle on which its own sovereignty is based, no longer sustains the Doctrine of Discovery. Following Marshall’s reasoning, Native Americans would then have, in his words, a “legal and just claim to retain possession” of what is now the United States of America. We have a responsibility to know and face our history, the indefensible as well as the praiseworthy. To deny our past as immigrants is to deny ourselves the chance of understanding who we are, for better and for worse. It is also, following the very logic and law of America, to abandon our claim to the dominion over territory, and to restore the land to those who first called it home.

The fact that the central character in this story is my own newsagent, does not indicate special pleading because, after looking deeper into the issue, it is clear – as will emerge – the crisis is a national one. I have been loyal to my newsagent in Brighton for the best part of 40 years. The shop changed hands several times before it was acquired in 2007 by a man who soon proved to be far more efficient than any previous owner. Guy Wright imposed order on the enterprise, oversaw a well-organised delivery system and introduced computerised billing. Most important of all, he was helpful and amiable, always stressing that business is about people. By 2009, he was doing so well that I reported on his opening of a second shop, at Brighton Marina. That certainly bucked the national trend because newsagents were closing down across Britain in the face of competition from supermarkets and petrol stations. Although his spin-off venture didn’t last long, his central concern, a corner shop in Brighton’s Kemptown known as The Kiosk, thrived. At the time, despite the gradual decline of newsprint, his team of adult delivery men – because, he says, “they are more dependable than schoolchildren” – were serving 250 people a day. Gradually, that number has dwindled to 150. Even so, that’s a substantial total in these online times and his business remains profitable. But Wright has reluctantly decided to close down after suffering what he regards as “months of hell” due to the service he has received from the region’s newspaper wholesaler, Smiths News, part of the Connect Group, which boasts: “We win trust by giving outstanding service.” Along with other customers, I have been upset by the number of times our newspapers have arrived late. Wright patiently explained to complainants, including me, that it was due to the late delivery of the papers to his shop by the wholesaler. Further investigation revealed the astonishing reasons for that lateness. The wholesaling system, the key link between newspaper publishers, retailers and, ultimately, customers, has all but collapsed in the Brighton region. Wright believes that customers who pay for papers to be delivered should have them by 7.30am. That was easy enough to achieve when the bundles arrived at his shop at 6am, as was the case for 10 years. But the wholesale delivery time has become a moving target over the past few months. It is rare for the papers to reach him in time to give customers an adequate service. There have been occasions when they have arrived beyond 8am. On one infamous Saturday, the day when papers achieve their highest sales, the delivery was at midday. Getting in touch with the Smiths News depot, in Lancing, West Sussex – about 10 miles from Brighton – proved difficult and expensive. “I was often held in a queue on a premium-rate line,” says Wright. “Many times, after 20 minutes, it simply dropped the line.” There is an app, but this doesn’t enable him to deal with problems in real time. So Wright took matters into his own hands. On days when he was able, instead of awaiting the late arrival of his papers, he drove to the depot to collect them himself, as did a neighbouring newsagent, Kanak Patel of Shiv News. Yet Smiths News still insisted that they pay the carriage charge. It enabled Wright to talk at length to the depot manager who was sympathetic. There was little she could do, she told him. It was down to the drivers, who are self-employed freelancers. Some hold contracts and employ drivers, while some subcontract the work. Wright found that several drivers assigned to his route were new immigrants with poor English and no knowledge of the area. Wright and Patel cannot go elsewhere for a better service, however, because Smiths News holds the wholesale monopoly in the area, as it does in many regions across Britain. I thought this might be an untypical incidence, a one-off. So I contacted the body that represents newsagents across Britain, the National Federation of Retail Newsagents (NFRN) and told Wright’s story to its communications manager, Anne Bingham. She wasn’t surprised. “It’s happening up and down the country,” she says. “We have scores of examples.” It is one of the main reasons the NFRN called on 11 April for the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to examine the news supply chain. The NFRN’s president, Linda Sood, submitted what she referred to as “an explosive 32-page document”, which argues that hundreds of independent newsagents have been forced to close because of the monopolistic nature of newspaper distribution. It states that because news wholesalers enjoy “absolute territorial protection”, they have little incentive to provide an adequate service to retailers who cannot switch suppliers. It refers to the deteriorating service – as evidenced by Wright – and points to spiralling carriage charges and reduced margins. These problems led to a protest in September last year by a group of 30 retailers outside Smiths News’s headquarters in Swindon. As Sood says: “Independent news retailers feel under siege from all corners of the supply chain.” Of course, there are two other big factors. Corner shops have been dying for years and it is undeniable that newspaper sales have been falling with increasing rapidity throughout the past 20 years. Even so, should we be happy about hastening the demise of both? Smiths News concedes that Wright has suffered from “a serious issue”, which the company says it is investigating. “Mr Wright has a fair point and, based on our findings, we’ll be looking at this in as broad a way as possible,” says Freda Cronk, head of brand and marketing. She contests some of his claims, arguing that – according to company records – he has picked up bundles of papers from the depot on only three occasions. A fourth occurred last Friday. But she adds: “We do not expect, or want, customers picking up their supplies.” Cronk defended the use of self-employed contract drivers as “the most efficient and flexible model for delivering newspapers” and says their performance was “actively managed”, adding: “We will terminate contracts if they do not meet the expected standards.” Whatever the investigation discovers, it will probably be too late to change Wright’s mind about closing his business. And he will take his place in a lengthening line of discouraged former newsagents. As for editors and journalists who put so much effort into producing newspapers, they will surely read this story and weep. They might do better, however, to ask why their publishers are so relaxed about monopolistic practices in the wholesale trade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/22/koji-tsuruoka-japan-ambassador-britain-brexit-single-market","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T08:05:38Z","webTitle":"Japan ambassador’s Brexit warning: there won’t be a deal better than the single market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/22/koji-tsuruoka-japan-ambassador-britain-brexit-single-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/22/koji-tsuruoka-japan-ambassador-britain-brexit-single-market","fields":{"headline":"Japan ambassador’s Brexit warning: there won’t be a deal better than the single market","bodyText":"Koji Tsuruoka is sipping green tea in Japan’s splendid embassy in Mayfair, recalling how his first two years as Japan’s ambassador to the UK have not gone quite according to plan. At least, they haven’t turned out how his predecessors assured him they would. One after another, ex-ambassadors advised him, before he took up the position on 6 June 2016, that he would find the UK very “stable”, and its politics “very predictable”. The attractions of London’s ballet scene, opera and art galleries quickly lured him into thinking it would be “an excellent place to conclude my 40-plus years of diplomatic service in a very comfortable and quiet environment”. British politicians and civil servants he met early on were almost all sure the EU referendum would pass peacefully by. “Almost 99% said that you don’t have to worry because the British people don’t make adventurous decisions. They said it was irrational to leave because of the economic conditions… And you know what happened.” A year later, after the Brexit bombshell caused global diplomatic and economic panic that reached Tokyo, Theresa May called a surprise general election that threw everything up in the air again. Thinking back to that period of turbulence, Tsuruoka stops for a few seconds and glances out of the window in the direction of Buckingham Palace. “Now I have to keep in mind that you don’t predict what is going to happen in the UK.” That said, he does quickly predict, in his diplomatic and soft-spoken way, that Brexit will bring considerable economic uncertainty to this country, in the short term at least. He spells out how decades of ever-increasing Japanese investment into the UK have already come to a halt for the time being. He is well qualified to judge how Brexit will pan out. Before coming to London, Tsuruoka spent three intense years negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that aims to reduce barriers between the US, Japan and 10 other Pacific nations. He knows as much as anyone about how international trade flows work, and about what is possible and what is not. “We have 1,000 companies operating in the UK today funded by Japanese capital,” he says. “It accelerated after Margaret Thatcher promoted the UK as the ‘gateway to Europe’ for Japanese firms. The total Japanese investment to the EU’s 28 countries is of course huge, but out of 28 countries the UK alone now absorbs about 40% of total Japanese investment destined for the EU.” This account of a relationship that strengthened year after year – in a period during which the UK was in the EU – raises a very obvious question. Will it continue to thrive after we have left? He replies decisively. “One thing I can say for certain, based on fact, is that the companies operating today in the UK are not expanding their investment in the UK today.” Huge Japanese firms with big plants in the UK – such as Nissan and Toyota, who sell most of their British-made cars into the EU – are, he says, treading water, biding their time before deciding whether to relocate part or all of their businesses, so they can continue to be based inside the single market after March 2019. He tries not to sound alarming, but is clear about the threat to UK jobs. “They are currently considering and thinking and watching very closely what they need to do. That is why they are not investing additionally today. “If you are proposing in your board meeting in a company that you need to invest more and build more cars in the UK today today there will be questions, and those are questions that are very difficult to answer today with certainty and therefore decisions are put off.” For Japanese enterprises which came to the UK to sell into EU markets, tariff-free trade is the guiding star that decides where they locate. “The reason that many of those companies have come is that this is the best gateway to Europe,” he says. “If that is in danger, if that is no longer sustainable, of course they will have to look at what they will have to do best. The existing arrangement for the single market is a total frictionless trade.” He believes membership of the single market is as good as it gets for Japanese firms wanting to sell into the EU from European bases. “The EU is a very exceptional single market. I don’t think the single market could be substituted by something and be better or even be the same.” It is not a uniform picture across the whole economy. There are sectors, such as software design, where the UK is still attractive, as it has the R&amp;D expertise and skills. He cites the example of how Japan’s SoftBank agreed, after the referendum, to buy the British software design firm Arm Holdings for £24.3bn in the hope that it would become a global leader. “That is one representation of what will go on and that was based on the assessment that the R&amp;D, the hi-tech capability, the potential for the UK succeeding further in this area, was quite concrete… those technologies are not necessarily linked to the EU.” Factory-based businesses, however – those producing goods for European markets rather than merely designing them – are a very “different issue”. They face real uncertainties if and when the terms of trade change. So too do Japanese financial institutions in the City, Japanese banks and other organisations offering financial services. The fact they will no longer have passporting rights to operate into EU markets will have significant effects on employment here. “It is an issue – because having passporting rights to reach the single market and be part of the single market is a very efficient and cost-saving way of conducting financial services which is a regulated industry.” Will Japanese banks up sticks and go? No, he says, not lock, stock and barrel, because Europe is just part of their market. But jobs will head out of the City into the EU and Japanese companies will have to reduce their operations in London. “They are not leaving London, because London is a global financial centre, not just a centre for the EU – but they will have to relocate some of their EU business to the EU in order to continue serving the EU consumers.” He is at pains not to talk down the UK’s post-Brexit prospects. Just as no one thought Brexit would happen when he arrived, no one can know for definite that it will turn out badly, as it approaches. “If you take a longer term, five, 10, 20 years… things become more unpredictable,” he says. But he is clear that in the shorter term it will not be good for the UK economy nor the strength of its economic partnership with Japan. He says Japan has not yet begun talks with the UK on a post-Brexit trade deal and that it would take several years to complete, if one is struck at all. It is another area of real uncertainty in the entirely unpredictable post-Brexit world that he never expected to encounter on arriving in London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/20/jurgen-klopp-backs-liverpool-catch-stronger-manchester-city","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T21:30:35Z","webTitle":"Jürgen Klopp backs Liverpool to close gap on ‘even stronger’ Manchester City","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/20/jurgen-klopp-backs-liverpool-catch-stronger-manchester-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/20/jurgen-klopp-backs-liverpool-catch-stronger-manchester-city","fields":{"headline":"Jürgen Klopp backs Liverpool to close gap on ‘even stronger’ Manchester City","bodyText":"Jürgen Klopp has said Liverpool do not fear the challenge of trying to wrest the Premier League title from a Manchester City team he expects will be even stronger next season. Liverpool have beaten the newly crowned champions three times this year, sealing a place in the Champions League semi-finals against Roma as a result, yet trail City by 17 points in the Premier League having played a game more. Klopp believes it will be possible to close that gap next season despite expecting City to improve. “Unfortunately, the job City have done in the last few years is outstanding,” the Liverpool manager said. “They brought together a team in a fantastic age. There is still a lot to come from them. They will not stop refreshing the squad, that’s clear, but whatever they do it will stay possible to beat them – that’s how it is. “The gap between us and City didn’t happen in the games against them, it happened in the other games. It’s not important how good City will be, it’s about how we can get all the other points plus the points we got so far again. That is why it is always possible to be closer. But are they able to dominate? They don’t have a limit to spending, so I don’t know. “Maybe it depends on all of us. Our age group is good as well, the best years are coming. That’s why we try to build on it.” Klopp has vowed to field a strong team at West Bromwich on Saturday despite hosting Roma in the first leg on Tuesday, insisting qualification for next season’s Champions League remains a priority. And he believes competition at the top of the Premier League will intensify next year with Liverpool aiming “a little bit higher”. “I don’t fear the challenge,” he said. “This year, if City plays a normal season, which they didn’t do, then it would be really close until the end because we are now all close together. “United is four points ahead, Tottenham is two points behind. It’s a real fight for all positions. All the big six pretty much delivered this year but City delivered best. It’s difficult to deal with success just as it is difficult to deal with other things in football but I’m sure they will be strong again. It doesn’t make life easier but it’s not impossible for us to step a little bit higher.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/20/football-manchester-city-pep-guardiola-new-contract","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T16:39:33Z","webTitle":"Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City future hinges on his energy reserves","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/20/football-manchester-city-pep-guardiola-new-contract","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/20/football-manchester-city-pep-guardiola-new-contract","fields":{"headline":"Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City future hinges on his energy reserves","bodyText":"Pep Guardiola has said how long he stays at Manchester City will depend on his energy reserves and his players’ hunger. He believes the closing five matches of this season will offer an indication as to whether the Premier League title can be retained next term. City host Swansea on Sunday with the manager demanding a continuation of their excellent season-long form. He has a year left on his contract and will sit down with the board in the summer to discuss a new deal. His longest previous tenure was four years at Barcelona, from 2008-12. The 46-year-old, who is in his second season at City, would not commit on Friday to staying for longer than that. “Now the people say we are champions, everyone’s happy,” he said. “You feel the team are an amazing group of guys, the players and the staff, but you can lose that. You can drop it. I don’t know how we are going to react, even myself, after winning the Premier League. “I don’t know how the players will see me after winning or how I will see them. Now it’s OK. Everything’s good. But football changes over nothing. In these next five games we will see how we react to success. It will be a good test for all of us to see what will happen next season. “We’ll speak to the club at the end of the season about a new contract. I have one more year, I am going to be here. We have to see what they think of the future. “It also depends on my energy. Now I feel good. We’ll speak with Ferran [Soriano, chief executive] Txiki [Begiristain, sporting director], Khaldoon [al-Mubarak, the chairman].” After Swansea, City end the season by facing West Ham, Huddersfield, Brighton and Southampton and Guardiola believes that to improve next season his team will have to mature. “Still we are young,” he said and he cited Tottenham being allowed to score shortly before half-time of City’s 3-1 victory at Wembley last Saturday as an example of their shortcomings. Only Manchester United and Chelsea have retained the title in the Premier League era, the former having twice won it three seasons in a row. “You’ve seen how difficult it is,” he said. “No club has done it four times; here it’s so complicated to do. There are a lot of contenders – it’s a good challenge.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/22/homeopathy-quackery-plain-and-simple-whatever-royal-family-says","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T04:59:12Z","webTitle":"Homeopathy is quackery plain and simple, whatever the royal family says | Catherine Bennett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/22/homeopathy-quackery-plain-and-simple-whatever-royal-family-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/22/homeopathy-quackery-plain-and-simple-whatever-royal-family-says","fields":{"headline":"Homeopathy is quackery plain and simple, whatever the royal family says","bodyText":"Anyone who doubts the power of homeopathy may want, its practitioners point out, to account for an extraordinary longitudinal study involving multiple generations of one exceptionally long-lived British family of homeopathy enthusiasts. Even allowing for other life-extending factors, such as footmen, normalised indolence and a morning pint or so of gin and Dubonnet, the propensity of so many Windsor-Mountbattens to survive into their 90s and, in the late Queen Mother’s case, much longer, is so striking that homeopaths are understandably eager to accept responsibility. They “live long and healthy lives,” says a member of the School of Homeopathy, presumably attributing to chance the marginally less inspirational example of noted homeopathy enthusiast, George VI (1895–1952). With every comment on their prodigious health, the Queen, aged 91, and her husband, 96, become a yet more valuable promotional asset to advocates of Hahnemann’s potentisation. The same, admittedly, applies to passionate advocates of never running your own bath. Either way, the royal family’s importance in promulgating homeopathy, by way of physical evidence, as well as through their official patronage, perhaps justifies what might otherwise appear intrusive inspection of their respective physical states. What, for instance, did Prince Charles mean by his recent pleasantry, addressed to fellow almost-70-year-olds, to the effect that “bits of me keep falling off at regular intervals”? Which bits? It was encouragement enough for royal correspondents to list various health problems, from a bad back to finger difficulties, which might be 20 times worse if the prince were not a lifelong homeopathy patient. Or 20 times better. Or, given homeopathy remedies have no active ingredients, exactly the same. As with so many homeopathy trials, there is no control prince. Still, so long as he remains more or less functioning, homeopaths can reasonably hope, now that it has been announced that Charles will succeed his mother as head of the Commonwealth, that he will be as determined to promote quackery among the other 52 nations as he has been within the UK. If NHS doctors are still – as it was confirmed last week – offering treatment described by the chief medical officer as “rubbish”, by the head of the NHS as “at best a placebo and a misuse of scarce NHS funds”; and by NHS Choices as not “consistent with long-accepted principles on the way the physical world works”, then the credit for this achievement should surely go, almost if not quite entirely, to the Prince of Wales. It would be wrong, after all, to overlook the contribution of some prominent MPs to preserving the memory of water theory from the constant threat from evidence-based medicine. Jeremy Hunt finds a homeopathy-friendly ally in, for instance, Jeremy Corbyn. Although where some compounds are concerned, a noted stickler for evidence, the leader of the opposition is minded to exempt homeopathy – for which royal partiality remains, perhaps uniquely in the NHS, a critical evidence base. As well as supporting early day motions in favour of homeopathy, Corbyn tweeted, in 2010: “I believe that homeo-meds works for some ppl and that it compliments ‘convential’ [sic] meds. they both come from organic matter…” That would be “come from”, in the sense of diluted-to-the-point-of-not-being-there-any-more, with the original “organic matter” being selected according to the magical principle of “like cures like”. As for “works for some ppl”, this has recently been demonstrated by a Canadian practitioner, Dr Anke Zimmermann, who described how she cured “Jonah”, a four-year-old exhibiting aggression, with a remedy derived (like curing like) from the saliva of a rabid dog. “Within a minute or two of giving him the remedy,” she reported, “Jonah smiled at me very broadly and beautifully, as if all the lights had just gone on.” Following widespread criticism, an indignant Dr Zimmermann now emphasises that homeopathic remedies are “harmless sugar pills medicated with sth [something] like an energetic information of the substance”. Possibly because of stories involving rabid dog saliva, along with a growing reluctance to spend public money on this energetic information of the substance, the use of homeopathy has been declining within the NHS, to the point that in 2017 it finally proposed a ban on prescriptions. It will certainly require more than damning surveys, to judge by a new study, to deter a still active body of NHS-based Hahnemann enthusiasts from prescribing remedies from the same pharmacopeia as the rabies cure. The study, published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, may make, within the homeopathic community, for bittersweet reading. Researchers, led by Ben Goldacre, senior clinical research fellow at the University of Oxford, found that determined GPs, in over 600 surgeries, were still, regardless of the official “rubbish” verdict, prescribing homeopathic remedies in 2016-2017. However, the relevant surgeries were also shown to be less competent, on all the accepted prescribing measures. A willingness to defy the principles of evidence-based medicine like this is shown to accompany other examples of poor prescribing. If it’s over-harsh to summarise the homeopathy prescribers, as one report did, as “bad doctors”, it’s reasonable to ask how these professionals reconcile the existence of Nice’s guidance on evidence-based decisions with the prescription of, say, potentised bee venom, presumably out of personal conviction. Is it so much better, really, than branding your initials on a transplanted liver, because, as that surgeon said of his (mercifully harmless) misconduct:“I do this”? He was fined and sentenced to 120 hours of community service.

It is an unlikely setting for the story of an extraordinary Jewish renaissance in the weeks following the 1945 liberation of Dachau, which is being commemorated this week. It is a bright but chilly Saturday afternoon and the large baroque complex is packed with visitors enjoying a drink in the beer garden after a hike in the countryside. As he tucks into a large plate of wiener schnitzel and downs a lager, Father Cyrill, who is presiding over memorial events that will take place in the monastery, expresses his sadness that most of the people who come to St Ottilien have no idea of what took place here. Father Cyrill’s day job is running the monastery’s Benedictine publishing house, but in his spare time he is busy collating information about a key, but forgotten, moment in both the monastery’s and Jewish history. He hopes that remembering how Holocaust survivors found shelter in the monastery after Dachau’s liberation will help Germans care about the thousands of refugees who have arrived in their country in recent years. In late April 1945, as the American army advanced deep into Germany, 3,500 mostly Jewish prisoners were moved from Kaufering, a sub-camp of Dachau. They were loaded on to a train heading for the South Tyrol on the Italian/Austrian border, where they were to build the defences for the Nazis’ last stand. In the village of Schwabhausen, not far from St Ottilien, the train was strafed by US fighter planes. Ammunition in the sidings blew up, and in the confusion the SS who were guarding the prisoners fled. Among the 800 people left alive on the train was Zalman Grinberg, a 33-year-old physician from Kovno in Lithuania. He knew the prisoners had little chance of survival if they stayed in the open, so quickly gathered them together and, with the help of an American colonel, led them to safety in the monastery. Father Cyrill explains: “The monastery had been closed by the Nazis and the monks sent to the eastern front, or set to work as slave labourers on the monastery farm and in the military hospital that was set up here.” Grinberg, posing as a Red Cross official, commandeered part of the monastery and it became the only Jewish hospital in Bavaria. Father Cyrill and I walk into the heart of the 19th-century complex and stand in the shadow of the abbey with its grey steeple. The setting is idyllic. Orchards lead down the hill to the pastures. “The young doctor was not just setting out to heal his patients’ bodies but their minds as well,” says Father Cyrill. “He wanted to instil in them a desire to move forward and rebuild their lives.” One of the things Grinberg did was hold a concert on the monastery lawn, where they “played music that the Nazis had banned”. On 27 May 1945, 19-year-old US private Bob Hilliard, from Brooklyn, attended the concert thinking it would make a light-hearted feature for the army newspaper he edited. “Rows of wooden chairs were set in front of the stage. In the aisles, and on the chairs and on the grass, standing, sitting, walking, leaning, lying, were hundreds of stick figures, emaciated, pale, skeletal, expressionless, all dressed in the black-and-white striped uniforms of the concentration camps,” he reported. The audience barely moved, and “when they did it was in the flickering slow motion of early silent films”. When the concert ended no one applauded. It was “a liberation concert at which most of the liberated people were too weak to stand. A liberation concert at which most of the people could not believe that they were free.” That was all about to change. Grinberg stepped on to the stage and delivered a speech in which he described the odyssey he had taken. It was a chronicle of tragedy that linked all the survivors together; each had taken a different “road of torture” that formed “one common red thread of blood, torture, torment, humiliation – and violent death”. His speech moulded them into a community, giving the survivors back their self-confidence, and began a Jewish renaissance fuelled by a burning desire to build a new life in Palestine. “He gave the people a will to live. It was important and should not be forgotten,” says Father Cyrill. The orchestra became a symbol of this renaissance and soon became known as the Ex-Concentration Camp Orchestra. It went on to play across Germany. “I met the family of a survivor, Dr Chiam Ipp, who came to visit the monastery and I was deeply moved by their story, so I decided to set up an information centre,” says Father Cyrill. The centre opens this summer and he hopes the lessons of the past will help Germany face the future. The country now has a large immigrant and refugee population. “People think the war ended and everything was over but it was not the case,” says Father Cyrill. “It is the will to build a new life that we see here, and it is our obligation and our mission to commemorate what happened as a lesson for the present. This is not just a story of cruelty but one of hope.” To this end, the energetic 50-year-old, along with many local volunteers, has organised a series of commemorative events that will begin with a concert next month. The “liberation concert” of 1945 was followed by the formation of the Central Committee of the Liberated Jews in Bavaria, which was the first meeting of its kind since the Holocaust. At the meeting survivors discussed their future and the way forward. Father Cyrill explains there was no talk of revenge: “Grinberg thought only of rebuilding lives.” The thoughtful Benedictine is fearful that the story of what happened here will be forgotten. The monastery buried the last of the fathers who remembered the postwar years last year. “The new information centre is important for Germany. When I was young growing up in Freiburg, my father believed that an international Jewish conspiracy existed. Keeping memories alive is important educationally.” What really fires up Father Cyrill is that the monastery was home to a maternity hospital in which 427 babies were born. He points to a small cream-coloured building with a pointed roof. “It was a symbol of hope for the Jewish people and some of the children who were born here visit us.” Grinberg gave the survivors a sense of pride and self-worth, and Father Cyrill would like to see that this is a key part in the way they are remembered. “They must be remembered with dignity and respect,” he says. We walk through the gardens to the cemetery, although in St Ottilien there are two, one Catholic and one Jewish. The latter has small metal gates adorned with the Star of David. I explain that it is the Jewish tradition to put a pebble on a gravestone that is visited. As Father Cyrill helps me find one, he explains there are fewer graves than there once were as some families have moved their relatives’ remains. He poses for a picture beside a new noticeboard that explains why the monastery has a neatly tended Jewish graveyard. “It is a start, but I have a long way to go.” He is working with the Jewish community in Munich and believes “this is not something that the Church must do alone. We must do it together, Catholics and Jews”. As we walk back up the hill, through farm buildings decorated with Banksy-style murals, the conversation moves on to another reason why the history of St Ottilien’s Jews is important. Conditions in the hospital in the summer of 1945 were dire; there were no blankets, no medicine, no food and little help from outside. Bob Hilliard was so appalled by the conditions that he began a letter-writing campaign in the US that would change American policy on caring for refugees. “It was an important step in changing how we see refugees,” Father Cyrill says. On the day I visit, there are 15 African refugees being cared for in the monastery.

Brooks claimed a two-year long investigation by the National Crime Agency into claims corruption blighted the hunt for Lawrence’s attackers “turned a blind eye” to Clifford Norris. The Guardian reported new claims on Thursday from Norris’s family members, alleging the career criminal used a network of corrupt Metropolitan police officers to protect himself and his close relations from justice. Lawrence was murdered on April 22, 1993, in Eltham, south-east London by a racist gang of at least five white youths. One of them – David Norris, son of Clifford – escaped justice for 19 years. He was convicted of the murder in 2012 alongside Gary Dobson but three of the gang have escaped conviction for their role in the attack. Brooks, speaking ahead of the 25th anniversary on Sunday, said: “The NCA, who have been tasked with uncovering the corruption Norris was engaged with, have deliberately turned a blind eye to Norris’s activities. “Norris is central because he had the power, links to influence the investigation.” Connections between Norris and the police are also suspected by a former senior investigator in HM Customs and Excise who feared corruption was blocking the agency’s efforts to look into his drug-smuggling operations. Former Met officers have also revealed longstanding concerns about Norris’s reach into the force, with one claiming it went back as far as 1978. In the latest claims, Victoria and Naomi Smith, who are related to the Norris family by marriage, alleged that Clifford Norris used corrupt officers to thwart a murder inquiry involving his brother four years before Lawrence was stabbed to death. Brooks, now 43, was with Stephen on the night he was killed. He said: “How is that simple journalists have the ability to investigate corruption better than so called trained investigators at the NCA and Met before it? “Everything about corruption has come out from the media, not the police or NCA.” Reports in the Guardian and Independent in 2012 about corruption led to then home secretary Theresa May to order a senior barrister to review the claims. It found there was reason to suspect one officer in the Met’s first botched Lawrence investigation, John Davidson, had acted corruptly. That finding followed claims made by a former detective Neil Putnam, reported by the Guardian in 2002 and BBC in 2006. The NCA inquiry is being overseen by the police watchdog, the Independent Office of Police Conduct. Asked about Brooks’s new criticism, it said: “Our investigation is comprehensive in its reach, however it’s not over and there are lines of enquiry that remain for us to pursue. “We are determined to leave no stone unturned and we remain keen to speak to anyone who feels they might have information to aid our efforts.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/20/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-struggle-catch-manchester-city-next-season","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T21:29:34Z","webTitle":"José Mourinho says Manchester United may struggle to close gap on City","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/20/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-struggle-catch-manchester-city-next-season","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/20/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-struggle-catch-manchester-city-next-season","fields":{"headline":"José Mourinho says Manchester United may struggle to close gap on City","bodyText":"José Mourinho has admitted that Manchester United will struggle to catch Manchester City if the new Premier League champions maintain their high standards next season. United’s manager struck a pessimistic tone when asked whether greater consistency would allow his team to challenge City’s supremacy, pointing out that Pep Guardiola’s side have set a remarkable pace at the top of the table. “It depends on what your opponents do,” Mourinho said. “I was champion in Spain with 100 points and Barcelona had 91 points. Ninety-one points was a failure for Barcelona? I don’t think it was but the other guys did 100 points. “So in this season many clubs had positive seasons, like us, like Tottenham, like Liverpool. But it was impossible because City were really good and consistent and will reach a number of points that makes it impossible for you. If they do the same number of points [next season] it will be almost impossible. If they get into 90-something points, it is almost impossible.” City have 87 points from 33 games and need nine more to break the record set by Mourinho’s Chelsea team in 2005. “I was champions with Chelsea with 95 points,” Mourinho said. “We gave no chance to the opponents, which is what Manchester City did. We had periods of winning matches and waiting for them to lose a couple of points. They never did it. “Even when they were almost losing points they managed to win against Bournemouth in minute 145 and some other matches where they won in 90-something. They were really strong. That is why there is no question about who deserves to be champions.” United prepared for Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham by beating Bournemouth on Wednesday, with Paul Pogba recovering well from his disappointing display in last Sunday’s defeat by West Brom. “I told him after the Manchester City game that I am not expecting him to be the man of the match in every match,” Mourinho said. “I am not expecting him to be phenomenal in every match, because that is really difficult, but to keep a certain level is the challenge. “He was phenomenal against City. I think he was not good against West Brom. And I think he was phenomenal again against Bournemouth. Against City you have the two goals where people can say: ‘Wow, super decisive.’ But I think he played even better against Bournemouth. Since minute one he was more consistent, more in control of the game.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/22/could-donald-trumps-lone-ranger-approach-provide-the-silver-bullet","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T10:30:20Z","webTitle":"Could Donald Trump's lone ranger approach provide the silver bullet? | Larry Elliott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/22/could-donald-trumps-lone-ranger-approach-provide-the-silver-bullet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/22/could-donald-trumps-lone-ranger-approach-provide-the-silver-bullet","fields":{"headline":"Could Donald Trump's lone ranger approach provide the silver bullet?","bodyText":"Donald Trump is playing with fire. That thought permeated last week’s spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington. The US president’s go-it-alone approach – especially in the field of trade – has certainly shaken things up. It is not just the threat of tariffs, nor that the US has brought the dispute settlement system at the World Trade Organisation to a standstill. Rather, it is a concern that Trump is rejecting the multilateral system that has been in operation for more than 70 years and risks sending the world spinning back to the 1930s. This is not entirely accurate. After some hard bargaining the US has agreed to fund an increase in the World Bank’s capital that will allow it to lend more. But everyone knew what Christine Lagarde, the IMF’s managing director, meant when she said last week that international cooperation since the second world war had helped to reduce poverty and deliver more progress than at any time in history. The rules-based system needs to be cherished not attacked. This argument is fine as far as it goes, but as Richard Kozul-Wright, the chief economist at Unctad (the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) pointed out, the multilateral system operating in 2018 is by no means the one envisaged by its original architects in the 1940s. The Bretton Woods conference in 1944 that set up the IMF and the World Bank was dominated by the US and the UK, with the former having far more clout over the eventual outcome. Harry Dexter White, the US representative did not always see eye to eye with his UK counterpart Maynard Keynes but they were in broad agreement on three basic ideas. The first was that full employment was the main economic goal. The second was that the lesson from the Great Depression was that finance had to be controlled. The third was that the new institutions would not be in the business of prescribing one-size-fits all remedies but would instead create an environment that would allow countries to fashion policies for themselves in line with their own cultural preferences. All this has changed in the past seven decades. The prevailing orthodoxy at the IMF is that curbing inflation is more important than full employment, which is why it is recommending – on the scantiest of evidence – that the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England should be raising interest rates. A messianic belief in free movement of capital for all countries, even those with the most immature financial systems, prevailed in the years leading up to the crisis of 2008, and was in large part responsible for it. Financial markets remain vulnerable: risk has migrated from banks to other parts of the system. What’s more, the idea that countries that run into trouble should be allowed policy space has long since disappeared. There is a basic structural adjustment template when the IMF arrives in town: squeeze the domestic economy in order to get costs down, privatise in order to make industries more efficient, and devalue the currency to foster export-led growth. But it is not just a question of returning to the original 1944 blueprint. Other changes are needed. The WTO provides a rules-based system for international trade, but there is no rules-based system for debt restructuring. Plans for a sovereign-debt bankruptcy mechanism were floated in the late 1990s and early 2000s but pressure from Wall Street, which stood to lose money-making opportunities, killed off the idea. This did not seem to matter that much at the time, because two rounds of debt relief culminating in the 2005 Gleneagles agreement seemed to sort out the debt problem. One of the features of last week’s meeting, however, was a belated recognition that debt is back. The IMF said 40% of low income countries are currently at high risk of or already in debt distress, a doubling in the past five years. Jim Yong Kim, the World bank’s president, said he was watching the situation “very, very closely” and he is right to do so. Many countries have borrowed heavily in US dollars in the world’s capital markets at a time when American interest rates are being ratcheted up. Another fundamental weakness of the international system, highlighted by the trade tension between the US and China, is that it lacks a way of dealing fairly with current account imbalances. The IMF can force a deficit country that asks for help to import less and export more, but it has no sway over surplus countries. Attempts by Keynes to ensure both creditor and debtor nations had to make adjustments were thwarted by the US at Bretton Woods, a time when it was the world’s leading creditor nation. Trump, judging by his actions, would be a lot keener on a system that enshrined reciprocal action. Finally, the governance of the Bretton Woods institutions fails to reflect the changes to the global economy seen since 1944. Despite some modest tweaks in recent years, voting power is still vested in the developed countries that set up the IMF and the World Bank. Every managing director of the Fund has been a European, every president of the Bank an American. The US retains a veto over all important decisions at both institutions. There is a difference between multilateralism as a concept and multilateralism as it has been practised for the past few decades. The current state of affairs is not perfect, far from it in fact. If Trump facilitates a long overdue assessment of what a properly functioning international system might resemble, that’s to be welcomed. It would look quite different."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/21/black-art-kendrick-lamar-pulitzer-literature-rap","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T08:00:09Z","webTitle":"If we valued black art, Kendrick Lamar’s Pulitzer would have been for literature | Dotun Adebayo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/21/black-art-kendrick-lamar-pulitzer-literature-rap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/21/black-art-kendrick-lamar-pulitzer-literature-rap","fields":{"headline":"If we valued black art, Kendrick Lamar’s Pulitzer would have been for literature","bodyText":"I can’t help thinking that the Pulitzer prize committee missed a trick in their award to the rapper Kendrick Lamar this week. If they had given him the Pulitzer for literature rather than for music it would have elevated his artform and sent a message that would have resonated around the world: that rap is a legitimate form of poetry and should be put on a par with, and treated with the same deference as, Shakespeare and Wordsworth. Let’s be honest, Kendrick Lamar, Stormzy, BBK and Giggs have a greater impact and more relevance today than all the literary “greats” wandering lonely as a cloud on some dusty bookshelf in some crusty corner, waiting to be forced down the school curriculum gullets of young people. If the Pulitzer people had only bitten the bullet and done the equivalent of what the Nobel committee did for Bob Dylan and rock lyrics when they said, “You know what? We’re going to get dissed and ridiculed for even putting Dylan on the same level as John Steinbeck, but what the heck. Let’s just do it and take the flak.” Who knows what the dividend would have been for wider society? In Tottenham, where I am from, literary recognition would transform every other young black boy writing rhymes. It would stick two fingers up at the notion that the only way young black boys can get respect is on the streets. Contrary to popular belief, young black boys spend more time writing poetry than they do stabbing and shooting each other. For real. They have transformed the English language with an unparalleled lyrical dexterity. But we refuse to acknowledge that – even on Roger McGough’s Poetry Please on Radio 4. It is shocking. But the fact there is no recognition of this “new English” in our classrooms is criminal. No wonder so many youngers are bored out of their skulls and headed right down the “schools-to-prison pipeline” – as Cheryl Phoenix of the Black Child Agenda calls it – when they should be in class learning. Believe me, if the lyrics of Biggie Smalls were on the GCSE reading list, state education wouldn’t be failing our children. And if there had been an O-level in rap when I was at school I would have been the first person through the school gates every morning and the last person out. I wouldn’t have been expelled, and I certainly wouldn’t have burned down the chemistry lab. And big up Her Majesty for recognising that in her New Year honours list, which acknowledged homegrown rap poetry by giving a gong to grime artist Wiley. So why isn’t the rest of high society following QE2’s lead? Isn’t the measure of any civilised society how it treats its rappers? If it was white kids spending so much time writing poetry, would the government not be co-opting the phenomenon as a standard bearer for this amazing country we live in? And, please, don’t start talking about the content or the character of these rap poems and blaming it for the gun and knife deaths this year. Aim that vitriol at the opening exchange of Romeo and Juliet, where Samson and Gregory talk of stabbing up the Montagues and doing unspeakable things to their women. Let’s face it, the play needs a “parental advisory” sticker because it would have run foul of the obscenity laws that saw Lady Chatterley’s Lover being dragged into court in 1960. If we’re asking our children to read filth such as Shakespeare in school, and turning a blind eye to the content because it has been deemed by the gatekeepers of literary imperialism, known as “the canon”, as beyond moral reproach and contemporary social responsibility, then we cannot blame Eminem for corrupting the minds of our youths. Indeed, the corruption is from us, the guardians of their mindsets, in refusing to make the connection between Romeo and Juliet and Straight Outta Compton. I challenge any English teacher to make a comparative study between the lyrics of the title rap from NWA’s debut album and that opening scene of Romeo and Juliet and tell me they’re not the same thing. The only difference is that an AK-47 is Ice Cube’s tool, whereas Samson vows to stab any man or maid of Montague’s. When schools neglect their duty it is left to black parents in particular, in this respect, but wider society in general, and the arts, to pick up the pieces and make the change. As the new chair of the Bernie Grant Arts Centre in Tottenham, in these most challenging times for my neighbourhood, I’m trying to give our youngers their due and to turn this incredible venue into a safe space to “spit bars” and make the connection with the past 100 years of black British musical creativity.

In the latest scandal to hit the Home Office after the Windrush crisis, a range of MPs and immigration experts have criticised the use of the controversial section 322(5) of the act, with two saying the crisis-hit department is truly wicked and abusing its power. Experts say the highly skilled workers – including teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers and IT professionals – are being refused ILR after being accused of lying in their applications either for making minor and legal amendments to their tax records, or having discrepancies in declared income. In one case, the applicant’s tax returns were scrutinised by three different appeal courts who had found no evidence of any irregularities. The same figures are nevertheless used as the basis for a 322(5) refusal because of basic tax errors allegedly made by the Home Office itself. Highly Skilled Migrants is a support group that represents over 600 workers and says it is in contact with over 400 more, most of whom are facing deportation under section 322(5), with the rest still waiting for a decision by the Home Office. Aditi Bhardwaj, one of the organisers, said the group has raised about £40,000 to challenge the Home Office in the courts. “Ten members of our group have taken the Home Office to the first tier tribunal over their use of 322(5) in the past six months. Nine of these won their cases, with the appeal judges ruling the government’s use of section 322(5) was wrong,” said Bhardwaj. “At best, this suggests that the Home Office is recklessly incompetent in its use of 322(5). At worst, however, the section is being applied by the Home Office so often and being overturned so frequently when challenged at the highest level, that I question whether there is a blanket policy which the Home Office is using internally, which no one is aware about.” The claims will be seized upon as further evidence of what Jeremy Corbyn has described as the government’s “cruel and misdirected” policy of deportation. Cases include a former Ministry of Defence mechanical engineer who is now destitute, a former NHS manager currently £30,000 in debt, thanks to Home Office costs and legal fees, who spends her nights fully dressed, sitting in her front room with a suitcase in case enforcement teams arrive to deport her, and a scientist working on the development of anti-cancer drugs who is now unable to work, rent or access the NHS. Saleem Dadabhoy, a scion of one of the wealthiest families in Pakistan, is facing deportation under section 322(5) despite three different appeal courts having scrutinised his accounts and finding no evidence of any irregularities, and a court of appeal judge having ruled that he is trustworthy and credible. His deportation would directly lead to the loss of 20 jobs, all held by British citizens, and the closure of a British company worth £1.5m. Dadabhoy’s lawyer says the Home Office has made two basic accounting errors, comparing his client’s gross income to his net income, and comparing his tax return from an April to April tax year to a return from his December to December accounting year. They have used the inevitable discrepancy in income as evidence that he has submitted inaccurate figures. “The litany of callous incompetence by the Home Office has been laid bare in the past few weeks, first with the Windrush scandal and now with the revelations regarding removal targets,” said Alison Thewliss MP. “The way that the 322(5) rules are being applied is similarly malevolent, and I urge the government to get their house in order before any more lives are needlessly ruined.” Thewliss is helping a number of her highly skilled constituents facing deportation under paragraph 322(5). “It is clear that people are being unfairly targeted using this paragraph of the immigration rules,” she said. “It is a truly wicked way to treat people that have lived here for so long, obeyed the law, and contributed a great deal.” The Home Office claims the discrepancies in an ILR applicant’s tax returns are evidence that the applicant has deliberately provided false information, giving it the right to trigger its discretionary powers of paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Act, a section designed to tackle criminals and those judged to be a threat to national security. The controversial paragraph comes with devastating conditions. Migrants immediately become ineligible for any other UK visa. Many are given just 14 days to leave the UK, while others are allowed to stay and fight their cases but not to work. In addition, people deported under the terrorism-associated paragraph will have that permanently marked on their passports, making it highly unlikely they will ever get a visa to visit or work anywhere else in the world. The Home Office’s own internal guidance to caseworkers specifies that section 322(5) should only be triggered in cases involving “criminality, a threat to national security, war crimes or travel bans”. But the discretionary section also allows the Home Office to refuse an applicant by inferring that their “character and conduct” make them undesirable to be allowed to live in the UK. “Tax error rectification is not illegal or unlawful anywhere in the world, and not even in the UK Financial Act 2007,” said Bhardwaj. Paul Garlick, a former Queen’s Counsel who specialises in extradition and human rights law, and was a part-time judge at the crown court in London said: “The decisions of the Home Office are beyond belief and deplorable. “The system is crippled by not having enough people to do the work while those who are there, don’t understand the basics,” he added. “They genuinely have no idea of the difference between tax years and accounting years, or what is a legitimately deductible expense. “My feeling is that since Theresa May’s announcement of a ‘hostile environment’ for immigrants, caseworkers have been told to look for discrepancies that could form the basis of an accusation the applicant is lying, because that’s the quickest way to dispose of an application.” Afzal Khan MP, the shadow minister for immigration, said: “Driven by a misguided net migration target, the Home Office has gone after what they perceive as easy targets in the form of the Windrush generation and highly skilled migrants. “Going after NHS doctors, lawyers, teachers and engineers on the basis of tax errors is another example of the misguided injustice of the Home Office.” Malini Skandachanmugarasan, senior solicitor and head of appeals and human rights at Laura Devine Solicitors in London, said the Home Office is “abusing” the powers granted to them under section 322(5) by “wrongly applying it to those not accused of any crime”. “They are increasingly applying it to highly skilled migrants who have been in the UK for many years, creating or building up businesses here while contributing to our economy by paying high taxes and creating jobs for settled, British workers,” she said. “Generally with the refusals of the highly-skilled migrants, there have not been and are unlikely to be any type of police investigation or prosecution, so a refusal on this ground seems unfounded and disproportionate.” Mark Symes, one of the country’s leading barristers specialising in immigration law who also sits as a judge of the upper tribunal and first tier tribunal, said: “In the last couple of years, the refusal of the Home Office has become near-automatic for any applicant who declares higher earnings on their immigration applications than they subsequently – or at the same time – declare to the HMRC. “The Home Office think this shows deliberate misuse of the immigration system: that these individuals have either downplayed their income for tax reasons or overstated their income for immigration purposes.” “But small businesses may have up and downs on their incomes, and the tax year rarely equates perfectly to the immigration application year,” he said. “In any case, it is not unusual for businesspeople to have to correct their tax returns but the Home Office treats any amendments almost as an admission of guilt,” added Symes, who is also the co-founder of HJT, a consultancy which trains government on immigration law. A Home Office spokesperson said it refuses applications “in these circumstances only where the evidence shows applicants have deliberately provided false information to the government”.

With his brother Paolo, two years his junior, he wrote and directed more than 20 films. The brothers were said to work harmoniously as one. “We have different characters but the same nature,” Vittorio said in 2012. Marcello Mastroianni, who starred in their 1974 drama Allonsanfàn, addressed the brothers as “Paolovittorio.” Asked at the end of the shoot what it was like to take direction from two people, he replied: “There were two of them?” The Tavianis won the Palme d’Or at Cannes for their 1977 masterpiece Padre Padrone, shot on 16mm for Italian television. This odyssey of rural hardship was adapted from the memoir of the linguist Gavino Ledda, son of a brutal Sardinian farmer, and elevated by its unusual mix of neorealist earthiness and Brechtian theatricality. In the film’s opening scene, for instance, the real Ledda hands a stick to the actor playing his on-screen parent: “My father was carrying this,” he says. Ledda appears at the end also, to close the book on the adaptation of his life. In between are coarsely poetic passages outlining his journey from mental and physical impoverishment to emancipation through music and language. The film has an appealing playfulness, eavesdropping on the internal monologues of humans and animals alike. There was a special poignancy to Padre Padrone’s Cannes triumph: the jury president that year, arguing passionately in the film’s favour, was Roberto Rossellini, whose neorealist picture Paisan, about the allied liberation of Italy, had first inspired the brothers to become directors. They were born and raised in San Miniato, Tuscany, by liberal, anti-fascist parents who used art and culture as rewards: their father, Ermanno, a lawyer, took them to the opera when their grades were good. Their mother, Jolanda (nee Brogi), was a teacher. They got along well enough until their teens. “There was a period during adolescence when we both hoped the other would die in a car crash,” Vittorio said. “I used to write plays that contained two brothers, one perfect, the other one evil.” After the war they attended university in Pisa, where Paolo studied liberal arts and Vittorio read law. While there, they saw Paisan together. “It was such a shock in our lives, such a turnaround, because we watched our own tragedy that we’d lived through being re-enacted on screen. By seeing it, we understood better the times we had lived through.” Leaving the cinema, they vowed that, if they were not making their own films within a decade, they would buy a gun and kill themselves. Before their self-imposed deadline was up, they completed a short film: San Miniato, July 1944 (1954), about a massacre carried out by the Germans in the Tavianis’ home town. They co-directed with Joris Ivens the 1960 documentary Italy Is Not a Poor Country and teamed up with Valentino Orsini to co-direct A Man to Burn (1962) and Outlaws of Love (1963) before branching out on their own with The Subversives (1967), which traced the impact of the death of the communist leader Palmiro Togliatti. St Michael Had a Rooster (1972), adapted from Tolstoy’s Divine and Human, was the first of a string of literary adaptations that also included Kaos (1984) and You Laugh (1998), both based on stories by Pirandello, The Sun Also Shines at Night (1990), based on Tolstoy’s story Father Sergius, and a film of Goethe’s Elective Affinities (1996). After Padre Padrone, the other pinnacle of their career was The Night of the Shooting Stars (1982), a pastoral wartime drama shot through with fantasy and black comedy, and set in 1944 in a Tuscan village poised to be snatched away from the Germans by approaching US troops. The New Yorker critic Pauline Kael, who had been part of Rossellini’s Cannes jury, received the new film just as rapturously: “The Tavianis make stylised unreality work for them in a way that nobody else ever has; in Shooting Stars, unreality doesn’t seem divorced from experience (as it does with Fellini) – it’s experience made more intense.” Good Morning Babylon (1987), about set designers working for DW Griffith, felt less assured, perhaps because of the English-language script and the use of Italian and Spanish locations standing in for American ones. Their last great work was Caesar Must Die, which won the Golden Bear at Berlin in 2012. This unorthodox adaptation of Julius Caesar was shot inside Rebibbia prison in Rome and performed by hardened lifers, many of them former mafia and Camorra hitmen. Searching and powerful, it was above all compassionate. “We could sometimes look in the eyes of the inmates while they were acting and see that those eyes had witnessed murder in real life,” said Vittorio. “From behind the camera, we saw them as the children they once were, whooping and jumping around. By the same token, we hate with all our might what the mafia and Camorra and so on have done. How can we put these equally strange emotions together? We still don’t know how to resolve that.” The last film directed by both brothers was Wondrous Boccaccio (2015), adapted from stories by the Italian writer. Rainbow: A Private Affair (2017), based on Beppe Fenoglio’s 1963 novel set in wartime Italy, was directed by Paolo alone, due to Vittorio’s poor health, though it was presented as the work of both men. He is survived by his wife, Carla (nee Vezzoso), and by their children, Giovanna, Francesca and Giuliano, as well as by Paolo. • Vittorio Taviani, film-maker, born 20 September 1929; died 15 April 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/20/care-for-13000-britons-at-risk-as-provider-seeks-rescue-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T18:30:54Z","webTitle":"Care for 13,000 Britons at risk as provider seeks rescue plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/20/care-for-13000-britons-at-risk-as-provider-seeks-rescue-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/20/care-for-13000-britons-at-risk-as-provider-seeks-rescue-plan","fields":{"headline":"Care for 13,000 Britons at risk as provider seeks rescue plan","bodyText":"The care of more than 13,000 elderly and vulnerable Britons could be thrown into turmoil after one of the biggest providers of home care visits in the UK warned it would go bust unless creditors backed a rescue plan. Allied Healthcare, which has contracts with 150 local authorities and also provides out-of-hours services for the NHS, is asking for breathing space on its finances after cashflow problems that have been triggered in part by an £11m bill for back pay owed to sleep-in care workers. The loss-making company has 8,700 employees and cares for 13,500 people in their homes via a network of 83 branches around the country. According to the Allied website it is the country’s largest domiciliary care business, twice the size of its nearest competitor. Its Primecare division provides primary and urgent healthcare services, including NHS 111 telephony services, GP-led medical centres and end-of-life care. It also provides healthcare services in a number of secure settings including prisons, immigration centres and secure training centres. Allied was bought by the German private equity firm Aurelius in a £19m deal in December 2015 but it has struggled against a backdrop of local authority funding cuts. In a letter to creditors seen by the Guardian, its chief executive, Luca Warnke, said it had “significant funding pressures on our customers that have impacted on their ability to deliver financially viable health and social care services”. It added that it had taken the decision to pursue a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency procedure that will enable it to agree a payment plan with creditors that include landlords and members of its pension schemes. It expects to file for the procedure on Monday. Warnke blamed rising agency labour costs for its woes, pointing to the shortage of doctors and nurses since the Brexit vote as well as a potential £11m bill for backdated “sleep in” payments depending on HMRC’s calculation of the pay period. Last year the government changed its guidance on how sleep-in carers should be paid, advising that they were entitled to earn the national minimum wage for the entirety of the time they were present in a house rather than just a flat rate. At that time some charities warned it could cost the sector £400m and potentially bankrupt many social care charities and providers. The company said in a statement: “As with many independent providers in the UK health and social care sector, Allied Healthcare has been operating in a highly challenging environment for a sustained period of time, which has placed pressure on the company. “As a result of these challenges, Allied Healthcare has has taken the decision to pursue a company voluntary arrangement as part of a prospective business plan that will ensure safe continuity of care across our UK-wide operations, place the company on a sustainable long-term footing and maximise repayments to creditors. “The proposed CVA will not impact on the safe continuity of care that Allied Healthcare provides across the UK,” it said. “Allied Healthcare will continue to trade safely and it remains business as usual for Allied Healthcare employees and customers.” The company insisted there were currently no plans for redundancies or branch closures. A spokesman for the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents local authorities, insisted that councils have “robust” contingency plans in place to manage the care of individuals if necessary if the company were to fail. “The absolute priority for councils affected is to protect the vital care and support that older and disabled people rely on and ensure it is able to continue without interruption,” a spokesman said. “The LGA is working alongside the Care Quality Commission and the government to support Allied, where possible, as it plans to financially restructure the business and continue to provide high-quality home care.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/22/construction-industry-watchdog-carillion-small-contractors-exploited","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T05:59:13Z","webTitle":"Construction industry needs a watchdog to stand guard over the little builders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/22/construction-industry-watchdog-carillion-small-contractors-exploited","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/22/construction-industry-watchdog-carillion-small-contractors-exploited","fields":{"headline":"Construction industry needs a watchdog to stand guard over the little builders","bodyText":"The concept of dominant forces in the construction industry snatching some readies off folk less powerful in the supply chain sounds a trifle Dickensian. Literally so, in that this is precisely what the odious Sam Pecksniff, the obsequious architect in Martin Chuzzlewit, did by trousering his students’ tuition fees and passing off their work as his own. But it is also quite obviously a modern phenomenon, too, most recently illustrated by the collapse of the “construction” giant Carillion – the company formerly entrusted to arrange for the building of some of the country’s most important infrastructure, from NHS hospitals to new roads. Its demise has left small business subcontractors around £1bn down, but no matter: on the flip side, we have all been cheered by the news that Carillion directors worked hard to ensure their white-collar chums would not be out of pocket. The fallout from the collapse of the firm is going to rumble on for a good while yet, with many fearing that recent insolvencies, such as the likes of Vaughan Engineering (160 jobs), are merely the foundations of a wider crisis that affects the wider economy. Let’s hope not, but, at the very least, the efforts to dodge the next disaster are now becoming more visible. This week parliament is due to hear the second reading of a bill being introduced by Conservative MP Peter Aldous, which seeks to ringfence payments to subcontractors in an effort to avoid exactly the type of pain now being suffered by those formerly on Carillion’s payroll. Its genesis pre-dates the firm’s dramatic collapse in January and follows years of so-called “subbie-bashing”, in which the small businesses actually doing the project work have been squeezed, and exploited along the lines of Pecksniff’s underling Tom Pinch. Similar efforts to Aldous’s have already been implemented in other countries, such as the US, Germany, France, New Zealand, Australia and Canada, while the MP’s brave new world has united unlikely bedfellows such as shadow chancellor John McDonnell and defence secretary Gavin Williamson, who is flirting with supporting the bill. So what next? Well, assuming it gets read (and remember, this is government meets construction, so expect delays) the bill will then progress to committee, then the Lords, and then back to the Commons – so it’s an even-money bet to come in before HS2. Still – other initiatives are also in train. Rudi Klein, chief executive of the Specialist Engineering Contractors’ Group, says: “Maybe it is time for a construction conduct authority, which might have the power to say ‘if you are guilty of shoddy practice, we will fine you 1% of turnover’. That might concentrate their minds.” Maybe so. Construction is an industry particularly sensitive to cash, as contractors operate on wafer-thin margins, with their largest customer (the government) under pressure to accept the lowest bid. Strangely, that makes bidding for major public-private partnership (PPP) construction deals even more crucial, as the winner gets a large chunk of cash upfront and has little incentive to start paying new subcontractors for another 120 days. During those four months, much of the upfront payment might be used to pay other debts, and before you know it, you become reliant on winning new contracts just to keep going. If that all sounds broadly similar to a Ponzi scheme, you are not alone in making the comparison. Nor is it new. In fact, it was another delightful little tactic that Dickens chronicled in Martin Chuzzlewit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/20/westpac-held-back-details-from-rival-about-dodgy-financial-adviser","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T07:22:58Z","webTitle":"Westpac held back details from rival about dodgy financial adviser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/20/westpac-held-back-details-from-rival-about-dodgy-financial-adviser","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/20/westpac-held-back-details-from-rival-about-dodgy-financial-adviser","fields":{"headline":"Westpac held back details from rival about dodgy financial adviser","bodyText":"Westpac has admitted it failed to tell a competitor about a financial planner who had ripped off clients while under its employment, and that it allowed that competitor to hire the planner anyway. The banking royal commission has heard that a former financial planner, Andrew Smith, who worked for Westpac and St George bank between 2007 and 2015, eventually resigned after it was discovered he was charging customers for services he never delivered, keeping woeful records, and asking clients to sign blank documents. His misconduct led to numerous customer complaints being registered – which are expected to cost Westpac $2.2m in compensation payments to 91 clients. After resigning in 2015, he applied for a role with Dover Financial Advisers on 21 April 2015. Michael Wright, the head of Westpac’s BT financial advice subsidiary, admitted to the royal commission on Friday that it took months for Westpac to report Smith’s conduct to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) as a “significant breach”. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon He also said Westpac did not provide details about Smith’s record to Dover Financial whenit asked for a reference, other than to say the bank “had concerns about [Smith’s] conduct”. An email from Dover to Westpac on 6 May 2015, roughly six weeks after Smith had resigned from Westpac, asked the bank’s executives if they knew of any action that might affect his ability to provide financial advice honestly, or if any client complaints against him had given rise to a claim, or if he had been the subject of any investigation, inquiry or audit. At the time, Westpac had accepted Smith’s resignation, after he had been suspended amid serious allegations agaginst him. But Westpac executives replied to Dover saying it wasn’t the bank’s policy to give written replies to reference checks or to go into specifics about individuals. A Dover executive, Peter Thompson, then called Westpac for clarification and he was merely told “we have concerns regarding his conduct” and “there is an ongoing investigation taking place”. Dover then sent an email to Westpac saying it needed an immediate response with details about the investigation, and it wanted to be told if he had made a significant breach. By this time, Westpac’s investigations had identified serious deficiencies in Smith’s conduct but it would not provide those details to Dover. Wright told the royal commission on Friday he had no reason not to stand by the advice from Westpac’s lawyers at the time that the bank should not tell Dover many details about Smith’s conduct. Orr then asked: “Well, what do you say about the need to protect Mr Smith’s future clients from his conduct, and the importance of licensees sharing information with each other to protect those clients?” Wright replied: “Critical.” Orr said: “And this is not consistent with that, is it?” Wright replied: “No, and it wouldn’t meet today’s standards.” The royal commission heard that Westpac’s internal investigation into Smith wrapped up in July 2015, and it took until November for the bank to notify Asic. Orr said: “Do you accept that in a situation like this where Westpac has extensive concerns about the conduct of a financial adviser and Westpac knows that that adviser is moving to practice with another licensee, that the community would expect Westpac to communicate those concerns to that further licensee? Wright replied: “Yes I’d agree with that.” There have been some shocking revelations from the second round of the banking royal commission, including AMP admitting that it lied to regulators and Commonwealth Bank acknowledging that its advisers charged fees to clients after their death. On Friday morning, the chief executive of AMP said he would stand down immediately. Despite the angry reaction from the public to the royal commission’s findings, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, declined on Friday to apologise for repeatedly resisting calls for an inquiry, instead rounding on the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, for “political point scoring”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/27/korea-summits-key-players-kim-jong-un-and-moon-jae-in","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T22:53:55Z","webTitle":"Inter-Korean summit's key players: Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/27/korea-summits-key-players-kim-jong-un-and-moon-jae-in","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/27/korea-summits-key-players-kim-jong-un-and-moon-jae-in","fields":{"headline":"Inter-Korean summit's key players: Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in","bodyText":"Kim Jong-un Born – Kim Jong-un on 8 January 1984 (the date has been widely reported although not officially confirmed) to Ko Yong-hui, a Japanese-born Korean dancer, and Kim Jong-il, the supreme leader. Attended Kim II-sung University, a prestigious officer-training school in Pyongyang. In July 2012 state media announced he was married to Ri Sol-ju. South Korean intelligence has reportedly said the couple have three children. Best of times – Taking on the mantle of North Korea’s supreme leadership – one of his brothers could have been the choice. That paranoia led to Kim ordering his half-brother’s assassination in Malaysia last year. Worst of times – Since 2011 he has conducted four nuclear tests and more than two dozen missiles tests, damaging North Korea’s close relationship with China and leading to further pressure from the US. The Trump administration has increased sanctions against the already reclusive nation as part of its “maximum pressure” policy. What he says – “Whatever Trump might have expected, he will face results beyond his expectation. I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire.” “The entire area of the US mainland is within our nuclear strike range. The US can never start a war against me and our country. These weapons will be used only if our security is threatened.” What others say – Most experts agree Kim is a rational person who has developed nuclear weapons to safeguard against what he sees as an existential threat from the US and its allies. There is little chance he would use those in a preemptive strike, since it would ensure his destruction. Kim is also wary of giving up weapons after seeing leaders such as Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi relinquish arsenals only to later become the target of western powers. Moon Jae-in Born – Moon Jae-in on 24 January 1953. He served in the South Korean special forces (all men are required to complete military service) in the 1970s and later became a human rights lawyer. He and his wife are Catholic and the couple have two children. Best of times – Winning the presidency in 2017, ending nearly a decade of conservative rule. His meeting with Kim is the culmination of a lifetime of working on engagement with North Korea. Moon was previously the presidential chief of staff during the last inter-Korean summit, in 2007. Worst of times Losing the presidential election in 2012 to Park Geun-hye, who was eventually forced from office amid a corruption scandal. What he says – “The message that we must send to North Korea is twofold: If the North Korean regime believes that it can defend and protect itself through nuclear and missile programs, that is a misjudgment. But if North Korea gives up its nuclear program, we will help it secure and develop itself. We must consistently send these two messages.” “I think President Trump deserves big credit for bringing about the inter-Korean talks, and I want to show my gratitude. It could be the result of US-led sanctions and pressure.” What others say – South Korean politicians are defined by their North Korea policy. Liberals and the younger generation are strongly supportive of Moon’s agenda while older people believe he is making too many concessions.

The old Kim disappeared, he isn’t here now. It happened after I was walking down a street at night. I remember being called a faggot, a hard punch to the left of my head, and a flash of white. Things seemed OK in hospital. I got the side of my head stitched back together. My medical files say I had seizures or spasms of some kind, but nothing too serious. The serious part came later, in stealth; it crept up in silence. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday I went to get those stitches out. I said I still wasn’t feeling the best. I was different. Tests revealed something was wrong. Scary words filled a report with my name on it: Memory, low average. Executive functioning, low average. Verbal fluency, reduced ability. Impairment. Below expectation. Below average. They were all ways of saying I was brain damaged. At work, I got taken off the air. The thing I was great at was gone. “Kim’s work is characterised by misuse of vocabulary, unclear grammar, difficulties with logic and structure, lack of sentence cohesion,” is something mentioned in a later report. Broadcasting was all I’d ever done, and all I’d ever cared for. I was really good at it. But now I was getting rehabilitation, and now I was getting speech therapy. I spent my late 20s and early 30s learning how to talk and write again. It spanned years. I had tests using what looked like children’s picture books, and failed. I had to learn to say 10 vegetables, or 10 things starting with ‘s’, and failed. I had to say what the similarities and differences are between a dishwasher and an oven, a glove and a sock, or a mirror and a window. My injury is well-known in media circles. But it’s not something I’ve talked about publicly. I’m talking about it because while a lot has been written about freedom of speech and about sport and role models, there’s still a lot that needs to be said. I’ve been told I can never ski, snowboard, and it’d be best not to cycle. Years later I’ve been caught out not knowing or being able to place someone if they’ve come up to me on the street, when I actually know them very well. And if I’m tired and run down, I’ll sometimes mispronounce a simple word. I used to say the wrong word altogether, and say something about champagne instead of shampoo. My partner is hurt when I’m too scared to hold his hand in public, fearful I’ll be bashed again. Which takes us to more recent events. What some people see as freedom of expression, I see as a vehicle for hate and prejudice. I see a sanctioned target put on people who are often already doing it tough and made to feel less. Freedom of speech doesn’t need to cross a line into speech that spreads hate and puts people in harm’s way. High-profile people wouldn’t be able to talk like this about other groups. I don’t know why the LGBTQ+ community has to hear it. I don’t know why people are allowed to say it. But I do know what it does. To many, it makes it seem like it’s appropriate. It makes it seem like it should be done. It makes it seem like it’s a normal thing to say. It shouldn’t be. It’s not. The person that hit me thought it was OK to say names and hit a person because they’re gay. I don’t need anyone to tell me I’m going to hell, I’ve already been. And there are people who are hurt far worse by people who think there’s nothing wrong with wounding a gay person. At least I’m here.

The prime minister wore a Kahu huruhuru; a Māori cloak adorned with feathers and bestowed on chiefs and dignitaries to convey prestige, respect and power, said Mark Sykes, guardian of Māori special collections at Te Papa, the national museum of New Zealand. Sykes said Ardern’s choice was a proud moment for Māori around the world. “Cloaks are worn for warmth, protection and to symbolise your status and mana [power],” said Sykes. “I think it shows how she is portraying herself as a leader of Māori, of all of New Zealand, of everyone. It made me feel proud. She wore it well. She wore it so well.” On social media in New Zealand the striking image went viral, with many people commenting that the picture captured the inversion of traditional gender roles; a female world leader wearing a powerful cloak while pregnant and representing her country. There are more than 10 varieties of Māori cloak, broadly referred to as Korowai, and the Kahu huruhuru become prestigious from the mid-1800s, with Kiwi feather cloaks the most valuable and sought after. Two of them were given to the Queen and Prince Philip on their 1954 tour of New Zealand, and were later worn by other members of the royal family when they visited the country. According to Te Papa, in the Māori world birds were given the task of carrying spiritual messages between the gods and people, and their feathers were prized and sacred. Ardern’s Kahu huruhuru has been loaned to her from the London Māori club Ngāti Rānana. Modern-day Kahu huruhuru are often made from the feathers of birds killed by predators or on motorways, because many native New Zealand birds are threatened and protected species. • This article was amended on 27 April 2018. An earlier version said many native New Zealand birds such as the Kereru and Pukeko were endangered. Those birds are not endangered and the reference to them has been removed. “Endangered” has been corrected to “threatened”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/20/oregon-too-much-weed-oversupply-what-happened-420","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T07:01:15Z","webTitle":"Growing pains: how Oregon wound up with way more pot than it can smoke","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/20/oregon-too-much-weed-oversupply-what-happened-420","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/20/oregon-too-much-weed-oversupply-what-happened-420","fields":{"headline":"Growing pains: how Oregon wound up with way more pot than it can smoke","bodyText":"Trey Willison, a cannabis farmer in Eugene, first started worrying last May about there being too much marijuana in Oregon. He had sold all his “clone” plants to other growers, who were using them to cultivate yet more marijuana. “You start doing the math on that and it just didn’t make sense how people could be growing that many plants,” Willison said. Fast-forward nearly a year and Oregon does indeed have a glut of marijuana; there are over 1m lb of usable but unsold marijuana, according to the state tracking system. That’s more than 128m “eighths” of weed, and almost three times the amount of cannabis sold in Oregon in all of last year. Flooded with supply, prices are dropping so much that some dispensaries in the Portland area are selling the drug for $4 a gram. That’s less than half the cost of a bargain-basement batch in other US cities where marijuana is legal, like Denver and Seattle. When the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC), the agency in charge of cannabis regulation, issued the first licenses to businesses in 2016, projections were for 800 to 1,200 businesses to obtain cannabis licenses in the first couple of years, according to Mark Pettinger, a spokesman for the OLCC. But 1,824 marijuana-related business licenses have already been issued, including 981 production operations. Another 967 production licenses are in various stages of approval by the state and could come online later this year. Molly Conroy, the program director for the Oregon Cannabis Association, cautioned that this is a brand new market that needs time to adjust. “Every agricultural crop has its highs and its lows,” she said. “No pun intended.” Unlike Colorado, which also legalized marijuana, many of the cannabis farms in Oregon are outdoors because the plants thrive in the state’s warm, sunny summers. But the first year that recreational cannabis farms were licensed, a rainstorm hammered the crop just before the prime flower harvest in October. “A lot of crop got destroyed,” said Pettinger. “It wasn’t salvageable because it had mildew or mold on it. So there was a not a real accurate gauge of what the market looked like.” Demand remained high – so, by last fall, hundreds more farms had obtained licenses. And a long, favorable growing season made for a bumper crop. Suddenly, the state had more marijuana than it knew what to do with. Cannabis flowers have a shelf life of several months but after a while, the product gets stale. Andrew Lessar owns Oregon CO2, a company that extracts oils from cannabis flowers, then sells the oils to producers of edibles. Lessar said he gets between five and 10 calls a week from growers who are desperate to generate some income from their flowers. “If I see an unknown number on my phone, I know it’s going to be someone saying, ‘We’ve got 500 lb,’ ‘We’ve got 2,000 lb … Can you help us?’” But Lessar said that because of the way cannabis is regulated, he can’t sell the oils back to the producer. They need to already have a buyer lined up or obtain a $5,000 license that covers a different part of the farm-to-consumer process. And because US federal law still prohibits cannabis, Oregon growers cannot legally sell outside the state’s borders. Tristan Reisfar works part-time for a company, High Desert Pure, that produces vapor cartridges and said he fields phone calls from desperate growers offering to sell their marijuana for as little as $100 per lb. When Oregon launched its recreational marijuana program, it was common for growers to count on bringing in $2,400 per lb. “We’re coming into another growing season here, what are they going to do then?” Reisfar asked. Reisfar also co-hosts a weekly marijuana-themed talk radio show called The High Desert Co-op. He said he gets calls every week from growers who are looking to sell their cannabis farms and want his promotional help. Willison, the co-owner of Eugenius LLC, said he still has “a couple hundred lb of product in our vault”. He has pared down his operation from 16 employees to seven. Three-quarters of the farm has been switched from cannabis to hemp seed. Hemp is a related plant that doesn’t offer the same high as cannabis, but has a variety of uses including fabric and medicine. He plans to keep growing marijuana to maintain his brand until the market rebounds. In the meantime, he estimates that the marijuana portion of his business is losing between $5,000 and $10,000 a month. “This glut’s going to take a few years. There is really no short-term answer,” Willison said. So what’s to come of that 1m lb of weed? Reisfar said that as cannabis flowers age, some of the chemical components that cause a narcotic high break down into slightly different components which instead cause drowsiness. “That’s another factor in their desperation,” he said of the growers. “That weed is turning into something that they didn’t start out trying to make: sleepy time weed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/22/jfk-documents-could-show-the-truth-about-a-diplomats-death-47-years-ago","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T11:00:21Z","webTitle":"JFK documents could show the truth about a diplomat's death 47 years ago","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/22/jfk-documents-could-show-the-truth-about-a-diplomats-death-47-years-ago","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/22/jfk-documents-could-show-the-truth-about-a-diplomats-death-47-years-ago","fields":{"headline":"JFK documents could show the truth about a diplomat's death 47 years ago","bodyText":"Charles Thomas was a rising star at the state department in the early 1960s, a career diplomat who had served across Latin America and Africa. His colleagues were convinced he would earn the rank of ambassador. They agreed that the tall, jut-jawed, preppy, handsome Thomas – described by colleagues as “the diplomat from central casting” – adored his wife Cynthia and two young daughters. But then something went horribly wrong. In 1971, at the age of 48, Thomas killed himself. The death certificate showed that on Monday 12 April, at about 4pm and in the second-floor bathroom of his family’s rented home on the banks of the Potomac river in Washington, Thomas lifted a gun to his head. Cynthia, downstairs, thought the boiler had exploded. The reasons for the suicide were not a complete mystery. Thomas had been despondent after he had been denied a promotion two years earlier and forced out of the state department. In the 1960s, the department had an up-or-out policy – diplomats were either promoted or they were “selected out”, to use the department’s Orwellian term. For Cynthia and the rest of the family, the nightmare was compounded months later by a terrible discovery – Thomas had been “selected out” in error. A clerical mistake had apparently cost him his cherished 18-year career. According to the department, Thomas was denied a promotion because part of his personnel records, including a glowing job evaluation from the embassy in Mexico, had been accidentally misfiled. The family received a formal written apology, signed by Gerald Ford. Congressional outrage led the state department to overhaul its promotion system. But now, four decades later, Thomas’s widow and others say they are convinced they are still being denied the full truth about what put Thomas on a path to killing himself. In that cause, they are pleading with Donald Trump to release classified documents from the National Archives. The documents are long-secret government files about – of all things – the assassination of John F Kennedy. ‘True nature of the Kennedy assassination’ The Thomas family acknowledges that theirs is a bizarre and complicated story. But they are convinced – with good reason, given what they have discovered – that if Thomas’s personnel records were misfiled it was intentional, and that it was never the real reason for his firing. They are certain that Thomas lost his career – and ultimately his will to live – because senior officials were determined to shut down his persistent, unwelcome and ultimately fruitless effort to reopen an investigation of JFK’s murder. There is a long paper trail. Documents released to the public show that during a posting in Mexico in the mid-1960s, Thomas came across evidence that showed Lee Harvey Oswald – who visited Mexico City in September 1963, weeks before killing Kennedy – had been in contact there with Cuban diplomats and spies who wanted JFK dead and might have offered help and encouragement. In internal memos not made public until years after his death, Thomas told supervisors such information from Mexico could undermine the findings of the presidential panel that determined in 1964 that Oswald acted alone. In one memo, Thomas warned that the Mexico information “threatened to reopen the debate about the true nature of the Kennedy assassination and damage the credibility of the Warren report”. For historians, Oswald’s trip to Mexico has never been adequately explained. Available records shows that the CIA and FBI knew much more about it – and the threat Oswald posed – than they ever shared with the Warren commission. The agencies appear to have withheld evidence out of fear they might be blamed for bungling intelligence that could have saved Kennedy’s life. Oswald, a Marine Corps veteran and self-declared Marxist who had once tried to defect to the Soviet Union, met in Mexico with Cuban and Soviet diplomats and spies and, according to a long-secret FBI report, talked openly about his plan to kill Kennedy. Given Trump’s deadline next week – a deadline he set himself – to release thousands of still-classified documents related to the assassination held by the National Archives, the Thomas family says questions about their family tragedy are urgent once again. Many of those documents are known to have come out of the files of the CIA station in Mexico at about the time of Oswald’s visit, which suggests they could bolster Thomas’s suspicions about what happened there. In an interview, Thomas’s youngest daughter, Zelda Thomas-Curti, a Minneapolis business consultant who was born in Mexico, described her father as “one of America’s most important – if mostly unrecognized – 20th-century government whistleblowers”. On behalf of her family, including her own three children, Thomas-Curti said she had written to Trump, to ask him to do justice to her father’s memory by releasing all remaining JFK files. “Washington overpowered my father like a steam shovel, tossing him into a heap like discarded dirt,” she wrote. “But he was a hero who was out there fighting for the truth.” She told Trump that she wanted “my three children to know that their grandfather was a real-life hero”. Thomas’s widow, Cynthia, who went on to her own career in the state department and now lives in Minnesota, said the family deserved to see all the JFK documents. “My grandchildren are entitled to know the truth about Charles,” she said. ‘As much access as possible’ In 1992, Congress passed the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act. Lawmakers hoped it would damp down raging conspiracy theories created by the release of Oliver Stone’s conspiracy-laden film, JFK, the year before. The law called for release of all assassination-related documents. As a result, millions of pages were made public in the 1990s. Several thousand other documents, initially held back because of national security concerns, were supposed to have been released last October, the 25th anniversary of the law’s passage. But Trump delayed the release for another six months, citing security concerns raised by the CIA and FBI. The new deadline is 26 April. The White House has given no clue about whether the president will now allow the full library of documents to be made public. But Trump, who is no stranger to conspiracy theories, including about the Kennedy assassination, has vowed transparency. “The American public expects – and deserves – its government to provide as much access as possible” to the JFK records, he said last year. The exact number of assassination-related documents still held is in question, since there is no definitive public inventory. A research group, the Mary Ferrell Foundation, said last month its tally showed more than 21,890 documents were still being withheld in full or in part. The National Archives has produced a bare-bones index, which shows that many of the documents are drawn from the CIA station in Mexico City. For Thomas’s family, as well as for many JFK historians, that suggests those documents may refer to surveillance of Oswald and his contacts in Mexico. Previously declassified files show that CIA officers in Mexico conducted close surveillance of Oswald as he apparently sought a visa to defect to Havana. The files show that he visited both the Cuban and Soviet embassies and that he may have had a brief affair with a Mexican woman who worked in the Cuban consulate. In a once-classified 2013 internal CIA report, the agency’s chief historian concluded that the CIA had conducted a “benign cover-up” to withhold “incendiary” information. The cover-up, the report said, was intended to keep the commission focused on “what the Agency believed at the time was the ‘best truth’ – that Lee Harvey Oswald, for as yet undetermined motives, had acted alone in killing John Kennedy”. ‘A responsibility for seeing it through’ Previously declassified records referring to Thomas show that he was repeatedly rebuffed when trying to reopen an investigation of Oswald’s Mexico trip. In a memo written in 1969, in his final days at the department, Thomas made a last plea that someone go back to Mexico. Though he made no allegation that Fidel Castro had any personal role in any plot to kill Kennedy, Thomas wanted the US to investigate whether the Warren commission had missed evidence of a conspiracy in JFK’s death between Oswald and Cubans loyal to the Castro regime. “Since I was the embassy officer who acquired this intelligence information,” Thomas wrote, “I feel a responsibility for seeing it through to its final evaluation.” The memo outlined a story that Thomas first heard in 1965 from a friend – Elena Garro de Paz, a prominent Mexican writer whose husband, Octavio Paz, later won the Nobel prize for literature. Garro said she had encountered Oswald at a family dance party in Mexico City in the fall of 1963 that was attended by Cuban diplomats and Mexican leftists who supported the Castro revolution. According to Garro, people at the party had spoken openly of their hope that Kennedy would be killed. According to Garro, who died in 1998, Oswald was invited to the party by her cousin Silvia Duran, a vivacious young woman who worked at the Cuban consulate. Garro told Thomas she was certain Oswald and Duran had a brief affair. In the years since Thomas’s paperwork was made public, Duran, who is still alive, has insisted that she did not have an affair with Oswald and only met him inside the Cuban consulate. But other Mexicans, including members of Duran’s extended family, have disputed her account. A Mexican journalist recalled seeing Oswald at a separate reception, at the Cuban embassy.

Lawyers for Michael Cohen, Donald Trump’s consigliere and legal fixer, had tried every trick in the book to avoid disclosing the name of a mystery Cohen client, who they said was desperate to remain anonymous. “I’m directing you to disclose the name – now,” said the veteran jurist. Stephen Ryan, Cohen’s hangdog lead attorney, got to his feet and cleared his throat. “The client’s name that is involved is Sean Hannity,” he said. Gasps filled courtroom 21B at the federal courthouse in lower Manhattan. Hannity, the bloviating primetime star of Fox News and Trump’s favorite journalist, had excoriated US prosecutors for their raid on Cohen’s office earlier this month. The raid was part of a “an all-hands-on-deck effort to totally malign and, if possible, impeach the president of the United States”. He failed to mention his relationship with Cohen, something even guests on his own show have since criticized and an omission that has thrust him into a media maelstrom. So what is Hannity’s relationship with Cohen, a lawyer most famous for paying off women who allegedly had affairs with the president and one of his billionaire backers? According to Hannity it’s “de minimis”. The multimillionaire may have handed him “10 bucks” for some real estate advice but he had never formally engaged him and there were “no third parties” involved, said Hannity. The media had gone “absolutely insane” about nothing, he said. For now, it appears his employer agrees. After a short pause in which management quizzed Hannity about his dealings with Cohen, Fox announced it was “surprised by the announcement” but gave him its “full support”. Fox’s support has failed to appease critics inside and outside the Fox hole. Vanity Fair’s Gabriel Sherman, author of a biography of Hannity’s mentor, the Fox News founder Roger Ailes, wrote this week that fellow Fox staffers were horrified by the news, telling him it “violates every rule of journalism”. But while Trump’s TV ratings (if not his poll numbers) are still in the ascendant, the Fox star may currently be too big to fail. “Hannity’s closeness with Trump has given him immense power at the network, and he’s not afraid to show it. When he visited Mar-a-Lago earlier this month, Hannity bragged to a guest: ‘I’m the only thing holding this network together’ (Hannity denies saying this),” wrote Sherman. Other Fox stars have been cautioned for getting too close to Trump. After Politico revealed that Bret Baier, the network’s 6pm news anchor, had played golf with Trump, the network said it had “addressed the matter”. Hannity too has been challenged for appearing in a Trump ad ahead of the election and for planning a broadcast from a Tea Party rally. For Hannity’s critics, worse still was his promulgation of the conspiracy theory that Democratic operatives were behind the murder of Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer, killed in what appears to have been a botched robbery. Hannity continued to push the far-out theory even as Rich’s parents begged him to stop. There is no suggestion that Hannity is in breach of his contract and the terms of his engagement as a commentator, not a reporter, are likely to be different from Baier’s. Fox said: “We do not discuss talent contracts. They are confidential.” The bald truth may be that in the current climate, Hannity’s omission just doesn’t matter to Fox. Last week Fox News marked 14 consecutive weeks as the number one cable TV network. Hannity, with an audience of 3 million viewers, is its biggest star after the channel lost Bill O’Reilly to a sex scandal and Megyn Kelly to NBC. But the median age of its viewers is 68 years old, a demographic timebomb common across cable news (CNN’s is 59). Media executives expect a big shakeup at Fox in the near future but, for now, they believe Hannity is safe. One source with close ties to both the Trump administration and Fox described Cohen as “a hanger on” who liked to make himself appear more central to the action than he actually was. He said Hannity would probably emerge from this scandal unscathed - as long as his relationship with Cohen was as he has described. “Michael Cohen is significantly less of a player than he wants you to believe. Hannity says they had discussions about real estate ... He has tons of real estate lawyers,” the source said. “If it’s just Michael Cohen trying to associate himself with Hannity, I don’t think it’s a problem for Hannity,” he said. But Hannity’s explanation still puzzles those closely following Cohen’s case. Cohen’s team chose to include Hannity – then still unidentified – in a list of clients whose files he intends to argue are protected by attorney-client privilege. These records, according to Cohen, should not be viewable by the investigators who are trying to prosecute him. But Hannity has said Cohen wasn’t really his attorney – he just provided some advice on buying property. “I never retained his services, I never received an invoice. I never paid Michael Cohen for legal fees,” Hannity said, soon after his identity was revealed. So why did Cohen not just leave Hannity off the list altogether? Investigators stumbling upon mentions of Hannity in Cohen’s files would, presumably, have dismissed the documents as irrelevant and his name should have remained secret. Instead, investigators tipped off the world to the pair’s working relationship. Researchers now scouring Hannity’s output for clues about it unearthed a clip from Hannity’s show about a week before Trump entered office, in which he made a curious statement. “I was kidding around yesterday with Michael Cohen – $2bn, some guy in Dubai,” Hannity said. “And I said, ‘Can you give him my number?’ I said: ‘I’m interested in that deal myself.’” Ultimately Hannity’s undoing may be what has made him such a player at Fox: his closeness to Trump. Hannity gets 15 mentions in Michael Wollf’s exposé of the early days of the Trump presidency, Fire and Fury – only five fewer than the first lady, Melania Trump. The two talk and meet regularly. Hannity had even planned to set up a rival to Fox with Trump if his presidential bid had foundered, according to Wolff. The Fox star “basically has a desk” in the White House, a presidential aide told the Washington Post last week. Ultimately those ties may spell trouble for Hannity, said David Folkenflik, NPR media correspondent and author of the book Murdoch’s World. He said the Cohen revelation was at present “a data point” but unlikely to change his relationship with Fox. “But Hannity’s proximity to Trump is such that as we learn more about that relationship, it may be unsustainable. Even for Fox News,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/19/cuba-president-miguel-diaz-canel-modernise-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T22:08:50Z","webTitle":"Cuba's new leader vows to modernise economy but no return to capitalism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/19/cuba-president-miguel-diaz-canel-modernise-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/19/cuba-president-miguel-diaz-canel-modernise-economy","fields":{"headline":"Cuba's new leader vows to modernise economy but no return to capitalism","bodyText":"Cuba’s new president has promised to modernize the country’s economy and make the government more responsive to its people, even as he pledged to uphold the values of the country’s socialist revolution. Miguel Díaz-Canel was sworn in as president on Thursday, becoming the island’s first leader without the Castro surname for the first time in almost 60 years. At a functionalist conference centre in Havana, Díaz-Canel, 57, read a brief speech which sought to reconcile revolutionary continuity with a recognition of the need for change. He said there would be no “capitalist restoration”, but promised to make better use of the internet and push on with “the modernization of our social and economic model”. He finished his address with the familiar rhetorical flourish: “Socialism or Death! We will triumph!” Raúl Castro, 86 – who stood down as president after 12 years in the office but remains first secretary of the Communist party – embraced Díaz-Canel, and gave his presidency a ringing endorsement. But he left no doubt where power still lies. In an uncharacteristically long speech, in which he repeatedly joked and went off script, Castro emphasised the need to fight corruption – and said he would stay on to guide his successor. Castro said he expected Díaz-Canel to serve two five-year terms as president before replacing him as first secretary of the party when he retires in 2021. “From that point on, I will be just another soldier defending this revolution,” Castro said. Amid the anachronistic language, there were signs that the new president was trying to forge a more modern image for the island’s ruling Communist party. In what appeared to be a centrally managed information operation, the hashtag #somoscontinuidad (#wearecontinuity) was trending on Twitter. Internet access has expanded rapidly in recent years, but still remains below the regional average. All major international news websites can be accessed from the island, but government censors block critical blogs as well as webpages financed by the US state department. Communist party insiders say Díaz-Canel is aware of the economic benefits that wider internet access could bring the island’s economy, but fears the island’s political system could be overwhelmed. Under the Obama administration, USAid worked on developing a “Cuban twitter” aimed at fomenting unrest, and in January the US state department launched a Cuba Internet Task Force, which Havana sees as another attempt to undermine it. Díaz-Canel assumes office at a tricky time for the island after the Trump administration partially reversed the fragile détente announced by Castro and Barack Obama in 2014. The US has said Cuba was “responsible” for a series of mysterious health ailments affecting US embassy personnel on the island and has withdrawn more than half of its diplomatic staff. Washington has also warned US citizens not to visit the island – a move which is starting to choke off tourism revenues. Cuba’s main ally, Venezuela, is in crisis, and has heavily cut back on highly subsidized oil shipments to Cuba, upon which the island is heavily reliant. One of Díaz-Canel’s first tasks as president will be to unify the island’s byzantine dual-currency system. Analysts say that if not managed correctly, unification could provoke inflation which could hit the purchasing power of poorer Cubans who form the base of the government’s support. Unlike the carefully orchestrated election, currency unification has the potential to unsettle the island’s seemingly rock-solid political stability. Cubans were divided about the new president. “It’s not good news for me,” said Liliam Rodríguez, 33, who works as a tour guide. “He’s looks like he’s against the private sector in recent speeches.” “I don’t see him as a president,” Gerardo Cartalla, 56, a taxi driver. “In the current situation, I’d have liked Raúl to stay on as president. He’s somebody everybody respects.” This article was amended on 19 April 2018 to correct a mistyping of Miguel Díaz-Canel’s name."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/20/nt-says-it-cannot-afford-all-of-juvenile-detention-royal-commissions-reforms","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T05:32:27Z","webTitle":"NT says it cannot afford all of juvenile detention royal commission's reforms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/20/nt-says-it-cannot-afford-all-of-juvenile-detention-royal-commissions-reforms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/20/nt-says-it-cannot-afford-all-of-juvenile-detention-royal-commissions-reforms","fields":{"headline":"NT says it cannot afford all of juvenile detention royal commission's reforms","bodyText":"The Northern Territory government has announced more than $229m in funding to enact the recommendations of the royal commission into abuses in the juvenile detention system but has conceded that it cannot afford to cover all of them. It said the government had looked at what it could afford and repeated calls for federal government assistance in addressing the 227 recommendations handed down last year. On Friday, the NT minister for Territory Families, Dale Wakefield, again acknowledged the royal commission’s finding of “shocking and systemic failures” in the youth justice and protection systems. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “A system which was meant to make the community safer has in fact made more dangerous,” Wakefield said. “Today’s reforms are not just about more money. It is about doing things differently. This is about long-term, systemic changes that will be drivers for a safer community for us all.” The $229m is earmarked to be spent over five years and is on top of current funding. It includes some previously announced funding, such as $71.4m to replace the Darwin and Alice Springs youth detention centres, which the NT government conceded on Friday was not enough. Friday’s announcement pledged new or improved initiatives, including a youth and children’s court in Alice Springs, the introduction of family group conferencing, youth diversion programs and recidivism reduction measures. It also committed $5.4m for an overhaul of the out-of-home care system, which is understood to include improved involvement from Indigenous carers and families, and partnerships with Indigenous organisations. Out-of-home care now costs the government $110m a year, out of a total department budget of $270m. The funding also includes $66.9m to replace the department’s case management and information systems. A new system would ideally link police, child protection and health systems, and provide alerts about domestic violence and other incidents within one or two days. The notoriously dated systems, which are essentially paper-based and without streamlined coordination, have frequently been cited in instances of department failures. In February, the department sent staff to Tennant Creek to investigate the circumstances around the alleged rape of a two-year-old girl. An internal review found that caseworkers did not have comprehensive information, which would probably have led them to make different decisions about the girl’s safety and potentially prevented the alleged rape. The royal commission recommended the establishment of 20 child and family centres across the NT. As part of Friday’s announcement, 17 will be established at a cost of $11.4m, with locations yet to be determined. “We believe that the family and children centres is a way that the federal government can support the Northern Territory, and particularly Territorians in remote communities, to have access to services that other Australians take for granted,” Wakefield said. “They have funded that type of facility before.” The lack of full funding for the recommendations comes amid the NT’s economic woes following the redistribution of GST payments, which the Territory government estimates will amount to a cut of $1.4m over four years. “I think this plan gives the federal government plenty of opportunities to invest alongside the Northern Territory, in particular in the family and children centres,” Wakefield said. “Obviously we are in a difficult budgetary situation. We looked at what we could afford within the Territory budget. We have absolutely made a significant financial commitment to this reform process, through this plan.” The NT government had accepted – either entirely or in principle – all but 10 of the 227 recommendations delivered in March by the royal commission into the protection and detention of children in the NT, which it said were the responsibility of federal or non-government bodies. It is yet to act on non-financial but significant recommendations, including raising the age of criminal responsibility to 12 or banning the detention of children under 14."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/20/sampa-the-great-live-review-an-effortlessly-charismatic-performance","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T06:34:02Z","webTitle":"Sampa the Great live review – an effortlessly charismatic performance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/20/sampa-the-great-live-review-an-effortlessly-charismatic-performance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/20/sampa-the-great-live-review-an-effortlessly-charismatic-performance","fields":{"headline":"Sampa the Great live review – an effortlessly charismatic performance","bodyText":"“How you supposed to be black Down Under?” asks Sampa the Great on Bye River, the simmering seven-minute hymnal at the centre of her stunning mixtape Birds And The BEE9. It’s a question she asks not only of herself, but of her fellow immigrants, the Indigenous artists she collaborates with, and the white Australians who have been, to say the least, less than supportive of the art and welfare of people of colour in this country. The crowd at Sydney’s Metro Theatre, on the first night of Sampa’s Birds and the BEE9 Experience tour, chant that line along with her, white and black and brown faces, and it’s simultaneously a rhetorical question and a genuine enquiry. On stage in the warehouse-like Lair space, Sampa is garlanded with lilies and bird-of-paradise. The smell of nag champa incense hangs in the air; the small band are all in white and iridescent fabrics, and she’s a head shorter than all of them. “Sometimes when we don’t know our story, where we’re from … there’s a piece of us missing and we’ve gotta fill that in,” she says. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Sampa Tembo, 24, knows where she’s from. She came to Sydney via Zambia, Botswana, LA and San Francisco – but it’s in Australia that she crystallised her voice. She’s actually yet to release a debut album proper, but Birds, her second “mixtape”, was deemed close enough that it took out the prestigious Australian Music Prize this year. She has only been in the country four or so years, so it feels both premature and extremely tempting to claim the rise of Sampa the Great as something that could only have happened in Australia. Rather, it happened because she made it happen, and she happened to do that here, and we’re lucky to have any claim on her at all. Her dense, dark flow has as much in common with MF Doom and Kendrick Lamar as Ms Lauryn Hill, who she’s most often compared to. She scrunches her mouth up so the words curl out in a crimped, rhotic drawl over the glimmering arrangement drenched in neo-soul and funk. Her inflections and phrasing are deliciously angular, her consonants crisp and sticky at the edges like honey toast, her voice slipping between crinkled spoken-word tumble and fluttering, breathy soul. The effect of the stage set-up in the Metro is both welcoming and regal. Song titles, subtle animations and stars are projected on the wall beside the stage, adding a theatrical edge, and warm keyboards drift and twinkle between songs, never quite fading away. Her stage presence is unassuming but effortlessly charismatic. She beats her chest a little with a fist as the crowd roars, after a superhuman run of rapid-fire bars that pushes past where most mortals would need a breath; she raises a finger deliberately to point to her skin while talking about wanting to make her little sister feel beautiful. It is just a few days after Beyoncé’s earth-shattering, internet-breaking performance at Coachella, which is being hailed as a watershed in the current moment where blackness is being centred and celebrated more than ever before, and mainstream (white) audiences are becoming incrementally more literate and enthusiastic about black culture, and about art that neither draws on nor speaks to the experience of white people. It’s the year of Kendrick winning the Hottest 100 and a Pulitzer, of Black Panther – and of Sampa being the second non-white artist in a row to take out the AMP, just quietly. She folds in nods to some of the biggest moments in the current wave of hip-hop and R&amp;B. The shadowy Karma the Villain hangs on a refrain of “... with the mask off”, as she encourages the audience to chant the phrase back at her, and the breathy, uneasy flow of Bye River sees her musing: “Token black / One mask fits all but mine is getting / Uncomfortable, uncomfortable.” On Protect Your Queen, one of the songs centred on black womanhood, she tells a lover, and the listener: “If you accept me kink and all, coconut oil / Nine curl cos I can’t be Becky and I don’t wanna be”, using the Beyoncé-coined nickname for white girls with “the good hair”. She shrugs “I don’t need your table, I can sit by myself” on Black Girl Magik and “This my seat and the table’s been set” on Can I Get a Key, as if turning Solange’s radical invitation to dialogue and healing into a statement of defiance and independence. Hip-hop is always in dialogue with itself and its history, but Australian-based rappers sometimes struggle to work out how entitled they are to access and reference that history. And for Australian audiences, particularly white ones, the African diaspora is experienced and filtered almost exclusively through African-American culture, but it doesn’t have to be. As an African-born artist working in Australia, Tembo has taken what she needs from where she finds it, and woven it into something that single-handedly pushes Australian music forward in a small but significant way. After taking a bow, she and the band return to the stage for an encore, playing her The Great Mixtape standout Female to the raucous but largely respectful crowd. Immediately after, Kendrick Lamar booms over the speakers, and everyone stays to dance and yell along: “We gon’ be alright / We gon’ be alright.” • Sampa the Great is touring Australia in April and May"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/21/no-joke-have-chinas-censors-gone-too-far-with-ban-on-humour-app","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T01:36:32Z","webTitle":"No joke: have China's censors gone too far with ban on humour app?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/21/no-joke-have-chinas-censors-gone-too-far-with-ban-on-humour-app","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/21/no-joke-have-chinas-censors-gone-too-far-with-ban-on-humour-app","fields":{"headline":"No joke: have China's censors gone too far with ban on humour app?","bodyText":"There is a not-so-secret club in China. Members find each other in traffic by honking their horn – one long honk, followed by two short ones. Others identify each other by completing nonsensical couplets: “The son of heaven covers the tiger” – to which the correct response is “chicken stew with mushrooms”. They call themselves duanyou after the app Neihan Duanzi, or “implied jokes”, where until recently some 30 million users could watch short videos, comedy sketches and follow dirty jokes and memes. Fans also organise offline meet-ups. At one gathering in Hunan province earlier this month, a group posed in a parking lot with little red flags and a sign describing themselves as the “duanyou coalition”. China’s media regulator on 10 April ordered Neihan Duanzi’s parent company and one of the country’s fastest-growing internet companies, Bytedance, to shut down the app because of its “vulgar” content. It was one of several news apps to be removed from online stores or shuttered this month. The group’s unofficial song, On Earth, a ballad about life’s struggles, has been censored. Cities from Shanghai to Changde in Hunan province have placed restrictions on honking. Authorities have advised news outlets not to report on fan gatherings. The founder and CEO of Toutiao, the news platform where Neihan Duanzi was first hosted, issued a public apology for failing to “promote positive energy and grasp correct guidance of public opinion”. The app’s closure and subsequent restrictions offer more evidence of how China’s censorship is moving beyond politically sensitive topics to seemingly benign content like entertainment and humour. It is also a campaign more likely to cause backlash among the general public, observers say. In a country where topics from human rights to Winnie the Pooh, a nickname for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, are routinely censored, it is the closure of a joke app that has riled citizens most in years. “[The platform] is a channel for people’s emotions ... to have some private space and share their experiences. It’s kind of a utopian place. Here they can share their happiness, their sadness,” said Chen Qin, a researcher who completed her doctorate on Chinese media at Ohio State University. For some Duanzi fans, the app doesn’t just provide an escape from the tedium of daily life but a sense of belonging. Users quip back and forth, referencing inside jokes and phrases only other duanyou would know. The code phrase “the son of heaven covers the tiger” is a saying used by bandits in a popular Chinese novel from the 1950s. “Through [this], a new type of social bond or affinity was built, first only within the cyberspace, then in reality,” Chen said. In real life, duanyou groups get together for dinners, go rafting, hold barbecues, sing karaoke, or just hang out by their cars. Some get involved in local causes, raising money. In a post on a Duanzi forum this week, one user asked other duanyou to drive their cars to his wedding in order to beep and cheer him on. “Neihan Duanzi contains normal people’s happiness ... Duanyou make fun of each other ... but if you meet another offline, he will give you a cigarette. Strangers can have a meal together like old friends,” a journalist wrote on the Chinese tech news site PingWest last year. Now, some duanyou are moving underground. They’ve started chat groups on platforms like Telegram, which can only be used via VPN in China. They complain about the Duanzi ban and talk openly about politics and tightening controls over Chinese society. Others are in private WeChat or QQ groups for duanyou. Duanzi videos are still circulating online. “I’ve been a Neihan Duanzi user for two years and never even thought of putting a sticker on my car. Occasionally I’d honk at a duanyou’s car. But when Duanzi was censored, I felt a certain pain in my heart, like someone had taken my child from me,” one user wrote on 12 April in a Duanzi Telegram group that has more than 2,000 members. China’s new broadcaster, China Media Group, a combination of the country’s state radio and television broadcasters, was inaugurated this week. Duanzi users posted on a state news report of the event, “give Neihan Duanzi back”. Another wrote: “Duanzi has been blocked but duanyou will always be together.” By shutting down Neihan Duanzi, authorities may have targeted a segment of Chinese society for whom this app is especially important. While the app’s appeal is broad, it seems especially popular among those with less education, from China’s less-developed cities. Teng Wei, a cultural studies scholar based in Guangzhou, calls them China’s “new poor”, a group defined not by their income so much as by what they don’t or cannot buy. According to Teng, they are often young people born in rural areas who have relocated to larger cities and who, in between the village and the city, lack a sense of identity outside of virtual spaces like Duanzi. Videos on the app, filmed and uploaded from all over the country, often feature scenarios and skits in China’s poorer second- and third-tier cities. In one popular Duanzi video, a man in an unbuttoned shirt with long hair pulled into a messy pony tail comes across his girlfriend walking with another man, much more smartly dressed. His girlfriend proceeds to break up with him because her new beau, she says, “pays more attention” and has bought her a BMW and an iPhone X. “Being poor no longer means you don’t have property or a job; it simply means you are not consuming,” Teng wrote in a 2016 essay about fans of another video app, Kuaishou, whose following she believes is similar to that of Duanzi. That app was also singled out this month for inappropriate content. By censoring this group, Beijing also risks losing a support base: young people known as “little pink” for their sympathies with China’s ruling Communist party, whose official colour is red. Videos and content on the app are often more nationalistically skewed. “Overall, they seemed to be aligned with the government and now they face this situation,” said Zhou Fengsuo, a Chinese human rights activist who was a leader in China’s 1989 democracy protests and is now based in the US. “This is a pretty common pattern in China where people keep going with their regular life until suddenly one day you are the victim of arbitrary rules.” Observers say it will be difficult to fully disband these communities, who are still looking for an outlet. “Soon another app will come out,” Teng said. “Consumers are always looking for something new.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/21/frydenbergs-neg-challenge-is-like-climbing-everest-with-no-oxygen","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T00:12:36Z","webTitle":"Frydenberg's Neg challenge is like climbing Everest with no oxygen | Katharine Murphy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/21/frydenbergs-neg-challenge-is-like-climbing-everest-with-no-oxygen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/21/frydenbergs-neg-challenge-is-like-climbing-everest-with-no-oxygen","fields":{"headline":"Frydenberg's Neg challenge is like climbing Everest with no oxygen","bodyText":"For folks who aren’t hardcore climate and energy policy tragics, it might be hard to stay on top of the various twists and turns in the debate about the national energy guarantee. This is a good weekend to take stock. If you were watching events on Friday, you’ll know the federal energy minister Josh Frydenberg has persuaded the states and territories to keep going with the Neg, but just hold that thought. To understand all the dimensions of this debate properly, and I think there’s value in laying it all out – we’ll need a brief recap, then we’ll need to look over the horizon to chart where it’s all going. The Neg is supposed to deal with two problems. The policy’s reliability and emissions framework is aimed at ensuring the lights stay on at something like an affordable price for energy users, and emissions decrease in the electricity sector so we have some vague hope of meeting our international climate commitments. • Sign up to receive the latest news in Australian politics every weekday The Neg is entirely a creature of its circumstances. The government isn’t in a position to argue for a carbon price or an emissions trading scheme, or for a continuation of the renewable energy target after 2020 as a rebadged clean energy target – which was an idea put forward by the chief scientist Alan Finkel. Because of the great, persistent, internal unreason that descends within the Coalition whenever the words carbon abatement are uttered, the government has locked itself out of conventional policy approaches, so it had to conjure up something entirely new, and when you are a government trapped in that universe, the policy will reflect the compromises you’ve had to make to get there. So the Neg isn’t perfect. Not even close. Frydenberg is also being shadowed at every turn by Tony Abbott. Abbott, more than any other person, has created the energy mess Australia finds itself in. You’d think his previous miscalculations might trigger a bout of quiet introspection, or even remorse, but no such luck. Our former prime minister is nothing if not relentless, always up for another round of virtue signalling, followed by vandalism. Fortunately, at least in this early point in the proceedings, there is a mild structural check on rampant Abbottism because there are a whole bunch of players – businesses, energy companies, consumers – who are now so worn down by the consequences of 10 years of brain-dead sloganeering and hyper-partisan claptrap that they now just want this problem fixed. Aided by a broad coalition calling for action, Frydenberg has worked assiduously, doing his best within the constraints he faces, determined to deliver the fix. The states and territories, who are partners in this joint venture because any one of them has the power to torpedo the policy because of the way the national electricity market is structured, are trying to manage their serious doubts about the commonwealth plan and remain at the table long enough to see if a deal can be done. So that’s act one of this process. That ended Friday. We are now about to embark on acts two and three – the decisive phase of the Neg. During act two, which will play out between now and August, states and territories will be given more detail about the scheme, and once they have that detail, they will know whether there is a deal to do, or whether there isn’t. Assuming the commonwealth and the states can come to terms, assuming the scheme is not torpedoed at a meeting of the Coag energy council in August (and right now I assume nothing), then we’ll move into act three, which is the Canberra end of proceedings. Frydenberg will have to come back to the Coalition party room to secure sign off on legislation enacting the national emissions reduction target for electricity, and determine a trajectory for how fast that emissions reduction happens. The government will also have to make a decision and get internal sign off about whether energy companies will be able to buy offsets to reduce their emissions, and the treatment of activities that are emissions intensive and trade exposed. These questions will be resolved while there is a rising public clamour about what happens with emissions reduction in the rest of the Australian economy – a new front that Frydenberg really doesn’t want to open given his plan for electricity is not yet settled, and the colleagues are already skittish. So in Coalition terms, Frydenberg faces a challenge comparable to climbing Mount Everest without oxygen, and that’s in normal conditions. That’s assuming the government doesn’t blow itself up between now and the end of the year, which on current indications, looks entirely possible. But persisting with the idea that Frydenberg can put this deal together through a sheer act of will, that he can scale Everest minus his oxygen tank, that’s not the end of it either. He still has to get legislation through the parliament. To get it through he’ll have to ensure any internal dissidents intent on “look at me” mischief making don’t do anything spectacularly unhelpful, like crossing the floor. Then Labor will need to be persuaded to sign up. I think if Frydenberg can push through the various obstacles, the states and the colleagues, federal Labor is more likely to sign on than not, with clearly articulated caveats and conditions. While that’s not yet a certainty, given at least some of Labor’s calculation will depend on the political contest they think they are in at the time the decision has to be made, the alternative is the ALP starting this whole process over from scratch in the event they win the next federal election. I suspect that thought alone would give some in Labor nightmares, as would the thought of starting from scratch when their only viable dancing partner in the parliament is the Greens – a party in the midst of something of an identity crisis, a phenomenon that works against a spirit of compromise. As a price of entry, the Greens would want at a minimum a much higher emissions reduction target, a plan for shutting down coal fired power and structural adjustment assistance for workers, more subsidies for renewables, and significant government intervention in the electricity market including more generation to future-proof the grid once the transport fleet starts rolling over at pace to electric cars. To cut a long story short, we could be back at Groundhog Day, where Labor attempts post-election to implement a climate and energy policy that the Greens insist needs to be made more ambitious, which then prompts opposition leader Peter Dutton to demand repeal. For anyone who has lived through the colossal public policy failure of the past decade, the thought of enduring that zero sum cycle again will be enough to trigger a cold sweat. However this story ultimately ends, this much is clear: it’s going to be a mind-focusing few months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/20/facebook-tech-companies-us-privacy-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T10:00:19Z","webTitle":"Americans want tougher rules for big tech amid privacy scandals, poll finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/20/facebook-tech-companies-us-privacy-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/20/facebook-tech-companies-us-privacy-poll","fields":{"headline":"Americans want tougher rules for big tech amid privacy scandals, poll finds","bodyText":"Americans want major technology companies to be regulated, with legal responsibility for the content they carry on their platforms and harsher punishment for breaches of data privacy, according to a nationally representative survey of 2,500 adults. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the way that technology companies handle our personal data and moderate the content – including fake news, hate speech and terrorist propaganda – on their platforms has been thrown under the microscope. The increased scrutiny appears to have increased the public’s appetite for more stringent regulation of the tech giants, with 83% of people seeking tougher regulations and penalties for breaches of data privacy and 84% believing that technology companies should be legally responsible for the content they carry on their systems. Technology companies are currently protected from legal responsibility for most content thanks to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. About 53% of people feel the tech sector should be regulated by the federal government in the way big banks are. That figure rose to 62% among baby boomers. These results, from the inaugural Tech Media Telecom Pulse Survey, by HarrisX, represent a striking departure from responses to a similar set of questions in November 2017, when just 49% of Americans felt that tech firms needed regulation. “Public opinion last year was largely evenly split on the need to regulate technology companies,” said Dritan Nesho, CEO of HarrisX. “It has now swung in the opposite direction due to a series of scandals around fake news, platform bias, foreign interference and privacy concerns, which have rightly been called the ‘annus horribilis’ of the tech sector.” The survey was conducted right after the Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, delivered many hours of testimony before Congress last week. The poll included a section of questions dedicated to the social network. The results show that Americans don’t believe Facebook is a neutral platform. Sixty-six percent view it as a media company that prioritises some types of content over others, with 55% believing there to be evidence of political bias and censorship in its results – a view that’s more prevalent (70%) among Republicans. In questions comparing Facebook with other companies (Twitter, Google, YouTube, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, LinkedIn and Snapchat), the social network came out badly. Forty-four percent disagreed with the statement “Facebook cares about privacy” while 46% disagreed with the notion that it “protects my personal information”. Twitter scored the second-worst in these categories, with 33% and 30% respectively. When asked whether companies improved users’ mental health, Facebook had the most detractors, with 41% disagreeing with the notion, compared with Twitter’s 32%. Although Facebook has borne the brunt of the scrutiny over the last couple of weeks, 61% of the public believes that other tech CEOs should be summoned before Congress to explain their data privacy and security practices. The Cambridge Analytica scandal was a “perfect storm that caught Facebook in its crosshairs”, said Nesho, “but it is by no means solely a Facebook issue.” It wasn’t all bad for the technology sector. Sixty-three percent of Americans perceive technology to be a “good force”, with 68% perceiving it to have a “positive impact on the world”. However, when they were asked about specific companies, none received majority approval for being “good for democracy”. “The public has a complex relationship with personal technology. Broadly speaking, a majority of Americans perceive technology to be a good force on the world,” said Nesho. “But dig deeper and you find very conflicted views on a series of important social issues.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/19/javier-bardem-defends-woody-allen-i-am-very-shocked-by-this-treatment","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T22:03:28Z","webTitle":"Javier Bardem defends Woody Allen: 'I am very shocked by this treatment'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/19/javier-bardem-defends-woody-allen-i-am-very-shocked-by-this-treatment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/19/javier-bardem-defends-woody-allen-i-am-very-shocked-by-this-treatment","fields":{"headline":"Javier Bardem defends Woody Allen: 'I am very shocked by this treatment'","bodyText":"Javier Bardem has come to the defense of Woody Allen in response to other actors distancing themselves from the film-maker. The Oscar-winning actor, who worked with Allen on 2008’s Vicky Cristina Barcelona, has said in a new interview that he is “absolutely not” ashamed of starring in the film. “If there was evidence that Woody Allen was guilty, then yes, I would have stopped working with him, but I have doubts,” he said in an interview with Paris Match. After resurfaced allegations of sexual abuse made by Allen’s daughter Dylan Farrow, a host of actors have spoken out about working with the film-maker. Stars including Ellen Page, Michael Caine and Greta Gerwig all said they would never work with him again. “I am very shocked by this sudden treatment,” Bardem said. “Judgments in the states of New York and Connecticut found him innocent. The legal situation today is the same as in 2007.” In fact no charges were filed after Farrow accused him of molesting her when she was a child, something that Allen denies. Despite a state’s attorney saying he had “probable cause” to prosecute, Allen was never put on trial, a move intended to spare Dylan Farrow the trauma of a court appearance, the prosecutor said. An op-ed from Dylan Farrow in December, criticizing the hypocrisy of actors for keeping quiet over the alleged abuse from her father, led to more speaking out. “I can only speak for myself and what I’ve come to is this: if I had known then what I know now, I would not have acted in the film,” Gerwig said in a roundtable discussion for the New York Times. “I have not worked for him again, and I will not work for him again.” Allen’s next film, A Rainy Day in New York, is still awaiting release. Two of its stars, Rebecca Hall and Timothée Chalamet, have already donated their salaries to charity. “I want to be worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with the brave artists who are fighting for all the people to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve,” wrote Chalamet in an Instagram post. Bardem’s response arrives after Alec Baldwin also made his defense of the director clear. “Woody Allen was investigated forensically by two states (NY and CT) and no charges were filed,” Baldwin tweeted. “The renunciation of him and his work, no doubt, has some purpose. But it’s unfair and sad to me. I worked w WA 3 times and it was one of the privileges of my career.” Diane Keaton has also continued to support the film-maker. “Woody Allen is my friend and I continue to believe him,” she tweeted in January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/19/leicester-city-southampton-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T23:18:20Z","webTitle":"Stalemate at Leicester leaves Southampton’s hopes hanging by thread","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/19/leicester-city-southampton-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/19/leicester-city-southampton-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Stalemate at Leicester leaves Southampton’s hopes hanging by thread","bodyText":"It was the warmest day of the year but Southampton passed up the opportunity to turn up the temperature on those above them in the relegation scrap. Mark Hughes took some encouragement from the fact he has collected his first point as Southampton manager and ended the club’s run of four successive league defeats, yet this is a time of the season when he needs victories rather than draws to improve Saints’ survival prospects. Against a Leicester side who have badly lost their way, Southampton played with a curious lack of ambition and urgency, summed up by Hughes’s decision to replace one striker with another at a point in the game when the travelling supporters were entitled to think he would throw caution to the wind and chase the win that would have cranked up the pressure on Swansea, in 17th place. Strangely, however, Southampton looked like they were content to settle for the draw that leaves them four points adrift of safety with four matches remaining. Leicester, with nothing to play for, were obliging opponents and the chorus of boos at the final whistle said everything about how this listless performance was viewed by their increasingly disillusioned supporters. Claude Puel, who was sacked as the Southampton manager at the end of last season, has now won only four of his last 17 league matches and there were times here when it was hard to work out what his players were trying to do. All of which added to the feeling Southampton, who play Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday, missed a chance. Asked whether it was a point gained or two dropped, Hughes replied: “We don’t know yet. We’ll have to wait until the end of the season to see if that’s a significant point one way or the other. I think given the fact we haven’t been able to pick up points of any note in recent weeks, it’s a positive. Performance-wise, I don’t think we got anywhere near the level that we showed against Arsenal and Chelsea, but we didn’t get any points out of those games.” Hughes admitted there was “a little bit of apprehension” in Southampton’s play, yet his tactics and substitutions arguably contributed to that situation. There seemed to be no real desire for Southampton to attack with more intent, even in the closing stages, with the decision to replace Shane Long with Charlie Austin a case in point. ‚ÄúIt’s like for like because Shane Long had a huge effort against Chelsea, he was clearly flagging when we took him off,” Hughes said. “It was a little bit of a stick or twist situation, to be perfectly honest. The importance of taking something out of the game shouldn’t be underestimated. But clearly we’re going to get to a point with the games that we havewhere we’re just going to have to throw everything at it. Maybe tonight wasn’t the case for that.” Southampton did have a couple of good chances either side of the interval and both fell to Long. The Republic of Ireland international squandered the first after he was caught in two minds as to whether to shoot or pass and ended up doing neither. His next opportunity ended with Ben Hamer, the Leicester goalkeeper, dashing from his line to make an instinctive save as Long turned sharply to spear a close-range attempt at goal. Pedestrian in possession and devoid of ideas going forward, Leicester were plodding their way through the match. Kelechi Iheanacho placed an early chance wide but Leicester had to wait until the 69th minute, when Jamie Vardy’s first-time volley from Marc Albrighton’s pass was tipped over the bar by Alex McCarthy, for their next decent attempt. It is now five home league games without a win for Leicester. “It’s a pity but the performance was OK,” Puel said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/may/03/ruth-bader-ginsburg-rbg-on-film-legacy","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T10:00:38Z","webTitle":"'A tremendous legacy': capturing the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg on film","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/03/ruth-bader-ginsburg-rbg-on-film-legacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/03/ruth-bader-ginsburg-rbg-on-film-legacy","fields":{"headline":"'A tremendous legacy': capturing the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg on film","bodyText":"A small, fragile-looking woman with “Super Diva” stamped on her sweatshirt is stretched out over an exercise mat in the gym, her face locked in a rictus of concentration as she does 20 push-ups. “She is like a cyborg,” says her personal trainer, keeping watch over his client as she goes on to hold a steely plank then perform a series of bone-rattling squats. “And when I say cyborg, she is like a machine.” At 85, having already survived bouts of colorectal and pancreatic cancer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the proverbial survivor. And she needs to be. There is a very great deal hanging on her continued longevity as the fourth liberal-leaning justice among the nine justices of the US supreme court. As such she provides the last line of defense against the forces of darkness that are never far beneath the surface in American public life. Not least the current incumbent of the White House whom she famously denounced before his election as a “faker” (she later apologized). Should Ginsburg vacate her seat while the faker is still in office, she would give Donald Trump the golden opportunity to lock a conservative majority into the nation’s top court for at least a generation. In the new documentary RBG, directors Betsy West and Julie Cohen seek to answer the mystery of how such a quietly spoken and restrained person not exactly renowned for her effervescence – her children kept a record when they were little of the very rare occasions she was humorous called Mummy Laughs – morphed into a hipster icon likened to fellow-Brooklynite, the late rapper Biggie Smalls. “We were taken by this juxtaposition of this very tiny, soft-spoken 85-year-old grandmother being tough, speaking truth to power and, yes, even doing planks and push-ups. The whole unusualness of that combination is what makes her a star,” Cohen told the Guardian. The film-makers spent the best part of three years following Ginsburg around the country as she gave lectures and attended her beloved opera, as well as conducting interviews in her chambers in the supreme court. It was a daunting prospect at first. “Despite her small stature, Justice Ginsburg is a very intimidating person. We absolutely found it intimidating initially – there isn’t a lot of small talk,” West said. But over time the relationship loosened. At the end of an interview at the court, the directors started playing a clip of Kate McKinnon impersonating Ginsburg on Saturday Night Live. The real life Ginsburg, watching herself being parodied on the small screen, collapsed into a fit of uncontrolled giggling that is quite startling to watch in the movie. The film marks the 25th anniversary of Ginsburg’s nomination to the supreme court on 14 June 1993 and of her confirmation two months later with the astounding backing of 96 senators to three – a display of bipartisan support that seems unthinkable today. One aspect of her career the co-directors were particularly keen to explore, though, was the lesser-known story of her seismic work on women’s rights that consumed her long before she became a member of the highest court. “She would have earned a place in history even had she not become a supreme court justice,” said West. “She changed the law of the land for American women, making sure the US constitution applied to men and women equally – that’s a tremendous legacy.” As the documentary relates, in the 1970s Ginsburg played a leading role as a legal warrior for women’s rights. She was to gender equality what her predecessor on the supreme court bench, Thurgood Marshall, was to race equality in the 1960s. Ginsburg argued six gender equality cases on behalf of the ACLU in front of the supreme court justices – all nine at that time were male, and most of them oblivious to the visceral discrimination endured at that time by women in the workplace. Despite those prevailing prejudices, she turned them round and won five cases out of the six. She did so forever with the same poise and style – politely, respectfully, but always forcefully – that has become her trademark. Ginsburg says in the film that she inherited her composure from her mother. “‘Never in anger,’ my mother told me. That would have been self-defeating. I did see myself as a kind of kindergarten teacher in those days, because the judges didn’t think sex discrimination existed.” But there was also an unmistakable fire in her belly. You can see it most clearly at the point in the movie when the directors get her to recite the famous words she spoke in 1973 when she presented her first oral arguments to the supreme court in Frontiero v Richardson, a case opposing unequal benefits for married women in the air force. “I ask for no favor for my sex,” she said, quoting the abolitionist Sarah Grimké from 1837. “All I ask of our brethren is that they take their feet off our necks.” Ginsburg enunciates each word on camera with the same fearsome focus with which she does her push-ups in the gym. The impact is electric, and the message unmistakable: underestimate me, or my cause, at your peril. For RBG, the issue of rampant sexism was not just a legal challenge, it was personal. She began to train in the law in the 1950s when the profession was considered by most (male) practitioners to be unsuitable for women. She was one of nine women in a class of more than 500 men at Harvard law school, where she was refused entry by the Lamont Library because of her gender. The dean of the school graciously invited all nine female students to dinner, then asked each of them in turn to justify taking a seat that could have been occupied by a man. After graduating from Columbia University in 1959, not a single New York law firm would employ her. She was turned away by partnerships that today she employs to do research for her as a US supreme court justice. “The idea was,” she tells the film-makers, “that men were the breadwinners that counted, and women were pin-money earners. So women woke up and complained.” “Woke up and complained” would be a very good description of Ginsburg’s approach to serving on the country’s highest court over the past quarter century. As the legal and ideological fulcrum of the court has moved to the right over those years, so Ginsburg has become more pronounced in her opposition to the majority’s rulings. An RBG dissent has become a jurisprudential wonder to behold. In 2006 in Ledbetter v Goodyear, a case over unequal pay for women doing exactly the same work as their male colleagues, she challenged Congress to change the law and it duly did, drafting the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act that became the first bill to be signed by President Obama. When in 2013 the conservative justices tore a bloody hole in the Voting Rights Act that for almost half a century had protected African Americans from racist disenfranchisement, she issued another withering dissent. She took the chief justice, John Roberts Jr’s, argument in Shelby v Holder that America had “changed”, no longer requiring exceptional means to combat racism, and sent the five conservative justices who had voted in the majority straight back to kindergarten. She said: “This court’s decision is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.” Though they began filming RBG before the explosion of the #MeToo and Time’s Up movement, the film-makers see their work as forming part of a wave of recognition of the extraordinary contributions made by exceptional women. “There’s a long history in this country of women’s stories being undertold, but now there’s understanding that we’ve only been paying serious attention to half of the population,” Cohen said. Both directors feel privileged to have spent time with Ginsburg, especially in the gym filming her push-ups. “That was reassuring, certainly,” West said. “I was relieved to see that she has an energy level beyond anything I’ve seen in a human being – and that includes women decades younger than she is.” RBG is out in the US on 4 May with a UK date yet to be announced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/19/windrush-albert-thompson-cancer-treatment-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T19:44:54Z","webTitle":"Windrush scandal: Albert Thompson still in dark about cancer treatment despite May's promise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/19/windrush-albert-thompson-cancer-treatment-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/19/windrush-albert-thompson-cancer-treatment-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"Windrush scandal: Albert Thompson still in dark about cancer treatment despite May's promise","bodyText":"Albert Thompson, the Londoner whose case has come to epitomise the Windrush scandal, has spoken of his anguish as he remains uncertain about whether he is to get radiotherapy for his cancer a day after he heard Theresa May announce on television that he would “be receiving the treatment he needs”. As the fallout from the scandal continued to emerge, Thompson told the Guardian he was distressed to have no clarity, and upset that he had had no apology from the Royal Marsden hospital for the ongoing interruption to his cancer treatment. Thompson (not his real name) received a brief call on Wednesday night from a consultant at the Royal Marsden telling him that he would receive an appointment letter in “two or three weeks’ time,” and asking him in to come in so he could have some blood tests. He was despondent about the cursory nature of the contact. “He didn’t mention anything about radiotherapy,” Thompson said, noting that the hospital did not appear to be treating his case as particularly urgent. He remains concerned that despite the commitment from May that he was to receive treatment, the hospital seemed in no hurry to reschedule the 12-week series of daily radiotherapy sessions he was due to start last November, before he was told that he was not eligible for free treatment without proof that he was in the UK legally. The call he had from the hospital is only the second contact he has had from his cancer specialist since he was told he needed to pay £54,000 if he wanted to go ahead with treatment (a sum he was, naturally, unable to raise). The phone conversation lasted three or four minutes, he thinks, and he had no chance to ask questions about what was going to happen next, or for professional reassurance about his fears about his health. The earlier call was equally brief, he said. His unease over his suspended treatment came as the scale of the Windrush scandal continued to grow, as a flood of new cases emerged of lives ruined by the brutal application of the prime minister’s “hostile environment” policy towards a group of people who have lived in the UK legally for over half a century. The Home Office’s new Windrush hotline has had 232 calls since it was launched on Monday. Thompson, 63, moved to London as a teenager 44 years ago to join his mother, who was here working as a nurse. Despite tax and national insurance records going back decades, he is still struggling to prove that he has the right to be here. He has never had a British passport, was not aware he needed one, and assumed he was British until suspicion over his immigration status led to him being evicted from his council-owned accommodation last year. Even though his case exemplifies the difficulties experienced by this cohort of people, a technicality means that Thompson does not qualify as a Windrush person, eligible for assistance under the government’s new schemes announced this week, as Theresa May pointed out as she responded to questions about him in the Commons on Wednesday. He arrived a few months after the 1973 Immigration Act was implemented. Thompson’s lawyer Jeremy Bloom described his client’s treatment as “grossly unfair”. “Albert has still not received any clear communication, either verbally or in writing, that sets out exactly what treatment he can expect to receive and when. His clinicians first discussed the possibility of radiotherapy treatment with Albert in November 2016. He was told that it would start in November 2017. Nothing that the hospital have said since the PM’s announcement has clarified whether or when he will be receiving the radiotherapy treatment that he requires,” Bloom, of Duncan Lewis solicitors, said. “It is grossly unfair that someone in Albert’s position, who can demonstrate that he has been resident in the UK for 44 years, should have to demonstrate that he has Indefinite Leave to Remain before the hospital can provide him with treatment that they have previously decided is necessary.” Thompson was trying to be upbeat: “The prime minister said I would get treatment, so I presume it is true, but I won’t believe it until I get the go-ahead for the treatment,” he said. He was enraged at the revelation that the Home Office had destroyed Windrush landing papers in 2010, and suspected that the disappearance of these records might have complicated his attempts to get evidence of his long stay in the UK. He said he had repeatedly visited the Home Office in an attempt to sort out his difficulties. “They can’t find any trace of me at all. That’s not my fault – they need to sort that out,” he said. A spokesperson for the Royal Marsden hospital said: “Mr Thompson’s cancer specialist is arranging for Mr Thompson to come into the clinic for the next stage of his NHS treatment.” The Commonwealth heads of government meeting was entirely overshadowed by the unfolding scandal. In a joint statement, the high commissioners for Barbados and St Kitts and Nevis, the primary advocates for the Caribbean on this matter, said that the home secretary Amber Rudd had indicated “acute awareness of the need for urgency” in a meeting with the Caribbean leaders, and hoped the issue could be resolved. Keith Mitchell, the prime minister of Grenada, was more pessimistic. He said the use of the phrase “hostile environment” with regard to immigrants “doesn’t feel good”. “I think we have been making the point that Britain, being our former colonial masters, have not necessarily treated us in the postcolonial period in the way we expected,” he told the BBC. Many Windrush people contacted the Guardian to tell their stories, including an 89-year-old ex-bus conductor who described how in 2017 he went on holiday to Grenada (a country he left in 1957), and was told he could not return to the UK, where he had lived for 60 years because he had no proof of his right to reside. He is still trying to untangle his immigration problems. “When the Windrush scandal broke, I couldn’t believe what I was reading and hearing. I thought I was an unusual case,” he said. Others told disturbing stories of how they had lost jobs and homes and been asked to pay for hospital treatment as a result of their difficulties persuading officials that they were not in the UK illegally. Meanwhile, immigration case workers voiced profound concern about the Home Office’s new Windrush hotline, which is manned by untrained call processors, and which requires individuals to hand over all their personal details before they can get any advice. Gail Lyle, manager of the Citizens Advice immigration service in Bolton, with 15 years of immigration casework experience, tried calling the helpline on behalf of a client who came to the UK from Barbados aged 10, in 1965, and who was recently suspended from his job because he had no papers. She said he was nervous about giving all his personal details to the service without clear reassurances that if he was not found to have legal status here, for whatever technical reason, his details would not then be sent to the UKBA for removal purposes. The Home Office needed to understand that “our clients are out of the blue losing their homes and being told they can no longer work, therefore they are a bit reluctant to give all their personal details to the department that’s doing this”, Lyle said. Case workers from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants were also concerned about the hotline, and fact that it was not possible for applicants to get discreet, anonymous advice. “The helpline doesn’t work, doesn’t show any sensitivity or knowledge,” Satbir Singh, CEO of the charity, said. “The JCWI caseworker asked the person manning the phones: ‘How does somebody from the Windrush generation get their status regularised?’ The helpline worker replied: ‘Just apply as normal.’ The caseworker then asked, ‘What does somebody need to apply?’ The response was: ‘Go to the website. It’s got more information than I have,’” Singh said. The Home Office said: “Those who call our helpline will not have their details passed on for enforcement activity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/19/russia-fake-news-salisbury-poisoning-twitter-bots-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T21:30:04Z","webTitle":"Russia spread fake news via Twitter bots after Salisbury poisoning – analysis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/19/russia-fake-news-salisbury-poisoning-twitter-bots-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/19/russia-fake-news-salisbury-poisoning-twitter-bots-uk","fields":{"headline":"Russia spread fake news via Twitter bots after Salisbury poisoning – analysis","bodyText":"Russia used trolls and bots to unleash disinformation on to social media in the wake of the Salisbury poisoning, according to fresh Whitehall analysis. Government sources said experts had uncovered an increase of up to 4,000% in the spread of propaganda from Russia-based accounts since the attack,– many of which were identifiable as automated bots. Theresa May highlighted the cyber-threat from Russia in her Mansion House speech earlier this year, telling the Kremlin: “I have a very simple message for Russia. We know what you are doing. And you will not succeed.” But civil servants identified a sharp increase in the flow of fake news after the Salisbury poisoning, which continued in the runup to the airstrikes on Syria. One account, @Ian56789, was sending 100 posts a day during a 12-day period from 7 April, and reached 23 million users, before the account was suspended. It focused on claims that the chemical weapons attack on Douma had been falsified, using the hashtag #falseflag. Another account, @Partisangirl, reached 61 million users with 2,300 posts over the same 12-day period. Experts say that accounts can be amplified by automated means. The prime minister discussed the matter at a security briefing with fellow Commonwealth leaders Malcolm Turnbull, Jacinda Ardern and Justin Trudeau earlier this week. They were briefed by experts from GCHQ and the National Cyber Security Centre about the security situation in the aftermath of the Syrian airstrikes. May said afterwards: “Russia is using cyber as part of a wider effort to undermine the international system. This disinformation campaign is not just aimed at social media and the UK – it is intended to undermine the actual institutions and processes of the rules-based system, such as the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons. We must do all we can at every turn to challenge this.” The prime minister claimed that this particular fake-news campaign had failed, because she had managed to convince Britain’s EU allies, the G7 and Nato that there was “no other plausible explanation than Russia is to blame” for the nerve-agent attack on former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for “a shift from the rhetoric of endless confrontation with Russia”, believing that it “could also help lower the temperature and make a UN consensus for multilateral action to end Syria’s agony more likely”. • This article was amended on 27 April 2018 to replace the word “bot” with “account” in relation to @Ian56789 and @Partisangirl."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/19/the-guardian-view-on-stephen-lawrence-we-owe-his-parents-better","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T17:40:21Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Stephen Lawrence: we owe his parents better | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/19/the-guardian-view-on-stephen-lawrence-we-owe-his-parents-better","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/19/the-guardian-view-on-stephen-lawrence-we-owe-his-parents-better","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Stephen Lawrence: we owe his parents better","bodyText":"It is 25 years since a tragedy and crime evolved into a national scandal. Two of the five original suspects in the racist murder of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence were jailed almost two decades later, following advances in forensic science, but Scotland Yard says it has no further leads. The time it took to secure those convictions, and the fact that some of his killers remain free, is directly related to the second outrage that followed Stephen’s murder: the appalling failure of police to bring those responsible to account, and their shocking treatment of his family and his friend Duwayne Brooks, with him that terrible night, which extended even to spying on them. Only the extraordinary determination of Stephen’s parents, Doreen and Neville, confronted the wider public with the reality of racism both on the streets and within the state, and brought to light officers’ bias, sheer incompetence and alleged links to criminals. (The Guardian today reports fresh claims about those connections.) In 1999, the resulting Macpherson report exposed the institutional racism of police and forced a broader reckoning. The powerful BBC documentary series Stephen: the Murder that Changed a Nation captures these events in full. But it also shows how limited and slow progress has been. Lady Lawrence has repeatedly warned that racism still blights Britain, with discrimination persisting not only in the justice system but also education, housing and employment. This week the family’s solicitor, Imran Khan, revealed their shock on hearing an officer who had won their confidence dismiss the notion that the Metropolitan police as a whole was racist as “utter rubbish” and call Lady Lawrence ungrateful. “You cannot help but think that the improvements we so wanted to see were only skin deep,” Mr Khan wrote. Racism is not about the behaviour of an individual but structures, he noted: the institutions and society that frame, shape and respond to it. Discussing how the 50-year-old “rivers of blood” speech by Enoch Powell – admired by members of the gang that killed Stephen – legitimised physical attacks, he added: “It is politicians who set the parameters of how society behaves. It immediately filtered down.” The Macpherson report initially made public figures more careful in addressing race, and compelled institutions to face their shortcomings. Leaders had to decide whether they would tackle the worst instincts of society head-on, tolerate them as inevitable – or pander to them. As home secretary, Theresa May in some regards took up that challenge and showed a courage that predecessors lacked: calling police “too white”, criticising their use of stop and search, and meeting with the relatives of people who had died in custody. But on immigration, political rhetoric has since turned for the worse. And immigration is inextricably connected to race relations; the rise in hate crimes after the Brexit vote hit not only European migrants but also British-born black and Asian citizens. The prime minister has failed this test. Her cynical creation of a “hostile environment” has fuelled divisions. Outsourcing border policing to untrained individuals such as landlords has predictable effects. The treatment of the Windrush generation has exposed that, but even people born here feel the impact. Some of those legally obliged to make checks see the easiest way to determine origins as a foreign accent or a non-white face – and perhaps the easiest course as simply saying no. Discrimination has been validated, even encouraged. The progress forced by the Lawrence family is real, and we should thank them. But it never went far enough, and in some regards at least we are sliding backwards."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/20/nfl-2018-season-best-games-to-watch","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T08:00:17Z","webTitle":"NFL 2018 schedule: the 17 must-watch games of the upcoming season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/20/nfl-2018-season-best-games-to-watch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/20/nfl-2018-season-best-games-to-watch","fields":{"headline":"NFL 2018 schedule: the 17 must-watch games of the upcoming season","bodyText":"Sure, Sundays have long been devoid of football games, but the NFL is omnipresent. Ever since the Philadelphia Eagles shocked the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII, the machine has churned on. Free agency? You don’t even have to wait for the official start now, with the legal tampering period paving the way for reporters to break news of impending moves. The NFL draft? That, too, is covered ad nauseam. Every college athlete is dissected, magnified and laid bare for the world to see. The draft doesn’t even arrive until next weekend, but the league whetted the appetites of its football-starved fans with the official release of the 2018 schedule on Thursday. The 17-week slate is chock-full of intriguing storylines and matchups, and that’s before the draft adds gasoline to the fire. Here are our favorite games, week-by-week: Week 1 Atlanta Falcons at Philadelphia Eagles (Thursday, 8.20pm ET) The Eagles will begin their Super Bowl title defense, but there will be a different man under center. Carson Wentz will resume his role as starting QB after an MVP-caliber campaign that was cut short by a catastrophic knee injury (torn ACL, LCL). How will Wentz, a QB who loves to use his legs, respond? If he struggles out of the gate, the Philadelphia faithful will bang the drums for Nick Foles, fresh off his Super Bowl-winning performance. The Eagles ran roughshod over the postseason competition with Foles at the helm. Can they replicate their success? The Falcons are coming off a divisional round loss (also in South Philly) and figure to present an early test. Week 2 Oakland Raiders at Denver Broncos (Sunday, 4.25pm ET) Welcome back, Jon Gruden. The former and once-again coach of the Raiders will resume his rivalry with the Broncos after 17 seasons away from the organization. Gruden last coached the Raiders in 2001, and the season after, he was manning the sideline for Tampa Bay when the Buccaneers beat his former squad in Super Bowl XXXVII. He’s been away from coaching since he was fired by the Bucs following the 2008 season, but he stayed close to the game as an analyst for ESPN’s Monday Night Football. It’s also an early-season look at Case Keenum, who shocked with his play in Minnesota, as the leader of the Broncos. Week 3 San Francisco 49ers at Kansas City Chiefs (Sunday, 1pm ET) Two young guns square off: Jimmy Garoppolo and Patrick Mahomes. Garoppolo set the league on fire after he was acquired mid-season from the Patriots. Did Jimmy G catch lightning in a bottle, or is he simply that good? There’s similar intrigue surrounding Mahomes in KK. The Chiefs drafted him 10th overall, and he showed off a rocket arm that’s must-see TV in a Week 17 win. The Chiefs traded Alex Smith to Washington, and now, it’s Mahomes’ team. Week 4 Minnesota Vikings at Los Angeles Rams (Thursday, 8.20pm ET) Two NFC playoff squads that both ostensibly improved in the offseason. The Vikes picked up Kirk Cousins, and the Rams ... well, whom didn’t the Rams add? Los Angeles swung trades for All-Pro cornerback Marcus Peters and speedy playmaking receiver Brandin Cooks. They also signed Aqib Talib, and now boast perhaps the best cornerback duo in the league. The Rams plucked Ndamukong Suh in free agency, and along with Aaron Donald, it figures to be next-to-impossible to run against this squad. Week 5 Washington at New Orleans Saints (Monday, 8.15pm ET) The Saints seemed headed to the NFC championship game until then-Vikes QB Case Keenum somehow found Stefon Diggs in the closing seconds of their wild playoff game. The core of the Saints returns, and another run appears in the cards. Washington played well at times in 2017, and ho-hum at others before sputtering to the finish line. Now Kirk Cousins is gone, and Alex Smith is in. Under the bright lights, this will be the first look for many at the team’s new-look offense. Week 6 Philadelphia Eagles at New York Giants (Thursday, 8.20pm ET) The Eagles and Giants renew their rivalry, but this time, Philly can boast a Lombardi trophy. The Giants were abysmal in 2017, one season after they made the playoffs, and a shakeup ensued. Gone are coach Ben McAdoo and GM Jerry Reese, replaced by Pat Shurmur and Dave Gettleman. New York holds the draft’s No2 selection, and in light of Eli Manning’s repeated struggles, a QB pick seems certain. Manning figures to start the season, but by Week 6, the heir apparent could be in the mix. Week 7 Houston Texans at Jacksonville Jaguars (Sunday, 1pm ET) The Texans were humming along until DeShaun Watson was lost for the season with a knee injury. Their AFC South rivals, of course, prospered all the way to the AFC title game. Even though the Texans finished 4-12, they should be much-improved with Watson back in the fold and another offseason for him to build rapport with DeAndre Hopkins. Usually an afterthought, this contest could prove pivotal in the divisional race. Week 8 Green Bay Packers at Los Angeles Rams (Sunday, 4.25pm ET) Aaron Rodgers no longer has Jordy Nelson in tow, but Jimmy Graham’s addition should make the Packers even more formidable in the red zone. The All-Pro QB broke his collarbone last season, and with it, the Packers’ playoff hopes disappeared. The Packers should once again contend with Rodgers healthy, but they face a Rams’ defense that could be the best in the NFL (along with a high-powered offense led by Jared Goff). Week 9 Green Bay Packers at New England Patriots (Sunday, 8.20pm ET) Another imposing opponent for the Pack, and this time, it’s the Patriots in prime time. Rodgers and Tom Brady have somehow faced off only once before, a 2014 matchup that the Packers won. The Patriots have reached the Super Bowl three times in the past four seasons, and there’s no reason to believe they won’t be powering their way to another one. The two best quarterbacks in the NFL and perhaps the two greatest ever, period? Yeah, circle this one on the calendar. Week 10 Carolina Panthers at Pittsburgh Steelers (Thursday, 8.20pm ET) Cam Newton v Ben Roethlisberger and an interconference game between 2017 playoff squads. When the teams faced off in 2014, Big Ben led the Steelers to a 37-19 victory and Cam Newton was forced to leave the game with an injury. Roethlisberger and Newton remain among the ranks of the NFL’s elite, and they should be shooting for the playoffs by this juncture. Both clubs boast physical defenses, and Julius Peppers is back for another run. Week 11 Pittsburgh Steelers at Jacksonville Jaguars (Sunday, 8.20pm ET) A rematch of their divisional round playoff game which the Jags won with punishing hits and impressive play from Blake Bortles. By Week 11, we’ll know if Bortles’ playoff run was simply a matter of the former No3 overall pick catching fire at the right time, or if he’s turned the corner. And after the Jags’ playoff victory, the Steelers surely are licking their chops for revenge. Week 12 Atlanta Falcons at New Orleans Saints (Thursday, 8.20pm ET) Both NFC South rivals reached the postseason in 2017, and this Thanksgiving Day game could separate the squads in another tight race. They split their meetings last season, and both clubs were knocked out in the divisional round. Matt Ryan and Drew Brees, plenty familiar with each other at this point, lock horns in another game that’s likely to have playoff implications. Week 13 San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks (Thursday, 8.20pm ET) If Jimmy Garoppolo can continue his winning ways deep into the season, this divisional game could shape up as a key one. The Seahawks narrowly missed the postseason with a 9-7 record, the first time they haven’t played playoff football since 2011. The Legion of Boom is now dismantled. Is their playoff window closing too? Richard Sherman is now wearing red and gold, and this will be the loquacious corner’s first game against his former squad. Week 14 Pittsburgh Steelers at Oakland Raiders (Sunday, 8.20pm ET) Gruden returns to the Raiders-Steelers rivalry, which features so many classic games. Who could forget the Immaculate Reception? The teams haven’t played each other since 2015, when the Steelers topped the Raiders, 38-35. Since then, much has changed. Derek Carr was excellent in 2016, but fell off last season. He’ll be looking to rebound under the guidance of Gruden, a noted QB tutor. Week 15 Philadelphia Eagles at Los Angeles Rams (Sunday, 8.20pm ET) A late-season, prime-time contest between two Super Bowl favorites. The Eagles bested the Rams in a Week 14 thriller last season, but it’s also the game where Carson Wentz went down, and Nick Foles began his improbable march to the Super Bowl. This time, Wentz will have to contend with Marcus Peters and Aqib Talib on the outside, and Brandin Cooks will have another crack at the squad he faced in the Super Bowl as a member of the Pats. He was forced to leave the championship game in the second quarter – and didn’t return – after absorbing a massive hit from Malcolm Jenkins. Week 16 Pittsburgh Steelers at New Orleans Saints (Sunday, 4:25pm ET) Ben Roethlisberger and Drew Brees haven’t met since 2014, when the Saints topped the Steelers, 35-32. Big Ben passed for 435 yards and the Steelers rallied with 19 points in the fourth quarter, but they came up short against Brees’ five touchdowns. With both future hall of famers advancing in age, this could be the last time they square off. Unless, of course, both clubs reach the Super Bowl. Week 17 Los Angeles Chargers at Denver Broncos (Sunday, 4.25pm ET) The Bolts are steadily improving, and they’re looking to qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 2013, when the Broncos knocked them out in the divisional round. Joey Bosa is a force to be reckoned with, and Philip Rivers remains a threat at QB. The Broncos, of course, fell flat in 2017 with just five wins. The AFC West is now wide open, and this game could decide the fate of each squad."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/apr/24/uk-universities-erosion-integrity-bologna-statement","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T06:00:12Z","webTitle":"In UK universities there is a daily erosion of integrity | Stefan Collini","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/24/uk-universities-erosion-integrity-bologna-statement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/apr/24/uk-universities-erosion-integrity-bologna-statement","fields":{"headline":"In UK universities there is a daily erosion of integrity","bodyText":"In 1988, to mark the 900th anniversary of the founding of the University of Bologna, Europe’s oldest university, 388 rectors and heads of universities drew up the Magna Charta Universitatum. This was a brief general declaration of the nature of universities and their purpose. The first principle was: “The university is an autonomous institution at the heart of societies differently organised because of geography and historical heritage”. The second fundamental principle was: “Freedom in research and training is the fundamental principle of university life, and governments and universities … must ensure respect for this fundamental requirement.” The Bologna statement was an affirmation of an ideal transcending national frontiers. Its principles were reaffirmed in a 1999 document establishing the European Higher Education Area, signed by the education ministers of 29 European countries, including the UK. Viewed from the everyday experience of a British university two decades later, these principles can ring hollow. “An autonomous institution”? Barely a month goes by without a new diktat issuing from Whitehall and its satellite agencies. Governance is as constrained as policy. One recognised expression of autonomy is for academic staff to have a say in who is appointed to the roles of deans, pro-vice-chancellors, and vice-chancellors. In British universities – unlike the majority of their European counterparts – that doesn’t happen. Another institutional expression of autonomy would be a senate that had effective control of academic and intellectual policy, but that body has been bypassed or abolished in nearly all UK universities. “Freedom in research”? Tell that to the colleague compelled by their research excellence framework manager to focus on a particular line of inquiry. Or tell it to the heads of department obliged to enforce the targets set by the pro-vice-chancellor (research) for the amount of money to be brought in by each member of staff through external grants. The mantras “accountability” and “performance management” mask the disturbing extent of institutional bullying in so many British universities. It has long been recognised in most university systems that academic freedom and academic tenure are two faces of the same coin, with appropriate legal protections to match. In Britain, however, tenure was abolished by the Tories’ Education Act of 1988. But academics still have de facto tenure, don’t they? Tell that to those who are made redundant as a result of the latest piece of managerialist restructuring. In Britain we are used to hearing a lot of sub-Burkean blather about how written constitutions are only needed by those countries that don’t have our practical wisdom and good judgment. But the truth is that genuine academic freedom in British universities is in a parlous condition. Not because uniformed commissars are frog-marching outspoken academics off to jail (not that there are that many outspoken academics in the first place). It is more a matter of the daily erosion of intellectual integrity, the relentless commodification of scholarly values, and the tightening grip of managerialist autocracy. And no one can seriously believe that any of this will be improved by leaving the EU and submitting to the unregulated embrace of global capitalism in its most buccaneering and profit-hungry form. Anyone tempted to dismiss these points as the alarmism of disappointed idealists or other malcontents should read the sober and detailed survey of academic freedom across Europe by Terence Karran and Lucy Mallinson. When measured against a range of standard criteria, including legal safeguards and de facto practices, the UK came bottom of the 28 member states of the EU. Similarly, the definitive text book The Law of Higher Education declares that “in terms of the health of academic freedom, the UK is clearly ‘the sick man of Europe’”. So they may soon have to rewrite the Magna Charta Universitatum. “The university is an autonomous institution (though not, in practice, in the UK …).” “Freedom in research and training is the fundamental principle of university life (though, funnily enough, not in the UK …).”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/radical-conservation/2018/apr/23/worlds-newest-great-ape-threatened-by-chinese-dam","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T07:13:05Z","webTitle":"World’s newest great ape threatened by Chinese dam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2018/apr/23/worlds-newest-great-ape-threatened-by-chinese-dam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/radical-conservation/2018/apr/23/worlds-newest-great-ape-threatened-by-chinese-dam","fields":{"headline":"World’s newest great ape threatened by Chinese dam","bodyText":"Last November scientists made a jaw-dropping announcement: they’d discovered a new great ape hiding in plain sight, only the eighth inhabiting our planet. The Tapanuli orangutan survives in northern Sumatra and it is already the most endangered great ape in the world; researchers estimate less than 800 individuals survive. But the discovery hasn’t stopped a Chinese state-run company, Sinohydro, from moving ahead with clearing forest for a large dam project smack in the middle of the orangutan population. According to several orangutan experts, Sinohyrdo’s dam represents an immediate and existential threat to the Tapanuli orangutan. “Building the dam means chopping the orangutan population in half,” Erik Meijaard, the director of Borneo Futures and one of the experts to describe Pongo tapanuliensis, said. “You end up with two smaller populations, and these will have much reduced chances of survival, because a small population is more likely to go extinct than a large one.” Meijaard added, “with only 800 individuals of this species remaining, the hydrodam will significantly increase the likelihood of extinction.” Planned for the lowlands of the Batang Toru ecosystem in the North Sumatra province, the dam will hit the highest density of Tapanuli orangutans left. Researchers say the 510 megawatt dam will directly impact around 10-20% of the population, but perhaps even worse it will sever the eastern and western population, making it impossible for them to reconnect. “The impact will not just be the destruction of the habitat where they want to build the dam and roads, tunnel, electricity lines, but it will cause the extinction of two of the three sub-populations, and in addition create access and destroy the most important habitat of the only viable population left,” said Gabriella Fredriksson, a scientist with the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme and another co-author on the paper describing the new species. Greater access to the orangutans – due to new roads and cleared habitat – will likely lead to a spike in hunting orangutans and orangutans perishing in human-wildlife conflict. With only 800 left, any loss of animals is gravely problematic. According to the conservationists, Sinohydro’s environmental management plan makes no reference to the orangutans (though the environmental impact assessment does). Despite this fact, the Indonesian government approved Sinohydro’s Batang Toru dam. “The Indonesian government needs to respect its own laws,” Meijaard said. “Orangutans are protected species. The Indonesian law clearly prohibits any actions that harm a protected species or its nests. It is obvious that the hydrodam is harming a protected species, so why does the government allow this?” In November – when the announcement of the new species hit newsstands across the world – the government signaled it would make the new ape a priority. Wiratno, director general of Natural Resources and Conservation in the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, told the media that a government team would be sent to the region to make sure the orangutans were protected. “We will conduct further examination concerning the crisis of the Tapanuli orangutans. I am sure that they will be conserved,” Wiratno said last year. In the meantime, however, forest clearing is going on. Wiratno and other government officials did not respond to requests to comment on the dam. The dam project has also proven controversial with some local people, a protest last year ended violently. Requests for comment from Sinohydro have gone unanswered. “Companies that are seeking to be leaders in this industry must uphold high environmental, ecological and social standards. It is irresponsible and reckless to undertake a project that would destroy the habitat of a critically endangered species,” Stephanie Jensen-Cormier, China program director at International Rivers, said. Serge Wich, another co-author and a professor at Liverpool John Moores University, said the government should drop the hydropower plant and instead focus on a massive geothermal project north of the vulnerable orangutan population. The plant has the potential to be expanded to reach one gigawatt. Fredriksson says Northern Sumatra “has a surplus of energy now.” Of course, stopping the dam won’t ensure the survival of the Tapanuli orangutans. The species remains gravely imperiled by hunting, conflict with locals and habitat loss. However, if the dam goes ahead the species is almost sure to be slowly strangled. “First of all, we need to ensure that the eastern and western populations in Batang Toru remain fully protected, that is zero habitat loss and zero killing,” said Fredriksson. “We also need to ensure that the eastern and western block remain connected. Once the Batang Toru populations are safe and secure, reintroduction of the species into its historic range can be considered.” Conservationists believe the last 800 Tapanuli orangutans are likely the last stand of a species that once spanned all of southern Sumatra – and may have even inhabited Java. This opens up the possibility that the species could be reintroduced to well-protected forests in the south – but first it has to be safeguarded from obliteration. “The discovery [of the Tapanuli orangutan] showed that there is still a lot not known about the differences between populations in our nearest relatives and that studying such differences can even lead to a new species being described. In this case it was the first newly described great ape species since 1929,” said Wich, referencing the discovery of the bonobo in Africa. Sumatra’s megafauna is undergoing a wholesale collapse due to the usual suspects of hunting, snaring, poaching and habitat loss – especially as the palm oil and pulp and paper industries have steamrolled over the island leading to one of the highest deforestation records on the planet. The Sumatran rhino is nearly extinct with some 30-100 individuals left. The Sumatran tiger, the Sumatran elephant and the other orangutan species on the island – the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii) – are all today listed as critically endangered. These critically endangered “Sumatran Five” – rhinos, elephants, tigers and two orangutans – represent a failure of the global and local community to balance conservation with development. And to value life on planet Earth. “If Pongo tapanuliensis disappears it wipes out a significant chunk of unique Indonesian evolutionary history, like the extinction of Java and Bali tiger,” Meijaard said. It would also be the first extinction of a great ape – our closest relatives – in millennia. One has to ask: is that worth 510 megawatts?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/21/kathrine-switzer-boston-london-marathon-gender-equality","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T18:41:11Z","webTitle":"Woman who blazed a trail for equality in marathons hits London’s starting line","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/21/kathrine-switzer-boston-london-marathon-gender-equality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/21/kathrine-switzer-boston-london-marathon-gender-equality","fields":{"headline":"Woman who blazed a trail for equality in marathons hits London’s starting line","bodyText":"There are many differences between Sunday’s London marathon and the one run in Boston, Massachusetts last Monday, not least the weather. While Boston’s runners struggled in wintry conditions, London’s race is predicted to be the hottest since the event began in 1981. Hopes that the Kenyan favourite, Eliud Kipchoge, could break the world record if he wins a third London marathon now look a little on the optimistic side. But perhaps the most symbolic difference between the two races is also the most subtle. There was no runner wearing No 261 at Boston on Monday. The reason? Ask the person wearing that number at London. Kathrine Switzer, 71, may not be a name familiar to the wider UK public, but among the running community she is considered marathon royalty. For it was Switzer who in 1967 became the first woman to run Boston as a registered entrant. It seems extraordinary today, but 50 years ago women were not allowed to compete in the world’s oldest annual marathon. True, some had run the race unofficially before, but Switzer’s participation was to change everything, even if she did not realise its significance when, wearing an official bib, No 261, she lined up surrounded by hundreds of men for the start of the race. “I had no intention of making history that day,” she said. “I was a kid who wanted to run. I signed up to the race. I signed my name K Switzer – I’d done it since I was 12 – and they thought I was a guy. I wasn’t trying to defraud them but my coach insisted that I officially sign up. He said: ‘You don’t mess around with Boston, you don’t just jump in the race.’ Other women had run marathons, and even one at Boston the year before, but not officially. We checked the rule book. Nothing in the rule book about it being for men only. It was only a tradition. They just assumed a woman couldn’t or wouldn’t want to run. Even on the entry form there was nothing about gender.” What happened next has entered the annals of marathon history. Four miles into the race, an official, Jock Semple, attempted to grab Switzer, yelling, “get the hell out of my race and give me those numbers”. Switzer remembers the moment graphically. “My coach was screaming at him, saying ‘She’s OK, leave her alone, I’ve trained her’, but he [Semple] was tired, and he was a man of his time. He didn’t think women should be there.” Switzer’s boyfriend Tom Miller, a 17-stone ex-All American football player, who was also running the race, bodychecked Semple, knocking him into the air, a moment caught in photographs that went around the world. Switzer went on to finish in 4 hours 20 minutes, almost an hour after the first unregistered woman to finish, Bobbi Gibb. Official retribution was swift. “In the end, after I’d finished the race, I was disqualified and expelled from the athletics federation because I had run with men, because I had run more than a mile and a half and because I had fraudulently entered the race, which was not true – and the worst one was because I had run without a chaperone. It just shows the attitude that existed in 1967: people thought that if women ran they would turn into a man or that it was socially objectionable.” Her actions triggered a clamour for equality in the running world that could not be silenced. Five years later, Boston allowed women to compete and Switzer was on her way to becoming a de facto ambassador for women’s running. On Sunday she will be the official starter for the women’s elite race, after which she will join around 40,000 people looking to get around the 26.2 mile course in temperatures that experts warn will prove difficult for the non-elite runners. “Take every opportunity to consume fluids,” said Andrew Jones, professor of applied physiology at Exeter University. “If there’s shade on the course, use that. Prepare yourself mentally. It’s going to be a bit of a slog over those last few miles.” Switzer, though, is not deterred by the conditions. “I’ve wanted to run this race since it first started. I’m delighted to be here on the 100th anniversary of women’s right to vote.” London is close to her heart. She competed in an all-women marathon in the capital in 1980, an event sponsored by the Avon cosmetics company that played a pivotal role in bringing gender equality to running. “That race got the women’s marathon into the Olympic games. That was a huge battle for women’s equality. To me, it was the physical equivalent of the right to vote. That was about intellectual, social acceptance; this was the physical acceptance. That was amazing.” Last year, half a century on from the infamous race that earned her global recognition, Boston retired bib No 261 as a mark of respect to Switzer, for whom running has always been gender blind. “It’s about equality, it’s about inclusion and it’s also about peace,” she says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/22/helen-housby-england-commonwealth-games-netball-gold-winning-is-a-game-changer","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"‘Winning netball gold is a game changer’: Housby basks in surprise win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/22/helen-housby-england-commonwealth-games-netball-gold-winning-is-a-game-changer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/22/helen-housby-england-commonwealth-games-netball-gold-winning-is-a-game-changer","fields":{"headline":"‘Winning netball gold is a game changer’: Housby basks in surprise win","bodyText":"It’s one week on from the sensational last-second goal that could change English netball for ever. Scorer Helen Housby has hardly removed her Commonwealth gold medal. Inside a coffee shop at Sydney’s Olympic park, she passes it over the counter so two baristas can feel the weight. “I’ve worn it everywhere,” she says, “it’s the first one of these I’ve had so I’m going to make the most of it.” England’s surprise victory over hosts, world champions and overwhelming favourites Australia is not only a first gold medal for Housby – it is the nation’s only major netball title, which many predict will prove a transformative moment for the sport at home. Housby lives in Sydney, playing club netball for the New South Wales Swifts, as one of six England players who ply their trade in the southern hemisphere. She knows better than anyone just how huge this win was. “It’s hard to put into words how big beating them is,” Housby says. “Before the Games people were saying that the only guaranteed Australian medal was in the netball, which added fire to our bellies. They were having a great tournament, smashing teams by 50 or 60 goals and I don’t think anyone outside our team was tipping us to win. It is a game changer, in the same way as the women’s hockey team winning Olympic gold and the cricket team winning the World Cup.” Housby, 23, scored on the buzzer to secure victory by a single goal after the team had trailed Australia by four at one stage in the final quarter of the game. This triumph against the odds was in keeping with Housby’s own unlikely rise. She was born in Drumleaning, a hamlet in Cumbria which is home to more animals than people. When she first began playing for netball super league team Manchester Thunder, her mum Gillian would drive the five-hour round trip to training three times a week. “Mum would pick me up from school,” Housby says. “She’d have pasta in Tupperware ready for me to eat. It would often be close to 1am when we got back home so Mum sacrificed a lot but I feel like I repaid her with this medal: she was in tears at [seeing] me on the podium.” Such is Cumbria’s dearth of netballing talent that at one point the pair were team-mates. “Not that many people played in my local area,” she says, “When I was 14 I played for a local team which my mum also played for and she would have been around 40. I was goal attack and she was goalkeeper. We were just playing for the love of it – you’re rarely seen by selectors when you play rurally.” It was at Manchester Thunder that Housby, 6ft tall, long-limbed and very slim, was first spotted by Tracey Neville, then the club’s coach and England head coach since 2015. Recalling the early days, last week Neville called Housby a “skinny little waif”, but she has been a mentor throughout her career. Housby says: “I always remember her saying: ‘You could get through that gap, you’re a little slice of ham.’ That is just Tracey 101, she’s straight talking and I really like that. “A couple of years ago I was playing in England and was in a shooting position but decided to pass it off to get a little bit closer. At quarter time she told me: ‘If you don’t want to shoot then don’t be a shooter.’ It was live on TV so I was getting messages from my friends saying ‘Ooh, Tracey Neville is shouting at you.’ But she was right and I like that she has confidence in my ability.” Once the 8,000 fans had emptied out of the Gold Coast’s Coomera sports centre stadium last Sunday, the England women gathered in a corridor chanting, “there’s only one Tracey Neville”, a tribute to their manager, whose achievements have often been overshadowed by those of her footballing brothers, former Manchester United players Gary and Phil. A United fan, Housby got a message of congratulations from another former star. “I was on the bus after the game heading to the beach and I got a notification on my phone that David Beckham had sent me a message on Instagram,” Housby says, “I’m telling everybody because it’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. It’s completely bizarre that he knows who I am and you couldn’t think of a bigger celebrity. I don’t think netball has ever been recognised in such a way.” Wandering around Sydney’s Olympic Park, Housby draws stares from passers-by, not unusual for netball players in the country. “In Australia, they really get behind their sports stars, male and female,” she says. “I think we need more of that in the UK. We need the media to get behind us, the young boys and girls only know the big stars because of the TV and newspaper coverage. “When I was growing up most of the big sports stars were male. If I had had females to look up to it might have changed how I perceived myself in sport and we want young girls to think of sport as a viable career option. It’s been a really powerful time for women’s sport lately and everybody is feeding off each other’s successes and energy. “I feel like we need to harness that. We want it to be referred to as sport and not just ‘women’s sport’.” There is a campaign for netball to be included in the Olympics and Housby thinks England breaking the antipodean stranglehold might go some way to convincing the International Olympic Committee of its merits. But she also believes it is restricted by being a predominantly female sport. “In Australia a lot of men play it in social leagues,” she says, “It would be good if more boys played it in the UK because I am always being told by people who have just seen us play for the first time that they didn’t realise how fast it was.’ I went to university in Manchester and the rugby boys and netball girls were close and they used to bet us that they could beat us in a netball game and so we agreed to play them. We showed up and warmed up really professionally, they rocked up and expected to absolutely ghost us and we ended up winning by 40 goals. It felt so sweet because they finally appreciated the level of commitment that goes into playing a game at the highest level.” One of the players was forced to give Housby his club tie after losing that bet. Four years on and it is a gold medal round her neck instead and Housby hopes to continue teaching people the power of netball. -- • The UK won a total of 65 gold, 77 silver, and 86 bronze medals in the Commonwealth Games 2018. • Of these, England won most medals – 45 gold, 45 silver and 46 bronze and stood in overall 2nd position behind the host nation; Wales were in 7th, Scotland in 9th and Northern Ireland in 20th place. • The highest number of gold and silver medals won in one sport by England was in swimming (9 golds and 10 silvers). • Women won 40% of the total medals for the UK. • Top performing athletes include Nile Wilson, pictured above left, with six medals, and Courtney Tulloch, right, with four medals.

He made the surprise announcement at the Welsh Labour party conference in Llandudno on Saturday. Jones’s decision means Wales will have a new first minister at the start of December. He became first minister and leader of the Labour party in Wales in December 2009 – a decade after he was first elected to the Welsh assembly. The Welsh Labour leader had been under significant pressure since Carl Sargeant was found dead in early November, four days after being sacked as a minister over harassment allegations. This week, opposition parties in Wales criticised the Labour-led government for blocking the full publication of a report examining claims that Sargeant’s dismissal was leaked in the days before he killed himself. The Welsh Tories claimed during an assembly debate that it was morally wrong for the report not to be published. Jones’s decision to stand down comes a day after lawyers for Jack Sargeant, Carl’s son, wrote a strongly worded letter accusing him of causing considerable distress. An inquiry into how Jones handled the sacking has not yet begun. The letter said: “The inescapable fact here is that someone sadly lost their life, a much-loved family member, and due process must be followed expeditiously to enable those closest to him to find some closure.” Sargeant’s lawyer, Neil Hudgell told BBC Wales: “It’s a culmination of a series of frustrations over the delay to the start of the inquiry. Our thoughts very much are that it’s been dehumanised within the first minister’s office: there’s some game-playing going on and some deliberate stalling tactics.” When asked about the accusation his manner had caused distress, Jones said: “I can’t see how that can be the case.” In his speech on Saturday, the first minister paid tribute to his wife, Lisa, and their children, and thanked them for their support. “There are people I haven’t been fair to in recent times, and that’s my family,” he said. “In any normal political career you expect to be put through the wringer and have your everything challenged. I don’t think anyone can know what these last few months have been like, other than Lisa and the kids. They have helped me through the darkest of times. I have asked too much of them at times and it’s time for me think about what’s fair to them.” Jones told the Welsh Labour conference he was “incredibly proud of what we’ve achieved together so far”. Earlier on Saturday, Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris was elected as the party’s first deputy leader. Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood congratulated Jones on his nine years as first minister but said Wales not only needed a new leader but a new government. “Wales can and must be better than this – rearranging the deckchairs will not deliver the change we need,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/21/manchester-united-v-tottenham-hotspur-fa-cup-semi-final-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T18:27:17Z","webTitle":"Manchester United 2-1 Tottenham Hotspur: FA Cup semi-final – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/21/manchester-united-v-tottenham-hotspur-fa-cup-semi-final-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/21/manchester-united-v-tottenham-hotspur-fa-cup-semi-final-live","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United 2-1 Tottenham Hotspur: FA Cup semi-final – as it happened","bodyText":"Here’s Simon Burnton’s report from Wembley, which is my cue to drift off into the night. Thanks for your company and emails, bye! We’ll have a live match report from Wembley shortly. No more post-match interviews I’m afraid: the BBC coverage ended abruptly so that they can squeeze in Pointless Celebrities. I can MBM that if you like. Jose Mourinho is one game away from his third trophy in two seasons at United manager. It hasn’t been smooth but he sure knows how to win trophies, something he’ll remind everyone of in the build-up to the final. Prizes make points. It’s another to add to Spurs’ list of what-ifs. They started beautifully but faded after Sanchez’s equaliser. Harry Kane barely had a kick and Dele Alli was quiet apart from his goal. They are such a likeable side but they are running out of time to win a trophy before the time starts to break up. The United players speak! Ander Herrera “Really happy for the goal, for the victory. We are getting used to being in finals, which is good because that’s what this club is about. The centre-backs did an amazing job. Chris Smalling “We turn up in big games and I think we’ve shown that again.” That’s a huge result for United after a difficult week. Their star players, Pogba and Sanchez, were superb, and their much maligned defence controlled Spurs brilliantly in the second half. It was a really good game. Manchester United will play Chelsea or Southampton in the FA Cup final! They started wretchedly but fully deserved to win an excellent match. Spurs have now lost their last eight FA Cup semi-finals. 90+6 min Marouane Fellaini replaces the man of the match Alexis Sanchez. 90+5 min Pogba flips a long pass into space for Lukaku, who is just beaten to the ball 40 yards from goal by Vorm. At the other end Smalling holds off Kane to win a goalkick, and is almost chestbumped by Jones. 90+4 min Nemanja Matic is down with cramp, so there’s another delay. 90+3 min Alexis Sanchez looks an absolute state, which is a reflection of the obscene effort he has put in all game. He’s been brilliant. 90+2 min Lukaku makes a great interception and sets Rashford clear, one against one with Dier. Rashford moves into the area, dummies to shoot but then loses the ball to Dier. He was a bit indecisive there, though it was good defending. 90+1 min There will be five minutes of added soccer. 90 min Herrera is booked for some foul or other. Spurs are running out of time. Lamela’s clip over the top is volleyed up in the air by the stretching Davinson Sanchez and De Gea makes a comfortable claim. 89 min Lamela’s curling free-kick is headed over from six yards by Wanyama. It was just behind him and so he couldn’t steer it on target. 88 min Vertonghen slips past Alexis Sanchez, who pulls him back. Free-kick to Spurs on the left wing... 87 min Lucas Moura spanks a desperate long-range shot well wide. United’s defence have been Spurs at arms length throughout the second half; it’s been a seriously good performance. 86 min Spurs make their last change, with Erik Lamela replacing Son. 85 min Rashford is booked for diving. He hurdled Davinson Sanchez’s tackle and fell over as he landed. It’s hard to say for certain whether it was a dive or whether the leap left him off balance. 84 min “I heard the opinion this week that Pogba is better with Herrera in the team,” says Adam Roberts. “It’s certainly true today; they’ve both been great.” The balance looks so much better when they both play. That 4-3-3 should surely be the default formation next season. 83 min Eriksen’s tame low shot from distance is easily saved by De Gea. 83 min “My perception of practitioners of ‘the dark arts’ is entirely coloured by how creative the player is,” says Phil Podolsky. “ For someone like Deco, cheating was part of his credentials as Professor of Cunning at Oxford University, that also included being incredibly artful with the ball at his feet, so it’s qualitatively different from someone like Materazzi.” 82 min Another United change: Marcus Rashford replaces Jesse Lingard, who has put in his usual shift. 81 min United have controlled the game very well in the second half. There hasn’t been a lot between the teams but United have been just a bit better in all areas. Dier, meanwhile, is booked for plunging his studs into Lingard’s achilles. 80 min United make their first change: Antonio Valencia, who has cramp, is replaced by Matteo Darmian. 78 min Victor Wanyama replaces Mousa Dembele for Spurs. 77 min Valencia, who has already been booked, fouls Alli on the left wing. Spurs ask for him to be sent off but Anthony Taylor doesn’t oblige. Valencia made it look clumsy, which probably saved him. 76 min At the moment United look pretty comfortable. I can’t remember De Gea making a save since half-time. 75 min Pogba’s stinging shot from 20 yards is palmed behind by the flying Vorm. I think it was going wide anyway but it was a good strike. 73 min Eriksen, Spurs’ best player, hits a surprise left-footed shot from 25 yards that just misses the far post and sends a water bottle flying behind the goal. De Gea was happy to let it go, which showed exceptional judgement of where his off stump was. 72 min Pogba plays a lovely, subtle through pass to Lukaku, who charges from right to left and hits a rising shot from a tight angle that is comfortably patted down by Vorm. Pogba has had a superb game. 72 min Ashley Young is booked for timewasting. 71 min “Kane not looking remotely fit today!” says Nick Parmenter. “Almost like playing with 10 men.” 70 min Spurs have moved Dier into the back four, with Vertonghen at left-back. 69 min A challenge by Dembele on Alexis Sanchez leads to a full and frank exchange of views by the players on both sides. He put his arm across Sanchez’s face but I don’t think it was a deliberate elbow and there’s no card. 68 min Spurs make their first change, with Lucas Moura replacing Ben Davies. 65 min Pogba angles a fine pass over the top to Lukaku, who is one against one with Vertonghen in the inside-right channel. He comes infield onto his left foot and drives a low shot just wide of the near post. Vorm had it covered. 63 min I’m not sure about Vorm’s positioning on the goal but it was a really crisp connection from Herrera. United take the lead! Alexis Sanchez’s pass was miscontrolled by Lukaku on the edge of the area but fell nicely for Herrera, who charged onto the scene and whistled a low first-time shot under Vorm from 15 yards. That’s a nice finish. 59 min After a slow start, the second half is warming up nicely. 58 min Alli plays a sweet first-time pass through to Kane in the area. He works the ball onto his left foot and hits a shot that deflected behind off Smalling. Good defending. 57 min Trippier lobs a good pass infield to Eriksen, who belts a superb cross that flashes across the face of goal. 56 min Herrera’s sharp cutback finds Lingard, who mis-hits a first-time shot from 12 yards. That was a decent chance. 56 min The game is much less open than it was in the first half. I suspect both managers spent half-time telling their teams to stop playing silly buggers. 55 min “I know that, in many ways, he’s a wonderful footballer,” begins Adam Roberts, “but Dele Alli is a ****, isn’t he?” I think he’s great. I love ball players with a snide side - Alli, Bergkamp, Van Persie and the rest. 54 min “Lukaku is invisible and slow at it,” says Geertjan Wielenga. “Bring on Rashford.” 53 min Alexis Sanchez scoops a pass into the area towards Lingard, who goes over after a slight nudge from Vertonghen. It probably wasn’t enough to warrant a penalty. 52 min It’s been a quiet, scruffy start to the second half. 51 min “One of the Fox commentators just said that Spurs have to win something because when they concede they go flat,” says Ron Stack. “I take this to mean that they lose confidence, and too easily let games slip away. At first blush that seems a facile comment, but the more I think about it the more sense it makes. What do you think?” I think that’s a bit harsh. They’ve had some brilliant comebacks under Pochettino. But there is a slightly mysterious psychological barrier that can affect them in big games. Winning any trophy, even the Anglo-Scottish Cup, would help. 50 min Alli gives the ball away to Lingard, compounds the error with a naughty tackle and is booked. 47 min “Ander Herrera just has one of those faces, doesn’t he?” says Scott Oliver. “He’s the sneering school bully in the American high school comedy-drama, the dutiful young Lieutenant-Colonel diligently doing the dirty work for a newly installed Latin American military junta, the snitch, the pr1ck in the pub. Thus the perfect Mourinho foot soldier, in many ways.” I prefer to accentuate the positive. Look at the damage he’s doing to national stereotypes. 46 min Peep peep! Spurs begin the second half. Half-time chit chat “I don’t know if you’re seeing the same thing, but on the international feed we keep getting shots of a fan, presumably a Spurs supporter given he’s surrounded by others wearing white, dressed in a bright red t-shirt that says ‘ARTHRITIS RESEARCH’,” says Jerry Parks. “Despite the quality of this game I am strangely preoccupied with this fellow: did he not realize the opposing team wears, is famed for, their red shirts? Is arthritis of all ailments really the most pressing area for medical research? Is this all a stealth marketing campaign of some sort?” Never mind that. What I want to know is: who is Jim Ramsey? Half-time pluggery That was an excellent 45 minutes. Spurs started the half well and took the lead through Dele Alli; United ended the half well after equalising through Alexis Sanchez. The scoreline is fair, and the second half should be a belter. 45+2 min Dier’s long-range shot takes a deflection and rattles off the post! De Gea didn’t even move. It was a sweet strike from Dier and took a touch off the rump of Smalling before arrowing towards the bottom corner. Happily for United, it hit the outside of the post. 44 min Pogba hits a big curling shot from 25 yards that is tipped wide by the diving Vorm. It was a relatively comfortable save. 43 min Lukaku, found by Alexis Sanchez, hoofs a low shot from 20 yards that is blocked by Davies. He looked a bit cumbersome, as he has for much of the half. All United’s threat has been through Pogba and Sanchez. 42 min United break through Pogba, who plays a fine angled pass to Herrera just outside the box on the right. He slips in the act of crossing but the ball still almost sneaks through to Alexis Sanchez, with Davinson Sanchez making an important clearance. Herrera is then lucky not to be booked for a deliberate play-breaking foul on Vertonghen. 42 min Eriksen clips a nice pass into space for Son, who overruns it slightly but still manages to win a corner off Smalling. Eriksen swings into the warm bosom of De Gea. 41 min Possessionwatch: Manchester United 50-50 Tottenham Hotspur. It’s been a Spandex-tight first half. 39 min Kane tries unsuccessfully to lob De Gea from inside his own half. Know your limits, Harry; you’re not Charlie Adam. 37 min A beautiful pass over the top by Eriksen is volleyed into orbit by Son. No matter, he was miles offside. 36 min Son is fouled down the right by Pogba, who for some reason starts applauding. Bit weird. Eriksen’s free kick is unusually poor and cleared by Young. 34 min Eriksen dummies to shoot and plays it wide to Tripper in loads of space on the right edge of the box. His first touch isn’t great and by the time he gets the cross in United have enough men around to clear. 33 min Kane is fouled 30 yards from goal by Herrera... 31 min Alexis Sanchez and Pogba, who keeps pulling to the left, are threatening to overrun Trippier. Pogba has been superb in the last 10 minutes. 30 min The game has been much more even since United equalised. In fact, it’s turning into a potential classic. 28 min Son is booked for a hack at Alexis Sanchez. 27 min Another chance for United! Lukaku’s cross finds Lingard on the six-yard line, but he mistimes his jump and heads the ball straight up in the air. 27 min Valencia is booked for a bad tackle on Alli. It was two-footed, so some referees might have sent him off, though I think it looked worse in slow motion. 26 min As with Eriksen’s ball for Alli’s goal, it was as much a pass as a cross by Pogba. It was majestic. United equalise with a fine goal! Pogba, at fault for the first goal, made this one brilliantly. He muscled Dembele off the ball on the left wing, moved infield and coaxed the most magnificent curling cross towards the far post. Sanchez got between Davies and Vertonghen to steer an excellent header back across goal. That’s his sixth goal in five FA Cup games at Wembley. 21 min United are in danger of being swamped before half-time. They started pretty well but have been all over the show since the goal. 19 min Eriksen, who is having a blinder, combines with Kane to release Son on the left. He’s one on one with the last man Valencia, who does very well to stay on his feet and block Son’s shot. 18 min The look on Mourinho’s coupon is absolutely murderous. 17 min Another chance for Spurs! Alli plays a fine pass into Kane, who eschews the shot and instead tees up Eriksen 15 yards out. He screws a bobbling shot fractionally wide of the far post. De Gea wouldn’t have got to it had it been on target. 17 min This is an excellent spell for Spurs, whose passing has a lovely rhythm to it. Son’s fierce low cross to the near post is brilliantly intercepted by Phil Jones, who just managed to get in front of Alli. Had he not done so it would have been 2-0. Mourinho is already waving furiously at his players. 14 min Son’s deep cross from the left just evades the stretching Kane in front of goal. That was almost 2-0. 14 min Trippier nutmegs Pogba, to the delight of the Spurs fans. Their team look really sharp with the ball, if not quite so good without it. It’s a very open game. 12 min Lingard appeals for a penalty when the ball bounces off the arm of Davinson Sanchez. He wasn’t even looking at the ball so I don’t think you could say it was deliberate. 12 min United’s defending was pretty poor for the goal. Young went AWOL and Pogba couldn’t be bothered to chase back after Eriksen. Spurs take the lead with a simple goal. Eriksen runs onto a long punt down the right by Sanchez and swings a terrific low pass/cross to the far post. It bounces up perfectly for Alli, who arrives late and steers it into the empty net. 10 min Lukaku misses a good chance, heading Matic’s cross over from 10 yards. He had pulled onto Davies, who had no chance of beating him in the air, but the header was a poor one. 7 min Herrera’s superb pass down the inside-right channel finds Lingard, who picks the wrong option and has his cross put behind for a corner by Vertonghen. 5 min Now United win their first corner, with Trippier heading Herrera’s corner behind. This has been a really bright start to the game. Sanchez’s corner from the left is cleared at the near post by Dembele. 4 min That was a sore one for Sanchez, with Tripper plunging his studs into the left achilles. I’m not sure how deliberate it was; I do know it looked bloody painful. Sanchez seems fine now though. 3 min Sanchez is down injured, holding his left leg. Spurs play on; they have started really confidently. 1 min Kane wins a corner after 20 seconds with a deflected long-range shot. Davies’s outswinger is half cleared to Eriksen, who slides a lovely ball into Son in the area. His low cross is blocked by Valencia and goes behind for another corner. This one comes to nothing. 1 min Peep peep! Manchester United get the match under way, kicking from the right to left on the television screen. The players are in the tunnel. Let’s watch some association football. Hereeeeee’s Jose “The game against Spurs started 1-0 in the league (when United conceded after 11 seconds). I hope this starts 0-0 and we can go from there.” Mauricio Pochettino speaks! “We are going to play an amazing final (sic), with the possibility of going through to the final. Michel Vorm deserves to play. We are fully confident in him. I don’t think we have a home advantage - we are in a different changing-room and the support will be 50/50.” “Let’s see if I have this straight,” says J. R. “Mr. Lewis admits that Mourinho doesn’t know his best team or formation and has a crap record in the transfer market and this adds up to the conclusion that “Mourinho has done well”? (And he didn’t even mention Mourinho’s capability to make great players terrible. Maybe that’s implied.) I can’t imagine United playing any worse with the squad they’ve got.” They are above the media darlings Spurs and Liverpool in the league and won trophies last season; hence the doing of well. The 3pm games are coming to a close around the country. You can get the latest with John Brewin. Podcast plug Nessun Dorma, the podcast devoted to 1980s and 1990s football, returns this Tuesday with a special episode about Manchester United’s first title under Sir Alex Ferguson. You can subscribe here, if that’s what you want to do. When Spurs reach an FA Cup semi-final, we are contractually obliged to link to this clip of Gazza at his glorious best. An email! “Afternoon Rob,” says Jonny Lewis. “Mourinho has done well and improved us, but realistically, he won’t do more than two more seasons at United - max. Does he have it in him to make the leap to city’s level in that time? Also, will he want to hang around and watch Guardiola clean up? “I question whether he knows his best team and formation and also his record in the transfer market. Unfortunately, every signing has to work as we are playing catch up from Fergie’s last few years - they definitely haven’t. Lastly, I wish he would look like he is enjoying it more - pre-Madrid was a more fun Mourinho.” I suspect you’re right, but don’t you think that at least in theory he’d like to stay at United for a decade? I always thought that was his plan – affairs all around Europe, a happy marriage to United in his fifties and then a spell as Portugal manager before retirement. Manchester United have some extremely happy FA Cup semi-final memories - not least the greatest game I’ve ever seen, against Arsenal in 1999. That, and much else, is revisited in a superb documentary to be be broadcast on Monday night. I was lucky to see a preview, and it is gold. There are no surprises in either side. Michel Vorm, who has started every FA Cup match this season for Spurs, comes in for Hugo Lloris. United’s team is as expected, even if plenty would have preferred to see big-game specialist Marcus Rashford and/or Anthony Martial in the starting XI. Manchester United (4-3-3) De Gea; Valencia, Jones, Smalling, Young; Herrera, Matic, Pogba; Lingard, Lukaku, Sanchez. Substitutes: Rashford, J Pereira, Darmian, Lindelof, Fellaini, Mata, Martial. Tottenham Hotspur (4-2-3-1) Vorm; Trippier, Sanchez, Vertonghen, Davies; Dier, Dembele; Eriksen, Alli, Son; Kane. Substitutes: Lloris, Aurier, Alderweireld, Wanyama, Sissoko, Lamela, Lucas. Referee Anthony Taylor. Now this, my dear friends, is an FA Cup semi-final. Two of the three most successful teams in the competition’s history, both desperate to win a trophy for different reasons, each with contrasting public perceptions and styles. In a sense this is the dreamer versus the winner. Spurs, for all their charming football under Mauricio Pochettino, haven’t won a trophy since 2008. United won two last year, and their results have improved enormously under Jose Mourinho. But their style of play - and their strange propensity to have an absolute shocker every few weeks – has left Mourinho on the back foot for most of the season, waving his CV in everyone’s face. To Mourinho, prizes will always make points. He has won 25 to Pochettino’s none. Yet the common perception is that Mourinho the past and Pochettino the future, and this is such a good opportunity for Pochettino to win his first trophy. Spurs have home advantage of sorts tonight, and again in the final if they get there. The winners will play Chelsea or Southampton. With extra-time and penalties available, this could be a long night. Kick off is at 5.15pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/22/smallville-actor-was-allegedly-a-top-member-of-cult-that-abused-women","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T07:04:39Z","webTitle":"Smallville's Allison Mack was allegedly a 'top member' of cult that abused women","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/22/smallville-actor-was-allegedly-a-top-member-of-cult-that-abused-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/22/smallville-actor-was-allegedly-a-top-member-of-cult-that-abused-women","fields":{"headline":"Smallville's Allison Mack was allegedly a 'top member' of cult that abused women","bodyText":"As she was led from court in Brooklyn on Friday, Allison Mack appeared to wipe away a tear. The actor, best known for a role in the TV series Smallville, had entered a plea of not guilty to sex trafficking and forced labor charges which carry mandatory minimum sentences of 15 years and could lead to life in jail. Flanked by lawyers and closely shadowed by FBI agents and federal marshals, the 35-year-old’s distress provided the first glimpse of what the future may hold for senior members of an alleged cult known as Nxivm. Prosecutors claim Mack was second-in-command at the upstate New York headquarters of the group, and therefore instrumental in forcing new recruits to conform to the sexual demands of leader Keith Raniere. The government alleges that so-called Nxivm “slaves” were forced to starve; ordered to remain celibate; and held down as Raniere’s initials were branded below their hips with a cauterizing pen. Mack is alleged to have put her hands on the women’s chests, telling them to “feel the pain” and to “think of [their] master”. “Ms Mack was one of the top members of a highly organized scheme which was designed to provide sex to [Raniere],” assistant US attorney Moira Penza said in court. “Under the guise of female empowerment, she starved women until they fit her co-defendant’s sexual feminine ideal.” The government also alleged that Mack forced recruits to pose naked for photos – “including on one occasion close-up pictures of their vaginas” – that were given to Raniere, 57. He was arrested in Mexico last month, after being indicted, and has pleaded not guilty on charges of sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy. He is also being held in New York. Mack, who played Clark Kent’s friend Chloe Sullivan in Smallville – the hit a series about Superman’s origins – was ordered held, judge Cheryl Pollak arguing that her lawyers failed to offer a “sufficient” bail package given the gravity of the charges. Mack’s attorneys had argued that she was not a flight risk because she returned to the US voluntarily from Mexico. “The allegations contained in the indictment are only that: allegations. The hard facts establish that she is not a risk of flight,” lawyer Sean Buckley said. Outside the court, Stanley Zareff – a friend of Dynasty star Catherine Oxenberg, whose daughter India is believed to be a member of Nxivm – said Mack had no right to be freed. India Oxenberg, she said, had become involved with Nxivm as part of a search for self-enlightenment. “I hope that she can see the light and wake up,” he said. “Her family loves her. This is a crazy group. This is not fake news. And we certainly don’t want Allison Mack released. With Keith away, she’s now the leader of the group and I don’t trust her for a minute.” ‘Vanguard’ Nxivm was founded as an executive-focused self-help organisation but it appears to have metamorphised into a personality cult centred on Raniere, who falsely claims to have been a child prodigy who held the 1989 Guinness World Record for “highest IQ” and who followers reverentially call “Vanguard”. Raniere was arrested at a villa outside Puerto Vallarta in Mexico on 25 March. Mack and Clyne were reportedly with him but fled. According to the complaint against him, in 2003 Raniere began running workshops at a compound about 20 miles outside Albany, the New York state capital. The curriculum included teaching women about “the need for men to have multiple sexual partners and the need for women to be monogamous”. By 2015, the government alleges, Raniere had established a society within Nxivm called DOS or “The Vow”, in which “women were recruited to be slaves under the false pretense of joining a women-only mentorship group”. Any challenge to his authority was brutally resisted, prosecutors allege, saying Raniere “physically assaulted at least two intimate partners” and punished one member for expressing romantic feelings for another with 18 months confinement. Marc Agnifilo, a lawyer for Raniere, said earlier this month he was “confident these allegations will be soundly disproven”. On Friday, prosecutors expressed concern over granting Mack bail, arguing that Nxivm members appeared to have access to money. An account Raniere was using at the time of his arrest had $8m in it, authorities have said. It is thought that the group’s access to funds may be through the trusts of Clare and Sara Bronfman, heiresses to the Seagram liquor fortune and members of Nxivm. In 2003, Forbes published an exposé in which family patriarch Edgar Bronfman Sr described the group as “a cult”. A 2010 report in Vanity Fair claimed the Bronfman sisters’ funds were helping Nvixm resist a “multi-million-dollar, multi-front legal war”. According to the Albany Times Union, New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman opened and then suspended an investigation into the Ethical Science Foundation, a group formed in 2007 by Clare Bronfman. The government investigation of Nxivm gathered pace last year, when former member Sarah Edmondson provided a first-hand account of the alleged branding practice. Edmondson later told Vice: “It was like a bad horror movie. We even had these surgical masks on because the smell of flesh was so strong.” Her account, published by the New York Times, sparked an FBI investigation and triggered Raniere’s flight to Mexico. He did, however, respond to the Times story, posting on the group’s website: “This story might be a criminal product of criminal minds who, in the end, are also hurting the victims of the story.” The group may not have ended recruitment efforts. Last month, according to the New York Post, a member threw a party in Williamsburg, promising “an evening of meeting cool, like-minded artists and chatting about life, authenticity, and the awesome human potential”. Mack’s attorneys are due back in court on Monday, to petition for bail. Prosecutors have warned that Nxivm members have registered websites in the names of potential witnesses. Mack, prosecutor Penza said on Friday, “obviously has the ability to manipulate people. She has, based on the structure, a number of slaves underneath her who have pledged vows of obedience”. Raniere will be in Brooklyn federal court on Wednesday, to request bail."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/21/macclesfield-town-promoted-back-to-the-football-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T18:41:14Z","webTitle":"Wigan and Luton promoted as Macclesfield return to Football League","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/21/macclesfield-town-promoted-back-to-the-football-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/21/macclesfield-town-promoted-back-to-the-football-league","fields":{"headline":"Wigan and Luton promoted as Macclesfield return to Football League","bodyText":"Championship Wolves were confirmed as champions after a 4-0 romp at relegation-threatened Bolton. Goals from Barry Douglas, Benik Afobe, Diogo Jota and a Conor Coady penalty also left Wolves just two points shy of reaching a century of points. Cardiff reacted to Fulham overtaking them with a 3-0 win at Millwall on Friday night by despatching Nottingham Forest 2-1 at home to go back into second place. Aron Gunnarsson scored his first goal in a year to save the day for the Bluebirds after Liam Bridcutt had cancelled out Sean Morrison’s opener. And after Sunderland’s relegation was confirmed by their defeat to Burton, it was a mixed day for those trying to avoid joining them, with Bolton’s defeat leaving them two points above third-bottom Barnsley, who lost 2-1 at Leeds. Tom Pearce’s first senior goal and Ezgjan Alioski’s tap-in did the damage for Paul Heckingbottom’s Leeds against his former club after Paudie O’Connor had equalised for Barnsley with an own-goal. Birmingham climbed within touching distance of safety with a hugely important 2-1 defeat of play-off chasing Sheffield United. Marc Duffy had put Blades in the lead but Marc Roberts and Jacques Maghoma’s goals grabbed the three points. Birmingham are now five points clear of Barnsley. The undoubted game of the day in the Championship came at Bristol City, who drew 5-5 with Hull. City had led 4-2 after Bobby Reid’s goal, only for strikes from Harry Wilson, Abel Hernandez and Fraizer Campbell put Hull into an unlikely lead. It took Joe Bryan’s equaliser in the 94th minute to take a point for Lee Johnson’s team, though failing to win left them three points shy of a play-off place. Aston Villa kept alive their slim hopes of automatic promotion with a 4-0 win at manager-less Ipswich with goals from Conor Hourihane, two from Lewis Grabban and Henri Lansbury defeating the ten-man Tractor Boys, who had Grant Ward dismissed for a bad tackle on Neil Taylor. Middlesbrough meanwhile consolidated their play-off position with a 2-1 win at Derby, for whom defeat left them a point and a place outside the top six. Muhamed Besic, on loan from Everton, scored his first goal in English football and Britt Assombalonga scored a second. David Nugent’s injury-time penalty came far too late for Derby. League One Wigan’s promotion to the Championship was sealed by a 4-0 win at Fleetwood Town and Shrewsbury being held by already relegated Bury. Incoming Fleetwood manager Joey Barton was watching from the Highbury stands and saw Paul Cook’s men cruise to victory. Goals from Max Power, Gavin Massey, Dan Burn and Chey Dunkley got the celebrations underway. An equaliser from Bury’s Jay O’Shea meant Shrewsbury, now seven points behind second-placed Blackburn, cannot catch Wigan, now ten points clear of them. Abo Eisa had opened the scoring in the 1-1 draw. At the bottom, a relegation six-pointer between AFC Wimbledon and Oldham ended up with the points shared after a 2-2 draw. Charlie Wyke’s injury-time equaliser for Bradford kept Rochdale fourth from bottom and in the relegation zone. Northampton’s 2-0 defeat of Plymouth kept them within two points of safety, and kept the Pilgrims outside the play-off positions. Charlton stayed in fifth place with a 1-0 win at Portsmouth, who remained in eighth and are four points shy of sixth-placed Scunthorpe, who beat Walsall 1-0 to leave the Midlanders just a single point above the bottom four. Second-bottom MK Dons’ 4-0 defeat to Southend left them six points behind 20th placed Oldham League Two Luton’s promotion to League One was confirmed after their 1-1 draw at Carlisle. Exeter’s 2-2 draw with Crawley meant they could no longer catch Nathan Jones’ team. Accrington are within a point of claiming the League Two title after a thumping 4-0 win at Wycombe. Joining League Two next season will be Macclesfield Town, who returned to the Football League after six years’ absence with a 2-0 win at Eastleigh securing the National League title. A fourth-minute goal from striker Tyrone Marsh after a cross from David Fitzpatrick was followed by a close-range finish from Mitch Hancox on the hour. Victory in Saturday’s early kick-off put automatic promotion beyond chasers Tranmere Rovers, who must now negotiate the play-offs. At the bottom of League Two, Chesterfield are all but relegated, needing to make up a goal difference of 19 goals in their last three matches on third-bottom Morecambe to survive. Barnet meanwhile beat Newport 2-0 to be four points off Morecambe, who lost 1-0 to Crewe.

Eliud Kipchoge has a stronger claim than most to be the greatest marathon runner in history. The 33-year-old Kenyan has won nine of his 10 races over the distance, breezed to the Olympic title in 2016, and last year ran 2hr 0min 25sec, the fastest time over 26.2 miles. True, it didn’t count as an official world record as Kipchoge was helped by a phalanx of pacemakers, who subbed in and out of the race (which is against the rules) but it was still an astonishing performance. Yet he may not get things all his own way on Sunday. Kenenisa Bekele, who is widely regarded as the best distance runner in history, given he holds the 5,000m and 10,000m world records as well as the second-fastest marathon, says he is injury-free after an uninterrupted preparation – something that has rarely been the case over the past few years. Kipchoge’s coach, Patrick Sang, told the Observer that if the weather forecast wasn’t so hot, his man would have a big chance of breaking the world record. Privately, Bekele has similar thoughts. But while the 22C temperatures will likely scupper their ambitions, it should still be one hell of a race. 2) How will Mo Farah do this time round? Make no bones about it: Mo Farah’s first attempt at the full marathon distance was a disaster. Beforehand, he had talked up his plans of mixing it with the world’s best but he got a cold slap of reality as he struggled home eighth in 2:08:21, outside Steve Jones’s British record of 2:07:13. This time there can be no excuses. Having given up running on the track, his sole focus for eight months has been on this race. That means beating Jones’s record is the bare minimum. And if Farah is serious about being a top contender, he surely has to make a decent stab at the European record of 2:05:48, too. Depending on who you listen to, Farah is either in shape to break these records or will disappoint again because he is physiologically unsuited to running 26.2 miles. Either way it will be fascinating to see how he fares against a stacked field that includes not only Kipchoge and Bekele but last year’s winner, Daniel Wanjiru, and the Ethiopian Guye Adola, who ran the fastest marathon debut in history (2:03:46) in Berlin last September. With the 2009 and 2011 world champion, Abel Kirui, and Bedan Karoki, third last year, also in the mix, Farah faces a fight even to make the podium – something you could not say when he was winning medal after medal on the track between 2010 and 2017. 3) An epic battle in the women’s race Shortly after Paula Radcliffe broke the women’s world marathon record in 2003, the chief executive of the London Marathon, Nick Bitel, promised her it would not be beaten for a while; 15 years on, we are still waiting. However, there is a small chance that the Kenyan Mary Keitany or the Ethiopian Tirunesh Dibaba could finally lower that astonishing record. Keitany showed her class last year, breaking from the field in the first mile and running solo most of the way to run a time of 2:17:01 – the second-fastest ever. This time Keitany’s male training partners will be allowed to pace her, which might just make the difference. “But it’s not easy,” she says. “2:15 is something else. We are asked to try to follow the footsteps of a legend.” Dibaba, who a ran personal-best of 2:17:48 in finishing second last year, agrees. “When you talk about the world record, it’s not an easy thing,” she says. Yet she has not entirely ruled out going for it. “There are many factors in breaking it,” she says. “The weather has to be good, pacemakers and the condition of the race and everything. But hopefully if all things are met, I’ll go for it.” 4) Will the Weirwolf be shot down by the Silver Bullet? Last year David Weir secured a record seventh win at the London marathon, beating the Paralympic champion, Marcel Hug, in a thrilling finish. It was, Weir said, perhaps the best race of his career. However, the man known as the Weirwolf barely felt a thing because he had depression. Having taken a break from the sport – he raced his first marathon in a year last week in Paris – Weir is back and ready to take on Hug, the Swiss rider known as the Silver Bullet. “Marcel’s a nice guy and he works so hard to be the best at his game,” says Weir. “On the road he’s an animal. It’s hard to break him, but you can. Anyone can be broken.” 5) More women than ever are running the marathon London is not only about the elite racers. It is about the huge crowds lining the streets. The 40,000 club and fun runners raising millions for charity. And – more than ever – women. The London Marathon race organiser, Hugh Brasher, said: “In 1981, less than 300 of the 6,300 finishers were women. This year more than 149,000 women from the UK applied to run and, in another first, there were more female than male first-time marathon runners from the UK who applied this year (51.7% v 48.3%). “We can’t be sure yet but anecdotally we think that more women will be running than men on Sunday.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/22/city-faces-corruption-crackdown-as-imf-investigates-wealthy-countries","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T13:00:22Z","webTitle":"City faces corruption crackdown as IMF investigates wealthy countries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/22/city-faces-corruption-crackdown-as-imf-investigates-wealthy-countries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/22/city-faces-corruption-crackdown-as-imf-investigates-wealthy-countries","fields":{"headline":"City faces corruption crackdown as IMF investigates wealthy countries","bodyText":"The City of London will come under the spotlight of the International Monetary Fund as part of a crackdown on corruption that will investigate whether Britain and other rich countries are taking tough enough action against bribery and money laundering. In a hardening of its approach, the IMF said it needed to look at those giving bribes and financial centres that laundered dirty money as well as improving the existing clampdown on wrongdoing in poor countries. London has won the unenviable reputation of being the global centre for money laundering, partly as a result of cases such as the Global Laundromat, under which British-registered companies and banks helped move at least £20bn of money from criminal activities out of Russia. All members of the Group of Seven industrial nations – Britain, the US, Germany, Japan, France, Italy and Canada – together with Austria and the Czech Republic will be looked at by the IMF to see whether their legal systems criminalised bribery and have the right mechanism to prevent laundering of dirty money. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, said: “The flip side of every bribe taken is a bribe given. And funds received through corruption are often funds concealed outside the country, often in the financial sectors of major capitals. It is quite possible for countries to have ‘clean hands’ at home but ‘dirty hands’ abroad. “To truly fight corruption, therefore, we need to address the facilitation of corrupt practices by private actors. To do this, we will be encouraging our member countries to volunteer to have their legal and institutional frameworks assessed by the Fund – to see whether they criminalise and prosecute foreign bribery and have mechanisms to stop the laundering and concealment of dirty money.” Lagarde said the willingness of the G7 plus Austria and the Czech Republic to allow their anticorruption regimes to be tested was “a major vote of confidence in the new framework”. The investigation will form part of the annual Article IV health check that the IMF conducts on every member country. Philip Hammond said in Washington that the size of the City of London meant he could not definitively say that there was no illicit money flowing through the UK financial system but that the government was working hard to reduce and eliminate illicit flows. Lagarde said there was empirical evidence to show that high levels of corruption were linked to significantly lower growth, investment, foreign direct investment and tax revenues. A country that slid down from halfway to three-quarters of the way down a league table of corruption and governance was likely to see growth of national income per head decline by half a percentage point or more. “Our results also show that corruption and poor governance are associated with higher inequality and lower inclusive growth.” The IMF has had guidelines for dealing with corruption since 1997 but Lagarde said there was a need for an updated policy that aimed for a “more systematic, evenhanded, effective and candid engagement with member countries”. She added that the IMF was developing a clear and transparent methodology to assess how big a problem corruption was in individual poor countries. This would involve looking at the quality of government departments in charge of tax and spending, and the integrity of central banks. The IMF would then look at the impact of any governance weaknesses on long-term growth. Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, said: “Corruption is a threat to prosperity, security and trust in institutions. It is a barrier to development. We need collective international action by governments, business and civil society to fight it. Unless we tackle corruption, we won’t make the gains in development which we need to. “The UK is working with international partners to end impunity for those engaged in corruption, to recover assets stolen from developing countries and to empower citizens to stand up to and report corruption.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/21/organised-gangs-behind-rural-crime-wave-drugs-theft","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T21:43:53Z","webTitle":"City gangs behind burgeoning crop of countryside crime","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/21/organised-gangs-behind-rural-crime-wave-drugs-theft","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/21/organised-gangs-behind-rural-crime-wave-drugs-theft","fields":{"headline":"City gangs behind burgeoning crop of countryside crime","bodyText":"Organised criminal gangs are behind a growing wave of countryside crime, a rural police commissioner has warned. Julia Mulligan, the head of the National Rural Crime Network and police and crime commissioner for North Yorkshire, said that so-called “county lines” drug-dealing and a sharp rise in thefts and burglaries targeting farms and villages showed that organised crime was growing. More than 720 county lines drug networks have been set up by gangs in Manchester, Liverpool, London and other cities to sell crack cocaine and heroin in small towns and other parts of the countryside. Rural areas have also seen a 13% rise in thefts and burglaries so far this year, according to the leading farm insurer NFU Mutual. Mulligan said police should take a more intelligence-led approach, and warned that people in the countryside say they will “take matters into their own hands”. “I think it’s getting worse,” she said. “People are extremely worried about drug dealing – they are seeing it far more often than they ever used to, and it’s really a growing concern. “It’s not limited to drugs. I think we’ve got a serious and organised crime problem. They are opportunistic and make money from anything they can. They know they can go out into the countryside and they have a supply chain for getting rid of things they steal.” NFU Mutual’s rural affairs specialist, Tim Price, said two tractors worth a total of £96,000 were recovered from Lithuania after they were stolen in Scotland in 2016, and nine tractors were discovered in northern Cyprus. The groups scope out farms to see where equipment is kept, then bring a lorry to carry off hi-tech tractors, Land Rovers, all-terrain vehicles and quad bikes, he said. Monica Akehurst’s livestock farm in East Sussex was one of seven targeted over the Easter weekend by a gang who stole quad bikes and chainsaws. They returned the next night at 2.30am, when she was still awake helping a ewe deliver a lamb. “I heard the strangest noise,” she said. “It really unnerved me. You think the place is your own, and to think someone is there was scary. You feel vulnerable. I couldn’t believe they would be so brazen as to come back the next night.” Mulligan said rural communities did not believe they were getting enough of a response from police. “You talk to farmers and landowners and they say, ‘We’ll deal with this, there’s no point reporting it to the police’. They’re worried that if someone comes on to their land that they will do something that they could get into trouble for, but they’re so exasperated that sometimes they feel that that is the only option that is open to them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/22/hostile-environment-landlords-check-immigration-status-under-coalition-government","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T20:05:51Z","webTitle":"‘If you create a hostile environment, you shouldn’t be surprised that it’s hostile’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/22/hostile-environment-landlords-check-immigration-status-under-coalition-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/22/hostile-environment-landlords-check-immigration-status-under-coalition-government","fields":{"headline":"‘If you create a hostile environment, you shouldn’t be surprised that it’s hostile’","bodyText":"There was stunned silence in the cabinet room. Ministers exchanged awkward glances. Officials looked at their shoes. Had the prime minister really just stormed out? It was May 2013 and a red-faced David Cameron had suddenly packed up his briefing folder and left, with a full agenda far from complete. It brought an abrupt end to the gathering known as the inter-ministerial group on migrants’ access to benefits and public services – dubbed the Batmaps committee by civil servants. With the Tories under pressure from a bullish Ukip, the prime minister had raised his latest idea for creating a “hostile environment” for illegal immigration – forcing landlords to check the immigration status of their tenants. The only problem was, he could barely find anyone around the table to support it. Ministers kept raising awkward questions. Wouldn’t landlords simply stop offering tenancies to people with foreign-sounding names? Would landlords really have the skills to operate like border guards? Cameron eventually turned to the junior Tory ministers in the room in search of some unqualified backing. When it failed to materialise, he packed up and left. “He walked out in a strop, which was highly unusual,” recalls David Laws, a Lib Dem Cabinet Office minister at the time. “If you take decisions that are based only on the fears of mass immigration without thinking through the risks, you will have problems. Some Tories were aware of that.” Theresa May and her home secretary, Amber Rudd, have spent the past week apologising to the Windrush-era citizens who had found their immigration status called into question, despite having the right to be here. The apologies have been accompanied by a suggestion that the crisis is an aberration by officials “too concerned with policy”. To those who have been warning about such a crisis, however, their treatment is far from a momentary lapse. It is, they claim, the entirely predictable consequence of creating a hostile environment for illegal immigrants that risked collateral damage as the price of appearing tough. Anyone without the right documents would have to prove their case – and policies with unintended consequences would need to be pursued to show action was being taken. While some measures designed to make life harder for illegal migrants date back to the last Labour government, most Whitehall insiders and immigration experts point to the arrival of the Tory-led coalition government in 2010 as the moment when the “hostile environment” mission began in earnest. Everyday life was to be made impossible for those without proof of their legal status. Should they try to find a job, open a bank account, access healthcare or rent a room, they would meet with a demand for papers. As Cameron’s frustration at the Batmaps committee had shown, the need to act tough on immigration was a powerful driver in Downing St after 2010. Electoral pressure from Ukip, which was securing record poll ratings, was focusing minds and had already contributed to the adoption of the pledge to reduce net migration to the “tens of thousands”. The same pressures encouraged Cameron to back an EU referendum. The temperature was raised further in 2013 when the Home Office sent out controversial “go home” vans telling illegal immigrants to leave the country. Nick Timothy, May’s former adviser, has since said that she blocked the vans, only for the policy to be rolled out while she was on holiday. His claim was contradicted by a written ministerial answer in 2016. It stated that while the scheme was approved by the former immigration minister Mark Harper, May “was informed of the intention to pilot this campaign”. Measures clamping down on the undocumented were accelerated after the 2015 election. Rules were tightened for access to secondary healthcare, existing bank account holders and – despite a lack of support back in May 2013 – the plan to force tenants to show they had a “right to rent” was rolled out across England. Together with a change in the rules, some on the frontline say they detected a change in institutional attitude. “The hostile environment is actually two things,” says Adrian Berry, a leading immigration lawyer. “It is a series of legislative initiatives to make it much more difficult to lead an ordinary life in the UK, but secondly, a change in direction in the way the Home Office assesses individual people. “Essentially, you are under suspicion as being unlawfully present unless you can rebut that. We had immigration tests for benefits applications anyway. It’s just that those people started to be treated with much more suspicion.” Even after Rudd’s apology for the Windrush cases, it has emerged that she was privately pushing plans to tighten the net further. In a leaked private letter to May last year, she vowed to give immigration officials more “teeth” to deport thousands more illegal migrants. Rudd even implied that she wanted to switch money from low-level crime-fighting to her immigration enforcement programme. Her proposals came before the Windrush cases began to emerge. Unintended cases began to roll in. At risk are people who arrived here as part of an open-ended invitation to settle in the UK, but without the high levels of paperwork now required to access many services or satisfy the Home Office. As a result, some of those who came over with their parents from the Caribbean in the 1950s and 1960s have been affected. Albert Thompson (not his real name) was denied cancer treatment after failing to prove he was a legal resident. Winston Jones (not his real name), who arrived in London in 1972 as a 16-year-old, lost his tenancy after he was admitted to hospital with a brain aneurysm and told he may have to pay for his treatment. Junior Green, 61, visited his dying mother in Jamaica last year but was refused readmission. While he secured a temporary visa, he missed his mother’s funeral. The Home Office maintains it is “wilfully misleading to conflate the situation experienced by people from the Windrush generation with measures in place to tackle illegal immigration and protect the UK taxpayer”. The web of potential triggers has caused immigration issues to arise in unpredictable ways. “We have supported someone who came in 1968 when she was 15,” says Sally Daghlian, head of the Praxis Community Projects charity. “She didn’t have any immigration problems until 2016, when her youngest daughter applied for a British passport. She was told she couldn’t get the passport because her mother didn’t have permission to be in the UK. Her mother then got a letter from the Home Office saying that she had to make immediate arrangements to leave the country, or she might be removed.” Berry adds: “If you switch employer, having worked for someone for 20 years, you probably wouldn’t have had an immigration test before. But now you will have one – and could find you have no documentation. I’ve seen an increase in cases.” Chris Norris, director of policy and practice at the National Landlords Association, recalls an unusual round-table event at the time the policy for tenant immigration checks was being developed. “The round table involved us, homelessness representatives and local authorities,” he says. “I’m not sure I’ve ever been part of one of those working groups where there is so much agreement that it is a bad policy. I don’t think there was anyone around that table who thought this was a good idea.” The whole agenda has been driven by the need to cut numbers, says the former head of the UK border force Brodie Clark. “The constant government mantra of ‘hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands’, alongside the 50% success rate on asylum appeals, gives a clear picture of the sheer political desperation and pressure to improve the figures,” he says. “To politicians, the number of people removed mattered greatly.” However, immigration advice workers say that some people worried about their status simply disappear off the grid, rather than leave the country. The consequences can be tragic. “The worst case I saw was a pregnant woman who had no immigration papers,” recalls Rita Chadha, from the Migrants’ Rights Network. “She was suffering from acute pain. We took her to hospital, after three weeks of convincing her. When she got there, they found out the baby had died.” Then there is the alleged discrimination created by some of the reforms. Recent research by the Residential Landlords Association found that as a result of the “right to rent” checks on tenants, 42% of landlords are now less likely to let to anyone without a British passport. “The system is inherently prejudicial and xenophobic,” says Satbir Singh, the chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. “It creates a really strong incentive to discriminate. It comes alongside cuts to legal aid for those rejected [for leave to remain in the UK]. Access to justice is subtly removed.” It is unsurprising in such circumstances that the rights of EU migrants after Brexit are causing some nervousness. As in the Windrush cases, there will be a large cohort of people who were invited to settle freely in Britain who will suddenly be asked to prove their right to remain here after Brexit. Some 3.5 million people are in the group. “There are obvious parallels between the Windrush generation and EU citizens already living in the UK,” says Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory. “The situation of EU citizens ought to be much better as we are in a more hi-tech world and the Home Office is producing a system for giving them documentation. In theory that system ought to work very well. The issue is a group of people who don’t apply for various reasons.” According to the observatory, children in care could be at risk, as well as vulnerable people like the 50,000 female domestic abuse victims in the group. There are about 239,000 UK-born children in the group whose EU national parents report that they are UK citizens. However, available data suggests that tens of thousands of these children may not be. Will there be a rethink of the use of hostility as a policy principle? Charity workers helping those at the heart of the current furore live in hope, if not expectation. “All of this reflects a wider problem,” says Daghlian. “A problem with Home Office record-keeping, a problem with the fees that people are being expected to pay to secure their status, and, inevitably, if you set up a system where you outsource immigration control to non-experts, you end up creating a charter for discrimination. “If you create a hostile environment, you shouldn’t be surprised that it’s hostile.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/22/medical-research-needs-big-data-tessa-jowell-gets-ball-rolling","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T05:06:12Z","webTitle":"Medical research needs big data – Tessa Jowell gets the ball rolling | Sonia Sodha","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/22/medical-research-needs-big-data-tessa-jowell-gets-ball-rolling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/22/medical-research-needs-big-data-tessa-jowell-gets-ball-rolling","fields":{"headline":"Medical research needs big data – Tessa Jowell gets the ball rolling","bodyText":"Half of us born after 1960 will be told we have cancer at some point in our lives. Virtually no one will go through life untouched by the disease, whether as a sufferer, a survivor or supporter. So every year, millions of us lace up running shoes, bake cakes and cultivate moustaches in memory of loved ones to raise the cash needed for cancer research. But money is not the only critical ingredient in developing new cures. An important constraint on the pace of progress is the lack of large datasets that contain valuable information on how patients are responding to different types of treatment. So it is hugely significant that Tessa Jowell has pledged to make a different sort of donation to cancer research. The former culture secretary has won plaudits for her bravery in speaking out about her experience of suffering from an aggressive brain tumour and her calls for greater collaboration in the fight against cancer. She has now announced she will become the first person to donate her health records to a new global cancer database being set up by an Australian philanthropist. Cancer researchers have hailed it a gamechanger: it will enable them to look at what people responding well to particular cancer treatments have in common so as to refine and develop new treatments. It might be difficult to recall at a time when concerns about data privacy have never been more heightened, but 10 years ago, big data was being talked about as the panacea to a range of social ills. Like nudge theory, its potential was unquestionably overhyped, but there is no doubt that in relation to healthcare, our personal data has not just life-changing but lifesaving potential. Observational data from the real world has paved the way for huge medical breakthroughs over the years, including establishing the links between thalidomide and birth defects and between smoking and cancer. But the power of patient data remains cripplingly under-harnessed as a result of privacy concerns. Five years ago, NHS England announced it would be setting up a single, opt-out database – care.data – bringing together millions of patient records. The data would be made available in “pseudonymised” form (with personal information such as name and address removed) to medical researchers in the public and private sectors. There are, however, privacy risks to such an undertaking that can’t be eliminated. Even when data is pseudonymised, there’s a small risk people can be identified if the information were matched with data from other datasets, for example those held by insurance companies. The public accounts committee said that last year’s NHS ransomware attack was made possible by a lack of investment in cybersecurity – which doesn’t inspire confidence. The NHS sent every household a leaflet to explain the endeavour that “raised more questions than it answered”, according to the independent health data guardian. It certainly wasn’t clear about what sort of safeguards might be adopted to ensure patient data would not get into the wrong hands. So the resulting public outcry was perhaps inevitable and resulted in the whole thing being scrapped a couple of years ago. The tragic price? Potential delays to medical advances that could help us find new cures for diseases such as dementia and cancer. Today, we are awash with examples of how our personal data could potentially be put to malign use. Insurers would love to get their hands on our health data so they can charge us premiums based on how likely we are to become ill. A social media giant such as Facebook is able to use the massive amounts of data it holds on us, including our likes, our private messages and our reading habits, to try to predict how we will react to commercial and political advertising and push us targeted marketing accordingly – a capability its developers are continuously honing. And companies can use data to evade regulation and help them to break the law. The New York Times last year revealed how Uber had been using passenger data to systematically deceive local law enforcement officials. Too often, data experts throw up their hands at the way in which we apparently undervalue the privacy of our personal data. The saga over care.data shows us how far from the truth this is: people can get very animated about the privacy of our data when we don’t trust the people charged with keeping it safe and the benefits are either poorly explained or feel obtuse or too far into the future. But there is a tragic asymmetry in our response to care.data and to the big tech companies. Revelations about the reams of personal data that Facebook and Google hold about us, including which events in your calendar you actually attended and which apps you use and when, haven’t resulted in masses of people closing their accounts. We seem to be less anguished about under-regulated, global tech giants holding deeply personal information about us than an arm’s-length NHS body. That asymmetry isn’t surprising – it’s just yet another product of our irrationality. We trade away our data for short-term benefits such as the convenience of an app, but the risks make us more reluctant to hand it over in service of long-term collective benefits such as improved medical care and new cures for diseases. If we are to beat diseases such as cancer and dementia, that irrationality is something we need to overcome. Tessa Jowell has taken the first step. Hopefully some of us will follow. Perhaps in 10 years’ time, we’ll see people running races and baking cakes asking not just for cash sponsorship – but for friends and family to donate their health data. • Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14973","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T23:00:06Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,973","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14973","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14973","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,973","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/21/watford-v-crystal-palace-sunderland-v-burton-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T16:54:41Z","webTitle":"Sunderland sink to League One after late loss to Burton – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/21/watford-v-crystal-palace-sunderland-v-burton-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/21/watford-v-crystal-palace-sunderland-v-burton-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"Sunderland sink to League One after late loss to Burton – as it happened","bodyText":"Ok, that concludes today’s clockwatch.

Here’s Ed Aarons’ report from Vicarage Road. Sunderland’s Twitter feed still yet to admit the club will be in League One next season. News from the lower reaches, where it’s been a big day for the self-styled “Class of ‘92” (and Phil Neville). Salford City will play in the National League next season. As we wait for reports from Watford and Sunderland to come in, Richard McGahey emails in on the ref debate. “I don’t know if the tolerance for overly physical play and inconsistent standards is why English refs aren’t going to the World Cup. But the Premier League allows much more physical play, and English fans and commentators reflect this culture in their commentary and analysis--”oh, nothing much in that,” “no intent there,” let the lads play” while Lee Dixon and others on TV pine for the good old days of leg breaking. That’s why it was such a shock to see Michael Oliver calling fouls (inconsistently, of course) in the Juventus-Real Madrid match, and even issuing yellow cards, which he and other English refs don’t do nearly as much in the PL.” Matters across Europe rounded up here. And in all that hubbub, it’s best to round off matters at Bristol City which ended up 5 (five) - 5 (five) with Hull City. Joe Bryan grabbed the equaliser in the 94th minute. Football! The reason Sunderland are relegated is that Burton and Bolton play each other next week. That’s not the only reason of course, but that’s the maths. Sunderland’s Twitter feed still yet to admit the club have been relegated. Having won 4-0 at Bolton. Chesterfield need a 19-goal turnaround on Morecambe to stay up, so are all but down. Chesterfield lost 4-1 at Forest Green, but are not yet relegated after Morecambe lost. That’s now a question of mathematics. A 1-1 draw at Carlisle was enough for them After winning 4-0 at Fleetwood. It’s full-time and it’s finished 2-1 to Burton. Both teams edge to safety after a rather angry affair. Sunderland have just had a goal disallowed for handball. Anger at the Stadium of Light. A disaster for Sunderland, and it is Burton who have hope of survival, as Liam Boyce scores. Darren Bent almost won it for Burton, only to be denied by a great save from Jason Steele. Sunderland hit the bar after Ashley Fletcher’s header. It’s 5-4 to Hull at Bristol City! What a comeback. Fraizer Campbell grabbed it. Drama! And pain for Bristol City. Barnet are now leading 2-0 and can still escape the drop to the National League. Darren Bent scores against his old club and hopes of a great escape are extinguished. Another humdinger between Cambridge and Cheltenham, which is currently a 4-3 scoreline to the home team. 4-4 between Bristol City and Hull! Abel Hernandez has equalised. That could be a felling blow for City’s hopes of sidling into the play-offs. Forest Green lead Chesterfield 2-1 and that puts Chesterfield on the edge of their first time outside the Football League for almost 110 years. Luton, drawing 1-1 at Carlisle, are close to being promoted, but need Exeter’s 2-2 scoreline with Crawley to hold. Joseph Harvey has a view on the Zaha booking “Is it just me or has it been a terrible year in the EPL for referees? That Zaha penalty was a stone dead penalty. He got a yellow for diving. Could part of the problem be that the FA and the referee’s association in England want a game that just doesn’t resemble the rulebook anymore? The idea that a punch in the WBA match earlier is part of the game, that contact off the ball isn’t a penalty, and that there wasn’t enough contact (on a high boot in the box) for the penalty in case of Zaha, just isn’t consistent with the laws of the game. I can think of more than a dozen or so events like this across the year. It’s been weighing on my mind a lot since England won’t have any referees at the World Cup.” Isn’t England’s lack of referees down to Mark Clattenburg choosing to work in Saudi Arabia? And perhaps a lack of familiarity with VAR? Sheffield Wednesday lead Reading 3-0, after another Fernando Forestieri goal. It’s now AFC Wimbledon 2-2 Oldham. A tense afternoon down at the Cherry Red Stadium. Meanwhile, Burton are piling on the pressure against Sunderland, who are trying to hold on to their lifeline. Bristol City 4-3 Hull: What a game out west. Harry Wilson, on loan from Liverpool, has got Hull back into it. Watford are living dangerously against Crystal Palace, who have had a shot cleared off the line. But it’s still 0-0. Birmingham City lead Sheffield United 2-1, and with Bolton losing, this could be a big say for Blues. Middlesbrough lead Derby 2-0 after a goal from Britt Assombalonga. How wrong can you be? Bury have equalised at Shrewsbury through Jay O’Shea. And as it stands, Wigan, now leading 4-0, will be heading to the Championship. Wolves are 4-0 up and that is desperate news for Bolton. Captain Conor Coady slotted in from the penalty spot. Bristol City now lead Hull City 4-2. A humdinger at Ashton Gate. Penalty to Palace? No, Wilfried Zaha has been booked for diving. There was contact, too, and the Watford pariah is being jeered by the home fans. Wilfried Zaha is at the centre of things at Watford as Palace begin to put together some attacking pressure on. He’s taken a few whacks. Wigan lead 3-0 at Fleetwood after a Dan Burn goal. They are now waiting on a Bury equaliser to confirm their promotion, which may be some wait considering that Bury have already been relegated. Some duff info on that Barnsley equaliser. In fact, Oli McBurnie’s goal was ruled out for offside. Still 2-1 to Leeds United. Aston Villa lead 2-0 at Norwich now, after Lewis Grabban scored against his old club. Bristol City lead Hull 3-1 and as it stands will be a point outside the play-offs. Barnsley have equalised at Leeds, and now Wolves are 3-0 up on Bolton, who are losing goal difference on Sunderland. A great escape might - might - just be happening. That relegation six-pointer in League One is now AFC Wimbledon 1-1 Oldham. Leeds United are leading Barnsley 2-1 now, which is great news for Sunderland and Birmingham of the teams trying to avoid the drop. Here’s some more Wenger love. There is something rather sad about the faded red seats at the Stadium of Light. And these days, there are plenty on view. We are back underway in the second halves of the 3pm kick-offs. What looks likely to be decided in the next 45 minutes? Wolves to claim the Championship title Wigan to be promoted from League One Accrington to be champions of League Two Torquay to plunge down from the National League Macclesfield are already promoted from the National League Of course, the big news of the weekend is still Friday’s events at the Emirates. QPR goalkeeper Matt Ingram will take no further part for his team, having been injured in the incident which led to the Brentford penalty he subsequently saved from Ollie Watkins. Idrissa Sylla has just equalised for QPR at Brentford. At Watford, it’s half-time with Crystal Palace and still 0-0, but one yellow card. Here’s some Harry the Hornet v Zaha memories. Wolves are 2-0 up at Bolton, after a goal from Benik Afobe. The Championship trophy is within reach and so is 100 points. There are handbags at Watford, over a disputed penalty. It is Wilfried Zaha who was been accused of simulation and Watford players were not very happy with him. There is history there. Remember Harry the Hornet performing a dive to Zaha? Bristol City, chasing a play-off place, though probably in vain are now 2-1 up on Hull City. Another lifeline, this time for Chesterfield, who have just scored an equaliser through Kristian Dennis from a penalty at Forest Green. Wigan 2-0 up at Fleetwood - is Joey Barton watching? - and they are heading back to the Championship. Meanwhile, Barnsley have equalised at Leeds through Paudie O’Connor. The strugglers are really fighting for their lives. Fernando Forestieri has just scored for Sheffield Wednesday against Reading. 1-0. Should Sunderland land a win here, they will be three points shy of safety, and still breathing. That is desperate news for Burton. Paddy McNair, who scored a pearler last week at Reading, has scored his third in four matches. Lifeline for Birmingham City, who have just scored against Sheffield United to equalise. Marc Roberts with the goal. Forest Green against Chesterfield, who are hanging on to their league status by a thread. Aston Villa lead 1-0 at Ipswich as they seek to stay in form ahead of the play-offs. Watford piling on the pressure against Palace, but still no goal. Interesting stat on West Brom In a vital play-off encounter, Middlesbrough lead Derby 1-0. Mo Besic drilled in. The power of Pulis may be coming to the play-offs. Brentford lead the West London derby between them and QPR after a goal from Sergi Canos. And with Barnsley now losing 1-0 to Leeds, that is good news for both Sunderland and Reading. We just need something to happen between those two clubs. Wolves’ title celebration is imminent after Barry Douglas’ goal puts them 1-0 up at Bolton. Luton Town, chasing automatic promotion from League Two, are losing 1-0 to Carlisle. In League One, a vital goal perhaps as AFC Wimbledon lead Oldham in the battle to avoid relegation, while Shrewsbury, chasing automatic promotion, lead Bury, already relegated, 1-0. At the very bottom of the league, Barnet are 1-0 up on Newport. Martin Allen’s five-time manager bounce may yet pull the Bees out of the mire. Wolves, who need a single point to be champions, are under a bit of pressure from Bolton, themselves trying to escape the drop zone. Sheffield United are 1-0 up on Birmingham City, who are only two points clear of the bottom three. Mark Duffy with the goal. That’s good news for Sunderland and Reading. And Watford hit the crossbar. It’s Okaka again with the chance. Watford have begun the brighter against Palace, and Will Hughes has just gone close to setting up an opener for Okaka. Ok, we are underway in the 3pm kick-offs. Watford will start with two strikers today in Stefano Okaka and Troy Deeney. Manager Javi Gracia, in charge for only games so far but still in danger of feeling the annual managerial axe from Watford’s owners, is going for this one. Roy Hodgson speaks ahead of Crystal Palace’s match at Watford. We have decided to go with the same side but the good news is now we do have players on the bench who can not only change our formation but also our fortune. It’s all about performances and we know if we play well we can get points. More on Brendan Rodgers, who was evasive but not dismissive of reports linking him with the Arsenal job. He said this before Celtic lost 2-1 to Hibs. I’m extremely happy and I’ve got three years left on my contract after this year. The club have been brilliant to me since I came in so I don’t think so much about it to be honest. More Silkmen love here. It will be nervy at the Stadium of Light, where ears will be glued to portable radios or, to be more modern, button will be pushed on smartphones, as news is awaited from Birmingham and Bolton’s games. In Scotland, Brendan Rodgers’ hopes of landing the Arsenal job have taken a blow after Celtic lost 2-1 to Hibernian. That delays Celtic’s title celebrations. Here’s an amended version of what is still at stake through the divisions. West Brom can still go down if Swansea win at Manchester City tomorrow and if Crystal Palace win or draw today with Watford. So, all Baggies eyes will be on those matches. Well, those who think there is still a chance. Here’s the story of the Silkmen. Well done the Silkmen, well done John Askey. The whistle has gone at Eastleigh. Full-time at the Hawthorns: West Brom 2-2 Liverpool The Baggies stay alive and Jürgen Klopp is hot happy with the referee here. Darren Moore is doing one hell of a job for West Brom. What a caretaker manager bounce he is having. Just like Gary Megson did, in fact. Here’s the teams from the derby of imminent doom. Sunderland: Steele, Jones, Kone, O’Shea, Wilson, Cattermole, McManaman, Honeyman, McNair, McGeady, Fletcher. Subs: LuaLua, Camp, Maja, Matthews, Asoro, Clarke-Salter, Ejaria. Burton Albion: Bywater, Brayford, Naylor, McFadzean, McCrory, Davenport, Akins, Murphy, Akpan, Sbarra, Boyce. Subs: Allen, Turner, Bent, Sordell, Samuelsen, Buxton, Campbell. Referee: Darren England (South Yorkshire) Now it’s 2-2 at West Brom! Rondon with the headed equaliser. Hope for the Baggies indeed. Roma will be practicing set pieces like mad. In the Premier League, West Brom are heading for a weekend relegation if tomorrow’s results go against them. Liverpool lead 2-1. Danny Ings and Mohamed Salah got Liverpool’s goals, while Jake Livermore’s goal has given the Baggies a sliver of hope. The good news for Liverpool is that Salah has left the field. Looked to have taken a slight knock but nothing too serious. He’ll surely be OK for Roma. Here’s Rob Smyth with the dying embers. Here’s the teams from Vicarage Road. Watford: Karnezis, Mariappa, Cathcart, Kabasele, Holebas, Hughes, Doucoure, Capoue, Deeney, Okaka, Pereyra. Subs: Gomes, Janmaat, Britos, Richarlison, Sinclair, Gray, Femenia. Crystal Palace: Hennessey, Ward, Tomkins, Sakho, Van Aanholt, McArthur, Milivojevic, Cabaye, Loftus-Cheek, Townsend, Zaha. Subs: Speroni, Sorloth, Lee, Benteke, Wan Bissaka, Kelly, Riedewald. The news from Eastleigh is that Macc Town are 2-0 up and heading back to the Football League. They previously spent a 15-year spell up there, and were promoted to League One - or was it Division Two - after the 1997-8 season. There, they played Manchester City. It is fair to say the two clubs have gone in different directions since then. There is an FA Cup-shaped hole in the Premier League this weekend, but still plenty to play for at Vicarage Road, going solo as a 3pm kick-off. Watford and Palace are edging to safety, with Watford, on 37 points, probably already there and Palace, having secured that vital 3-2 victory over Brighton last week, three points behind them. In the EFL, it could be a decisive day. Sunderland and Burton could both be relegated if the teams above them win and they draw. The loser in that game will be suffer the same fate if Bolton and Birmingham win. Wolves will be crowned Football League champions if they avoid defeat against Bolton. In League One, Wigan will be promoted if win at Fleetwood on Saturday and Shrewsbury fail to beat already-demoted Bury at home. In League Two, Luton can join Accrington in being promoted if they beat Carlisle, while Barnet and Chesterfield could go down if they fail to win and other results go against them. And from the National League, Macclesfield will go up to the Football League if they win their early kick-off at Eastleigh. Here’s a handy guide to what is at stake."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/everyman/3733","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T23:00:27Z","webTitle":"Everyman crossword No 3,733","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/everyman/3733","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/everyman/3733","fields":{"headline":"Everyman crossword No 3,733","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/21/west-brom-v-liverpool-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T13:49:28Z","webTitle":"West Brom 2-2 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/21/west-brom-v-liverpool-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/21/west-brom-v-liverpool-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"West Brom 2-2 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s about it for our new MBM afterparty. One last bit of business: Macclesfield Town have been promoted back to the Football League. Please join John Brewin for this afternoon’s matches, and I’ll be back for the FA Cup semi-final at 5.15pm. See you then. Jurgen Klopp is not a happy man “We controlled the game pretty well. They only really had opportunities from set pieces. They were blocking the goalkeeper the whole game on corners – I know everyone likes that in this country but it makes like quite difficult for the goalie. I heard the second goal was not a foul. I don’t know why [Hegazi punched Ings]. You need a bit of … not help, just the right decisions, and then we win here 3-0 or 3-1. “It was a difficult game as the pitch got drier and drier – they obviously decided not to water it at half-time. I was not happy with the pitch. You’ve never played football obviously because it makes a massive difference if you want to pass the ball. If you’re like West Brom and you play the ball constantly in the air you don’t need a wet pitch. I’m not in the mood to talk about positive things but tomorrow I’ll tell Danny how good it was to see him score.” West Brom 2-2 Liverpool Stuart James’ match report from the Hawthorns has dropped - and here it is. Steve McMahon, who is in the Sky studio, is unhappy about a few things: zonal marking, Lorus Karius, Jurgen Klopp not picking his first-choice back four, West Brom’s effort. I’m looking forward to The Debate featuring Steve McMahon and Ian Wright. Liverpool weren’t happy with the award of the free-kick for the second goal. It looked a fair decision on the replays. That said, Liverpool should have had a penalty at 1-0 for a foul on Ings. The goalscorer Jake Livermore speaks “It’s a shame we’re running out of time as we’ve started to get a bit of belief and confidence in the last few games. All we can do is keep fighting and see what happens. It’s not for the want of trying. Confidence is a massive thing and we’ve thrown away a lot of points from winning positions.” The team news is in for the 3pm games up and down the country. John Brewin, who can name every starting XI in Premier League history, is following those matches - so you don’t have to! Here’s the updated Premier League table. Liverpool aren’t guaranteed a top-four place but they shouldn’t have any problems. In case you’ve just woken up in a pool of your own drool, it finished 2-2 at the Hawthorns. Danny Ings scored early on for Liverpool, his first goal since 2015, and the inevitable Mo Salah put them 2-0 up in the second half. That seemed to be that, but West Brom scored twice from set pieces to earn a point. Jake Livermore and Salomon Rondon got the goals, and they might even have snatched an absurd win. Jurgen Klopp does not look particularly happy with life. He’s having a chat with Ragnar Klavan about something or other. It doesn’t really matter, as Liverpool are going to finish in the top four and, most importantly, they didn’t get any injuries ahead of the Roma game. West Brom showed plenty of character to continue their impressive mini-run. They are going down with a belated fight, and could at least sneak off the bottom of the table before the end of the season. Peep peep! 90+3 min Burke, found by Evans on the edge of the box, slashes at fresh air. Liverpool, who were cruising 15 minutes ago, are now hanging on for a draw. 90+3 min Milner slaps a shot over the bar from 20 yards. 90+2 min A superb defensive header from Van Dijk saves Liverpool, with Phillips about to get on the end of Rondon’s cross. 90+2 min There will be four minutes of added time. Brunt’s long throw is headed on by Livermore and collected by Karius. 90+1 min West Brom are going down, but this has been a stirring little run under Darren Moore: three games, five points, no defeats. 90 min Karius was again in no man’s land for that goal. His shot-stopping can be excellent but he is a joke on set pieces. 89 min West Brom bring on Hal Robson-Kanu for Jay Rodriguez. Oh me, oh my. It’s 2-2! Brunt whips in a brilliant free-kick from the left, and Rondon gets in front of Lovren at the near post to stoop and head past Karius! 86 min A great chance for West Brom to equalise! Lovren’s weak backheader is straight into the path of Rondon, whose attempted lob is excellently saved by the advancing Karius. 85 min Liverpool are playing with a back five now, which is inviting a bit of pressure. Oxlade-Chamberlain leads a break and hits a big, deep cross beyond the far post. Firmino tries to guide a header back across Foster but can’t quite get around the ball and it drifts safely across the six-yard line. 83 min Liverpool make their final change, with Dejan Lovren replacing Mo Salah. 82 min Liverpool have responded well to that goal, with three minutes of almost uninterrupted possession. West Brom score from the corner. Brunt’s booming, deep inswinger was helped back into the six-yard area by Rodriguez. Dawson’s shot was blocked by Karius but Livermore turned it in from close range. 78 min Brunt waves a lovely pass over the top with the outside of his left foot. Phillips gets there first and cushions a volley back to Rodriguez, who is about to shoot when Klavan appears to concede a corner. 76 min Another West Brom change: Oliver Burke replaces Kieran Gibbs. 75 min That was Salah’s 41st goal of the season and his 31st in the league. For a wide forward, that’s ridiculous. 74 min Oxlade-Chamberlain will surely start at the World Cup. He is playing beautifully at the moment. The Mo-ssiah gets his obligatory goal. He’s been a bit wasteful today but that was beautifully taken. Oxlade-Chamberlain put him through with a gorgeous reverse pass, and Salah took a touch before dinking the ball gently over the advancing Foster. Lovely goal. 71 min A West Brom change: Jonny Evans replaces James McClean, with Kieran Gibbs moving into McClean’s stead. 70 min Dawson’s acrobatic volley bounces around the area and eventually through to Karius. Liverpool have dealt well, if a touch desperately, with West Brom’s set pieces. 69 min Moreno is booked for an inept hack at Phillips, who has the beating of him. 69 min “Rob, I’m working on my reaction,” says Charles Antaki. “Not sure about what, but thanks for the advance notice. Like many people I guess I’m all over the place, and that’s just about Arsène, so a bit of rumination first is a good idea. [Many minutes later] Nope, it’s not working. Can I come back to you early next season?” Always. 68 min Nyom plays a despicable pass straight to Salah, who runs into the area before messing up a fancy flick towards Firmino. 67 min A win would take Liverpool to within a point of second-placed Manchester United, having played a game more. 66 min Liverpool make a double substitution: Roberto Firmino and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain replace the goalscorer Danny Ings and and Sadio Mane. 64 min After a decent start to the second half by West Brom, Liverpool are again in control of the game. 63 min Salah runs at the heart of the defence, used Mane by not using him and then hits a low shot is blocked by Nyom. 61 min “Just tuned in,” says Scott Oliver. “Pitch looks slow. Which may explain why WBA are looking to sit back against Liverpool’s pace, hoping it may turn later... What season is this?” Shomer shabbos? 59 min Phillips rampages into the area from the right, a superb run that ends with an attempted cutback to Rodriguez. The angle isn’t great and Van Dijk clears for a corner. 56 min Ings is penalised for fouling Hegazi. The two of them fall on the floor, at which points Hegazi punches Ings in the stomach! That was really odd. It wasn’t a proper punch, but he should have been sent off. 53 min West Brom are playing with greater intensity in the second half, which will please Steve McMahon. 52 min Foster’s long free-kick bounces all the way through to Rondon in the area. Karius flies out and dives forward dramatically to push the ball partially away from Rondon. That leaves Karius out of the game and ahead of the ball, but it falls kindly for Liverpool and Klavan lumps it clear. 52 min The only reason I can think for Stuart Attwell not giving Liverpool a penalty is that Ings was not in possession of the ball. But that has nothing to do with anything, really. 51 min “Fine words from Steve McMahon on Sky,” says Richard South. “Even though he doesn’t advocate just kicking people, he thinks West Brom should just kick Liverpool a bit more. That’s the kind of tactical insight that earns you the big bucks.” 50 min McClean screws a shot well wide from 20 yards. 48 min Salah plays a slick give and go with Mane, bursts into the box ... and then leaves the ball behind. I’m not sure what happened then because it looked like he was about to score. 47 min Liverpool appeal for a penalty when Dawson blocks Ings in the box. Ings was nowhere near the ball but that doesn’t really matter and Dawson certainly tripped him. The only debate is whether it was obstruction, and therefore an indirect free-kick, or a foul. It looked like the latter. 47 min “Has Gary Naylor seen/heard Tim Minchin’s Groundhog Day?” asks Matt Dony. “Sondheim had planned to write it, but decided that the film couldn’t be improved upon. So big respect to Minchin for effectively saying, ‘Hold my drink, Stephen. I’ll get it sorted.’ I have Hamilton tickets for July, and I am very, very excited. Almost as excited as I am by the prospect of Salah tearing past Real Madrid in Kiev...” 46 min Peep peep! West Brom begin the second half. Sign! Sign! Sign! We’re going to extend today’s MBM to take in a bit of post-match reaction, so please do stick around after the final whistle. Think of it as an MBM afterparty, with the sex and drugs replaced by hardcore soccer chat. A bit of half-time reading Peep peep! A sleepy half of football comes to an end. Liverpool lead through Danny Ings’ first goal since 2015; he also had a great chance to make it 2-0. West Brom have had their moments, though Liverpool have generally been in control. 44 min “Hi Rob,” says Steven Ferriday. “Re: the manager rumble. Moore is a good shout, but I think Dyche would ultimately prevail using the Mountain’s finishing move on Oberyn Martell in Game of Thrones. Conte would bring a big knife and complain it isn’t sharp enough.” 42 min Salah scurries into the area again. Gibbs’ desperate tackle diverts the ball to Ings, whose close-range shot is superbly blocked by the outrushing Foster. If Ings had his time again he’d lift it over Foster. It was a really good save, though. 42 min “Hodgson for me too, Rob,” says Elliot Wilson. “Like Toby Ziegler in the West Wing, he’d fight nasty with a sock full of pennies in his clenched fist.” I’ve just started watching the West Wing. I suppose I can’t really complain about plotspoiling a program that has been on TV for 19 years. 41 min Liverpool have switched off a bit in the last 10 minutes. It feels like they have a few gears available if they need them. 38 min “If we’re talking Ritchie Partridge,” says Paul Neilan, “give the man his full title: ‘Ritchie Partridge AM R/L £190K’. Obscenely, the same price as Stephen Halliday (Full title: ‘Stephen Halliday AM/FC £190K’.)” At what age do you think it becomes unacceptable to reinstall Championship Manager 2001/02. I’M ASKING FOR AN EFFING FRIEND OKAY. 37 min West Brom’s best chance. Livermore swings a high, deep cross from the right that comes to McClean at a tight angle beyond the far post. He volleys it back across goal and just wide of the far post, with the stretching Rodriguez unable to turn it into the net. I’m not sure whether that was a cross or a shot from McClean but either way it was a good effort. 36 min A good spell for West Brom, who win four corners in quick succession. The second of those, taken by Phillips, flashes right across the line of goal with Karius out of the game. 31 min “If all the current managers had to fight,” says JR in Illinois, “I would take Darren Moore.” Hodgson for me, Clive. 29 min Rondon is very lucky not to booked for a crunching tackle on Ings. 28 min West Brom haven’t been able to land anything on Liverpool’s weakened defence. Van Dijk, as usual, is playing the game with a resting heart rate. I think he’s magnificent. 26 min ... and Salah curls a nice free-kick just wide of the near post. Foster had it covered, I think. 25 min Milner is playing so well. He flips a classy pass over the top for Salah, who turns Hegazi and is pulled back. Liverpool have a free-kick 25 yards from goal, to the right of centre... 24 min Liverpool are having so much possession. Milner’s cross from the right is headed over from 10 yards by Ings, who saw it late as it came over Hegazi’s head. 22 min Rodriguez plays a nice reverse pass infield for Phillips, who works the ball onto his left foot but drives tamely at Karius. It was a half chance at best. 20 min Milner has been really lively in midfield. Mane also looks sharp; after a dodgy few months he is bang in form. 18 min Brunt spanks a long-range half-volley into orbit with his weaker right foot. 17 min “Very disappointing to see Klopp is not giving fringe players like Ritchie Partridge, Conor Coady, Ings, Aspas, or even Macheda a go,” says Paul Griffin. “Reluctantly concluding that, like Pep at Citeh, The Big German has taken Liverpool as far as he can.” I agree. In fact, I’m starting to wonder whether football has taken football as far as it can. 16 min Phillips’ terrific cross is headed behind for a corner by Gomez. Brunt drives a deep corner to Dawson, who nods it into the six-yard box. Karius punches clear but a couple of West Brom players were offside anyway. 15 min Nyom is a bit lucky not to be booked for a lunge at Milner. 13 min Salah goes on another Messi-like run at the West Brom defence, who look terrified every time he gets the ball. Eventually Hegazi’s attempted clearance hits Salah and runs out for a goalkick. 11 min Salah scurries away from Hegazi on the right side of the box and whips a shot that loops just over the bar after a deflection off Livermore. 11 min Van Dijk is limping. He landed a bit awkwardly in the process of tackling Rondon. I don’t think it’s anything serious though. 10 min “Salad Days is just about my favourite musical (well, until I see Hamilton in three weeks, six days and five hours time),” says Gary Naylor. “The plot concerns a magic piano that compels everyone to dance (and there’s a spaceship too, natch). It’s all very different to Klopp’s Heavy Metal Football, but actually fits the way his front three have danced through defences this season - salad days indeed.” 9 min Liverpool are swaggering around the Hawthorns like they own the place. They are so damn hot right now. 6 min That was a really uplifting moment. Ings closed his eyes and screwed his face up as he tried to take it all in. All that rehab, all those bloody weights and squat thrusts and ice baths and misery... they were all worth it. Danny Ings gets his first goal since October 2015! He’s almost in tears of joy. It came from a short corner that was worked nicely by Mane and Milner. Mane’s low cross was stopped by Wijnaldum and rammed in from eight yards by Ings. 2 min “Stuck at work on a day like this and in the midst of a breakup, but will be keeping track of the match,” says James Cookson. “I really REALLY want Ings to get on the scoresheet. The lad deserves it.” He sure does. His last goal was in Brendan Rodgers’ final game, wasn’t it? I have no idea where players get the strength to come back from long-term injury. I’d disappear into a slough of booze and Deliveroo. 1 min Peep peep! Liverpool get the match under way on a lovely spring afternoon at the Hawthorns. The players are in the tunnel, which means it’s nearly business o’clock. My prediction, since you didn’t ask, is West Brom 1-4 Liverpool. “Salad days?” writes Patrick. “Salah days surely?” Arf, very good. I’ll be stealing that one! West Brom are unchanged from the team that won at Old Trafford. Liverpool, with Roma in mind, make five changes: Firmino, Lovren, Alexander-Arnold, Robertson and Oxlade-Chamberlain are all rested. An email! “Salad days they are but a lot of us (older) Liverpool fans are waiting for the worm to pop out of the tomato,” says Niall Mullen. “The David James against Coventry, the Federico effing Macheda, the Gerrard sli... I can’t even say it. Our previous relative success has always felt like a one off, built on sand &amp; unable to withstand any misfortune. I’d love to see us back this season up without, metaphorically speaking, buying Rickie Lambert again.” Pre-match reading West Brom (4-4-2) Foster; Nyom, Dawson, Hegazi, Gibbs; Phillips, Livermore, Brunt, McClean; Rondon, Rodriguez. Substitutes: Myhill, Evans, Yacob, Burke, Krychowiak, Field, Robson-Kanu. Liverpool (4-3-3) Karius; Gomez, Van Dijk, Klavan, Moreno; Wijnaldum, Henderson, Milner; Salah, Ings, Mane. Substitutes: Mignolet, Lovren, Firmino, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Robertson, Solanke, Alexander-Arnold. Referee Stuart Attwell. Hello. Bliss it is in this dawn to be alive, but to be a Liverpool fan must be very heaven. These are salad days for Jurgen Klopp’s team, whose intrepid Champions League campaign continues against Roma at Anfield on Tuesday. That puts today’s visit to West Brom in a slightly underwhelming context, but the word on the street is that Klopp will pick a very strong side. Liverpool will want to extend the feelgood mood of recent weeks. West Brom had an unlikely hit of happiness last weekened, when they won at Old Trafford. They also knocked Liverpool out of the FA Cup at Anfield in January, a result that boggles the mind a little more each week. Their relegation is unlikely to be confirmed this weekend, but they will be put out of their misery soon enough. Kick off is at 12.30pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/20/talking-horses-hot-weather-procedures-in-place-at-newbury-and-fontwell-horse-racing-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T09:27:54Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Ruby Walsh forced to miss Punchestown festival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/20/talking-horses-hot-weather-procedures-in-place-at-newbury-and-fontwell-horse-racing-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/20/talking-horses-hot-weather-procedures-in-place-at-newbury-and-fontwell-horse-racing-tips","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Ruby Walsh forced to miss Punchestown festival","bodyText":"2.45pm Walsh misses Punchestown with leg injury Chris Cook: Ruby Walsh has ruled himself out of the Punchestown Festival, having failed to make the hoped-for recovery after rebreaking a leg at Cheltenham last month. The 38-year-old will not now be available to assist his long-term employer Willie Mullins in the frantic defence of his champion trainer’s title. “I kind of knew it was coming,” Walsh said on Friday, in comments first reported by Racing UK. He has been wearing a cushioned boot on his right leg since he and Al Boum Photo fell in the RSA Chase. “I tested the water last week by taking off the boot and tried to walk on it but it wasn’t strong enough. It is hugely disappointing but I am looking forward to riding once again in the new season.” There may be some relief that Walsh will not rush himself back into action and will instead give his leg the time it needs to heal. When he reinjured the leg at Cheltenham, he had been back riding for less than a week, having suffered the original break in November. Since he misses Punchestown, there will presumably be no great pressure on Walsh to return until the Galway festival three months from now. Asked about what rides he would be missing at Punchestown, Walsh quickly reeled off the names of Douvan, Un De Sceaux, Penhill and Faugheen among others. “It is going to be fascinating and disappointing to watch in equal measure,” the jockey added. Punchestown provides the climax to the jumps season in Ireland and Mullins, who has been champion trainer for the last decade, must do at least as well as he usually does in this week, if he is to have any chance of retaining the title. Gordon Elliott’s lead is a shade over €500,000. Meanwhile, connections of Expert Eye are hoping to see a cooler, calmer horse going into the stalls for today’s Greenham Stakes at Newbury than the one who undermined his chance at the start of the Dewhurst in October. Khalid Abdullah’s horse is available at even-money for this return to action, which might lead to a tilt at the 2,000 Guineas next month. “We’ve worked on him in lots of ways and his progression has been pretty smooth,” said Lord Grimthorpe, racing manager to Expert Eye’s owner. “He’s been to Chelmsford the other day, did a nice, gentle piece of work. He schooled on the racecourse this week, never turned a hair. I think we have to be hopeful.” “Obviously we were extremely disappointed with the Dewhurst, especially bearing in mind how he had worked prior to the race. We went with a good deal of confidence. It wasn’t to be. “He was obviously a little bit anxious just before the stalls and in the stalls, which probably didn’t help. We knew our fate after about three furlongs. He was pulling too hard, not concentrating. I suppose, if there’s one good thing about it, it was just too bad to be true. “There’s no question he’s got some talent. We wanted to give him this trial to get him back on track, so it is an important race for him. The horse is in good form, we’re going there with a level of confidence but not without some apprehension, given his last start. Certainly, we’re treating him like he could be a very good horse.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/20/trivium-review-o2-academy-glasgow","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T09:50:02Z","webTitle":"Trivium review – heavy metal headbangers just wanna have fun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/20/trivium-review-o2-academy-glasgow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/20/trivium-review-o2-academy-glasgow","fields":{"headline":"Trivium review – heavy metal headbangers just wanna have fun","bodyText":"With such cheerfully titled songs in their setlist as Inception of the End and Drowned and Torn Asunder, eight-album veteran Floridian heavy metal foursome Trivium look, on paper, like a band in need of an emergency sense of humour transplant. But to see them live is to be reminded that sometimes even serious headbangers just wanna have fun. Threading together the kick drum-slapping stentorian gallop of Iron Maiden, the stomach-lurching heaviosity of Metallica and the screeching guitar solos of Megadeth, Trivium make fast, physical and faintly ridiculous music that demands a commensurate response from the crowd. The turbocharged thrashing instrumental passage of Sever the Hand has scores of people whirling around in a cauldron of mosh, even before frontman Matt Heafy starts whipping everybody into a more calculated frenzy. A tall, lean and tattooed devil-horning dude with a propensity for sticking out his tongue that would shame an unruly toddler, Heafy is like an ebullient life coach, showering superlatives on his fans (“Awesome!”, “Incredible!”, “Beautiful!”, “Unbelievable!”). By challenging the Glasgow crowd to top other crowds thus far on Trivium’s European tour – Paris is the one to beat, apparently – he encourages an audience by no means shy in the crowdsurfing stakes to fully take flight. Surreally, one guy even goes for it while Heafy is talking between songs. Abandon hope all ye who enter a Trivium show in search of something more profound than a whole lot of instrumental virtuosity and an excuse to get a bit silly – the hair-raising choruses of Until the World Goes Cold and The Heart from Your Hate perhaps notwithstanding. But as shuddering closer In Waves sends tides of black-clad bodies rolling towards the crash barriers, it’s hard not to get swept along in the daft exuberance of it all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/23/we-thought-thats-not-right-indigenous-artefacts-return-home","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T18:00:29Z","webTitle":"'It was the greatest thing': jubilation at return of Indigenous artefacts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/23/we-thought-thats-not-right-indigenous-artefacts-return-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/23/we-thought-thats-not-right-indigenous-artefacts-return-home","fields":{"headline":"'It was the greatest thing': jubilation at return of Indigenous artefacts","bodyText":"When Dave and Sue Akers became caretakers of Naree Station Reserve, a remote parcel of land about two hours up a dirt road out the back of Bourke, they came across some distressing garden ornaments. At some point over the land’s post-colonisation history, the station owners had gathered Indigenous artefacts from across the 14,400 hectares, and brought them to the homestead. • Sign up to receive the top stories every morning “Some were just strewn around the paddock,” says Dave Akers. “We thought that’s not right, they need to be treated better than that.” Naree is on Budjiti country, and is managed as a partnership between environmental NGO Bush Heritage and traditional owners like Budjiti elder Phil Eulo. “It was the greatest thing that ever happened,” recalls Eulo. “We’ve got a grinding plate, a stone axe, a couple of tools, and a grinding stone, and message sticks – they’re soft white material, not from around here. “The old people used to mark them when they were going through someone else’s territory and send a scout ahead of them with this stick, to show the tribe there and get permission.” Bush Heritage bought Naree, in far northwest New South Wales, in 2012 to preserve the ecologically significant landscape – what it says is the healthiest floodplain system in the Murray Darling Basin. The reserve – one of 44 owned by Bush Heritage across Australia – offers protection for several bird species, including the brolga. The organisation has 24 Aboriginal partnerships and manages or assists the management of 8.86m hectares. “Part of our role with Bush Heritage is to develop a relationship with the traditional owners in the area and that was still in its infancy when we came,” Akers tells Guardian Australia. “Gradually we spent time with the people and got to know them and [Sue] floated the idea of repatriating the artefacts to them, put them somewhere of their choosing.” Eulo began walking the rivers searching for an appropriate ancestral campsite, eventually deciding on a raised sand island, surrounded by golden-barked Yapunyah trees, with old hearths visible under the dust. Today, more than 30 members of his family have come to the place he found, including his Aunty Ruby, an elder of the Budjiti people who was born out here. “I’m glad when these things go back, because we don’t move them,” says Aunty Ruby. “We’re not allowed to keep them.” Under NSW law it’s an offence to cause harm to Aboriginal cultural heritage, which includes knowingly moving objects from sites. If a member of the public finds any artefacts – which do not include handicrafts created for sale – they are encouraged to report the artefact and its location to the Office of Environment and Heritage. A spokesman said the department had recently commenced proceedings against a Northern Rivers council, but didn’t provide details on the breach or on any repatriations, which were conducted on a case-by-case basis with Aboriginal communities. It’s midday at Naree’s guest quarters and there’s a flurry of activity as the teenagers practise their dance moves, parents gather the kids together and everyone piles into cars and buses. Eulo in his red ute leads the convoy to the site, where he stands by a fire, waiting for it to burn down a little so he can start the smoking ceremony and send the family members out towards a medicine tree in the clearing. Bruce Shillingsworth leads the young boys in a traditional dance to open the ceremony. Eulo holds each artefact aloft, and describes its use and possible history. “This blue stone is not from around here, it was probably traded,” he says of one. Nearly every family member is handed an artefact to place beneath the tree. Eulo doesn’t know how old they are, and a dating process with a university might be on the horizon. “They’re from our ancestors, put it that way,” he tells Guardian Australia outside the ceremony. “On this property here, we haven’t surveyed the whole of it yet but from what we found so far I’m sure there’s others here.” The repatriation ceremony – Bush Heritage’s first under an Aboriginal partnership – is “incredibly significant”, says Aboriginal partnerships officer Sarah Eccles. “This has always been Budjiti country and their management of this country for hundreds to thousands of generations. What we saw today with the artefacts is a physical reminder of that land management,” she says. “It’s hugely significant that if we’re able to work alongside Bujditi, and provide the opportunity for them to have much stronger decision-making over their country and say over what actually happens.” The return of these artefacts rights a wrong for the Budjiti, but it’s likely there are many more displaced. Cultural artefacts of the Budjiti or indeed any First Nations people could well be sitting in a garden, a shed, or on a shelf, out of place. Guardian Australia has been told – and has confirmed it by calling a few vendors – that they regularly pop up at farm clearance sales. Eulo is confident the artefacts are safe on Naree, and will be respected for what they are and where they are, by Bush Heritage and the caretakers that follow the Akers after they leave this year. “We’ve thought a lot about it and they’re doing the right thing working with us and working together. Putting the artefacts back, if we find new ones, we leave them there where they are,” he says. “That’s what the elders told me, you don’t pick it up, don’t touch it. If it’s in the road of something you can shift it, hide it somewhere. If it’s in a safe place … leave it. It’s been a really lovely journey. Let’s keep doing it, I reckon.” Guardian Australia travelled to Naree with Bush Heritage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/apr/20/pound-dips-as-carney-casts-doubt-on-may-rate-rise-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T16:45:14Z","webTitle":"Bank of England gives mixed signals on rate rise, Trump slams Opec on oil prices - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/apr/20/pound-dips-as-carney-casts-doubt-on-may-rate-rise-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/apr/20/pound-dips-as-carney-casts-doubt-on-may-rate-rise-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Bank of England gives mixed signals on rate rise, Trump slams Opec on oil prices - as it happened","bodyText":"The weakness in sterling against the dollar has given a lift to the UK stock market. The FTSE 100, full of overseas earners which benefit from a fall in the pound, has outperformed European rivals and a downbeat Wall Street. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 39.25 points or 0.54% higher at 7368.17 Germany’s Dax dipped 0.21% to 12,540.50 France’s Cac closed up 0.39% at 5412.83 Italy’s FTSE MIB added 0.16% to 23,829.34 Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.16% at 9884.2. In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.47% to 844.70 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 229 points or 0.93%. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back on Monday. Pharmaceutical group Shire has responded to the fourth takeover proposal from Japan’s Takeda, which values the target at £47 a share. As before, Shire says it is considering its position and will make a further announcement in due course. Shire shares closed in London at 3821.5p, down 3.8%. With last night’s comments from Bank of England governor Mark Carney casting some doubt on whether there will indeed be an interest rate rise in May, the pound continues to slip back against the dollar. It is currently down 0.43% at $1.4028 having soared as high as $1.4376 earlier this week. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: [The pound] is under pressure after Mark Carney’s comments last night. In recent months there was a lot of speculation the Bank of England could hike interest rates next month, and in light of Mr Carney’s remarks, a rate rise looks less likely now. Traders are almost evenly divided over whether there will be a rate hike next month. The pound has enjoyed a positive run recently, and we are now seeing some profit-taking. Sterling has been rising versus the US dollar for over a year, and while it holds above the 1.3800 region, its outlook could remain positive. But against the euro, the pound is faring slightly better and is up 0.14% at €1.1424. Oil prices have slipped further after Donald Trump’s Twitter intervention into the market. Brent crude is now down 0.64% at $73.31 a barrel after earlier hitting a day’s high of $74.15. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: Oil prices [have] rolled over from three-year highs. US President Donald Trump has found another financial market to tweet about. The Donald tweeted that OPEC has pushed oil prices artificially high. It’s hard to argue against, that’s the purpose of forming a cartel. It won’t have escaped Trump’s attention that rising gasoline prices can quickly eclipse any financial benefits to rust belt America from his tax cuts. The question is whether Trump has more than bluster on Twitter to impact the oil price. He probably does, but these tools are already in use. The US government has already opened up drilling rights on and offshore and US production is soaring as a result, adding to supply to the market. Here’s Suhail Mohammed Faraj Al Mazroui, the minister of energy in the United Arab Emirates, on the oil market: Back with the UK and the comments from Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Investec’s chief economist still expects a rate hike in May: The better than expected eurozone consumer confidence figures come despite all the negative headlines surrounding US sanctions and a possible trade war with China. Economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank said: Even though worries about the global economy have been increasing on the back of trade war concerns and a higher oil price, there is still a lot to like for the Eurozone consumer. Inflation has remained subdued despite the higher oil price and unemployment continues to decrease. While consumers may not be on cloud nine anymore, the economic environment remains positive for consumption. Last month, consumer confidence was stable at 0.1, but underlying data revealed another deterioration in consumer sentiment. The lower expectations for inflation count positively in the indicator, making up for deteriorating views on the global economy, personal finances and chances of unemployment. The uncertainty in the global economy stemming from trade war concerns seems to play an important role here. ECB president Mario Draghi recently commented that the direct effects of a trade war on the economy would be quite limited, but that damage through weaker confidence could have a more harmful effect on growth. This release suggests that this channel may not be that concerning for consumers so far, but next week’s PMI release may prove Draghi’s concerns to be more significant for the business sector. Over in the eurozone and consumer confidence rose unexpectedly in April. The European Commission said its consumer confidence index climbed to 0.4, up from 0.1 in March and better than the forecast fall to -0.2. The commission said: The Eurozone’s consumer confidence indicator rose by 0.3 points from the previous month to 0.4 in April 2018, easily beating market expectations of -0.2, a flash estimate showed. In the European Union as a whole, consumer sentiment decreased by 0.5 points to -0.8. Oil producers meeting in Jeddah have hit back after Donald Trump said they were keeping crude prices “artificially high”. Reuters reports: OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo said the pact between OPEC and non-OPEC countries to cut production had halted the collapse in global oil prices, and said the group was a friend of the United States with an interest in its prosperity. Output cuts “not only arrested the decline but rescued the oil industry from imminent collapse and is now on course to restore stability on a sustainable basis in the interest of producers, consumers and the global economy,” Barkindo said. Energy ministers from the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, two OPEC members, also rejected the notion that prices were too high. The bid saga surrounding pharmaceuticals group Shire continues, with Japanese predator Takeda announcing an increase in its offer. The terms are improved from £46.50 to £47 a share, comprising £21 in cash and £26 of new Takeda shares. The new offer values Shire at around £43bn. Nissan is planning to cut hundreds of jobs at its Sunderland factory in response to the sharp fall in demand for diesel cars. The Japanese car manufacturer makes its Qashqai and Juke models at the plant, and said it was talking to workers about the changes. We will be managing a planned short-term reduction in powertrain supply and plant volumes. It’s been a volatile day for the pound against the dollar. Sterling is currently down 0.5% at $1.4019, weighed down by Mark Carney’s comments last night in which he suggested a May rate is not a done deal. The pound is faring better against the euro, up 0.1% at €1.1419. Here’s how it looked when the opening bell rang on Wall Street: Dow Jones: +0.04% at 24,676 S&amp;P 500: +0.02% at 2,694 Nasdaq: -0.2% at 7,223 The FTSE 100 is up 50 points or 0.3% but not all of the UK’s biggest listed firms are having a good day. Shares in consumer giant Reckitt Benckiser are down 3.9%, while drugmaker Shire is down 4.3% after Allergan pulled the plug on a potential takeover bid. Here’s how it looks at the bottom of the table: Andrew Goodwin, lead economist at Oxford Economics, says Mark Carney’s comments last night are a “game changer” and suggest the next rate rise could be put off until June or August: Mark Carney’s BBC interview on Thursday night threatens to be a game changer in terms of May’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting. The MPC had consistently talked up the chances of a May hike, despite a lengthy run of soft economic data, but the Governor gave a clear sign that the Committee is wavering. There is now a very real chance of the next hike being postponed to June, or even August. But more important than the exact timing of the next move is the degree to which a more rapid slowdown in inflation and weak momentum behind wage growth could undermine the MPC’s case for subsequent hikes. Time for another look at the markets across Europe, where the FTSE is still ahead of the pack: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,354 Germany’s DAX: -0.2% at 12,539 France’s CAC: +0.2% at 5,403 Italy’s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 23,833 Spain’s IBEX: +0.1% at 9,879 Europe’s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 381 The UK economy is not the only item on the agenda over at the IMF’s spring meetings in Washington. Helena Smith reports from Athens. After almost a decade of economic crisis and the biggest bailout in global financial history, Greece will be in the spotlight today when international creditors meet in Washington to discuss a debt relief plan for the country. After receiving an estimated €260bn under three successive bailouts, international creditors say the time has come to put Greek finances on a sustainable footing. In what some are calling a day of reckoning for the hugely indebted state, the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank heads and finance ministers of the strongest eurozone member states will begin drafting a debt relief plan for the country. The discussion by members of the so-called Washington Group is expected to be instrumental in facilitating Greece’s ability to stand on its own feet again when its current – and last – bailout programme officially expires this August. The Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, who is also in the US capital, will not attend the meeting. Officials in Athens said it was hoped today’s meeting could pave the way for eurozone finance ministers to make concrete decisions when they meet in Bulgaria - the current holder of the EU presidency - next week. At 180% of GDP, Greece has the highest debt load in the EU. Among the options the Washington Group will likely discuss are support measures to ease the huge cost of servicing Athens’ debt pile. If there is some discrepancy in the Bank of England’s view of the economy - Mark Carney seeing signs of weakness, Michael Saunders less so - then Chancellor Philip Hammond seems to be on the side of positivity. Speaking at a lunch at the International Monetary Fund’s spring meeting in Washington, Hammond said he was feeling “Tiggerish” about the UK economy, with debt going down, inflation falling and real wages rising. This however is not the first time Hammond has channelled Winnie the Pooh’s bouncy tiger. In March’s spring statement he talked up the successes of the economy and said. “I..am at my most positively Tigger-like.” Scottish Power has become the third of the “big six” energy suppliers to announce price rises for some of its customers. Those on the standard variable tariff are facing a 5.5% increase in prices from 1 June. It means that for about 960,000 customers, the annual dual fuel bill for gas and electricity will rise by £63 to £1,211. Neil Clitheroe, chief executive of Scottish Power Retail, said: Unfortunately our standard variable prices are increasing. This reflects rising wholesale energy costs and compulsory non-energy costs. Two-thirds of our customers are unaffected. We will be contacting all customers affected by the price change to give them the opportunity to move to a fixed price tariff alternative and avoid this increase. It follows similar moves by British Gas and EDF. Donald Trump has criticised Opec over “artificially high” oil prices: Brent crude is currently down 0.3% at $73.57 a barrel, after rising in earlier trading. Will the remaining seven members of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee vote with the governor, Mark Carney, or Michael Saunders, at the May policy meeting? That is the key question according to Craig Erlam, analyst at currency specialist Oanda, based on the assumption that Carney will vote to leave rates unchanged at 0.5% and Saunders will vote for a hike to 0.75%. Erlam says: While a hike is by no means off the table, the comments from Carney are a clear and deliberate warning to markets that the Monetary Policy Committee could delay the move by a few months, at which point the data may be less sketchy and the outlook more clear. Market expectations have since fallen to around 45% for a rate hike and could fall further if fellow policy makers join Carney is playing down an increase in a few weeks. One policy maker that won’t be joining him is Michael Saunders, who spoke this morning about the need to raise interest rates at a “gradual” not “glacial” pace and questioned the significance of first quarter data due to the weather. He also claimed labour market inflation pressures are greater than forecast in February so I wouldn’t expect his vote to change next month. The question is what camp the other policy makers sit in, Carney’s or Saunders’. Investors appear to be placing their bets back on a May rate hike after a typically hawkish speech from Michael Saunders. Having fallen fairly sharply against the dollar this morning - following Mark Carney’s interview with the BBC - the pound is better shape now. It is down 0.1% against the dollar, at $1.4075, and up 0.3% against the euro at €1.1442. Saunders’ takes a different view to Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England. Carney said on Thursday night that some of the recent data, such as retail sales, had been softer, and pointed to the fact that inflation has fallen faster than the Bank was predicting in February. He also suggested that policymakers were aware they could vote for the next hike in rates at any MPC meeting, and were not tied to making such a decision in May. Andrew Sentance, former members of the MPC, agrees with Saunders: The Bank of England’s Michael Saunders says that “gradual” rate rises does not mean just one per year: ‘Gradual’ does not imply that the MPC can only raise rates at a very low frequency, such as once per year. Nor does “gradual” mean that the MPC cannot tighten faster than markets price in. He does however say that the Bank does not intend to give signals about the precise timing of a rate rise: ‘Gradual’ does not necessarily mean that the exact timing of rate changes must be totally predictable or signalled in advance. The MPC does not intend to create unnecessary uncertainty, and gives guidance – based on our economic forecasts – on the expected general outlook for interest rates. But I doubt that we will regularly use code words to effectively pre-announce policy decisions from meeting to meeting. Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, will be sticking with his vote to raise UK rates in May, his comments in Glasgow suggest. Speaking at the University of Strathclyde, Saunders said the economy no longer needed as much stimulus from the Bank and rises should be gradual but not glacial. Saunders voted for a 0.25 point rise in rates to 0.75% at the MPC’s last meeting in March, but was outvoted by colleagues. Speaking this morning, he said: With spare capacity largely used up and cost pressures rising, I believe the economy no longer needs as much stimulus as previously. Rather, we probably need to move over time to something more like neutral, in order to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to target. The second topic is to explain why – at least from my perspective – any further tightening is likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. A key point is that “gradual” need not mean “glacial”. Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, is giving a speech in Glasgow this morning. His comments will be scrutinised by investors and economists hoping for further clues about the likelihood (or not) of a May rate rise. Saunders is one of the MPC’s most hawkish members - tending to favour tighter monetary policy - and was one of two of the nine-strong committee to vote for a hike in March. The other was Ian McCafferty. We’ll bring you the highlights of the speech after 10.30am Economists at the Bank of America say they are sticking with the assumption that UK rates will rise in May, for now at least: Until last night we assumed the weak data flow would not derail a May hike. There were no signs of cold feet at the Bank of England after a hawkish March policy meeting and rate setter Jan Vlieghe arguing for six hikes in the next three years. Then last night Governor Mark Carney suggested delay. In a BBC interview he said the BoE was conscious of “other meetings over the course of the year” when they could hike. As hints go, we think it’s as strong as we get. The data justify delay in our view. We have been sceptical of the need for a May hike. We stick with a May hike for now, waiting to see if other rate setters speak. But the 85% market probability on a May hike looks (much) too high now. British government bond prices are rising this morning, as investors are less convinced that interest rates will rise in May. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, suggested markets might have got carried away by assuming a hike would come next month. The yield on benchmark 10-year bonds fell four basis points to 1.49% (where a lower yield reflects a higher price). Five-year bond yields were down five basis points at 1.18%. Moya Greene’s departure from Royal Mail will leave the FTSE 100 with just six female chief executives, at a time when the government is pushing for greater boardroom diversity. Commenting on her departure - after the company announced she will step down as chief executive in June and retire in September - Greene said: It has been my pleasure and a great privilege to serve as chief executive of this cherished UK institution. I am proud of what we have achieved over the last eight years. It is very pleasing to note that around 20% of this company is owned by our employees and retail shareholders. Most of all, I am honoured to have worked alongside Royal Mail’s people and the union leadership. It is their hard work and dedication that connects households, communities and companies across the UK every day. Royal Mail has announced that Moya Greene will step down as chief executive in June, after more than eight years in the job. The Canadian oversaw the privatisation of Royal Mail in 2013 and has “transformed” the business according to chairman Peter Long. Greene will be replaced by Rico Back, chief executive of Royal Mail’s European subsidiary, General Logistics Systems. Announcing the changes, Long said: Royal Mail was highly fortunate to recruit Moya, given her direct experience, strategic vision, drive and proven track record across a range of industry sectors. When Moya joined in the summer of 2010, the company was balance sheet insolvent. Since then, Royal Mail has been transformed, including our privatisation in 2013 and two significant, ground-breaking agreements with the CWU [Communication Workers Union]. Alongside the strong financial position Moya has secured for the company, we have invested over £1.5 billion in our UK operation in recent years. We are one of the most favourably viewed brands in the UK. I would like to extend to Moya our sincere thanks for her tremendous contribution during a defining time for us. After a short break, the unreliable boyfriend is back according to Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. Mark Carney may well rue the day back in 2014 that MP Pat McFadden accused the Bank of behaving like an “unreliable boyfriend” by giving mixed messages on the likely timing of an interest rate rise. Fast forward to 2018 and markets are once again confused by the Bank’s signals after Carney suggested last night policymakers might not raise rates in May as widely expected. Hewson says: Sterling traders could be forgiven for experiencing a significant case of déjà vu in the wake of yesterday’s remarks, as this isn’t the first time the Bank of England has led markets up the garden path, they did it in 2014, with the Bank of England governor earning the unfortunate moniker of the “unreliable boyfriend” from a UK MP for his flip flopping on whether to raise interest rates. It would appear that after a short break he’s back. The UK’s FTSE 100 is outperforming its major European peers this morning as it benefits from a weaker pound. FTSE 100: +0.5% at 7,364 Germany’s DAX: -0.1% at 12,556 France’s CAC: +0.1% at 5,399 Italy’s FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 23,740 Spain’s IBEX: flat at 9,868 Europe’s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 381 The Barclays board is giving its full support to chief executive Jes Staley this morning, despite regulators concluding that he breached conduct by trying to discover the identity of a whisteblower. From the Barclays statement: The Barclays board continues to have unanimous confidence in Mr Staley and continues to recommend his re- election as a director at the Barclays annual general meeting on 1 May 2018. As set out in the April 2017 announcement, the Barclays board will determine what adjustment to Mr Staley’s compensation is appropriate once the FCA and PRA processes have concluded. Barclays’ chief executive Jes Staley is to be fined by UK regulators over his attempt to uncover the identity of a whistleblower in 2016, the bank revealed this morning. It is not yet clear how much Staley will be fined by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, which have so far issued the boss with “draft warning notices”. The regulators have stopped short of saying that Staley is not fit or proper to run the bank. It follows Staley’s admission that he had tried to unmask a whistleblower who made allegations about a long-term associate he had brought to the bank. Staley twice attempted to use Barclay’s internal security team to track down the authors of two anonymous letters sent to the board and a senior executive at the bank in June 2016. Here is an extract from the statement from Barclays this morning: In respect of Mr Staley, the FCA and PRA have recently issued confidential draft warning notices setting out their reasons for proposing enforcement actions. The FCA and PRA are alleging that Mr Staley’s actions in relation to this matter represented a breach of Individual Conduct Rule 2 (requirement to act with due skill, care and diligence) and each have proposed that he pay a financial penalty. The FCA and PRA are not alleging that he acted with a lack of integrity or that he lacks fitness and propriety to continue to perform his role as group chief executive officer. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is down this morning after Bank of England governor Mark Carney hinted that market expectations that interest rates would rise in May were overblown. Investors closely monitoring the recent voting patterns and comments made by the Bank’s policymakers had decided there was a 90% chance that rates will rise from 0.5% to 0.75% at the next meeting of the Bank’s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee on 10 May. However, Carney told the BBC last night that the MPC were not fixed on a particular month for raising rates and pointed to some softer UK data, such as retail sales. Here’s what he had to say: Prepare for a few interest rate rises over the next few years,” he told me. I don’t want to get too focused on the precise timing, it is more about the general path. We have had some mixed data. On the softer side some of the business surveys have come off. Retail sales have been a bit softer - we are all aware of the squeeze that is going on in the high street. We’ll sit down calmly and look at it all in the round. I am sure there will be some differences of view but it is a view we will take in early May, conscious that there are other meetings over the course of this year. The pound is down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.4058, and down 0.2% against the euro at €1.1388. In other breaking news this morning Barclays boss Jes Staley is to be fined by UK regulators after he attempted to uncover the identity of a whistleblower. More on that soon.

I really care about people'","bodyText":"Jürgen Klopp is calm and serene. His face lights up, of course, at the prospect of “the mighty battle” which awaits Liverpool on Tuesday when Roma arrive at Anfield for the first leg of their Champions League semi-final. He also leans forward animatedly when assessing the intriguing challenge the Italians will pose. Yet, beyond the cliche of Klopp as a madly gurning cheerleader on the touchline, the 50-year-old German proved, again, his tactical nous and inspirational management while guiding Liverpool to three victories this season over the feted Premier League champions Manchester City. The 5-1 aggregate defeat of City in the quarter-finals was exhilarating and resilient. It is striking how, at Liverpool’s training ground, Klopp is also stimulated when discussing real life and tangled politics, Brexit and Angela Merkel. There are moments in a free-wheeling conversation when the hilarity feels unstoppable as Klopp considers a claim that he would win an election to become German chancellor because of his attention to detail, communication skills and empathy. But there are many more thoughtful moments – particularly when Klopp addresses the vexed issue of Brexit and his belief that British people should have the chance to vote again on their future in or outside the EU. We start, however, with Klopp reminiscing about his youthful desire to become a doctor. That teenage ambition chimes with his persistent interest in helping people “get better every day” and his work with players, from Mo Salah to Dejan Lovren, who improve in contrasting ways. “I was young when I thought about becoming a doctor,” Klopp says with a smile as he remembers growing up in the Black Forest village of Glatten. “I had the idea three years before my A-level. But to study medicine your A-level results had to be fantastic. So it was good for all the people who would have been under my knife that I didn’t make it. But it was close to be honest.” That wistful sentence is swamped by his laughter. But the idea of Dr Klopp is not outlandish. He exudes a warmth and intelligence we would all want to see in a doctor. “I have this helping syndrome,” Klopp says. “I really care about people and I feel responsible for pretty much everything.” Klopp’s inclusive leadership, ensuring everyone feels nurtured and needed, is at the root of his success. Is he also becoming a scouser as his immersion in Liverpool runs so deep? Klopp grins, brandishing his cup: “There’s this tea, for example. When we come somewhere new my family like to adapt. We want to live like people here. I’m not a guy who says: ‘By the way, I want to tell you in Germany we do it like this or that.’ We look so similar but we are very different too. It’s really interesting. My boys both work in Germany but they are football maniacs so they’re very often here. They tell me about the nightlife and I experience the country in the daytime.” Does life on this small island seem insular, particularly when the political landscape has shifted dramatically since he arrived? “I’ve heard it said that English people are not looking outwards but I don’t see it. I live in Formby and work in Liverpool. I drive from here to there and sometimes I’m in different cities for games. So I don’t know enough about the country but many people come to Britain because English is the language the world speaks. “I can’t say Germany is more open. If you ask the wrong people in Germany they would say: ‘Yes, we want a fence to keep foreigners out and, by the way, could you make is as high as the [Berlin] Wall.’ Europe has been strange the last few years. I like to go to Austria for skiing but they only push [immigrants] through to Mrs Merkel. Being a leader in this situation is not a joy. There is no easy solution.” The option favoured by the Brexiteers, however, seems misguided and dispiriting. “I understand,” Klopp says. “I’m not the best-informed person but I’m very interested in it. When Mr Cameron had the idea [of a referendum] you thought: ‘This is not something people should decide in a moment.’ We are all influenced by the way only some of the argument is given, and once the decision is taken nobody gives you a real opportunity to change it again. The choice was either you stay in Europe, which is not perfect, or you go out into something nobody has any idea how it will work. “So you give people the chance to make this big decision. And then it’s a 51-49 [51.9%-48.1%] vote and you’re thinking: ‘Wow, 49% are not happy with the decision that’s going to change the country.’ For the 51%, I’m sure they realised pretty early after the vote: ‘What have we done?’ “The two leaders of the Leave campaign then stepped aside. It was a pure sign they were surprised themselves by the vote. OK, that can happen. But then, come on, let’s sit together again. Let’s think about it again and let’s vote again with the right information – not with the information you’ve got around the Brexit campaign. They were obviously not right, not all of them. It makes no sense at all. “When I speak to people they say: ‘I wanted to stay [in Europe] but I don’t want to talk about it because I don’t feel it yet as a person.’ I feel it constantly because since I came here the pound dropped. People go on holiday and say: ‘Spain is very expensive!’ But it’s only because the pound is not that strong any more. The EU is not perfect but it was the best idea we had. History has always shown that when we stay together we can sort out problems. When we split then we start fighting. There was not one time in history where division creates success. So, for me, Brexit still makes no sense.” This embrace of Europe does not mean Klopp is disparaging towards British footballers. More than most Premier League clubs he has an English core to his squad. Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Adam Lallana, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joe Gomez, Nathaniel Clyne, Dominic Solanke and Danny Ings are joined by other bright young talents such as Scotland’s Andrew Robertson and Wales’ Ben Woodburn. “They are here because they’re really good – not because they’re English or British. But if you have two players at the same level and one is English and the other is from somewhere else I always go for the English guy. They keep the mood good and for them it’s easy to feel the club’s history. But we have fantastic boys from all over the world and they love the club. Roberto Firmino has such a Liverpool heart. But the English guys lead the group. Tottenham and us we are pretty much the English national team and I like that.” Liverpool’s, and the PFA’s, Player of the Season is Egyptian. Salah faces his former club on Tuesday. Klopp’s acumen in signing Salah from Roma has been underlined and a £35m transfer fee now smacks of a bargain. “Mo did very well at Roma but they have Edin Dzeko who is an outstanding striker. So it was their tactics to sometimes play him wide. Now, a year older, he came to us full of confidence. He scored in the first game but missed two big chances. So, unbelievably, he could have scored much more [than the 41 goals Salah has this season]. We have learned about him step by step because he plays constantly in the same position. This season is more about interpretation [of his goalscoring talent] and because Bobby Firmino is a workhorse he really gives Mo space. I’ve had many talks with Mo and he sees what the others do for him.” Did he spend much time assessing Salah’s character before signing him? “I always meet the player before we sign. That’s when I decide because I have a good feeling for people. It was a fantastic talk. He’s open, smiling all the time. He has crazy curls but he’s a really nice boy. He also looked much more mature than it says on his passport. Twenty-four? I was: ‘Wow, really?’ We talked for three hours about everything from his family to my family and at the end we had a deal to work together. I like to remind players from time to time of that agreement. It’s working really well with Mo.” Lovren has had a more testing season and mistakes against Spurs and Manchester United meant that many Liverpool fans denounced him. But his resurgence has been marked and, against City, he was a clear leader. “There are some really difficult things in Liverpool,” Klopp says. “The whole Liverpool family is not happy with not winning big trophies since whenever – so you always find a reason. ‘The problem is we don’t spend enough.’ Or, ‘The players make mistakes’. So, really, it’s a difficult job to be Liverpool’s goalkeeper. I’m not sure who was the last goalkeeper everybody was happy with here. It would be a while ago. And if you are not Sami Hyypia then your life as a defender is also difficult. “I don’t exactly know about Dejan’s start at Liverpool but he made a few mistakes. People always have that in mind: ‘Oh, Lovren again!’ But I’m long in the business. I said to Dejan: ‘If somebody told me, come on, you have the chance, create a centre-half. We found a way to do it, genetically, bam, bam, bam.’ That’s him, strong, quick, both feet, can head like crazy, jumps through the roof. He’s all you need. Yes, a few things you can improve – his concentration. But these are human beings. “Other centre-halves make mistakes. Against City, Virgil van Dijk, an outstanding person and fantastic player, should have cleared the ball before they scored. Virgil knows that. But nobody spoke about it because we won. It doesn’t look like it but I’m really relaxed in judging these things. When I see talent, and I’m convinced, I am calm.” Liverpool now face a formidable test – despite a widely held belief that Roma are the weakest club in the semi-finals. “Roma are interesting,” Klopp says. “We’re expecting a mighty battle. They have Dzeko, they brought in the young Czech guy [Patrik] Schick and the young Turk [Cengiz Ünder]. Fantastic. [Daniele] De Rossi controls the midfield. Their defence is really experienced. Alisson is a fantastic goalkeeper. They beat Barcelona. They were first in their group, they didn’t concede a goal at home so far in the Champions League. There are many impressive things about them.” It helps that Klopp has been here before although, when we remember our previous interview, before Dortmund lost to Bayern Munich in the 2013 Champions League final, he grimaces. “I’ve never watched it back. It’s too painful.” Manchester City felt Champions League pain against Liverpool – but soothed themselves by winning the league with five games to spare. How close are Liverpool to a concerted tilt at City’s title next season? “It’s an interesting question because while we improved a lot they do the same. You can’t imagine that City, after a brilliant season, will say: ‘Oh, that’s so good we’ll keep the same squad.’ They will find new players. I also noticed an interesting thing. Their club has more money than every club in the world but I saw the City boys celebrating in a really nice way in the pub. It showed a real team.” It has been another draining season but Klopp looks fit and well. He was said to have suffered a minor health scare in November when he went to hospital. “We all go for a check now and then but nobody knows. It was actually a funny situation. They tried to bring me in through the back door but the security guy has a walkie-talkie and he says: ‘Klopp is in the house!’ But, really, I’m fine. I love the job but if somebody told me: ‘If you carry on you will die much earlier’ then I’d say immediately: ‘Thank you. I’m on the road home.’” He looks intrigued when I point out that, after spending seven years each at Mainz and Dortmund as manager, his Liverpool contract runs until 2022. He will then have completed a third seven-year stint at a club with whom he has fallen in love. “The seven years is a coincidence. When you have a marriage and if you’re past your seventh year then you’re OK. But, actually, I don’t need this kind of settling. It’s not in my nature. But when I am in a club I am in it totally.” Liverpool are lucky to have him but, thinking of that seven-year cycle, I joke with Klopp that some people have another job in mind for him. Martin Quast, a German sportswriter, said: “If Klopp wanted to run for German president, he would get elected. He would bring people together, lead the way, make people happy.” After Klopp has stopped laughing he explains that Quast is from Mainz. “Maybe in 2004 I could have been chancellor of Mainz. But I have absolutely no skills apart from being interested in politics. I would enjoy it if a politician spoke like a normal person but the job is complex. So we should care about our good people in politics because there’re not many of them. It’s like being a football manager. Many people are interested in football but only a few combine all the skills. Politics is even more difficult. I could never do it – or want to do it.” Klopp as German chancellor would still be fun and maybe he could find a way to help Brexit Britain. “Hmmm,” Klopp says with mock seriousness. “Angela Merkel has two weeks off a year. That’s less holiday than I have which means that’s absolutely not my target. On holiday everybody is following her. She’s in the mountains having a nice hike and every year the same picture of Angela and her husband. I really like her and she’s doing an unbelievable job. But it’s a very difficult job – which is not as well paid as a football manager either. I will stick with Liverpool.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/20/football-transfer-rumour-mill-chelsea-manchester-united-juventus","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T08:11:55Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Juventus set to sign Premier League trio?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/20/football-transfer-rumour-mill-chelsea-manchester-united-juventus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/20/football-transfer-rumour-mill-chelsea-manchester-united-juventus","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Juventus set to sign Premier League trio?","bodyText":"Juventus hope to re-land Paul Pogba in the summer, after their general manager, Giuseppe Marotta, told reporters: “I do not believe in players coming back after having gone away – but there are exceptions.” Having already left Manchester United once, joined Juventus and rejoined United again, the move would leave open the possibility of Pogba spending his entire career bouncing between the same two clubs like some footballing version of a Chuckle Brothers catchphrase. Juventus could also be interested in Pogba’s occasional United team-mate Matteo Darmian and Chelsea’s Álvaro Morata, whose signing Marotta believes falls into the same good-but-unlikely category as Pogba: “They are great players and good lads but, to be honest, they are mirages for us.” Paris St-Germain will be their key rivals for United’s French haircut magnate, having apparently already opened preliminary discussions with Pogba’s agent, Mino Raiola. Pogba’s value has crashed since he joined United in 2016. Then he cost £89m and became the world record transfer. Now United will demand £140m for him - making him worth only 70.71% of the world record transfer fee, and thus cheaper than he was before, though also £50m more expensive. He could be cheaper still, with the headline figure trumpeted on the Mail’s back page revealed in the article to be the very most that Old Trafford executives might expect, and that they “would want between £120m and £140m”. And the summer exits from Old Trafford won’t end there, with Juventus (again), Bayern Munich and Lyon are all interested in Anthony Martial, who will be made available by United to make space in their squad for the Watford forward Richarlison. According to the Sun they “have scouted Richarlison at least 10 times this season” but they are not alone in taking a shine to the young Brazilian, with Tottenham, Chelsea, Arsenal, Bayern, Juventus (again), Monaco and Paris St-Germain also apparently keen and Watford unwilling to sell. Last summer Manchester City had a £21m bid for West Bromwich Albion’s Jonny Evans turned down; this summer he’ll be available for £3m thanks to the relegation-triggered terms of his contract, and at just 30 years of age seems set to be a genuine bargain for someone. Other players who under the terms of their contracts will become available once West Brom’s demotion is confirmed include Nacer Chadli, whose release clause is set at £17m (though whether anyone will actually want to pay that for a player who due to a string of injuries and, since recovering from them, simple unpopularity has started just two league games this season and none at all since October, remains to be seen) and Salomón Rondón, the 28-year-old Venezuelan striker, who would cost £16.5m. Whether City are still interested in Evans is unknown, but they don’t appear to have totally refreshed their shopping list if rumours of a fresh bid for Leicester’s Riyad Mahrez have any truth to them. In other stories-you-have-read-before news, West Ham want to sign Joe Hart on a season-long loan. Arsène Wenger, writes the Sun, “is ready to kick-start the Arsenal revolution”. He will do this by selling Shkodran Mustafi and Granit Xhaka, buying James Maddison from Norwich and Ryan Fredericks from Fulham, crossing his fingers and hoping really hard. Brighton, Newcastle, Everton, Stoke, Udinese and “a handful of clubs in France as well as Spain” are all chasing the Strasbourg striker Stéphane Bahoken, a former St Mirren loanee, who will be out of contract in the summer. According to the Express, Aston Villa are also interested, but Brighton have elbowed their way to the front of the queue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/apr/22/sportwatch-melbourne-victory-v-adelaide-united-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T10:18:12Z","webTitle":"Sportwatch: Berisha magic, Hawks grounded, Eels win big – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/apr/22/sportwatch-melbourne-victory-v-adelaide-united-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/apr/22/sportwatch-melbourne-victory-v-adelaide-united-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"Sportwatch: Berisha magic, Hawks grounded, Eels win big – as it happened","bodyText":"And with that dramatic finale, we’ll conclude tonight’s Sportswatch. Some close encounters across all four codes today - not least in the AFL where three late goals from the Lions almost saw them snatch a miraculous come-from-behind win against Queensland rivals the Suns. And earlier a big third-quarter scare for North Melbourne but they hung on to shock the Hawks. Upsets abounding in the NRL as well where high-flying Penrith were denied by the Sharks, and a remarkable result in the earlier game where Parramatta winless and rudderless until today almost put 50 points on Manly, a team that rolled them 54-0 only five weeks earlier. Throw in a home loss for the Brumbies in the Super Rugby against the Jaguares and it’s been a lively day all round. Thanks for your company, watch out for Sportwatch next week as we bring you the A-League semi-finals. Until then, be polite and friendly to strangers and try and get your eight hours each evening. And that’s it! Victory are through to the semi-finals, where Sydney FC await. Commiserations for United who did everything possible to deserve an extra thirty minutes, and even the win, but what can you say about Besart Berisha. The A-League’s all-time leading goalscorer. He’s come in for a bit of criticism in recent years with some perceiving his powers on the wane, but it’s his brilliance, his determination that have ultimately made the difference tonight. Victory roll on, and what a big semi-final we have in store next week. 92 min: Poor old Marco Kurz. His side had done just about everything he could have hoped for. And with minutes to go, whamo. A season’s hopes and dreams snatched away at the death! Five minutes added on, but here come the Muscat changes, he makes two, two minutes apart as first Berisha then George are withdrawn. 89 min: Would you believe it! With extra-time seemingly a fait accompli, a piece of pure and simple individual brilliance from Besart Berisha to decide this gripping encounter! Barbarouses again down the right hand flank, he dinks a cross, Berisha shields his marker Elsey as the ball dips, and he then flicks the bicycle kick effort - which nestles just inside Izzo’s far post! What a goal, and what a time to score it! 86 min: Marco Kurz looking to make his third and final change as George Blackwood comes on for Diawara. Kevin Muscat in contrast yet to shuffle his XI. Does this show greater trust in the chargers that started, or conversely a lack of faith in those on the bench? 84 min: So will we see extra-time here? Still a fair chunk of time to run, and it’s definitely been a more open second stanza. There are seven players out there on a yellow as well, might that fact yet play a decisive part? 81 min: And it’s an untidy first contribution from Vinny - he’s picked up a yellow for a late attempt on Antonis. The midfielder and Instagram chef flashes a rueful smile. 78 min: Kitto has been lively since his inclusion with his pace worrying the Victory down the flanks. He fires in a cross, but can’t find a teammate. Meanwhile Berisha goes into the book for finishing despite an earlier whistle. And cometh the moment, cometh the man - are we about to see former Victory player and Wellington cult figure, Vince Lia enter the fray? Yes we are. 75 min: There were times during the first elimination final where you thought it simply not a game of the quality befitting the occasion. But this has turned into a terrific spectacle - a tasty clash of cut, thrust and counter-parry. 71 min: Adelaide with a half-chance from an Adlung set piece. Gulum wins a big flick on at the near post, but with the ball looping temptingly to the far post there’s nobody there in Red to tap it home! Ryan Kitto comes on for Mileusnic as we see our first substitute of the match. 69 min: Huge save! Victory with a great break, George picks out Berisha at the far post - he fires it across the goal past Izzo, who sticks out a strong left foot and repels the strike! How crucial could that prove?! 66 min: Well that’s raised the decibel level inside AAMI Park! A nervous hush had fallen on the ground when Adelaide took the lead, but the home supporters have found their voice once more. A few cards creeping in here. Diawara in the book (for reason your humble scribe can’t explain) and then Broxham for a heavy foul. 63 min: Barbarouses with a mazy dribble outside the box from the right - he dinks in a tempting cross, it evades Berisha but the Dutchman George just gets ahead of Marrone, and it angles into the side of Izzo’s goal. What a response from the home side! 62 min: Gulum getting through a power of work at the back for the Reds. Such an experienced character. But hold on, hold on.. 57 min: Terrific quick thinking from the Reds - Isaias with a freekick from deep inside his own half, he looks up, spots the run of the lightning winger and puts it brilliantly over his shoulder. The winger outpaces Williams and nips in just ahead of the on-rushing Thomas to touch home inside the post. Game on! This will force Victory to chase a little more proactively. 55 min: Chance, Victory! George with a freekick in a handy area, his ball in is dealt with, but not cleanly. It falls invitingly and Valeri lashes back goalwards. It strikes Jordan Elsey, replays suggesting the arm, but perhaps ball to hand. It was not in an ‘unnatural’ position, so Master Beath and the VAR let it go. 51 min: A big flashpoint, and no surprise it’s Victory’s captain Valeri in the middle of it. He’s given a yellow for a very ‘agricultural’ challenge on Gulum. He’s gone clean through the Turkish-Australian centre back, and he’s caught him high as well. Lucky perhaps not to receive a red for that? 48 min: Antonis almost tempts fate as he looks to dribble out from his own box, but his decision to retain possession nearly pays off as he then picks out Barbarouses, but the Kiwi’s ball through to Berisha is too heavy, and the move is snuffed out. And we’re back! No changes from either side at half-time, unsurprisingly given the even nature of the contest. How’d you see that half? And who do you fancy to be the one to unlock this one? Fire me a tweet or drop an email to join the coverage. I’m calling this early and saying either extra-time and penalties (Adelaide win), or in the spirit of proper hedging, a half-mistake at the back/contention Berisha moment, and Victory jag 1-0. Send me your most fervently held predictions; failing anything it’ll be a good giggle come full-time. So a tense and terse opening first stanza in this one, with neither side enjoying any real clear cut chances. Isaias’ early freekick the only real goal moment of note, with both midfields working hard to neutralise each other. Melbourne with 58% possession, but George and Barbarouses aside they haven’t troubled the Reds defence too much. Expect this one to open up more in the second half. 45 min: Two minutes the extras. There haven’t been too many stoppages in this, but referee Beath does warn Izzo in the Adelaide goal for some tardy restarts. 43 min: Garuccio flashes a cross.. but it evades his teammates! Both he and Michael Marrone more natural attackers when the Reds are moving forward, and perhaps they’re offering a bit more in those wide areas, the visitors. 39 min: It’s a very defence-minded back six from Kevin Muscat with no recognised fullbacks. Centre back Thomas Deng is preferred to youngster Stefan Nigro on the right, while veteran utility Broxham patrols the left back position. And now it’s Rhys Williams in the book for a trademark Championship storm-and-thunder tackle from behind on Diawara. He doesn’t mind those, old Rhys. 35 min: Victory enjoying a decent spell of possession, but the Adelaide defence standing up well to the examination so far. Barbarouses looks the one most likely to spark something with Troisi and Besart Berisha largely peripheral. For now. 31 min: Elimination final 1 winning coach Warren Joyce is in the stands tonight. More of a psyche power move, no? Given his City side won’t face either of these two unless both progress past Newcastle Jets and Sydney FC respectively. And terrific defending from Garuccio! A fast break, and it’s George almost through one-on-one. The Reds left back slides in. He had to be so careful, having already been booked, but he connects cleanly in the box! 28 min: Slightly more end-to-end now, as Adelaide enjoy a good chance from a corner. Excellent delivery from Absalonsen who gets Thomas coming for it, but he doesn’t connect with the punch, and Konstandopoulos tries to chest control at the far post but can’t direct it goalwards! 24 min: First caution of the game, as Ben Garuccio bodychecks Barbarouses. He’ll have to watch out, the Adelaide fullback, they’ve got plenty of pace on the flanks, do Victory. George whips in the freekick and it’s the unlikely figure of Barbarouses on the end of it. Not a prolific headed goalscorer, and it’s safely controlled once more. 21 min: Baba Diawara goes to ground under a tackle from Leigh Broxham - there appeared to be sturdy contact, but nothing given. Up the other end Isaias is now penalised for a late challenge on James Troisi. What can Victory do with this freekick? It’s wide, just outside the Adelaide box. Antonis strikes it - but it’s comfortably held by Paul Izzo. 18 min: Not surprisingly it’s been a tense, and perhaps intense, start to this one. Marco Kurz has built a team that works very hard out of possession and the Reds are really scrapping when Victory have the ball and vice-versa from Kevin Muscat’s side. 13 min: Victory beginning to enjoy a slight shade of the possession, but there have been no clear cut chances, outside that early freekick to Adelaide. Mileusnic goes to ground looking for a foul by Carl Valeri but nothing forthcoming. 9 min: This time it’s Adelaide with the lightning transition. Lawrence Thomas very relieved as his clearance clatters into the speedy Nikolai Mileusnic but it trickles behind for a corner. Ersum Gulum gets a head to it..! But it flashes wide. 5 min: There’s just under 20,000 expected at AAMI Park tonight and already there’s a decent atmosphere. Antonis conceeds a second foul, but in a less dangerous area. Meanwhile, Kosta Barbarouses breaks away in transition and earns the Victory a corner. Leroy George plays short, but the defence is alive to it. Johan Absalonsen clears for Adelaide. And there’s been a late charge from the Panthers, but they’ve not been able to turn it around. A great win for the Sharks - they weathered a stack of pressure late in the first half, but they’ve made it count in the second. Disappointment for Penrith, who slip to just their second loss of the season. 2 min: And an early scare for the Victory! Terry Antonis catch young Red Nathan Konstandopoulos just outside the box to concede a dangerous free-kick opportunity. Isaias and Daniel Adlung - both hand from the dead ball - standing over it, but the wall deflects behind. Danger averted. Okay, we’ll wrap our other live games where we can, but let’s move our attention to this - the big one - the A-League elimination final. Adelaide’s captain Isaias returns to boost the Reds’ midfield, while Kevin Muscat names an as expected lineup: And here’s the visiting team: And there’s the whistle from referee Chris Beath, and we’re underway from AAMI Park in Melbourne! Relief for home fans - the Hawks really threatened to come knocking during that third quarter but their young Roos side has dug deep to hang on to a memorable win, and a rare one against Hawthorn! The margin comfortable in the end, but a wobble there that made it very lively late in the second half. Deary me. The Brumbies have really blown a chance to make a move in the Australian conference after both the Waratahs and Reds were handed heavy home losses, and the Rebels were done on the road in South Africa. Henry Speight’s 100th Super Rugby match overshadowed by the 0-4 weekend for Australian rugby, as the Jaguares win their second match on the bounce on Australian soil. And over in the NRL it’s a second try to Cronulla’s Jesse Ramien, and they should just be good enough, the Sharks, to see this one home! They lead 24-12 with ten to play and it would take something VERY special from here for the Panthers to maintain their blistering start to this season. It’s a 21-point margin in the Roos-Hawks AFL match, but North Melbourne are lining up with Zurhaar with just over ten to play. We’ve had five scoring opportunities in this final quarter and they’ve missed four, with only Jack Gunston kicking a major. Big pressure on the 19-year-old - he’s only got a handful of goals in his entire AFL career, but he’s got it, he’s kicked straight and true, and the Roos move to 27 clear! So a quick whizz round the grounds, because we’re not too far away from adding the big one - the A-League second elimination final - to this “all the sports, all the time” rolling report. In the super rugby, it’s really bubbling nicely as the Brumbies trail the Jaguares 17-20 with about fifteen minutes to play. To the NRL, where Penrith have just crossed to bring it back to 18-10 (conversion to come) against the Sharks. And in the AFL it’s Gold Coast by four, 4.3 (27) plays 3.5 (23) for the Lions, and it’s 12.11 (83) plays 9.4 (58) as the Hawthorn squander two consecutive shooting chances to continue their second-half resurgence against North Melbourne! So much happening, and a tough shout as to which of these is currently the most engrossing. Sports! Goodness me! We’ve had six goals to one in this third quarter; did we read the rites for the Hawks too early?! Not sure if Clarkson went for the ‘double hairdryer’ at HT but Liam Shiels came out and kicked two as Hawthorn went three straight to start the quarter. A steadier from Trent Dumont gave some nervous North fans a breather, but a double to Luke Breust and and a major to Isaac Smith has the Hawks roaring home. They trailed 75-18 at half-time don’t forget, but they’ve brought this one back to just 27 points! Remarkable, and what a quarter we have in store here. It’s first blood Suns in the AFL’s “Queensland derby”, who finished the quarter progressively stronger after the home side opened the scoring. Lewis Taylor and Zac Bailey the men to give home fans something approaching hope not sadness, but a double to Darcy MacPherson and goals to Tom Lynch and Brayden Fiorini gives the Suns a slight advantage. Plenty more to come here. Now isn’t this an interesting contest; just as the Panthers looked to be building ascendency it’s the Sharks who have hit back. Penrith have enjoyed nearly 60% possession and at times were really hammering the Cronulla tryline, but a try to Scott Sorensen with 28 minutes gone - converted by his brother-in-law Chad Townsend (fun fact) gives the home side the lead. Nice moment for Sorensen, he’s gone something like three years since his last NRL game, and his teammates gave him a big cuddle when he went over. Lovely. Better viewing here if you’re a Brumbies fan, with two late tries to fullback Tom Banks giving the home side a bit of momentum just before the break. It’s been a typically aggressive start from the Argentinians who have almost bullied the Brumbies. Captain David Pocock has come more into the contest as the half has progressed however, and if not for some conversion misses the Australians could have gone in ahead. Nicely poised here in Canberra therefore. And we’ve got overlapping AFL games and I’ve officially run out of televisions, phones and radios to monitor all these concurrent matches. Lets face it though, Lions will lose this right? Let’s work on that theory. It sure worked for that hot tip on the Hawks earlier. Try! Cronulla Sharks 4-6 Penrith Panthers Well, they weathered an early storm, did Penrith, but they momentum has definitely swung the way of the side currently boasting five wins from six, especially after the key involvement of another former Panther, this time with the loss of Luke Lewis to injury for the Sharks. Dallin Watene-Zelezniak making the most of some fine work by Dean Whare as the Panthers hit the lead. A disallowed try let off for them as well, so the Bunker rightly making it one a piece on that front. Wowee. Alastair Clarkson gave his side an absolute revving at quarter-time, and when a Roos error allowed Jarman Impey to kick the first of the quarter for the Hawks inside 70 seconds it looked like we could have a contest back on our hands. But we’ve had eight consecutive and unanswered scoring efforts from North, to see the Roos pick up where they left off - Shaun Atley, Billy Hartung, a fourth to Brown and a second to Waite doing the damage. This is turning into a shellacking, in utter keeping with the topsy-turvy start we’ve seen to this 2018 AFL season! Bad start: Brumbies 0-13 Jaguares No, no, no, don’t you bloody dare. We’re about 15 gone down in the nation’s capital and the visiting Argentinians are scoring at almost a point-a-minute! A try after just four minutes to Matias Orlando but it’s been the Nicolas Sanchez show early on. It was his bust that led to the try, and the fly-half has added the extras with a successful conversion and two penalties as well. Try! Cronulla Sharks 4-0 Penrith Panthers They’ve started brightly here the home side, and it’s the Sharks who draw first blood (arf arf) as Valentine Holmes crosses with just five minutes gone! No extras from the sideline. And a big video ref examination denies a second try - a one-on-one strip attempt in-goal from former Panthers fullback Matty Moylan almost makes it potentially 10-0, but The Bunker adjudicates it a knock on. And we’re also underway at GIO stadium in Canberra, as the Brumbies carry the weight of a nation, a nation that’s really sick of losing rugby union games. Thankfully, there’s no way the ACT outfit could lose to the team bottom of the South African conference, right? RIGHT? With the Dragons feeling the full force of the new look, who dat, New Zealand Warriors earlier this weekend it’s the Panthers who are now eyeing a share of the NRL ladder lead, but standing in their way is the Cronulla Sharks. Who will emerge on top? Find out here! And that’s that! They got absolutely pantsed in Round 2 by the Sea Eagles, but after a week of soul searching and some shake ups at the club the Eels look a very different prospect after this. Conversely, the Sea Eagles could now be in all sorts. Stories of player ill-discipline of their own behind the scenes are evidently not helping; a big few weeks ahead for Trent Barrett and his staff. Okay, hands up who picked this one. Here I was thinking the Eels coming out and being world beaters was unlikely, but did anyone think the Hawks would get seven goals put on them in a quarter?! Ben Brown has led the line for the Roos shooting 3.0, but Jarrad Waite, Jack Ziebell (two) and Cameron Zuhaar have all helped themselves. Wow. what a start for the Roos! Try! Parramatta Eels 42-10 Manly Sea Eagles And here he is - like a Godot that actually rocks up, this game is no longer Waiting for Guffman - the new co-captain has a try of his own, and aren’t they celebrating this one! He strikes you as a popular lad (relative to Jackson Hastings at least) and once again it’s Moses who was instrumental. This is turning into a tale of two footy clubs here; maybe Manly can ask the Parra boys what went down this week and see if they can try and replicate it? Try! Parramatta Eels 36-6 Manly Sea Eagles A sixth try, and a sixth different tryscorer, they’re carving the Sea Eagles open at will. For the very slightest of seconds it looked like Manly was about to arrest this one-way event as Brad Parker registered their first points, but a simple backline move and over strolls Kenny Edwards for the Eels. It’s turning into a procession. Try! Parramatta Eels 30-0 Manly Sea Eagles There was plenty of talk about the chances the Eels had looked to make this week, we mentioned it pre-game. But let’s be honest - would even diehard fans have expected this? Michael Jennings gets in on the brothers’ act as he reels in a smart chip kick from Moses. This could get very ugly for the Eagles, who with the Cowboys and now the Eels (presumably) wining might start to get very nervous about become NRL 2018’s whipping boys. And we’re underway in the AFL! It’s ten plays four, with a big win here giving the Hawks the chance to go top after GWS’s remarkable draw yesterday against St Kilda. They’re expecting around 25,000 in - should be a good game. Try! Parramatta Eels 26-0 Manly Sea Eagles My, oh my. It’s all coming up Eels-house now. Corey Norman, a player who’s been in the spotlight lately with whirling rumours of having fallen out with fellow players, with coaching staff, of wanting a move away. Well, he’s carved through the Sea Eagles defence like a hot knife through butter there. Nothing complex, he received, he ran, he saw half a gap and he made it count. Is this a season-defining turning point from the Eels? To some tennis news out of Wollongong, where Ash Barty has backed up yesterday’s heroics for Australia in the Fed Cup, win the crucial win over Netherlands’ No1 Lesley Kerkhove. After the Dutchman shocked Sam Stosur yesterday, it was down to Barty to level the ledger against the delightfully named Quirine Lemoine. She did so, and today she’s just beaten Kerkhove too, 6-4, 6-2. Australia now takes a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five-match indoor tie at the Wollongong Entertainment Centre, where a win in the reverse singles from Daria Gavrilova can secure Australia’s return to the eight-nation World Group in 2019. Try, Parramatta! Welly, well. Some quick thinking from the play-the-ball, but what were Manly doing? Kaysa Pritchard burrowing into the marker who failed to retreat, and they’ve let the diminutive playmaker stroll over. What a turnaround we’ve got on here - and that’s half-time! Try! Parramatta Eels 14-0 Manly Sea Eagles And they’re in again! A terrific floated pass from Moses once more, and he cuts out two defenders to put in on the chest of George Jennings. He’s then gone and slotted the kick from the sideline, terrific conversion - where’s this confidence been all season?! First big input from new co-captain, the Guff. Manly with a lunge at the line and a fingertip intervention from Parra’s versatile back dislodges the ball over the stripe. Bad news for the Hayne Plane - he’s left the field with an injury he picked up during that the try. Possibly a hip flexor? He heads up the tunnel, absolutely gutted. Try! Parramatta Eels 8-0 Manly Sea Eagles And they hit back straight away! The play seemed to have broken down, but Mitchell Moses went on a mazy lateral run; he teased and probed before putting it on the chest of Hayne. He moved it quickly to Manu Ma’u and the Eels are in! Moses adds the extras, game on. No try! Sheesh, they’re lucky here the Eels. First play after the 40-20 and Manly have walked over! They’ve called it back for obstruction, but two Eels defenders still missed their tackles, and it’s questionable whether the third (who was adjudged to have been impeded) could have got there anyway! Unlucky for Trent Barrett’s men, what a let off for the Eels. We’re about twenty down and it’s all Parramatta so far. They’re dominated possession and territory, completing their sets and keeping the Sea Eagles largely pinned in their own half. The only concern you’d have if you’re Brad Arthur so far is that they haven’t made this dominance count on the scoreboard. Tell you what I’d love to see today though. A bit of Jarryd ‘pre-travels’ Hayne razzle dazzle on the wing for the Eels. And as we speak, a 40-20 from Cherry-Evans. Gotta hate skill players who can individually turn a contest. What can Manly do from this? Parramatta Eels 2-0 Manly Sea Eagles This hasn’t been too shabby from the Eels, we’re about ten in and they’ve twice come dangerously close to breaching the Sea Eagle’s line. Only a terrific tackle on the tryline from Tom Trbojevic prevent the Eels from going in in the corner, and after four penalties, a talking to from the referee to Daly Cherry-Evans for consistently slowing the play. They eventually decide to take the kick, and no mistake for the first points of the game. And we’re underway in our first contest of the day, where it’s NRL action and the winless Eels looking for their first win of the season against the team sitting in 11th. Some big changes during the week for the Eels as they look to arrest their slide. Clint “the Guff” Gutherson has been named as a third co-captain as Brad Arthur looks to get the best from his playing group. David Kidwell, the former New Zealand nation team coach has also joined the backroom staff as the club desperately looks to freshen up their thinking. And, it’s so far, so good on the pitch. We’re five minutes in and they haven’t lost yet! Hi one, hi all! Another big day of sport as we decide the second A-League elimination final between ‘original derby’ rivals Melbourne Victory and Adelaide United. We’ll also see whether Parramatta Eels are ready to win their first NRL game of the season, whether the Hawks can keep pace with West Coast in the AFL, and whether the Brumbies can save face for Australian rugby on another ‘weekend horribilis’ as they take on the Jaguares.

When Luton’s ‘plastic fantastics’ toppled Arsenal","bodyText":"Tuesday marks the 30-year anniversary of one of the great Wembley cup finals – perhaps even the greatest. It was Luton versus Arsenal in the League Cup, underdog versus coming force, and to these eyes it had everything: four goals and a penalty save in the last 19 minutes, a whirler‑twirler of a match that swung one way and then the other and ended in a shock 3-2 win. Then again I am horribly biased, given I enjoyed my only experience as a ballboy that day. Even as a 13-year-old it felt like an out-of-body experience. How many kids are fortunate enough to get changed in a Wembley dressing room – in my case swapping a Luton Schools Under-13 side shirt and tie for an official white and green Littlewoods Cup tracksuit? Or, as a few of us did before the game, get to play keepie‑uppie with the Luton midfielder, Danny Wilson, in the Wembley tunnel? The venerable David Lacey, in his preview for the Guardian, had warned that “it would be unwise to expect too much – both teams use the offside trap as an easy defensive option, so Wembley could be in for a whistle-stop game”. Yet for once in his long career he was proved wrong. Arsenal were huge favourites. Luton’s “plastic fantastics” had won only once on grass in three and a half months and their first-choice keeper, Les Sealey, and midfield enforcer, Darron McDonough, were injured. In the official programme the Gunners’ sponsors, JVC, had an advert for their PC-V2 portable sound system with a cutting tagline: “The best thing you’ve heard since getting Luton in the final.” Arsenal were battle-hardened while Luton had the 19-year-old Kingsley Black, who looked more like a choirboy, playing in his 11th professional game. As he cheerfully admitted to Jim Rosenthal beforehand, he was “very nervous” and “hadn’t had a good night’s sleep”. The omens were not good. Yet at least half the 95,000 fans stuffed into Wembley that day were from Luton and their noise, perforating and relentless – like the London 2012 Super Saturday on steroids – inspired the Hatters. They scored early through Brian Stein and had the better of much of the match. I remember I stood behind a large advertising board for Gola and touched the ball once – although rewatching the match recently I was horrified to see myself pogoing as Mark Stein cut inside Tony Adams’s sliding tackle during the second half only to shoot over the bar. Perhaps that was not a surprise: if Opta had been around back then, Stein’s chances-spurned ratio would have been higher than anyone else’s. Yet increasingly Arsenal took control and, when they scored twice in three minutes through Martin Hayes and Alan Smith, Luton supporters felt a familiar tang of dread. A month earlier they had reached the Simod Cup final, only to be smashed 4-1 by Second Division Reading. A fortnight after that they lost 2-1 to Wimbledon in the FA Cup semi-final in a half-empty White Hart Lane (my main memory is of my brother repeatedly getting car sick on the North Circular). Suddenly a season that had fizzed with possibilities was going horribly flat. Arsenal should have put the game to bed at 2-1 up. They had six great chances in three minutes, only for a combination of bad finishing and the 22-year-old Andy Dibble to keep them out – once with a brilliant penalty save from Nigel Winterburn. If expected goals had been a thing 30 years ago, the models would have overheated. Yet while Luton had been beaten up, they were not knocked out. And somehow they were able to fight back and produce a comeback worthy of Rocky. It helped that Arsenal had Gus Caesar, who became a byword for hapless incompetence in Luton playgrounds for years afterwards, at centre-half. First he miscontrolled a header from Winterburn, then he swung and barely connected with his follow-up before falling over in his own box, and the Hatters had hope. After Caesar had fallen, Luton twisted the knife. Within seconds Wilson headed the equaliser. Then, eight minutes later, Brian Stein slotted home Ashley Grimes’ cross and suddenly the Luton players were celebrating in front of their fans – and about 20 metres from me. After the game I wanted to ask the Arsenal keeper, John Lukic, if I could have his gloves as a souvenir as I walked past him on the Wembley turf but I felt I would be intruding on private grief. Luton celebrated by partying for 48 hours and accidentally damaging the trophy. We ballboys had to settle for some cold chips from a Wembley van. It has not exactly been plain sailing for the Hatters since. They were relegated four years later and at one point had a chairman who proposed building an F1 track round a 50,000-seat stadium off the M1 as he drove the club towards enforced bankruptcy. In less than a decade they went into administration three times, had 40 points worth of deductions and endured four relegations. Not everyone has cared either. The legacy of banning away supporters from Kenilworth Road after Millwall fans ran riot in 1985 or having as chairman David Evans – a Tory MP whose calls for cat o’ nine tails to be used on hooligans made Thatcher appear almost liberal – has taken a long time to shift. Watching some of their football on the way to gaining promotion to League One, achieved at Carlisle on Saturday, offered hope for a brighter future. But nothing, surely, will top that glorious April day in 1988."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/22/emmanuel-macron-donald-trump-fox-news-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T16:46:30Z","webTitle":"Macron begins Trump charm offensive with Fox News Sunday interview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/22/emmanuel-macron-donald-trump-fox-news-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/22/emmanuel-macron-donald-trump-fox-news-interview","fields":{"headline":"Macron begins Trump charm offensive with Fox News Sunday interview","bodyText":"Touting “a very strong personal relation” with Donald Trump, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Sunday began an ambitious charm offensive intended to strengthen US commitments in Syria and Iran while heading off threats of a transatlantic trade war. Prior to his departure for an official state visit to Washington, Macron likened himself to Trump in an interview with Fox News Sunday, a venue with a wide following among Trump supporters and likely to be watched by the president himself. “Both of us are probably the maverick of the systems on both sides,” Macron said. “I think President Trump’s election was unexpected in your country and probably my election was unexpected in my country. And we are not part of the classical political system.” But if his emphasis was on political affinities, Macron faces a substantial challenge to guide his occasionally errant counterpart away from positions popular with his base and, in the case of Syria, at odds with his own recently stated intentions. “I want to get out, I want to bring the troops back home, I want to start rebuilding our nation,” Trump said of Syria at the White House earlier this month, before declaring the US “mission accomplished” with missile strikes outside Damascus and Homs. Macron will arrive in the US with the opposite message. “We will have to build a new Syria after war,” he said. “And that’s why I think the US role is very important to play.” Macron described a similarly ambitious plan to keep the US in the Iran nuclear deal, which the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee last week predicted Trump would withdraw from in May. “Is this agreement perfect?” said Macron. “No. But for nuclear – what do you have? As a better option? I don’t see it.” Macron has been framed as the best hope for co-opting Trump to European policy priorities, with a recent Der Spiegel cover depicting him standing next to a fiery Trump, holding a fire extinguisher as German chancellor Angela Merkel stands by. Macron will have an unusually strong opportunity to make his case in his multi-day state visit. He and Trump are to dine privately on Monday at Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington, before an official White House welcome on Tuesday and an address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday. As a gift, Macron will offer Trump an oak sapling taken from Belleau Wood, north-east of Paris, where in June 1918 US Marines repelled a German offensive with such ferocity that they earned from their beaten enemies the nickname “teufelhunden”, or “Devil Dogs”. Macron does seem to have surpassed other world leaders in establishing a rapport with Trump, whose envy he won when he hosted the US president for a military parade on Bastille Day – “We’re going to have to try to top it,” Trump said. Macron told Fox an interminable handshake between the two was not the contest of wills it appeared to be, but a moment of comity. “It was a very natural moment, I have to say,” he said. “And a very friendly moment. Don’t worry.” One of the sharpest splits between Macron and Trump, however, may be over another world leader, Russian president Vladimir Putin, who Macron, unlike Trump, has a history of confronting. “He’s strong and smart,” Macron said of Putin. “But don’t be naïve. He’s obsessed by interferences in our democracies.” If the French president can convince his American counterpart on that point, no claim of a diplomatic coup might be denied him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/22/aidan-obrien-order-of-st-george-gold-cup-so-perfect","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T17:42:13Z","webTitle":"Aidan O’Brien team steps up a gear as Order Of St George returns in style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/22/aidan-obrien-order-of-st-george-gold-cup-so-perfect","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/22/aidan-obrien-order-of-st-george-gold-cup-so-perfect","fields":{"headline":"Aidan O’Brien team steps up a gear as Order Of St George returns in style","bodyText":"Godolphin carried all before them at Newmarket last week, taking the chief Classic trials, but at Navan on Sunday Aidan O’Brien fired a couple of serious warning shots to let everyone know his team are ready to step up a gear after Order Of St George and So Perfect enjoyed notable victories. The 2016 Ascot Gold Cup winner was given a hands-and-heels ride by Ryan Moore to beat Lord Yeats by five and a half lengths and land the Group Three Vintage Crop Stakes 12 months after he suffered a shock defeat in the corresponding race. There were no mistakes this time as Moore was happy to allow Jedd O’Keeffe’s stable star to bowl along in front before winding up Order Of St George more than two furlongs out and he responded in style. O’Brien was delighted with the effort, saying: “He was well ready to start today. He was in a nice place. We were looking at giving him a couple of races before the Gold Cup and will now go to Leopardstown for the Saval Beg Stakes [which the six-year-old has won the past two years] .” At the other end of the age scale O’Brien unleashed a highly promising debutante in So Perfect, who showed a telling turn of foot to snatch the Tara Sires Irish EBF Maiden in the shadow of the post. The master of Ballydoyle said: “We’re delighted with that for a first run. We were worried about the ground and experience, but she is obviously a very nice filly. She is a big, powerful filly.” This was O’Brien’s first juvenile winner of the season and he was quick to suggest that she could be good enough to be considered for Royal Ascot in June. He remarked: “I’d say she is an Ascot filly and could run over five or six (furlongs). She could run at Naas [in the Listed Juvenile Fillies’ Sprint over six furlongs on May 20] for some more experience.” The champion trainer also had news of his leading Two Thousand Guineas protagonists. He reported: “The Leopardstown winner [Gustav Klimt] and the Racing Post Trophy winner [Saxon Warrior] are both good and I am happy with where they are. Also U S Navy Flag has come on a lot for his debut run (behind Gustav Klimt).” O’Brien’s chief rivals Godolphin also enjoyed notable success on the Navan card when Mary Tudor put up an emphatic performance to win the EBF Salsabil Stakes. The daughter of Dawn Approach didn’t have the clearest of passages with two furlongs to run, but once switched out she kept on strongly to beat Hazel Bay by two and a half lengths. Willie McCreery, her trainer, said: “She settled and did it well. She should get a mile and a half in time and we might go straight to the (Irish) Guineas now.

The ground dried up enough for her and that was the only thing I’d be a bit worried about - she wouldn’t want it any worse than that. “I loved the way she quickened there when she saw the rising ground.

It’s years of struggling to figure out who you actually are and whether or not the adult world will hold a place for that you. It’s fear and loneliness and ache and cringe and in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the dazzling two-part epic now making a triumphal entry onto Broadway in a Lyric Theatre kitted out in a riot of pomo-Victorian splendour, that goes double for wizards. The plays, based on a story by JK Rowling, John Tiffany and Jack Thorne, pick up where the monstrously successful books left off, at Platform 9 and 3/4 where the grown-up heroes of the Potterverse, Hermione (Noma Dumezweni) and Ron (Paul Thornley), Harry (Jamie Parker) and Ginny (Poppy Miller), are waving on children bound for their first year at the wizarding academy Hogwarts. Rose Granger-Weasley (Susan Heyward) seems ready to storm the place; Albus Potter (Sam Clemmett) looks like he would rather hide out that storm in a cellar somewhere. His misery lifts a little when he meets Scorpius Malfoy (Anthony Boyle), the son of his dad’s school days tormentor Draco (Alex Price). As Cursed Child is one of the most plot-heavy texts to appear on Broadway since melodrama became déclassé and suspense is the spell that keeps it whooshing along, it would be unsporting to say much more. Still, fans of the source texts (who cheered and gasped their way through a recent, all-day performance, were treated to some familiar faces. And maybe some faceless faces, too. Cynics not already ensorcelled will wonder if Harry Potter belongs on Broadway at all and some of that wondering is valid. Like Frozen and Mean Girls and Escape to Margaritaville it’s another show capitalizing on a known and already popular quantity. It is in dialogue with its fans (how else to explain the screams of delight when Moaning Myrtle appears?) and will deeply perplex anyone who hasn’t read the delightful books or seen the so-so movies. But unlike those musicals, which commit their material to the stage with less imagination than doggedness, Rowling, Tiffany and Thorne have reinvestigated what made the books work in the first place – a fairytale spine and psychodrama muscles all wrapped up in some incredibly specific world-building – and they’ve used their findings to craft a new story. Under Tiffany’s shoot-for-the-moon direction, they have presented it in a form that is exuberantly, flabbergastingly, Playbill-shreddingly theatrical. This is the unlikely link between Cursed Child and the pleasantly inane SpongeBob musical, another show that has decided that as long as it’s on Broadway it might as well make the most of it. Yes, the short scenes and quick cuts owe a debt to cinema. But Steven Hoggett’s movement, Christine Jones’s set, Katrina Lindsay’s costumes, Imogen Heap’s music, plus the sound, the projections, the lights and the extremely good acting (with Parker’s anguished Harry and Boyle’s screechy phobic Scorpius both standouts), that’s all theater. The stage illusions, created by Jamie Harrison in concert with a crack team of designers, are you-won’t-believe-your-eyes stunners. Broadway hasn’t seen magic like since the profoundly embarrassing and moustached days of Merlin. Its return is thrilling. Thorne’s eventful, jam-packed script sometimes leans on its metaphors and Freudianisms a little heavily. Who is the cursed child? There are at least six likely candidates. And it’s a shame that the script didn’t find more for the women to do. This is very much a Boy’s Own Story. Mothers and daughters are mostly surplus to requirements. Still, most of the daughters and sons who read the books in their first printings have become mothers and fathers by now and the plays are often wise about the ways in which parents try to protect their children from the world and the ways in which children resist that protection as part of the painful and necessary process of separation and how most families, however fumblingly, will survive it. The play’s great gift is to let us know that they boy who lived has to go on living and then make room for his sons and daughter to live their own lives, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/22/david-bailin-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T16:52:18Z","webTitle":"David Bailin obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/22/david-bailin-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/22/david-bailin-obituary","fields":{"headline":"David Bailin obituary","bodyText":"My father, David Bailin, who has died aged 79, was a physicist who was ahead of his time. His best known work was on superconductivity and superfluidity in relativistic fermion systems, inspired by his former Sussex colleague Tony Leggett’s Nobel prizewinning work on superfluid Helium-3. It gained no citations for the first few years, until its importance for neutron stars was understood. His early research was on the weak interaction – the fundamental force behind certain kinds of radioactivity. He showed that the experimental data at the time required the existence of a heavy W boson particle, which was discovered 20 years later. David was born in London, the son of William Bailin, a tailor, who worked as a codebreaker at Bletchley Park in the second world war, and his wife, Eva (nee Taylor). He attended Westminster City school, and was the first from his family to go to university. Gaining a first-class mathematics degree and PhD from Caius College, Cambridge, as a Fulbright scholar he went on to Princeton University in 1964 to further his particle physics research before becoming a young lecturer at Oxford University and finally settling at Sussex University. He spent 38 happy years at Sussex, rising to chair of physics and astronomy, having met and married Anjali (nee Medhi), a PhD student there, in 1965 following a whirlwind romance. She was the daughter of an Indian freedom fighter who had been imprisoned by the British. David had joined the civil rights movement in Mississippi in the Freedom Summer of 1964, which was his political awakening. Their core beliefs were the tenets of our family. He continued to study and marvel at the universe through the theoretical particle physics he loved right until the end, while enjoying all the benefits of being a doting grandfather. He loved Mozart, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion FC and chasing cows in fields. He is survived by Anjali, his sons, Adam and me, four grandchildren and two sisters, Barbara and Diana."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/22/government-aware-for-years-that-hostile-environment-hurt-windrush-generation","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T06:45:20Z","webTitle":"Government knew for years that Windrush generation hurt by 'hostile environment'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/22/government-aware-for-years-that-hostile-environment-hurt-windrush-generation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/22/government-aware-for-years-that-hostile-environment-hurt-windrush-generation","fields":{"headline":"Government knew for years that Windrush generation hurt by 'hostile environment'","bodyText":"A letter from a Home Office minister dated May 2016 and obtained by the Guardian shows that the government has known for years about the impact of its “hostile environment” policy on the Windrush generation. As the government struggles to contain mounting pressure on both Theresa May and the home secretary, Amber Rudd, Home Office sources indicate that legislation could be rushed through parliament to give citizenship to those affected. The letter the Guardian has obtained relates to Trevor Johnson. In a story that has shocked even veteran immigration rights campaigners, both Trevor and his brother Desmond have had their lives wrecked by hostile environment policies. They arrived as boys from Jamaica in 1971. Trevor has faced threats of deportation, while Desmond has not been allowed to visit Britain, where he has a daughter as well as a brother, since he went back to Jamaica for his father’s funeral in 2001. Desmond has not seen his daughter for 16 years. The letter was sent by James Brokenshire, immigration minister from 2014 to 2016, to Kate Hoey, the Labour MP who had raised the case of Trevor, her constituent. The letter set out that Johnson was liable to be deported despite having lived in Britain for 45 years because he could not show that he had arrived before 1973, when the law changed. Nor could he provide the documentary evidence the Home Office demanded of continuous residence over other periods in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2014 he was told he was here illegally, and his benefits were stopped. Asked about the letter on ITV’s Peston on Sunday programme, Brokenshire – who is now on the backbenches and has been receiving treatment for lung cancer – said he had not seen the letter before. He said, however, that he had always tried to be compassionate. “We did, as a Home Office, look compassionately over a number of individual cases. And you do try to make the right decisions. It is about being firm but fair. And I think that’s the issue that’s been striking for me.” Ministers insist that the Windrush victims are suffering from a failure at official level, not from a bad policy in and of itself. The justice secretary, David Gauke, has said that the flaws were in the implementation. “It is right that we take illegal immigration seriously – of course I stress we are not talking about illegal immigrants in the Windrush case – but it is perfectly reasonable to, for example, want to ensure that when we are providing public services they are being provided to people who are entitled to them,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. “The objective was for this to be focused on illegal immigration … most people … believed it would be possible to tighten up the provision of public services without there being an impact on people here legally.” A former cabinet minister, Sayeeda Warsi, has said however that there was bitter opposition in cabinet to some of the policies May pursued while she was home secretary between 2010 and 2016. Warsi, who is also a former Conservative party chair, told ITV’s Peston on Sunday it was a failed policy caused by the party’s obsession with bringing down net migration. “I think we were all responsible. I would hold myself responsible as part of the government,” she said. “What happened unfortunately during those years and has continued is that we had an unhealthy obsession with numbers. We were wedded to unrealistic targets, targets that we still haven’t met unfortunately a decade on, and yet we continue to remain wedded to targets. “And what we ended up with was, I think, the unintended consequences of the policy we are now implementing.” Warsi’s remarks, which reinforce criticisms made before the weekend by the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who chaired the cabinet subcommittee on immigration from 2010 to 2015, undermine Rudd. The home secretary has insisted that the problem was merely that officials lost sight of people in their concern for implementing the policy. Rudd was further embarrassed when the Guardian was passed a document she sent to May pledging to escalate the hostile environment. In it she set out her “ambitious” plan to increase removals and focus officials on “arresting, detaining and forcibly removing illegal migrants” while “ruthlessly” prioritising Home Office resources for the programme. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, told Nick Robinson on the Marr show that there was something “rotten at the heart of government”, and called for Rudd to resign. She said: “People have died, people have lost their jobs, lost their futures. People working in the National Health Service all their lives suddenly lose their jobs. “It could not be worse and yet the home secretary thinks, ‘I can apologise and it will be all right.’ Well, it won’t be. I really think she should quit.” The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants and the civil rights organisation Liberty are demanding that an independent commission is be set up to review the workings of the Home Office and the legal framework of the “hostile environment” policy. After an unsatisfactory meeting with May last week where they say there was no sign that there would be a proper investigation, the two organisations have released a dossier written in 2014 showing clearly how many warnings the government received about the impact of its policies. In further evidence that the government has been aware for many years of the problems experienced by children of Windrush immigrants, a blog from as long ago as May 2013, written by a Foreign Office official responsible for resettling deported Jamaicans, is still on the ministry’s website. “Many consider themselves British, having moved to the UK as a young child with their parents or grandparents and granted indefinite leave to remain [ILR].” The blog does not address policy issues, but it shows clearly that there were recognised and worrying issues related to Home Office policy. On Sunday night an email from a junior government whip, Mike Freer, the MP for Finchley, emerged in which he dismissed any government responsibility and instead blamed Labour. “It is so sad that opposition parties would seek to deliberately misquote and misinterpret what Theresa May said. The Windrush issue is absolutely nothing to do with immigration reforms introduced under the Cameron government. Then the policy was to make it harder for ILLEGAL immigrants to settle in the UK. The Windrush people were and are legal. Wholly separate and unconnected. “I would also point out that the decision to destroy the landing cards of the Windrush people was taken by the last LABOUR Government, so it really is the height of opportunism and hypocrisy for the Opposition to take some moral high ground.” Freer has not responded to requests for a comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/22/saudi-arabia-coach-crash-british-pilgrims","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T16:44:29Z","webTitle":"Saudi Arabia: four Britons killed after coach hits fuel tanker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/22/saudi-arabia-coach-crash-british-pilgrims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/22/saudi-arabia-coach-crash-british-pilgrims","fields":{"headline":"Saudi Arabia: four Britons killed after coach hits fuel tanker","bodyText":"Four Britons have been killed in a coach crash in Saudi Arabia after their bus collided with a petrol tanker, their travel agent has confirmed. The crash happened on Saturday morning on the road between the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, according to Gulfaraz Zaman, a director of Blackburn-based Hashim Travel, which organised the trip. A woman and her son were among the dead and the other two victims were a man and woman in their 60s or 70s, he said. All were taking part in an umrah Islamic pilgrimage. The crash happened near Al Khalas, a settlement roughly 30 miles north of Mecca, the Foreign Office (FCO) said. Many of the 14 other British pilgrims on the bus were injured. Zaman said: “There are broken legs, broken noses, one person has a brain haemorrhage. Those who survived were thrown out of the bus, which set on fire, along with the oil tanker. If you see photographs of the bus there’s just the frame of it left.” Five or six remained in hospital with burns and broken limbs, he said. Eighteen pilgrims were on the bus at the time, all guests of Hashim Travel. They were from Blackburn, Preston, Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Northampton, said Zaman. The youngest, a girl of about six, hurt her head, he said. They were halfway through a two-week pilgrimage when the accident happened. Hashim Travel charges £1,150 for the trip, according to its website. While the hajj takes place on fixed dates in the Islamic calendar, pilgrims can go to Mecca to perform the rituals of umrah at any other time of the year. FCO representatives were helping the survivors to return home, said Zaman: “All of their belongings have been burned; their passports and everything.” The families of the dead have been informed and the travel company has arranged for them to fly out to Saudi Arabia. An FCO spokesman confirmed there were British fatalities among the victims, but said details were still emerging. He said: “We are supporting the British families of those who have died and those injured following a serious road traffic accident near the town of Al Khalas, Saudi Arabia.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/22/letter-sir-wilson-harris-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T15:44:23Z","webTitle":"Letter: Sir Wilson Harris obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/22/letter-sir-wilson-harris-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/22/letter-sir-wilson-harris-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Letter: Sir Wilson Harris obituary","bodyText":"While working as a librarian for Hammersmith and Fulham, in west London, I met Sir Wilson Harris when we organised an event to celebrate his 70th birthday. There was a collective raising of eyebrows by a few of my colleagues, who either had not heard of him, or thought him something of a marginal figure in “black literature”. The ambivalence towards him may have been due partly to the perceived difficulty of his language and style, and to the fact that he seemed different from the Caribbean writers who were then being promoted in public libraries. Nonetheless, the event was well attended, and Harris seemed pleased to have his work recognised and promoted. What I appreciated in it was, as the obituary noted, his breadth of vision and avoidance of the trap of victimhood."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
