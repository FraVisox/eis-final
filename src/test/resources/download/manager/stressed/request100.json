In his indispensable book, Finishing the Hat, Stephen Sondheim says of this musical adaptation of a comedy by Aristophanes, originally staged in a Yale swimming pool in 1974, that it suffered from inflation when expanded by Nathan Lane into a full-length show in 2004. Fun as this longer version is, you feel Sondheim has a point. We are told at the outset that the time is now and the place is ancient Greece. What this paradox means is that Lane and the original adapter, Burt Shevelove, preserve Aristophanes’ structure while making the story topical. So we see Dionysos, appalled at the state of the world, descending to Hades with his servant Xanthias to bring back a dramatist who will shake mankind out of its moral torpor. In 405BC, this led to a contest between Euripides and Aeschylus. In the updated version, it yields a battle between a fiercely polemical George Bernard Shaw and a movingly poetic Shakespeare. Even if it takes time to get to the climactic bout, the journey is enjoyable. Disproving the idea that he can’t do touching love songs, Sondheim gives Dionysos a beautiful hymn to Ariadne. The chorus for the frogs spawns a fiendishly intricate number in which they contrast their easygoing existence with that of “fancy-pants humanitarians and chatty platitudinarians”. And, when it comes to the crucial contest, the advocates of Shaw wittily comment on “such sanity, humanity, who cares about the vanity” while Shakespeare’s “Fear no more the heat o’ the sun” is given a supremely musical setting. The problem is that Shaw’s pugnacious wit is no match for Shakespeare’s poetic power and the verdict is predictable. Sondheim later intriguingly suggested that it might have been more dramatic if the antagonists had been Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams. But it’s a show that Sondheim completists will want to catch, and Grace Wessels’s production and Tim Sutton’s musical direction, scored for a four-piece band, do it justice. Michael Matus as Dionysos, the god of drama, is amusingly flustered and, swapping places with his sidekick in a fit of cowardice, tells him: “You came out here a slave but you’re going to go back a god.” George Rae as Xanthias exudes the practical sense of the comic servant, and there is striking support from Li-Tong Hsu as the Amazonian Virilla and Emma Ralston as a Pluto who, in her lyrical paean to Hades, proclaims that “Hell is hot”. It is worth recalling, however, that when Aristophanes wrote his play, Athens was at a point of crisis: the Spartan army was encamped a few miles away, funds were running out and moderates in the Assembly were outnumbered by extremists. This remarkable comedy was a plea for the moral power of a poet to save a beleaguered culture. Whatever the pleasure provided by this larky update, it can never recapture the Aristophanic belief that it is the paramount duty of the artist to make people better citizens. •At Jermyn Street theatre, London, until 8 April.

The high court in London decides not to liquidate Leyton Orient, or place them in administration, but instead accepts a promise from the owner, Francesco Becchetti, that he will put another £1m into the club to clear its debts. But it has been a gruelling day for fans of a club that just three years ago was on the brink of the Championship. There had been a small cheer in Court 1 at the Rolls Building as Leyton Orient’s name was read out for the first time. Around 40 fans have made it inside to observe the winding-up hearing that might have ended up closing a football club that has existed since 1881. Some wore scarves, another had a blazer embroidered with the club badge, a third stood with his arms behind him, clutching his season ticket. There was also a smattering of press people, who mostly, like me, have a connection to the club. The fans were nearly all men of a certain age – who else has time to turn up to court on a Monday morning to observe? Word went out that there were only 23 seats for the public in court, and so a queue formed at the door about an hour before the hearing was due to open. Before the case, opinion was divided among the supporters waiting to get in. “I just want to get him out,” said one supporter about Becchetti. The court case is the culmination of three disastrous years of ownership by the Italian. Having acquired the club from Barry Hearn following Orient’s League One play-off final defeat on penalties in May 2014, Becchetti has given 10 managers the seemingly impossible task of keeping him happy, received a six-game stadium ban for violent conduct, and seen the team drop from being within spot-kicks of reaching the Championship to almost certainly exiting the Football League. “How to ruin a club in three years” is a constant refrain on social media. It was quite difficult to get people to go on the record in the queue. One man doesn’t want his boss to know he has come when he should be at work. Another is worried about further upsetting the owner. Online criticism of Becchetti has been, in the words of one fan, “quite vicious”. All possible future scenarios seem to worry somebody in the queue. One explains that he fears Becchetti selling up. “When most people sell clubs,” he says “they do it with the best interests of the club at heart. I can’t see him doing that.” Another fan wonders, with a club that does not own its ground and is reportedly in so much debt, what there is to sell. A lot of people are hoping for the case to be adjourned, to give the club time to come up with a payment plan. It would defer the threat of administration and postpone any points deduction until beyond the end of the season. But with the team bottom of the league, seven points from safety and coming off the back of 4-1 and 5-0 defeats, league survival seems unlikely in any case. As at any gathering of supporters, there is discussion about the team. A rumour sweeps the queue that someone has it on good authority that representatives of the owner have been approaching players about signing on for next season – indicating that maybe Becchetti, rather than selling, intends to hang on. One player’s name is mentioned as wanting to stay – there are some groans, then somebody pipes up: “But he might be quite good at Conference level.” One of the barristers speaks to me before the hearing. I wonder if it is an unusual day at the office for him. He says that it is “slightly busier than it usually is, but not that much to be honest. It’s a crazy experience, this court.” The Orient case is 75th on the list. There is a lot for the fans to sit through before the future of their club is to be decided. The man next to me ticks each case off the printed list we have all been given. There aren’t enough seats for everybody. “It’s like the Central line this morning, isn’t it?” chimes one fan. “Choc ices, anybody?” calls another. The cases whistle by, most lasting only a couple of minutes. There is a dispute over the value of a house that might be used to pay off a debt, with an appeal that if the court grants the winding-up petition, it would leave vulnerable adults who rely on the company for care services without anywhere to stay. It puts it into a bit of perspective. It’s football, not life or death. The Leyton Orient Fans’ Trust has been preparing for a range of scenarios, raising more than £100,000 for a regeneration fund that, in the worst-case scenario, could be used to set up a phoenix club. AFC Orient would have a good chance of playing home matches at Brisbane Road, as the owner of the Matchroom Stadium, Hearn, has indicated that a new club would be allowed to play there rent-free for a season. It is unclear though at which step a new club would be able to join the league pyramid structure, with a worse-case scenario of joining the Essex Senior League alongside teams such as London Bari, Clapton FC and Wadham Lodge FC being a possibility. Once the hearing starts, it is revealed that Becchetti has settled in full the debt to HMRC that caused the case to be brought forward. But four other creditors have come forward, including the club photographer who is owed £6,000, and the company which supplies matchday stewards, which is owed just over £18,000. Becchetti’s lawyers state that he intends to inject £1m into the club within the next eight to 10 weeks. The local council is also a creditor, and after some dispute, the case is adjourned until June. Afterwards, feelings are running high. There’s a brief skirmish outside with choice language between fans with opposing views about how supporters have handled the situation. “It’s that kind of language that’s got us here,” shouts one guy. Another fan is sceptical: “He says he is going to put in a million pounds. I still think we are in trouble.” It is a massive relief that the club has not been liquidated. Football has a weird way of throwing up coincidences and emotional narratives. If the club had gone out of existence, it would have meant that the last goal scored at Brisbane Road, their home since 1937, would have been by Mathieu Baudry. Fan favourite and former captain of Leyton Orient, he was one of the players who missed his penalty in that 2014 Wembley play-off final, which set off the chain of events that got us here. He did not celebrate his goal for Doncaster on Saturday, and later tweeted out his support for Orient on their big day in court. They will be back there again on 12 June. The saga of Becchetti’s ownership of Leyton Orient continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/mar/24/hosni-mubarak-returns-to-cairo-home-after-six-years-in-custody","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-24T12:05:29Z","webTitle":"Hosni Mubarak: Egypt's toppled dictator freed after six years in custody","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/24/hosni-mubarak-returns-to-cairo-home-after-six-years-in-custody","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/mar/24/hosni-mubarak-returns-to-cairo-home-after-six-years-in-custody","fields":{"headline":"Hosni Mubarak: Egypt's toppled dictator freed after six years in custody","bodyText":"Egypt’s former dictator Hosni Mubarak has left the Cairo military hospital where he had been held in custody for much of the past six years, and returned to his home in the Cairo suburb of Heliopolis, his lawyer said. Mubarak, 88, was acquitted by Egypt’s highest appeals court on 2 March of conspiring to kill protesters in the final verdict in a long-running case that originally resulted in him being sentenced to life in prison in 2012 over the deaths of 239 people in Arab spring protests against his rule. A separate corruption charge was overturned in January 2015. He left the Maadi military hospital on Friday morning and returned to his home, where he had breakfast with his family and a number of friends, according to a report in the privately owned newspaper al-Masy al-Youm. His lawyer, Farid al-Deeb, told the paper that Mubarak thanked those who had supported him throughout his trial. The strongman, who ruled Egypt for nearly three decades, often appeared in a frail state during his court appearances, attending on a stretcher and wearing dark sunglasses, but the appearances put paid to repeated rumours of his death. Mubarak was also healthy enough to appear at the window of his hospital room to wave to supporters gathered outside on occasions including his birthday and the anniversary of Egypt’s 1973 war with Israel. For those who worked to topple the former dictator, Mubarak’s freedom marks a grim moment in Egypt’s modern history. Yet some reacted with little more than resignation as his release became imminent, numbed by the years of political turmoil since his fall. Mubarak’s democratically elected successor, Mohamed Morsi, was overthrown in a popularly backed military coup in 2013. Many see echoes of Mubarak’s style of leadership in Egypt’s current leader, the former general Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. “I’m neither sad nor disappointed,” said Tarek el-Khatib, whose brother, Mustafa, was killed in the struggle to topple Mubarak. “I’d have been surprised had things happened otherwise. Politically, everything flew in this direction and paved the way for the normality of this moment.” Over the past six years there have been repeated efforts to punish family members and business associates who profited from Mubarak’s regime, largely without lasting consequence. Mubarak’s sons, Alaa and Gamal, were freed in October 2015, with a judge stating that they had served adequate jail time on charges of corruption and embezzlement of public funds. The notorious steel tycoon Ahmed Ezz, formerly the secretary general of Mubarak’s now defunct National Democratic party, was named as an honorary leader of a political party in 2016, although he had previously served three years on corruption charges. Despite describing the revolution that ended Mubarak’s rule as “a turning point in Egypt’s history,” Sisi and his military-backed government are regarded as the autocrat’s political heirs. “I think that Mubarak’s release was something expected as his students are ruling the country,” said Mahienour el Massry, an activist and lawyer who served 15 months in prison under Sisi’s rule. “The same regime, the same corruption, the same brutality. “Mubarak might be released, but in the eyes of those who believe in the revolution he will always be a criminal killer and the godfather of corruption,” she said. “This might be another round that we have lost, but we will keep on fighting to change the inhuman regime that releases criminals and imprisons innocent people.” Others were less hopeful. Mubarak’s freedom meant the families of those killed were “now praying for divine justice”, said Mohsen Bahnasy, a human rights lawyer who served as a member of the commission of inquiry into military abuses committed during the 2011 revolution. Egypt’s highest appeals court previously rejected demands by the families of those killed during the uprising to bring civil suits against Mubarak for his role in the deaths of protesters. An official inquiry later concluded that 846 people died and a further 6,467 were injured during the revolution, as Egyptian security forces violently suppressed the protests which packed Cairo’s central Tahrir Square. “The Mubarak acquittal is of significant symbolic value in that it reflects an absolute failure of Egyptian judicial and legal institutions to hold a single official accountable for the killing of almost 900 protesters during the January 25 revolution. It is indicative of a deeper, compounded crisis of transitional justice,” said Mai el Sedany, a legal expert with the Washington thinktank the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. “This is a clear message to all Egyptians that no one will be held accountable for any corruption or oppression in this country – the state is loyal to its men and will continue to be,” said Khatib. “Don’t dream of any revolution again.” Mubarak’s release comes amid an economic crisis following years of political tumult and worsening security. Egyptians complain of empty pockets and rumbling bellies as inflation exceeds 30% and the government tightens its belt in return for loans from the International Monetary Fund. “The economic crisis we are living in and the high prices take priority over everything, as does the fear of terrorism. That is what preoccupies ordinary citizens, not Mubarak,” said Khaled Dawoud, an opposition politician who opposed the Islamists but also condemned the bloody crackdown on them. “When you see the group of people who show up and cheer and support him, you are talking about 150, 200 people,” he said, referring to occasional shows of support outside the Maadi hospital when Mubarak was there.

Just this month, Klimt’s Bauerngarten sold for £48m, making it the third most expensive painting ever to be sold in Europe. In 2016, a Picasso sold for £43.2m, the highest price ever paid for a Cubist work, and in 2015, Gerhart Richter’s Abstraktes Bild sold for £30.4m, a record for a living artist. The global art industry, valued at $63.8bn (£51.6bn), is still dominated by bricks-and-mortar auction houses and private sales through galleries or dealers. But like many other industries it is diversifying, presenting a major opportunity for a new generation of “artrepreneurs”. One company leading the charge is Rise Art. Set up in 2011 by Scott Phillips and Marcos Steverlynck, it is an online gallery offering new works largely from emerging artists. Unlike other industries, which have been overtaken by e-commerce, online purchases make up just 7% of private art sales. But for Rise Art business is booming. “I’d say over the past eight months, we have been growing at about 30% month on month,” says Phillips. The business opens up the art world to people who might be limited by their location or the time they can spend looking for art. “It takes a lot of time, energy and research to immerse yourself in all the galleries to find something,” he says. So why aren’t more collectors buying online? “Art always looks better in the flesh,” Phillips says. “People have issues online with sizing, and knowing whether it will be perfect, an important factor when we consider the high-ticket value of art.” For this reason, Rise Art introduced an art rentals and flexible returns service, whereby you can live with art in your home before you purchase it. “If you love it, you can use the rental towards the purchase and if not, you can just return it,” he explains. A report from insurer Hiscox, released in June last year, showed that online art sales reached a record high of $3.27 billion in 2015, which would put the market on track for sales of $9.58 billion by 2020. Jeffrey Boloten, co-founder and managing director of ArtInsight Ltd and leader of the art and business semester programme at Sotheby’s Institute of Art, says the online art world is seen by both the auction and dealer sectors as providing a much welcomed expansion of the global collecting community. Boloten notes that while the expansion of the art market can present “challenging shifts in how the traditional art market has historically operated”, it has, he says, “increased the growth of innovative and creative new business models and relationships”. One of these new models is MyArtBroker, an online platform facilitating art dealer sales. Founded by Ian and Joey Syer, it focuses on the resale of art works, known as the secondary market. MyArtBroker connects owners of artworks directly with dealers actively looking to sell those pieces. It has sold work by Banksy, Picasso and Warhol. The idea for the business came to Ian Syer while he was working in a gallery. “We would sell artwork from our artists, but then at some point, someone would come back in to resell,” he recalls. As traditional high street galleries need to make a certain margin, art owners faced reselling at a loss. “We would end up just pointing people towards the internet but there’s not really anything out there other than eBay.” To help art owners avoid the drawbacks of selling on eBay and the steep fees of an auction house, Syer set up MyArtBroker. Sellers can upload their artwork to the platform and the company passes on the inquiries they get from interested buyers to a suitable broker. MyArtBroker works with a dedicated team of dealers who handle all aspects of the sale, including framing, authenticity checks and shipping. MyArtBroker takes an introduction fee of 12.5%, which alongside the broker’s fee of 12.5% brings the total deductions from the sale to 25%. Along with individual buyers, many businesses are looking for new ways to purchase art work affordably. King &amp; McGraw is an art prints company supplying artwork for offices, stores, healthcare, hospitality and interior design companies, including prints of iconic paintings and movie posters. Prints can be seen as a ‘poor relation’ in the art world but the latest printing technology allows designs to be printed in smaller batches, meaning print sellers don’t have to stick to safe or inoffensive designs to ensure they sell them all and make a return. In this way, King &amp; McGraw has been able to introduce the work of young, emerging print artists to market, much like a dealer in a gallery. The company even has its own artist-in-residence programme. Social media is key to King &amp; McGraw’s operation. “Social media has become absolutely crucial for how we sell our work. It is perfect for attracting the audience we want - often young people interested in getting their first bit of art,” says co-founder Gyr King. Technology has brought the art world to a bigger and broader audience – but once you have found your perfect treasure, how do you get it delivered safely? Van Girls, an all-female removals company with a specialism in art transit, is among the companies springing up to service this expanding market. Founder Emma Lanman first started moving art on her days off from her former job as a firefighter. “One of my earliest customers was a street art print gallery in North London, called Jealous Gallery. And I did, in a former life, do a history of art degree and work in galleries, so immediately I was excited by the idea of art moving,” she says. In such a flourishing sector, Lanman says there is plenty of work to go around. “You don’t have to have giant, expensive art collections to have art anymore,” she says. “The Affordable Art Fair and others like it are for normal people who might spend £1000 on something that’s going to be in their living room. And, there’s definitely a whole world of moving for that.” Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/mar/21/inspector-morse-creator-colin-dexter-dead","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T14:08:54Z","webTitle":"Inspector Morse creator Colin Dexter dead at 86","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/21/inspector-morse-creator-colin-dexter-dead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/mar/21/inspector-morse-creator-colin-dexter-dead","fields":{"headline":"Inspector Morse creator Colin Dexter dead at 86","bodyText":"Colin Dexter, the author behind detective Inspector Morse and his adventures solving mysteries in Oxfordshire, has died at the age of 86, with the top names in crime writing lining up to pay tribute to a “a kind, generous man”. Dexter’s death at his home in Oxford was announced by his publisher Macmillan on Tuesday. Val McDermid, who was a good friend of Dexter, described him as “a lovely, lovely man” and not as grumpy as his creation – “though he did share Morse’s love of music”. “Early on in my career I told him I was nervous about how to write police procedurals and he said, ‘Well, my dear, I had written five Morse novels before I had even set foot in a police station.’ He had great sense of humour,” McDermid told the Guardian. Author Lee Child described Dexter as “revolutionary”. “He wrote a character without any concessions at all to likely popularity – Morse was bad tempered, cantankerous, esoteric and abstruse – and thereby showed us that integrity and authenticity work best,” Child said. “His literary descendants are everywhere. When our genre’s family tree is drawn, he’s the root of a huge portion of it.” Author Peter James said “all of us who love crime fiction owe Colin Dexter a very great debt”. “There are few writers of whom it can be genuinely said that they changed – or indeed created – a genre. But Colin Dexter did. Morse was unique, both in the pages of the novels and in the subsequent television adaptations,” James said. “In many ways he mirrored characteristics of Sherlock Holmes, with his fierce brain and quiet nature, and. like Holmes, he came off the page and stepped out of our screens to become a living person, someone any of us could imagine meeting for a drink in a pub.” Dexter’s 13 Morse novels, which were written between 1975 and 1999, sold millions, and were adapted into a hugely popular television series starring John Thaw as the detective. Dexter’s writing also spawned spin-off TV shows, Lewis – following Morse’s longtime companion – and Endeavour, about Morse’s early days on the police force. Actor Sheila Hancock, who was married to Thaw until his death in 2002 and played a guest role in Endeavour, called Dexter “a sweet, gentle, erudite man”. “Colin seemed to thoroughly enjoy being involved in the programme, making Hitchcock-like appearances and hanging out with the cast and crew,” she said. “I think he was deeply fond of both Kevin [Whately] and John. As they were of him.” Born Norman Colin Dexter in Lincolnshire in 1930, Dexter began his writing career by writing text books while working in education. After retiring from a 13-year teaching career due to deafness, he decided to write a crime novel while on a rainy holiday in Wales with his family in 1972. Bored with the novel he was reading, Dexter decided he could do better. His debut, Last Bus to Woodstock, arrived on shelves in 1975. It was a sleeper hit, but the series eventually took off, in part due to his main character Inspector Morse, a curmudgeonly detective who liked ale, crosswords and Wagner – sharing many of his creator’s interests. “He’d no time for reports,” Dexter wrote of Morse, in Last Bus to Woodstock. “He suspected that about 95% of the written word was never read by anyone anyway.” Dexter killed off his famous detective in 1999’s The Remorseful Day, to great sadness among his fans worldwide. In an interview in 2000, he told the Guardian: “I started with him 27 years ago, and I miss the old boy more than most people. I get lots of letters saying, ‘It’s terribly sad’; ‘You’re terribly cruel’; ‘Why did you do it?’” In 2000, Dexter was given an OBE for services to literature and in 2001, was awarded freedom of the city in Oxford, where all his Morse stories were set. He also won four CWA Dagger awards, as well as the Diamond Dagger – the highest honour in British crime writing – and the Theakston’s Old Peculier outstanding contribution to crime fiction. Dexter refused to write a memoir, and would not allow anyone else to write a biography while he was still alive. “I’ve had such a lot of luck, I don’t want to risk having someone ridiculously ill-informed doing it,” he told the Guardian. “I think it should wait till you are dead. And when you’re dead, everyone forgets you anyway, if you write crime fiction.” “Colin was an author who inspired all those who worked with him,” said Maria Rejt, his most recent editor. “His loyalty, modesty and self-deprecating humour gave joy to many. His was the sharpest mind and the biggest heart, and his wonderful novels and stories will remain a testament to both.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/mar/21/furry-wild-side-fursona-animal-nature","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T14:24:07Z","webTitle":"I’m a furry.

And I’m finally at home with my wild side","bodyText":"If I could be anything, I’d be a jaguar. And not just any jaguar. One with a dark coat, blue spots, but my general humanoid shape intact along with the feline features. That’s because I’m a furry. It took me a long time to admit that to anyone. More than 15 years. That’s because I had always heard the word “furry” as a pejorative, a term practically synonymous with fetish. At best, being open about it would open me to ridicule and at worst, well, I didn’t even want to think about the reactions of friends and family. Despite the proliferation of nerdy pop culture – from anime to cosplay – furries have always been pushed out to the fringes. Even when I decided to tell my wife about my interest in the fandom, I couldn’t hold back the anxiety. I was in a knot for days leading up to purchasing a ticket to my first furry convention at the relatively late age of 33. It was unexpected enough that my wife called me as soon as she saw the charge on our bank account. She thought some pervert had hijacked it. No, I said, I was the one going to Rocky Mountain Fur Con. Even then, she asked me “You’re not a secret furry, are you?” To her, the term conjured the implication of people dressed up in mascot-like costumes who set about deviantly despoiling convention centre hotel rooms. All I could say was: “Not secret, but not how you think.” Furry is not a fetish. I know that runs counter to the atrocious CSI episode about the fandom and a long-form 2001 Vanity Fair hatchet job, but furries are not bound together by some predilection for anonymous yiffing. It’s more like someone asking what superhero you’d want to be and saying no, thanks, you’d rather be a hyena or fox or deer. It’s about identity, picking a fursona – like a persona, naturally – that’s a projection of who you are or wish you could be. Instead of going to comic cons dressed up as Captain America or Black Widow, furries define an identity all their own. Of course there’s a sexuality to the fandom. There is for almost any you can name. But that doesn’t define what brings furries together, and it would be a mistake to let the sneers and jeers of critics define the conversation. If you want to be surprised by who furries are and what they do, there’s an entire scientific profile on the matter for you to peruse. Stigma shouldn’t drive the way furries present themselves, especially during an era where a little escapism feels sorely needed. Furries are hardly the only fandom to be misunderstood. But during a time when comic book movies are big box office and cosplaying is normal, I don’t understand why furry hate hangs on. If anything, it’s always been on the edges of our experience. Anthropomorphic animals completely permeate our culture, from the earliest cave drawings to the Oscar-winning Zootopia (Zootropolis in the UK). People dress as animals for Halloween, identify with certain species as personal favourites, and, hell, a popular trashy novel and movie series had duelling fans debate the merits of whether the female lead should marry a blood-sucking corpse or werewolf. Whether you’re rooting for an animal-themed sports team or listening to Top 40 songs about being “hungry like the wolf”, we’re practically obsessed by crossover between the human and animal. Furries have a culture all their own, formed through internet forums and conventions over decades. But the basic fascination has always been with us. Furries are simply drawing from our animalistic interests and curiosities to create characters for ourselves instead of trying to co-opt something already pre-packed and sold. It just so happens to be animal-shaped, and so much the better.

Michael Rakowitz’s piece The Invisible Enemy Should Not Exist will occupy the plinth from 2018. The work is a response to what Rakowitz called the “cultural genocide”, and the accompanying human tragedy, happening in places such as Iraq and Syria. Rakowitz’s towering work will reconstruct the sculpture of Lamassu, a winged bull, which stood at the entrance to the Nergal Gate of Nineveh in Iraq from 700BC until its destruction by Isis in 2015, along with other ancient artefacts in Mosul museum. It will take over from the current commission, a giant black thumbs-up, created by the British artist David Shrigley. “It’s a real honour,” said Rakowitz, an American whose Iraqi grandparents fled the country in the 1940s. “[The plinth artwork] is happening at a time which is especially meaningful, considering the enormous number of people that are forced to leave Iraq and Syria and are seeking sanctuary. This piece becomes a kind of a placeholder for those human lives that can’t be reconstructed … whether it’s cultural genocide or the burning of books, it’s the destruction of artefacts that always accompanies a human catastrophe.” The sculpture is part of a decade-long project by the sculptor to reconstruct ancient objects destroyed during or after the Iraq war of 2003, or more recently by Isis in Syria and Iraq. So far he and his team have recreated around 600 of the 7,000 objects missing from the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad. “It’s devastating what’s happened,” he said. “Creating these apparitions of the originals has been a very meaningful work but it’s also become very clear to me how impossible it is to reconstruct history. Regardless of what our technologies are, the DNA of the societies can’t be put back together.” Rakowitiz said London’s own multicultural fabric made it a very potent place to display the work, particularly somewhere as public as Trafalgar Square. The work will partly be created from empty cans of date syrup that are made in Iraq and he said he had visited Iraqi shops in London to begin to source the bottles. “I visited the Edgware Road and went by these stores called Bagdad and Babylon Grocery and I recognised just how much of Iraq is here as well,” he said. “It’s one of the pleasures of being able to do a project in a place like this where there are different generations of Iraqis who left at different times. “But it is also interesting to have it outdoors in a city that is part of a global discussion about immigration, a conversation that has been disappointing and vulgar.” In 2020 the plinth will be given over to Heather Phillipson’s giant swirl of whipped cream, adorned precariously with a red cherry, a fly and a flashing drone, which will contain a camera surveilling Trafalgar Square 24 hours a day. Phillipson said she was overwhelmed to be able to display work in such a “social and politicised context”, and said her sculpture reflected the congregational and celebratory aspect of Trafalgar Square as well as its political importance as a gathering spot for protest. The flashing drone will be equipped with wifi that passersby can log into to see the drone’s view over Trafalgar Square on their phones. Phillipson said the drone element was a comment on how we had come to accept a surveillance society. “I think my work exists somewhere in the realm of exuberant unease, so this is apparently very celebratory at first glance but the more time you spend time with it, other elements will start to creep in,” she said. “The plinth becomes a monument to hubris and impending collapse.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/mar/22/f1-season-new-rules-optimism-australian-grand-prix-melbourne","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T16:00:39Z","webTitle":"F1 season heralds fresh approach, new rules and a revived optimism | Giles Richards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/mar/22/f1-season-new-rules-optimism-australian-grand-prix-melbourne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/mar/22/f1-season-new-rules-optimism-australian-grand-prix-melbourne","fields":{"headline":"F1 season heralds fresh approach, new rules and a revived optimism","bodyText":"The waiting is over and Melbourne is abuzz with anticipation and the feeling, shared by Formula One fans across the world, that this is going to be a big weekend. Friday practice will be the first indicator of pace after the poker hands of testing in Barcelona; Saturday’s qualifying will be cards on the table time to discover who can turn any pace into a hot lap. Race day is crunch time for the teams but this year, with new regulations, it is also going to be a huge moment for the sport. A new start in a new era. But it is hard not to sense an undertone of unease. What if F1 has got it wrong? Ross Brawn, appointed by the owner, Liberty Media, as Formula One’s director of motorsport, has already made it clear there will be no knee-jerk reactions to an unsuccessful reboot. As things stand the regulations are set for three years and changing them would require agreement with the teams, whose involvement in creating the rules was half the problem in the first place. Brawn’s task is to create a long-term strategy and he is working to that end by looking ahead to five years’ time. Whatever happens in Melbourne, he does at least have other good reasons for fans to be optimistic about F1’s future. The fears for Sunday are simple. The regulations were formulated around the woolly notion that making the cars five seconds a lap quicker would make racing better. That has been achieved, largely through aerodynamic grip allowing faster cornering speeds. It has come with wider cars, shorter braking distances and almost certainly an increase in the disturbed air thrown up by the cars – all of which may combine to make racing in one another’s wakes difficult and passing even harder. Overtaking seems to have been entirely ignored. For a pass to matter it should not be easy and while it is hard enough to find fans of drag reduction system the extra drag created by the new cars is going to make its role even more significant. Formula One, like any sport, must be entertaining, especially to fans who only tune in for the race on a Sunday. If passing and close racing become almost impossible because of a formula dictated by horse trading between teams, then it is failing in that remit. Let us hope it is not the case and Formula One 2017 hits the track running in Albert Park. But whatever happens the process has at least informed how such decisions will be made in the future. Brawn, who describes his role as that of benevolent dictator, is planning to set up a group of experts to create a vision for the sport and it is heartening to learn that the fans, for once, are to be taken into consideration. “When there is a discussion or debate about racing or cars there will be boxes to be ticked: Is it more entertaining for the fan? Is it more engaging for the fan? Is it better for the sport?” he said. This is part of a wider strategy. Liberty Media has already been vocal in its desire to promote F1 more vigorously, using new media to try to engage with new, larger audiences. The Formula One Group is now run by Chase Carey as the chief executive officer with Sean Bratches handling the commercial side. That two senior figures have come from outside Formula One is proving to be an advantage, Brawn believes. “Sean and Chase are asking questions about F1 to which I have no good answers as to why we do things a certain way, which is good,” he said. “They are taking a very lateral view of how F1 works and engages with its fans and that is something we can do very quickly and is totally under our bailiwick to do.” Making the sport more accessible is something that will be acted on sooner rather than later. The process has already begun. At the tests in Barcelona, the rules governing what teams and drivers can broadcast on social media were relaxed, unthinkable under Bernie Ecclestone, and it proved to be hugely popular. The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, said demand for their content from the tests had almost crashed the Red Bull servers. “That is an area you will see quite a rapid development in, that it won’t be a five-year plan, that will be a five-month plan,” Brawn said. “You’ve seen it in Barcelona with social media loosened up. That will continue. There has to be limits but those limits will be much further away from where they are today.” This week the focus remains firmly on how Formula One performs where it matters, where the limits everyone is interested in are those of the cars – and Brawn may yet have to perform some firefighting in that department on behalf of his new employer – but at least he has begun the process of ensuring F1 will not enter another season with this level of uncertainty as to what sort of racing will be on offer when the lights go out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/mar/28/high-road-birds-views-hills-moors-country-diary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-28T04:30:19Z","webTitle":"Northern views too good to miss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/28/high-road-birds-views-hills-moors-country-diary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/mar/28/high-road-birds-views-hills-moors-country-diary","fields":{"headline":"Northern views too good to miss","bodyText":"It’s late morning and I’m driving from Allendale to Hexham along the straight road known as the Paise dyke. Cars bowl along here at speed, but to do that is to miss the far views and the birds. There’s always something to catch the eye. Ahead, on this warm March morning, starlings swarm like bees across the fields, a rushing wind as I drive under them, about 3,000 birds. The flock is so regularly spaced that I feel a vast net has been cast over me before they settle on a field pocked by mole hills and rich in worms. There’s a farm and a wood called the Paise but the road’s name is not on the Ordnance Survey map. In his book published in 1970, Goodwife Hot and Others: Northumberland’s Past as Shown in Its Place Names, the historian and farmer Geoffrey Watson thought the name referred to land where peas were grown. Though these are upland fields, he believed they would have been adequate for growing this staple diet. The dyke might refer to a stone wall or a causeway over the boggy moorland. Passing along the Paise dyke in winter, I look out for black grouse in the roadside hawthorns. Feasting on the crimson berries, the plump black birds look slightly comical and out of proportion to the tough squat trees. On those cold days, the long trough of the Tyne Valley can be filled with fog but up here it can be clear enough to see the Cheviots or into Scotland. With March showers come days when rainbows arc above isolated Scots pine woodlands and the air vibrates to the wings of golden plover. There’s the swooping lapwing, a high-up lark or the slow glide of curlew, its drawn-out mournful cry coming through the open window of my car. At Cushat Lane I catch a white-barred flash from a wood pigeon, after which this little track is named. In May, there will be snow in summer as cotton grass flowers across the bogs. Come August, the honey-scented heather will turn the land purple. Colours and sights shift across the seasons, all seen from this one road.

After close observation, I have concluded that, even if I had pushed a screaming baby out of my own (nonexistent) womb, I wouldn’t enjoy Mother’s Day. It must be nice to have your kids tell you how much they adore you, but it’s only one day a year, and the evidence of the other 364 is that the younger ones in particular would happily swap you for a Kinder Egg. And it’s not as if they pull out all the stops. Most mothers know what this Sunday holds in store: a tacky card, a few daffodils wrenched from the garden and a badly made breakfast in bed. Wham, bam, thank you, Mum. But it doesn’t have to be like that. I have just spent an afternoon helping my six-year-old stepdaughter create a meal for her mother. And not just any meal, but a stylish-looking “bouquet” made of sushi. The ordeal – sorry, the experience – definitely brought the three of us closer together. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys shouting at children. Flo and I start with 400g of sushi rice – short-grained, slightly sweet and, in case you’re sceptical about recipes with hard-to-find ingredients, available from many supermarkets. After washing it several times, we put it in a pan with 525g water and bring it to a boil. Once it has simmered for 10 minutes with the lid on, we turn off the heat and leave it to stand for half an hour, then tip it into a bowl to cool. While this is going on, we prepare the other ingredients: five or six sheets of nori, the dried seaweed that will hold the rice; nuggets of cucumber and avocado to stuff inside it; wasabi paste to add a little fire; and the slivers of raw fish that will make everything more exciting. Only the freshest will do, so I have had to visit a proper fishmonger and ask for sushi-grade tuna and mackerel. If that’s not an option, the Japanese food specialist Yutaka, whose recipe we’re adapting, recommends crab sticks or smoked salmon. Our tuna, by the way, costs £35 a kilo. If you’re wondering about the wisdom of spending that kind of money to feed a child, remember that, in theory, you’re doing this for her mother. And be prepared to push away grabby hands. I’m not saying that Flo is a greedy little pig, but the one and only time she told me she loved me, she immediately followed up with, “… and I love cheese. Can I ’ave some cheese?” Then come the decorations: a little gem lettuce, which just has to be broken up into individual leaves, and thin slices of courgette, carrot and beetroot, which Flo stamps into assorted shapes with the smallest pastry cutters we can find, stuffing as many as she can into her mouth along the way. The shapes that survive this treatment are threaded on to cocktail sticks, two or three contrasting colours on each stick, to form little flowers. Then more carrots, courgettes and beetroots are turned into long strips with the help of a spiraliser, with Flo manically cranking the handle while I yell at her to slow down and watch out for the razor-sharp blades and she pretends to be deaf. More veg finds its way into her gaping maw, although she declares that beetroot, which she hasn’t tasted, is “disgusting”, and spits out the “cucumber” she is enjoying when I remind her that it’s courgette. Cooking can be relaxing, but not in these conditions. At the end, however, we have some impressive piles of vegetable ribbons. I have to physically restrain my sous-chef from plunging her hands into them. The rice is cool now, so we mix together 5tbsp rice vinegar, 3¼tbsp sugar and 1½tsp salt and fold this in once the solid ingredients have dissolved. This quickly creates a sticky mass that needs to be manipulated with wet hands – but that’s OK, as we want it to keep its shape. Now we can finally assemble the bouquet, which is a relief because Flo has been asking about this every 30 seconds. I curl the first nori sheet into a Cornetto-style cone in my hand, then chuck it away because I have cracked it. (Don’t even think of getting your own child to do this, unless they are freakishly dextrous and big-handed.) The second is more successful and, with a little gentle prodding and a lot of furious screaming, I coax Flo into moistening her hands and filling it with rice. When the cone is about half-full, we add some cucumber, some fish and some wasabi, before topping the cone with another handful of rice, a mass of spiralised carrot and a cocktail-stick flower. By now, the moisture in the rice has bound the nori together. We carefully place the completed cone on a plate, and start the next, which we decorate with a different mix of vegetables and a few lettuce leaves. Once we have assembled five of these things, the bouquet – it’s more like a bunch of bouquets – looks like something you would get from a cutting-edge florist, the kind that stocks miniature cabbages but no carnations. To finish it off, we wind some pretty wrapping paper around the whole thing. Hannah – Flo’s mum – couldn’t be more delighted when we present it to her. Now the bickering is all over, she can finally get a little peace."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2017/mar/26/la-storia-di-orfeo-philippe-jaroussky-review-monteverdi-sartorio-rossi","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-26T06:20:23Z","webTitle":"Monteverdi, Sartorio, Rossi: La storia di Orfeo CD review – glorious Jaroussky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/26/la-storia-di-orfeo-philippe-jaroussky-review-monteverdi-sartorio-rossi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/mar/26/la-storia-di-orfeo-philippe-jaroussky-review-monteverdi-sartorio-rossi","fields":{"headline":"Monteverdi, Sartorio, Rossi: La storia di Orfeo CD review – glorious Jaroussky","bodyText":"Orpheus, with or without his lute, is one of the most resonant figures in musical history, the inspiration for dramas from Monteverdi to Birtwistle.

They are not there to present a new sofa or lighting range like many of their contemporaries, but instead to unveil a 6m high blossoming tree sculpture crafted from recycled scaffolding metal. Every five seconds the tree will dispense vibrating vapour bubbles from its 30 branches. These bubbles will bounce on certain textiles, but pop on skin. “We really looked into Milan as a city,” says Azusa Murakami, one half of Studio Swine. We loved the palazzos with blown glass rather than cut Murano chandeliers. That seemed to cast a new light and we wanted to capture that, but also think about this time of year, and how you can experience nature and seasonality.” The interactive installation is a collaboration with Cos. The brief from the fashion brand was entirely open, but the brand’s values work well with Swine’s: minimalism, modernity and a delight in interesting materials. Swine is an acronym for Super Wide Interdisciplinary New Explorers and was co-founded by Murakami – a Japanese-born architect – and her British artist husband Alexander Groves back in 2011. “We see ourselves as designer agents of transformation,” says Murakami. “We transform something that could be seen as undesirable into something desirable.” They met while studying for an MA in product design at the RCA. “We would never have chosen to work with each other, because our style is very different,” admits Murakami. “It’s only because we started going out with each other,” Groves adds. “We were interfering with each other’s projects. I was a really poor student and I struggled, coming from an art background and doing design. It was a leap for me. She helped me a lot.” It’s a good thing they did get together. Studio Swine’s thought-provoking work has captured the imagination of both the design and art world. While they have produced beautiful permanent products – such as benches for London’s St James’s Market – a lot of their creations feel like limited-edition artworks. There are chairs made from discarded plastic dredged from the Pacific Ocean, a Hair Glasses collection (biodegradable frames containing human hair) and display cabinets made from aluminium foam which showcase China’s modern industry and tradition in one bubbly package. “We go to a place, do in-depth research and hope that a good project emerges,” explains Murakami. “Why wait for an opportunity when you can make it happen? We’ve always self-initiated projects. After graduation we went to Brazil. In São Paulo we didn’t have any space, so we made a project completely on the streets. The project wouldn’t exist if we could’ve done it the way we wanted to. The same thing happens when you’re working at sea gathering plastic, or in China collecting hair.” Murakami describes her husband as “obsessed with materials”, while her approach is more holistic. “It’s quite hard to separate,” Groves explains. “We wake up and talk about design until we go to bed. That drives something forward much quicker, because it’s based on back-and-forth rapid dialogue, and trying to convince each other of a particular direction.” Next, they are considering a move to New York. “We really like the culture of crash-and-burn or go big, no safety net and comfort. That’s quite liberating,” explains Groves. They are also continuing with a project started last year exploring Fordlandia, the abandoned city Henry Ford built in the Brazilian jungle in the late 1920s. In September there’s a solo exhibition at Pearl Lam’s Hong Kong gallery. The pair have also recently signed to Pace Gallery as part of the Future\\Pace programme, which explores public space and urban installations. Their long-term ambitions are far removed from product design. “Because we make films in tandem with the objects, we see that as an integral part of each project,” says Groves. “Ultimately we’d like to make a feature-length film. We’ve seen a great trajectory over the years of artists like Steve McQueen and Julian Schnabel making Hollywood films.

It’s time to change that. It’s clear a big part of the answer lies in how we support our towns and small cities to grow. So where do we start? Outside of the big cities, there are two types of places in England. The first are the “stifled”, places with the potential to become big cities but are constrained by their boundaries. The second are the “stuck”, areas that still wear the economic scars of 1982. Both need special recognition in the industrial strategy. Firstly, stifled places need their borders expanding. Swindon, for example, could make the case for land that is currently controlled by Wiltshire, or Norwich for land held by the district councils of Norfolk. A place wanting to build, but short on land for development, should be able to go direct to the secretary of state to petition for a border expansion. This may anger some local politicians but it needn’t be entirely without benefit. Places could potentially share council tax or business rates. This would readily apply to a selection of small English cities and towns where the population has grown quickly in recent years, for example York or Leicester. Secondly, we need to change the rules for stuck places. Take the example of charter cities, advocated by American economist Paul Romer. Essentially a charter city is a place that sets its own rules instead of following those prescribed by its national government. I’m not suggesting Sunderland declare its independence of course, but the idea that if you can’t win at the game, change the rules, is worth reflecting on. Stuck places should embrace a similar spirit and, for example, enjoy bespoke tax arrangements. Take the government’s Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme, this could be altered to make investing in local startups very attractive to investors. The scheme provides 50% tax relief on investments up to £100,000. Why not make that 80% for companies just in Hull City region? Or Stoke-on-Trent? With a tweak of the tax system you could turn a struggling part of England into one of the safest and most enticing places to invest, not to mention how attractive it becomes to budding entrepreneurs. What does the industrial strategy mean for small cities and towns? Surely the answer must be the opportunity to help themselves. Business secretary Greg Clark was right when he said that “real growth doesn’t happen in abstract”. Our recently published report, The Making of an Industrial Strategy [pdf], takes this sentiment and turns it into action. The industrial strategy needs to be locally led. By focusing on stifled and stuck places it can help ensure, in the words of Theresa May, that “people in all corners of the country share in the benefits of its success”.

The Nevels, struggling to survive as sharecroppers, join the great migration of rural Americans and move to Detroit where there is the promise of work in the booming industries of war. The abject hell of the public housing where they live is described in details that make you weep for the author’s own experiences, on which the narrative draws.

A director of the FBI, himself key in aiding the president’s election, not only confirming that inquiry but refuting the president’s claim of illegal surveillance by his predecessor. The first open hearing into Donald Trump’s alleged Russia connections on Monday ensured that the US president will operate under a cloud of suspicion until either the various inquiries deliver credible public conclusions or Trump leaves office, whichever comes first. Testimony from the FBI director, James Comey, indicated that for Trump, the allegations are no weather pattern, lasting for a finite time, but rather the climate for his presidency – what the House intelligence committee chairman, Devin Nunes, a Republican who was also a Trump transition official, angrily called a “big gray cloud”. Here are critical questions for understanding that climate. Where do the inquiries go next? The next big calendar date for the public hearings is 28 March, when two Obama-era intelligence officials, the ex-director of national intelligence James Clapper and the ex-CIA director John Brennan, will appear before the House panel. Both were instrumental in the January assessment that the Russians had interfered in the US presidential election in an attempt to benefit Trump. Two days later will see the first public hearing for the Senate intelligence committee, which is also investigating Russia’s involvement in the 2016 election. Neither Comey nor the National Security Agency (NSA) director, Mike Rogers, is scheduled to testify, though Rogers’ predecessor, Keith Alexander, is. That hearing will focus on Russia’s interference in other elections. What about the FBI’s investigation? Comey pointedly did not reveal anything beyond confirming that the bureau has been conducting a counterintelligence investigation into Trump associates and Russia since “late July”. Counterintelligence investigations, designed to identify security breaches and root out spies or compromised officials, move slowly and do not easily get resolved. They do not often lead to criminal charges. It is unknown if this investigation will lead to a grand jury empanelment, let alone a criminal case, let alone a conviction. In a comment likely to be seen as ominous at the White House, Comey said the inquiry was “very complex and there is no way for me to give you a timetable as to when it will be done”. Ironically, Comey is himself under justice department inquiry for his own interjections in the election, which Hillary Clinton believes cost her the White House. What happened in July 2016 that may have prompted the FBI investigation? Several things that Adam Schiff, the lead Democrat on the committee, listed as data points connecting Trump to Russia: The former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page gave a speech in Moscow attacking the US’s “often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change”. At the behest of the Trump campaign, the Republican party neutered a platform amendment that would call for arming Ukraine against Russian-backed forces. Trump’s then campaign manager, Paul Manafort, had previously worked for the ousted prior Ukrainian leadership that backed Russia. WikiLeaks published hacked Democratic National Committee emails, prompting several cybersecurity firms and the Obama administration to attribute the hack to Russia. Days later, Trump publicly urged Russia to hack Clinton’s email. What will Comey’s relationship with Trump now be like? Hard to say, but probably not warm. Comey did not just knock down Trump’s claims that Obama had Trump Tower wiretapped. He corrected Trump in real time. When the official presidential Twitter account claimed Comey and Rogers had said Russia did not influence the election, Comey replied: “It certainly wasn’t our intention to say that today because we don’t have any information on that subject. And that’s not something that was looked at.” Already Comey’s nominal boss, the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has had to recuse himself from any inquiry into the Trump-Russia question. The White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, came under fire for attempting to get the FBI to knock down news reports about Trump and Russia. Comey testified, to the frustration of Republicans, that he would not do that. Trump has the power to fire Comey. To do so at this point would immediately raise comparisons to Richard Nixon’s “Saturday night massacre”, in which Nixon’s dismissal of the independent Watergate counsel prompted the resignation of the justice department leadership. What about detente with Russia? Much recent speculation has claimed that the scandal will prevent Trump from embracing Vladimir Putin. Yet the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is skipping a Nato meeting next month but keeping an appointment in Russia later in April. Whatever reason Tillerson cites – the Nato meeting conflicts with Chinese president Xi Jinping’s arrival in the US – officials from every European capital will see the secretary of state in Moscow before they see him in Brussels. It is the latest mixed message on Trump’s view of Nato, a key question before he is slated to meet Putin in Hamburg in July for the first time at the G20 summit. Do Comey and Congress trust each other? A subplot in the hearing came when Comey, questioned by the New York Republican Elise Stefanik, revealed that he had kept the counterintelligence inquiry from Congress until “some time recently”. That followed earlier warnings from Schiff that the FBI was dragging its feet on providing the House panel with critical information, as well as non-answers to the broader House that angered Democrats. Schiff also began the hearing by all but begging Comey to cooperate with a House inquiry he said was stretched thin. “The sensitivity of the matter” prompted withholding it from Congress, Comey said, though Democrats point to Comey’s fateful late-October letter to Congress, quickly leaked, speculating (ultimately without basis) that additional material damaging to Clinton might emerge from the FBI’s investigation into the disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner. Though he didn’t say so, Comey might consider that leak a lesson in why he can’t tell Congress everything. On the Republican side, several members told Comey that he had put Trump under a “cloud” of suspicion that the administration was unlikely to disperse. Their dealings with Comey are likely to be affected by that cloud for as long as they see their fortunes yoked to their party’s leader in the White House. What unintended consequences might the various investigations have? Several Republican members of the panel opted to focus on leaks they attributed to the intelligence agencies about Trump and Russia, events that support Trump’s assertion that the allegations are merely the sour grapes of political enemies who range from Obama to the intelligence community. They intimated that unless Comey and Rogers hunted the leakers down, they would allow a broad intelligence authority, known as section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa), to expire in December, as now they found the privacy implications of the provision – which undergirds the NSA’s Prism and Upstream mass-communications-data collections – disturbing. (Those Republicans did not raise those concerns after Edward Snowden’s revelations showed the vast privacy implications of 702 affecting ordinary Americans.) “It could be you. It could be me,” said the Republican Trey Gowdy. It fell to the NSA’s Rogers to point out that “collection on targets in the United States has nothing to do with 702”. Rogers is taking liberties with this – yes, 702’s targets must be outside the US, but its dragnets capture those inside the US with whom those targets communicate or whom they discuss – but conversations with foreign agents such as Russian officials would be collected under the pre-702 sections of Fisa. All this suggested Republicans on the panel overseeing the intelligence community do not understand the surveillance laws they pass. For civil libertarians, who consider 702 so broad as to be unconstitutional, the GOP turning against the surveillance authority resembles a dream come true. Yet endorsement of it remains prominent on the House intelligence committee’s website."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/mar/21/sicilian-lemon-pudding-posset-recipe-rachel-roddy","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T12:44:53Z","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy’s Sicilian lemon pudding recipes | A Kitchen in Rome","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/21/sicilian-lemon-pudding-posset-recipe-rachel-roddy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/21/sicilian-lemon-pudding-posset-recipe-rachel-roddy","fields":{"headline":"Rachel Roddy’s lemon pudding recipes","bodyText":"In her 1747 book The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy, Hannah Glasse suggests grating lemons with a piece of broken glass! Elizabeth David suggests lump sugar is one of the best graters, although she was referring to a lump sugar from a loaf, a sizable piece of which, complete with craggy edge, would rasp the zest nicely. I have tried sugar lumps, which work, until they crumble, which is why you need a bowl underneath. I have also improvised with a fork, which didn’t really work. Then the wind blew the camping table over – comeuppance for zesting in a field in Pembrokeshire. Some people are dedicated to their zesters, others their microplane (about which people become evangelical), I use the second finest section of my box grater, because it is what I have. Whatever you use, there can be no doubt that the insistent and fragrant perfume unleashed as you scrape your lemon along a sugar lump, fork, grater or even broken bottle is one of the loveliest kitchen scents. It should be prescribed on the NHS – for nothing in particular, simply lemon zest for life. I have been grating a lot lately, for my annual batch of Nigel’s lemon curd which, apart from the three spoonfuls my mum ate straight from the jar, I have not shared at all. Also for Margaret Costa’s lemon surprise pudding, and an extra-lemony queen of puddings for my pudding-fond dad when he visited. I have also got back into the habit of making gremolata – parsley, garlic and lemon zest finely chopped into a fragrant and deeply seasoned confetti – which is good on meat, fish, and really good on broccoli ripassati, right at the end when it seems the culinary equivalent of gospel music, uplifting everything. Like many edible things lemons are no longer bound by seasonal constraints. That said, they are arguably at their best from December to March. I saw this first hand in Sicily last month at a cookery school run by my friend Fabrizia Lanza. In 1986, her mother had planted a toddler of a lemon tree, and it is now a robust and generous lady, dropping her fruit on your head if you are lucky. We also visited a garden called Il Giardino della Kolymbetra in the Valley of Temples near Agrigento, an ancient garden which has recently been brought back to life after years of abandonment. The garden is thought to have been created by the Greeks in 500BC, then curated by the Arabs, who brought to it citrus and their irrigation systems, which still run quietly and ingeniously round the garden. A fruitful idyll, the garden is home to dozens of varieties of citrus and Mediterranean fruit trees. I now know about the three ancestral fruits: pomelo, mandarin and citron. Fussy but suggestible, the three travelled and cross-pollinated, creating all the varieties we know today, and many more we have forgotten. The most extraordinary was bergamot, which is a cross between a sour orange and a lemon. To begin with, we searched, doubting we could find it among all the trees. The scent found us. The skin of bergamot is so impregnated with essential oil its skin glistens and the scent is memorising, rich, irreducible and floral, almost soapy, and of course you think of earl grey tea. I only touched a fruit for a second but hours later the scent still clung to the tips of my fingers. We arrived back at the school with 15 varieties of citrus in supermarket plastic bags. Over the following days we cooked many things: all of them complex in flavour but simple in execution. Used in savoury dishes, lemon is like liquid fire; used with sugar, by which it is tempered, lemons are fresh and blithe and the zest gives perfume that enhances the flavour. This is why lemon puddings using both zest and juice are so delightful. The first of today’s recipes is Fabrizia’s Sicilian lemon pudding, which is just lemon juice, lemon zest, water, sugar, eggs and a typically Sicilian thickener, cornflour – which you could replace with another two eggs if you prefer. This pudding is rather like a butter-less lemon curd – softly set, gently sweet and sharp – with a texture that is somewhere between jelly and blancmange, so with a requisite wobble. Fabrizia sometimes serves it in a large, shallow dish, other times in glasses, often with sour cherries she has cooked in light syrup. I think maraschino could work. It would also be nice with lemon shortcake biscuits. From Sicily to England, and a lemon posset – which, according to Mary Norwak’s wonderful book about English puddings, is related to a medieval drink of milk curdled with wine or fruit juice called sack posset, which became grander, eventually evolving into an elegant cream. Just lemon, sugar and cream, posset is a haiku of a pudding. It cools into a silky set cream with a sharpness that stops it being cloying, which in puddings, as in life, is important. Sicilian lemon pudding Makes 6 small glasses/bowls Zest and juice of 3 large unwaxed lemons 3 large eggs 60g cornflour 250g caster sugar 750ml water Cherries or sour cherries in syrup, to serve 1 Zest the lemons. In a large bowl, whisk together the zest, eggs, cornflour and sugar. Whisk together vigorously until you have a thick cream. You could use a mixer for this. 2 Scrape the mixture into a pan, add the water and lemon juice and cook over a medium low heat, whisking continuously, until the pudding is thick enough to really coat/run slowly from the back of a spoon. It should get hot, and nearly, but not quite, boil. Pour into 6 glasses or small bowls and allow to cool, then put in the fridge for at least 6 hours, or until firm and chilled. Serve alone or topped with fruit, such as cherries in syrup. Lemon posset Makes 4 to 6 small bowls. Zest and juice of 2 large unwaxed lemons 150g caster sugar 450ml double cream/150ml single cream and 300g mascarpone. 1 Grate the zest and then juice the lemons (you need 80ml, so use any extra for another time). Put both zest and 80ml juice a pan with the sugar. Heat over a medium-low heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved completely. Keep warm. 2 In a separate pan, warm the cream over a medium-low flame and bring to a simmer, but do not let it boil. Remove from the heat and then add the lemon and sugar and whisk. Cool slightly and then pour the mixture through a fine sieve into bowls. Cool further, then leave in the fridge for at least 8 hours or until firm and chilled."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2017/mar/22/coal-power-plants-green-energy-china-india","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T08:25:28Z","webTitle":"Coal in 'freefall' as new power plants dive by two-thirds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/22/coal-power-plants-green-energy-china-india","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/mar/22/coal-power-plants-green-energy-china-india","fields":{"headline":"Coal in 'freefall' as new power plants dive by two-thirds","bodyText":"The amount of new coal power being built around the world fell by nearly two-thirds last year, prompting campaigners to claim the polluting fossil fuel was in freefall. The dramatic decline in new coal-fired units was overwhelmingly due to policy shifts in China and India and subsequent declining investment prospects, according to a report by Greenpeace, the US-based Sierra Club and research network CoalSwarm. The report said the amount of new capacity starting construction was down 62% in 2016 on the year before, and work was frozen at more than a hundred sites in China and India. In January, China’s energy regulator halted work on a further 100 new coal-fired projects, suggesting the trend was not going away. Researchers for the groups said a record amount of coal power station capacity was also retired globally last year, mostly in the US and EU, including Scotland closing its last one. One of the reasons for the fall in new plants was that too much capacity had been built in recent years, particularly in China. Tim Buckley, director of energy finance studies at the IEEFA, a pro-green energy thinktank, said the falling demand for coal power in China and India and plans to curtail new power stations shows that the world has overestimated the need for the fossil fuel. The report, which tracked power stations through publicly available information, company reports and satellite imagery, said 65GW of new coal-fired units had started construction between January 2016 and January 2017, down 62% on the 170GW the year before. Most coal power stations are around 1GW or greater in capacity. Lauri Myllyvirta, a Beijing-based energy analyst at Greenpeace and author of the report, said the fall in China was largely down to government policy to clean up air pollution and encourage clean energy. That policy shows no sign of stopping – at the weekend, Beijing ordered its last coal-fired power plant to close in a bid to improve the capital’s air quality. Myllyvirta said that in India the decline was down to slower-than-expected growth in energy demand, and renewable energy projects being installed rapidly. Paul Massara, the former chief executive of RWE Npower and now head of a green energy company, North Star Solar, said: “The decline in new coal plants in Asian countries is truly dramatic, and shows how a perfect storm of factors are simply making coal a bad investment.” In total, 64GW of coal capacity was retired last year, mainly in the US and EU. Despite US President Donald Trump saying on Monday that he is preparing a new executive order to help America’s ailing coal industry, campaigners echoed analysts who have said he is unlikely to be able to significantly stop its decline. “Markets are demanding clean energy, and no amount of rhetoric from Donald Trump will be able to stop the fall of coal in the US and across the globe,” said Nicole Ghio, senior campaigner at the Sierra Club, a US-based NGO which has managed to force many US coal plants to close over the last decade. However, the report showed there were still around 570 new coal-fired plants in pre-construction around the world, prompting the industry to reject the notion it was struggling. Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of the World Coal Association, said: “Yes, China, is reducing the number of coal-stations but not because it’s transitioning away from coal, instead the new dynamics is a signal of a more developed economy. Contrary to the picture being portrayed by certain quarters, China’s climate pledge suggests that coal will continue to be central to its energy solutions albeit through efficiencies including the use of new coal technologies.” For India and countries in south-east Asia, he argued, “excluding coal from the energy mix is not an option – it is essential for economic growth and critical in securing energy access”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/mar/22/rare-ledgers-shoe-buying-habits-of-tolkien-waugh-ducker-son","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T13:30:54Z","webTitle":"Rare ledgers reveal shoe-buying habits of Tolkien and Waugh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/22/rare-ledgers-shoe-buying-habits-of-tolkien-waugh-ducker-son","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/mar/22/rare-ledgers-shoe-buying-habits-of-tolkien-waugh-ducker-son","fields":{"headline":"Rare ledgers reveal shoe-buying habits of Tolkien and Waugh","bodyText":"On 11 October 1913, an Oxford undergraduate bought a pair of black leather football boots for 14 shillings and sixpence and spent an extra sixpence on a pair of brown laces. It was a substantial investment for an Exeter College student but he was in good company: Ducker &amp; Son shoe shop had princes and professors, prime ministers and maharajas in its leather-bound ledgers. The student was JRR Tolkien, and the ledger recording his purchase has joined the largest collection in the world of original manuscripts and drawings by the creator of The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy, in the archives of the Bodleian library in Oxford. The library has bought the archives of Ducker &amp; Son, the Turl Street home of the Oxford brogue, which shod the great, good and relatively humble for a century, until it closed at the end of last year because the partners could not find anyone to take on the business. A selection from the 11 impeccably kept ledgers will be on display at the library on 25 and 26 March, tracing the many connections between its customers and the library collections. HH Asquith is one of seven prime ministers whose papers are in the library. He served a term as president of the Oxford Union in his student days, which were rather grander than Tolkien’s, and bought a pair of lambswool slippers for 10/9 in 1923. Records show they were posted to his home in Abingdon. In contrast, the novelist Evelyn Waugh had a serious shoe habit: the ledgers record over two pages that he bought 20 pairs of boots and shoes between 1930 and 1946. Another customer was Lady Ottoline Morrell, who kept open house for the Bloomsburies and many other literary hangers-on at her country house in Garsington – many of whom, including Aldous Huxley in Chrome Yellow and DH Lawrence in Women In Love, responded by cruelly caricaturing her in their work. Her many lovers included Bertrand Russell, who wrote of their first encounter: “For external and accidental reasons, I did not have full relations with Ottoline that evening but we agreed to become lovers as soon as possible.” She was 6ft and clearly had a heavy tread. In April 1916 Ducker virtually rebuilt a pair of boots for her, replacing the soles, heels and straps and repairing the uppers, one of three pairs repaired that month at a total cost of £1.8.4d. HH the Maharaja Holkar of India, as the ledger magnificently recorded him, who was studying at Christ Church, had a pair of shoes restored and some slippers enlarged in 1929. There are some mysteries and poignant stories within the simple entries. Baron Wilhelm Friedrich Adam Lothar Max von Richthofen was a distant cousin of the German fighter pilot known as the Red Baron. He bought a pair of shoes from Ducker &amp; Son in 1913, when he spent a year at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar, but his bill was not paid until 1989. The ledgers do not reveal who settled the account. The Ponsonby Brothers, Charles and Ashley, were among many young Oxford men heading for the first world war who bought marching boots and waterproofing at Ducker &amp; Son. Ashley was killed in action less than a year later, but Charles’s purchases continue for many years later, as he became an MP, parliamentary private secretary to the then foreign secretary Anthony Eden, honorary colonel of the Kent yeomanry, and finally the 1st Baron Ponsonby of Wootton in 1956. Chris Fletcher, keeper of special collections at the Bodleian library, said staff were delighted to save a piece of Oxford history. “People will have fun looking at the buying habits of some familiar names, as well as taking a serious look into a sustained historical record of social and business history in Oxford.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/shortcuts/2017/mar/21/pride-and-racial-prejudice-why-the-far-right-loves-jane-austen","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T17:28:38Z","webTitle":"Pride and racial prejudice – why the far right loves Jane Austen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/shortcuts/2017/mar/21/pride-and-racial-prejudice-why-the-far-right-loves-jane-austen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/shortcuts/2017/mar/21/pride-and-racial-prejudice-why-the-far-right-loves-jane-austen","fields":{"headline":"Pride and racial prejudice – why the far right loves Jane Austen","bodyText":"It is a truth not universally acknowledged, that if you want to throw off any association with Nazi forebears, there is no better place to look than England’s Jane. For in what may be one of the most bizarre cases of image management, a US scholar has found that Jane Austen has been co-opted by the US far right to whitewash its image. Nicole M Wright, assistant professor of English at the University of Colorado, found that the author has been invoked by white supremacists online as a symbol of sexual purity who advocated marriage, despite the fact that her heroines never emerge from the altar, and happy marriages are the exception rather than the rule in her work. Rather than seeing Pride and Prejudice’s Elizabeth Bennet as a feminist icon, or Emma Woodhouse in Emma as a challenge to aristocratic entitlement, the far right are holding up both books as examples of how Austen supposedly pioneered their style of conservatism. One online commentator wrote: “If traditional marriage à la P&amp;P [Pride and Prejudice] is going to be imposed, again, in an ethnostate, we must behave like gentlemen.” Wright also found Austen used as a standard-bearer for a “vanished white traditional culture” and “exception that proves the rule of female inferiority” (because there are so few women in the literary canon). Neither claim stands up to close examination, while, Wright added: “Austen’s protagonists express little of the populist boosterism and preoccupation with ethnic heritage that foster an ethnostate.” The scholar was prompted to dig into the far-right devotion to Austen after hearing her misquoted by the disgraced “alt-right” flag-bearer Milo Yiannopoulos in a characteristically misogynist diatribe against feminism. Trawling through far-right sites, Wright recognised a pattern in which the author’s name was used. “By comparing their movement not to the nightmare Germany of Hitler and Goebbels, but instead to the cosy England of Austen – a much-beloved author with a centuries-long fandom and an unebbing academic following – the ‘alt-right’ normalises itself in the eyes of ordinary people,” she wrote. Not only did the far right co-opt Austen in support of a mythologised past, but Wright believes the appropriation “also subtly panders to the nostalgia of the Brexiters, with their vision of a better, bygone Britain. Such references nudge readers who happen upon ‘alt-right’ sites to think that perhaps white supremacists aren’t so different from mainstream folks.” Fellow Austen scholar Bharat Tandon, who edited the Harvard University Press edition of Emma, is sceptical that Austen’s fans on the far right have actually read her books. Citing Ayn Rand, another of the far right’s favourite female writers, he said: “[Austen] would have had Rand for breakfast. That rootsy post-Randian demagoguery that they all follow would have been completely alien to the society Austen chronicled.” According to Tandon, the only character in Austen’s work who could possibly have voted for Donald Trump would be Mrs Norris, Fanny Price’s cruel and snobbish aunt in Mansfield Park. “She’s a nasty, greedy and abusive piece of work,” says Tandon. “Trump would speak to her.” Claire Tomalin, whose biography, Jane Austen: A Life, revealed a woman more radical in her roots than her popular image allows, doubts the writer would find anything in common with white supremacists. “[Austen] loved the poetry of William Cowper, who was opposed to hunting and shooting,” she says. Trump has yet to tweet his opinion of Austen, but her ascendance to global celebrity in the wake of myriad TV and film adaptations may well have endeared her to him, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/the-h-word/2017/mar/22/drug-scandals-and-the-media-the-unresolved-case-of-primodos","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T08:00:29Z","webTitle":"Drug scandals and the media – the unresolved case of Primodos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2017/mar/22/drug-scandals-and-the-media-the-unresolved-case-of-primodos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/the-h-word/2017/mar/22/drug-scandals-and-the-media-the-unresolved-case-of-primodos","fields":{"headline":"Drug scandals and the media – the unresolved case of Primodos","bodyText":"If the history of drug scandals teaches us anything, it is that fair compensation is typically achieved only through lengthy media campaigns and legal battles. Though lacking the direct powers of judges or policymakers, interventions by investigative journalists and broadcasters have sometimes proved decisive. Take thalidomide: between 1957 and 1961 the widely prescribed morning-sickness treatment caused miscarriages, and many thousands of babies around the world were born with severe limb malformations. In the UK, an adequate settlement was negotiated with the British distributor, Distillers Company (now part of Diageo), only after the Sunday Times took up the cause in 1972. The thalidomide disaster is the best-known drug scandal involving birth defects, but it is not the only one. In the late 1960s, suspicion fell on Primodos, a hormonal pregnancy-test drug marketed by the German pharmaceutical company Schering (now Bayer). I have previously written on the origins of Primodos and the still unresolved debate over whether the British government should have allowed it to remain on the market until 1978, despite widespread safety concerns and the existence of a highly reliable and perfectly harmless alternative: the laboratory urine test. As with thalidomide, the media played and continues to play a crucial role in the campaign for compensation for those who say they have been harmed by Primodos. Blowing the whistle on Schering The Primodos scandal unfolded in the shadow of the thalidomide disaster and was shaped by it. Primed by thalidomide, the Sunday Times became involved early on. It was in response to a Sunday Times exposé that the British government issued the first official warning of a ‘possible association’ between Primodos and ‘an increased incidence of congenital abnormalities’ in 1975. Despite the warning many doctors continued to prescribe Primodos, and it remained widely available in Britain. The media campaign took a dramatic turn in 1977 when a concerned employee of Schering’s British subsidiary leaked internal corporate documents to the press. These papers revealed a significant dispute between British and German executives over whether Primodos should continue to be marketed in Britain. Essentially, British executives wanted the drug to be taken off the market, but their hands were tied when the final decision was made in Berlin. The documents eventually reached the light of day by a circuitous route, involving a whistle-blower, a reporter, and a private investigator. Scandal, leaks and spin Ian Withers, a private investigator, was enlisted by a law firm to place the documents with one of the national newspapers. Withers was offered a fee of £500 and asked to generate £10,000 for the large folder of correspondence. This sum was intended as an insurance policy for the anonymous ‘whistleblower’, who fully expected to lose his job and forfeit any further career prospects in the industry. Withers spent around ten days hawking sample pages to journalists and media contacts. One was a reporter for the Sunday People, who expressed an interest in the story. But instead of exposing Schering’s internal dispute over drug safety, the reporter decided to portray Withers as a ‘rat’ trying to ‘cash in on a toddler’s suffering’. Withers considered suing, but refrained in order to safeguard his client’s anonymity, which endures to this day. Happily, the incident did not damage the detective’s reputation and he went on to a career as one of Britain’s most successful private eyes. The leaked folder, meanwhile, soon made its way into the hands of journalist and broadcaster Greg Dyke, who quoted heavily from the documents it contained in his hour-long documentary for London Weekend Television’s The London Programme in 1978. By then, Labour MP Jack Ashley, who had spearheaded the thalidomide campaign in Parliament, had begun calling for a government inquiry into Primodos. Further coverage in The Guardian and The Sunday Times continued to apply pressure and culminated in a first debate, in the House of Commons, on 26 May 1978. On 6 June 1978, Dyke reported in The Guardian that Health Minister Roland Moyle would that day ‘for the first time, come face to face with a group of parents who believe their children were born deformed because their mothers were prescribed hormone pregnancy testing drugs’. The parents, Dyke explained, wanted ‘just one thing from the Minister – a public inquiry into the way the drugs were used in this country’. But despite Ashley’s efforts, the parents did not receive the inquiry they wanted—until 2014. New lines of evidence The current inquiry, set to report in May, was launched by the Department of Health following a second debate in the Commons, on 23 October 2014. Its brief is to examine the evidence, including new sources that were not available in the 1970s. These include thousands of pages of documents that have resurfaced in London and Berlin and ongoing laboratory research on the effects of Primodos on developing fish embryos. A reenergised campaign, headed by Marie Lyon, now has the support of an all-party parliamentary group formed in 2014 by Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi. And Jason Farrell, a Sky News reporter who became involved in 2011, has made Primodos: The Secret Drug Scandal, an hour-long documentary and the culmination of his investigation. Back in 1978, Dyke had access to just a single leaked folder of internal correspondence. Today, the evidence base is radically expanded to include new experimental results and masses of previously supressed documents. Farrell makes good use of these, as should the inquiry, which has vastly more material at its disposal than it would have done in the late 1970s. It is possible that legal proceedings, abandoned in 1982, will be started up again. The media, alongside campaigners and MPs, continues to play as vital a role as it did back then. It does so by bringing new evidence to light, using it to form public opinion, and, not least, by applying pressure to government and industry.

The defiant plea for the government to recognise that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg has a continuing, positive role to play – and that it is a “price worth paying” – is at odds with Theresa May’s uncompromising vow to extract Britain entirely from its jurisdiction. In her landmark speech on 18 January, setting out her Brexit strategy, the prime minister declared that staying in the single market “would mean accepting a role for the European Court of Justice that would see it still having direct legal authority in our country.” That, May said, “would to all intents and purposes mean not leaving the EU at all”. But the report by the justice select committee, published on Wednesday, suggests that cutting all connections to Luxembourg would be damaging to UK interests. Ending the “substantive part of the ECJ’s jurisdiction in the UK” is an inevitable consequence of Brexit, the report acknowledged. Denying the Luxembourg court “any binding authority” would be ideal. However, the report cautioned, “a role for the ECJ in respect of essentially procedural legislation concerning jurisdiction, applicable law, and the recognition and enforcement of judgments, is a price worth paying to maintain the effective cross-border tools of justice … ” The justice select committee has 11 members: six Conservative, four Labour and one SNP. The chair is the influential Tory MP Bob Neill. Launching the report, Neill said: “Protecting the UK as a top-class commercial law centre should be a major priority, given the clear impacts on the economy of failure to do so: the government should look to replicate existing provisions as closely as possible. “Similar provisions in family law provide greater speed in child abduction cases, for example, and represent improvements over their default alternatives.” The report states that the evidence the committee received “strongly suggests close continuing cooperation in these areas of commercial and family law would, at the least, necessitate UK courts giving due regard to CJEU decisions … “The risk here is that UK and EU case law on the same provisions begins to diverge in a way that undermines consistency and, potentially, reciprocity.” Precisely what “due regard” would entail would have to be clarified, the MPs suggested."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/apr/08/my-workout-ballet-dance-fitness","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-08T06:00:31Z","webTitle":"My workout: ‘Ballet has given me strength’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/apr/08/my-workout-ballet-dance-fitness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/apr/08/my-workout-ballet-dance-fitness","fields":{"headline":"My workout: ‘Ballet has given me strength’","bodyText":"I have always loved to dance. It’s a brilliant way to keep fit: it’s so much fun and doesn’t even feel like exercise. I’ve had lessons since I was little, everything from jazz and contemporary to street dance. Over the years, I started to realise ballet is the base of them all, and that my teachers were referring to moves and positions I wasn’t familiar with. I signed up for adult beginners’ classes, and now feel I’m learning not just a new style, but the fundamentals of movement. The first half of the class is done on the barre (a long handrail you use for balance) and we concentrate mainly on footwork, doing moves such as tendu, rond de jambe and others with names I struggle to pronounce. Then we’ll do travelling exercises, where we move and pirouette across the room, performing “simple” choreographies. It’s a real challenge and gives me a huge sense of satisfaction. We don’t always dance to classical music. More often than not we listen to jazz or music from Africa and Latin America. It works brilliantly with the steps, which can be slow and deliberate, or fast and exciting. Some moves require a fair amount of flexibility, and while my legs don’t go that high, I love how graceful ballet makes me feel. Ballerinas will stand with one leg on the floor and the other way up in the air, and make it look effortless, but it involves a lot of strength, balance, stamina and concentration. It’s not vigorous – I don’t get hot and sweaty – but it’s a full-body workout. In the short time I’ve been doing ballet, I’ve become fitter and more toned. My back’s straighter and everything feels more aligned. It’s a lot like yoga in that sense. I’m never going to become a ballerina, but I feel I can manoeuvre better than I could before. It’s physically and mentally demanding, and has given me a much better awareness of my body. Ballet has given me strength. My weekend workout Favourite music to dance to? African and South American beats. Favourite move? A grand plié – a sort of deep squat. I like the challenge of seeing how low I can get. Five ways to get started 1 People tend to think of ballet as something for either children or professional dancers, but adult classes are a great way for men and women to keep fit, tone and stretch. Especially if you hate the repetitive nature of the gym. 2 Flexibility, coordination and balance aren’t prerequisites – they come as a result of ballet. Worrying about trying ballet because you can’t touch your toes is like worrying about going to the gym because you don’t have a six-pack. 3 For most people, standing at the barre, being confronted with their reflection in the mirror can be quite scary. Try to let go of that self-consciousness. In time, looking in that mirror becomes as natural as brushing your teeth. 4 Wear what feels comfortable: tracksuit trousers or leggings and a top. Avoid baggy clothes that might trip you up. 5 One of the most basic steps is the plié. Stand with your heels together and toes pointing out to either side. Keeping your back in a neutral alignment and your chin up, bend at the knees, so they move over the centre of your toes.

So how has the country done it? By giving homeless people permanent housing as soon as they become homeless, rather than muddling along with various services that may eventually result in an offer of accommodation. It’s an idea is being considered in the UK by communities secretary Sajid Javid. We spoke to Juha Kaakinen, chief executive of the Y-Foundation, which provides 16,300 low cost flats to homeless people in Finland, to find out more: What is Housing First? Housing First means ending homelessness instead of managing it. The basic idea is to offer permanent housing and needs-based support for homeless people instead of temporary accommodation in hostels or in emergency shelters. Permanent housing means an independent rental flat with own rental contract. In Housing First people do not have to earn their right to housing by proving their capability to manage their lives. Instead, they are provided with a stable home and individually tailored support. How has it worked in Finland? Since 2008 the national homelessness strategy in Finland has been based on the Housing First model, as a result of dedicated cooperation between the state, municipalities and NGOs. Investments have been made to provide affordable housing and shelters have been converted into supported housing units. New services and methods of help have been developed to match the multiple needs of individual tenants. Finland has all but eradicated rough sleeping and sustainably housed a significant number of long-term homeless people. Finland is the only country in Europe where the number of homeless people has declined in recent years. What has the public response to Housing First been? Was there any backlash? There was a strong political will to find new solutions for homelessness. There were a few local reactions concerning the location of new service facilities. However, those were mainly overcome by open interaction with the neighbourhoods. Financially, how does Housing First work? The key things are affordable housing and support. Extra funding that the state has allocated for flats and services has been an incentive for the municipalities to implement Housing First. Tenants pay rent and are entitled to receive housing benefits. Depending on their income, they may contribute to the cost of the services. The rest is covered by the municipalities. They provide the support themselves or buy support from other service providers, mainly from the NGOs. Stable living conditions enable the use of mainstream services instead of using expensive emergency services. This will save money in a long term. Where there any initial problems that needed to be ironed out? The focus of the national strategy was clear from the start. The city specific implementation plans included concrete objectives and resources to meet them. Therefore, no major problems were encountered. There was, however, some work to be done on attitudes. For example, the unconditional housing was hard to accept by some people in NGOs which had previously been working with different set of values. How easily can the model be replicated in other European countries? The Housing First model can be replicated even though housing conditions may vary from country to country in Europe. Providing permanent homes for the homeless should be a target instead of temporary solutions. There is no quick fix to all life situations but a solid base provides the foundations upon which to improve the welfare of the homeless. The first step in change is the change in attitudes. How much interest have you had in the scheme? Who seems most supportive? In Finland this has been a national strategy, not a local project. This new approach and convincing results have raised broad interest internationally.

She wears a long-sleeved shirt, pants, and sneakers. Nothing is particularly shocking about this image, except the fact that it’s December in New York City (or Detroit, or London). In a “traditional” year, this girl would be wearing her winter coat, a hat that covers nearly her entire head, and potentially snow boots. But not in 2016. Or 2015. Or 2014. It’s simply too warm for all those clothes. If, like many of us, you have the sense that seasons are changing, winters are milder, summers a bit warmer, springs coming earlier, and autumns not quite what they used to be, you’d be right. According to a report released today by the United Nations, 2016 was the warmest year on record, breaking the record previously held by 2015, and before that by 2014. Having three years of record-breaking temperatures is a clear trend that the climate is changing. And the UN isn’t the only one to have noticed; Nasa, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the US, the UK’s Met Office, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), Japan’s Meteorological Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and dozens of others have repeatedly stated that the global climate is changing and that society is now in “uncharted territory”. Perhaps having slightly warmer temperatures sounds appealing. I must confess, I enjoyed walking around the streets of Ann Arbor, Michigan, in February, basking in temperatures of 15C (60F). Yet it’s not quite that simple. Changing climate, including increases in temperature and shifting precipitation patterns, lead to real and significant impacts to human health, livelihoods, cultural assets, economies, ecosystems, and society as a whole. For example, shifting rainfall patterns can drastically impact crop timing and yields. Rising sea levels already threaten to further drench coastal communities, roads, homes, and other infrastructure. Shifting disease patterns bring new issues into areas with limited exposure and immunity. Prolonged droughts can lead to famine, as in Somalia and Ethiopia at the moment. And natural disasters, which are on the rise, wreak havoc on local communities and economies. Regardless of where you live or what you do, it is nearly guaranteed that climate change is already affecting you. And these effects are going to get more severe and frequent. In the face of this reality, one would assume that investments in disaster preparedness and climate action were on the rise. If you lived in the United States, however, you’d be grossly mistaken. In fact instead of being serious about protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens, the Trump administration has decided to gut all programmes related to climate and many related to disaster-preparedness. If you still doubt the need for action to adapt to the consequences of climate change, don’t just listen to me – listen to the US military, world business leaders, or the majority of Americans. Given that climate leadership is unlikely to come from the US federal government under Trump, many are asking, what can I do to prepare for climate change? Here are eight initial actions that individuals, as well as governments, could take immediately to prepare. What you can do 1) Make a plan; build a kit. Natural disasters are on the rise and are only projected to occur more frequently and be more intense thanks to climate change. Ensure you are prepared by having a plan for what you and your family will do in the case of a disaster. Then make a kit that has the supplies you’ll need to withstand and recover. 2) Get to know your neighbours. In a disaster, government resources are likely to be strained. Building strong social networks, including within your own neighbourhood, can be an extremely effective way to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters. 3) Reduce your carbon footprint. Anything we can do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will help slow down climate change. The mantra I use is that we must manage the unavoidable through adaptation, but avoid the unmanageable through mitigation. 4) Call your legislators today, and every day. Demand that they preserve and advance domestic and international climate programmes, policies, and funding streams. Don’t take these programmes for granted. What governments should do 5) Integrate climate change into all policies, programmes, and decision-making processes. We need to ensure that all investments are based on sound science and prepared to endure, regardless of what the future brings. That is why climate change must be factored into all planning and decision-making at local, state, national and international levels. 6) Invest in climate science. Instead of gutting science budgets, increase investments in climate science, including investments in real-time monitoring, research into climate-related impacts, and the implementation of climate solutions. 7) Embrace green infrastructure. Investing in green spaces, parks, urban forestry, rain gardens, and the like would be an economically smart way of managing storm-water and flooding while also investing in our local communities. Encourage your government to consider green infrastructure with the same fervour usually reserved only for traditional physical infrastructure projects. 8) Embrace climate action as a means of advancing economic development and social justice. Climate action needs to be about people. When designed with citizens, climate strategies can enhance both the economy and the wellbeing of all, especially those traditionally left behind. Make sure that the most vulnerable are part of identifying and implementing climate solutions. Regardless of where you stand on the political spectrum, it is essential that we all understand that the climate is changing and it is in our collective interest to immediately begin adapting and mitigating. The stakes are simply too high for inaction."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/2017/mar/24/jami-attenberg-interview-women-all-grown-up","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-24T13:00:33Z","webTitle":"Jami Attenberg: ‘I wanted to see if there were other happy endings for single women’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/mar/24/jami-attenberg-interview-women-all-grown-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/mar/24/jami-attenberg-interview-women-all-grown-up","fields":{"headline":"Jami Attenberg: ‘I wanted to see if there were other happy endings for single women’","bodyText":"In her new novel, All Grown Up, Jami Attenberg has done what many long assumed to be impossible: she has coined a smart and original take on the single woman in a big city. Just when the shtick seemed hopelessly exhausted by decades of Bridget Jones, Sex and the City, bad chicklit and worse romcoms, along comes Attenberg’s heroine, Andrea. Spiky, utterly uninterested in marriage or babies, the daughter of an activist mother, she is broken but not in a way a relationship could or should fix. An individual but at once so familiar that every line seems to sing effortlessly off the page. In a typically wry and layered moment, Andrea, addressing herself, describes when her sister-in-law got pregnant: You throw a baby shower, at which you drink too many mimosas and cry in the bathroom, but you are pretty sure no one notices. It’s not that you want a baby, or want to get married, or any of it. It’s not your bag. You just feel tired for some reason. Tired of the world. Tired of trying to fit in where you don’t. You go home that night and draw the Empire State Building and you feel hopeful doing this thing you love to do, so hopeful you look up online what tonight’s [lights on the building] mean and find out it’s in honour of National Eating Disorders Day and you get depressed all over again even though you’ve never had an eating disorder in your life. “I’d always felt frustrated with the depiction of single women in movies, TV shows and books because they always feel very centred around the romantic ending,” says Attenberg when we meet in a bar near her home in Brooklyn. “I wanted to see if there were other kinds of happy endings.” To do this, Attenberg has structured her novel as a series of linked short stories that jump around in time, encompassing not just Andrea’s past and present but also those of her family, friends and lovers. The stories, which can be about something as simple as a botched flirtation at a wedding or as complex as Andrea’s father’s long-term heroin addiction, provide a satisfyingly thorough portrait of all of their lives, explaining how they got to where they are when we meet them. They also suggest all kinds of different endings for single women in fiction that are always realistic and often optimistic. “I wanted you to know everything about Andrea, and I felt if we made a list of the most important things about our lives it would never be in order. It would be: ‘seven is the guy I made out with in high school’, ‘eight is the guy I made out with last week’, and ‘nine is the job I got fired from when I was 30’. While I always want to write epic sweeping plots, my work is character-driven and small moments that take you forward.” In the case of this novel, these small moments are all unmistakably tied to life as a 40-year-old single woman in the 21st century: all your Facebook friends posting on your wall about how you have to read the new book about what life is like as a single woman; being patronised by men who are far more neurotic about being single than you; finding out the friend you thought you’d lost to the perfect marriage is unexpectedly getting divorced. But as natural as the book feels, Attenberg resisted it. She started off by writing three of the stories, but then quickly shut them away in a drawer. “I was like, I don’t want to write this book because it’s going to be super annoying,” she says, in a voice that slips into somewhat endearing teenage-like inflections. “Not to write, but I knew it was going to force me to evaluate where I was at with my life as well, and then talk about it, and I didn’t know if I wanted to do that. You know, I grew up in a small midwestern town, where every third house on the block looked the same and there were not really any single people. My instincts to get out were always there, but those expectations were still something that formed me to a certain extent about what was supposed to make me happy. I think it’s important that someone writes stories that show something else, so I finally decided to do it.” And yet some of her fears about writing this book were soon justified. When we meet she had recently done an interview and the (male) journalist asked what her marital status is: “I was like, I can’t believe you asked that question when the whole point of my book is that it shouldn’t matter!” Attenberg, 45, has for some time been building up a reputation as the writer par excellence of tricky, independent women. Her third novel, the bestselling breakout The Middlesteins (2012), is a warm and expansive story of a dysfunctional suburban family, including Edie, a compulsive eater who never should have married her husband, and her thorny daughter, Robin, who whispers “This doesn’t mean anything” to men as she has sex with them. Saint Mazie (2015) is a brilliantly constructed fictionalised oral history of Mazie Gordon-Phillips, a real woman from 1920s New York, who Attenberg first discovered when a friend gave her a copy of Joseph Mitchell’s 1940 New Yorker profile. “I didn’t want nothing to do with marriage with a respectable man or any other kind of man,” Attenberg’s Mazie declares stoutly at the beginning. “Not once in my life did I ever dream of my wedding day, no white dresses, no goddamn diamond rings. I only ever dreamed of freedom.” It could be the mantra of most of Attenberg’s heroines. As it happens, the bar we are meeting in is owned by the friend who gave her that profile, and is called Saint Mazie. I tell her I’ll now picture this bar as the one Andrea hangs out in, and Attenberg looks surprised. “Oh no, I wasn’t thinking of this place. Although the room downstairs is where I imagined Andrea hosting her birthday dinner …” As screenwriter Nora Ephron once wrote, “the words ‘thinly disguised [autobiography]’ are applied mostly to books by women”, and asking Attenberg about the overlaps between her books and life feels cheap. But the question is unavoidable from the moment she walks into the bar. “I have big breasts and a tiny waist and round hips, round but narrow, and big fistfuls of curls, and well-manicured eyebrows, and rosy cheeks, and I wear all black, and I have a cool, smart look to me, angled and soft at the same time. I got my thing going on,” is how Andrea describes herself in All Grown Up, and it is a pretty bang on description of Attenberg, although she is shocked to near speechlessness when I say this. “But she’s short! I’m not short. And OK, she has a brother, and so do I, and she works in advertising, and I did that, and she lives in Brooklyn. And she is Jewish, but she’s an Upper West Side Jew, which is a different flavour from a suburban Jew. But I pictured her as, not me in a parallel universe, but someone I’d pass in the subway station. My mother said, ‘She sounds like you, but she’s not you,’ and a friend said, ‘It’s like she’s your worst nightmare life.’” That latter description sounds especially plausible. A major theme in the novel is Andrea’s regret about giving up her dream of being an artist to work in advertising. Attenberg went the other way. After “getting the heck out” of suburban Illinois, Attenberg studied writing at Johns Hopkins University, where her senior fiction professor, the novelist Robert Stone, “hated” her writing. “Right before I graduated he was like, ‘You know, honey,’ – honey! – ‘you can still work in publishing. You can be a publicist.’ My impression of him was that he didn’t like writing by women that much, and I think that was the last time I let a man tell me I couldn’t do a thing I wanted to do,” says Attenberg. She travelled and temped all around America for the next few years, always writing but not sure what to do with it. She briefly lived “kind of a hippy life” (“I never really fit in – I admired the spirit but I didn’t like fish”) before moving to New York in the late 90s, where she worked in an advertising office. “People who were married with kids there used to say to me with this weird envy in their voices, ‘Oh you’re living the dream – you have all this freedom,’ and I was like, ‘No, you’re supposed to be the one who’s living the dream.’ But they always made it sound like it wasn’t much fun. So that was how I got to see the other side,” she says. After a stint working at HBO, Attenberg made a decision to commit to fiction, so she quit her job and interspersed novel writing with temp jobs. She completed three well-reviewed books – Instant Love, The Melting Season, The Kept Man – but had, she wrote in 2012, “what is politely called a ‘challenging track record’ in the publishing industry. Getting three books published means I am technically a success, but if you ask some people, my empty bank account unequivocally means I am a failure.” She lived in 26 different homes over a decade, reliant on the kindness of friends and cheap rent where she could find it. Does she think she’d still be living that peripatetic life if things hadn’t turned around? “I don’t know. Something had to give, I guess, but I’d accepted that writing was the thing I wanted to do, because I just loved it more than anything else. I just felt it was what I was supposed to do with my life, but it was really hard. I can’t imagine what would have happened if I’d decided to be the other person [who gave it up]. I don’t live in fear of that, not any more.” In 2012, two things changed everything: first, Attenberg moved publisher. “Before, I was being marketed as women’s fiction, and now I’m with a publisher who said, ‘No, this is literary fiction, and we won’t ever put a woman looking wistful on your covers.’ And that was huge for me.” The next was that The Middlesteins became a bestseller, helped, she thinks, by Jonathan Franzen giving a quote for its front cover, praising Attenberg’s “sympathy and the artistry of her storytelling”. This, she says, “was mentioned in every book review, sexist as that probably is, and it gave me a whole new level of credibility.” Although not as much as some: Chad Harbach’s novel The Art of Fielding came out at exactly the same time, was also about a dysfunctional midwest family and had been praised by Franzen: “It was reviewed everywhere, whereas mine wasn’t in the New York Times Book Review until three months after it came out,” she shrugs. Although once it finally got there, it got a front-page rave. The sidelining of women’s stories and female writers is one of Attenberg’s real bugbears. The day before we met, she tweeted her disgust that the actor Drew Barrymore, who wrote about her 10 favourite books for the New York Times, hadn’t included a single one written by a woman. “Seriously, what the FUCK, dude? ‘Charles Bukowski was always on point.’ I mean, Bukowski was the opposite of on point,” she laughs. After publishing three books in five years (“I guess I had a lot to say”), Attenberg is thinking of taking a little break and has been judging books for literary competitions. “And that’s where I see a real change happening – so many writers of colour, so many women, trans voices. So no matter what the current political situation is, I think things are changing. Slowly. Maybe,” she says. And when she laughs she sounds, characteristically, both cynical and hopeful. • All Grown Up is published by Serpents Tail.

When the Italian shit-canning artist Piero Manzoni created his 1961 work Base Magica, consisting of just an empty plinth with two footprints on it, he was making a joke that was already old. The idea that statues need a “magic base” to set them apart from real life is a pre-modern convention that 20th-century artists gleefully subverted. Marcel Duchamp’s 1913 piece Bicycle Wheel mounts a bike wheel on a kitchen stool: it clearly demands to be displayed on the floor, part of real life and not separated from it. Setting the whole ensemble on a plinth would be silly. Putting Carl Andre’s horizontal array of bricks Equivalent VIII or anything by Richard Serra on a plinth would be equally ludicrous, not to mention physically impossible. It’s no coincidence that Rachel Whiteread, the best and most serious modern artist who has ever made a work for the fourth plinth, created one of its least effective sculptures. Whiteread’s transparent cast of the plinth itself was an awkward compromise between the new and the old that quickly lost its ghostly quality when pigeons perched on it. If it brings out bad work from good artists – while giving the maximum acclaim to the artistically old-fashioned statue that was Marc Quinn’s portrait of Alison Lapper – is the fourth plinth really such an effective way popularise avant-garde art? The fourth plinth does not challenge artists to create new ideas of what art is, but instead asks them to adapt to a traditional style of display. Why? No wonder so many commissions, such as Katharina Fritsch’s big blue cock, have been banal and pointless (once you’ve said “cock” the joke is made). The relentlessness of this series of commissions, its boundless appetite for fitting the square cube that is modern art into Trafalgar Square’s round hole, is changing art. It is making sculpture’s history go backwards. Young artists appear to be getting more plinthy in the way they think; their imaginations are increasingly well suited to a setting that was created for an equestrian statue in 1841. I like the two latest commissions, a homage to destroyed art by Michael Rakowitz and an apocalyptic dessert by Heather Phillipson. The first is an ancient Assyrian mythical beast built from date syrup cans. It represents an ancient masterpiece in the Mosul museum that was smashed by Islamic State, while the cans symbolise a local industry wrecked by the Iraq war. This sculpture deals with the current crisis in the region and its causes. Admirably, it mourns destroyed art but doesn’t pretend we can replace it with an exact simulacrum. Phillipson’s The End is a tottering still life representing the doom of civilisation; a giant swirl of cream is topped by a cherry, an insect and a drone. As in the still-life paintings in the National Gallery next door, we see corruption about to rot loveliness, except the drone is more sinister than the fly and the creamy dessert is sickly and decadent. These works have valid points to make and do so pithily. That’s a good, sensible use of the plinth. Yet they don’t exactly push the avant garde forward. There are no piles of bricks here. A hundred years after Marcel Duchamp exhibited a urinal as art, where is sculpture going? Well, backwards. The Victorians, once they got used to the idea of food cans as an artistic material and someone explained what a drone is, would have had no real difficulty with these sculptures. They are representational art whose content is more important than their form. Very moral, very 19th-century. Forty years of this, and art will be back in the stone age. The ultimate plinth art will be an equestrian statue of a monarch, and we will be so beaten down by then that we will hail it as a modernist masterpiece."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/mar/26/formation-look-at-the-powerful-people-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-26T08:00:25Z","webTitle":"Formation: Look at the Powerful People review – too little, too late","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/26/formation-look-at-the-powerful-people-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/mar/26/formation-look-at-the-powerful-people-review","fields":{"headline":"Formation: Look at the Powerful People review – too little, too late","bodyText":"As the career of rappers the Mitchell Brothers illustrates, an endorsement from Mike Skinner is no guarantee of success.

It was far from just a rinse. The dye came out bright purple, but Twigg remembers that Margaret took it in her stride and her family approved too. “Margaret said, ‘How lovely, darling. I do like to be different.’ Over the following week she basked in the attention as people stopped in her doorway to admire her lovely purple locks.” Twigg has been cutting older people’s hair for more than 15 years and her company, Lily Pins, is the UK’s only provider of dementia-trained hairdressers. Twigg began doing hair in a care home one day a week before taking on casual shifts as a care worker. “I found it overwhelming at first. I was really naive and just didn’t realise people lived to that age,” she says. A throwaway comment from a client’s daughter was her lightbulb moment. “The crucial thing was that I was doing both jobs. A relative said to me: ‘I can’t believe my mum let you cut her hair. She normally won’t let anyone near her.’ But it was because of my dementia training as a care worker.” She began hiring hairdressers, some of whom had also done care work, and there are now 12 Lily Pins hairdressers serving 18 care homes in Kent, Essex, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire. She also employs beauticians and chiropodists. Twigg believes care homes need to take hairdressing and personal grooming seriously. “It’s all about individuality. People over 80 shouldn’t all look the same. And it’s for the families too. Can you imagine if it was your mum? You wouldn’t want to go in and see them looking completely different.” A recent study by researchers from the universities of Manchester and Stirling backs up Twigg’s experiences. It found that there could be greater integration of hairdressing and other appearance-related services into the broader therapeutic objectives of dementia care. The study observed people with dementia in eight different care-based hair salons, as well as accompanying hairdressers on home visits, over a period of 10 months. Salon visits, they found, could provide sensory cues and help reignite memories. Hairdressers often have close relationships with clients and can act as “keepers of stories”, reminding them of forgotten details, as well as offering emotional support. “The salon is a very natural setting for reminiscing but also a place where people share insights about themselves,” says Richard Ward, senior lecturer in dementia studies at the University of Stirling. “The overarching message our research highlighted was that we need to rethink our understanding of appearance and the part it plays in the lives of people with dementia.” Di Moss, one of the Lily Pins hairdressers, agrees that done right, it can be a really positive experience for everyone. “It’s important to try to think about who these people were before the dementia. We really like to speak with families and ask how they used to have their hair done, what they like and don’t like. It’s not just a case of booking an appointment and sitting them down to cut their hair.” For Moss, communicating with residents is the best part of her job. “It can be hard work but it is so rewarding,” she says. “A lot of residents aren’t able to to speak but sometimes if you get down to their level they might give you a smile or say a little. It’s about giving them the time.” Maintaining dignity is another reason why personal grooming should be a priority in care settings. The Social Care Institute for Excellence’s (Scie) Dignity in Care guide explains that a person’s appearance is integral to their self-respect. Elaine Cass, practice development manager for Scie, says personal preferences on haircare, body and facial hair removal, and nail care should be respected. “The most important thing for care home staff to remember is that it depends on personal wishes and preferences,” she says. “If they have always worn makeup, then having their makeup done will be important. It’s about what they want to do because not everything is for everyone.” Many care homes are now purpose-built with this in mind, like Tye Green Lodge in Essex, which included a salon in its design. The home’s manager, Melanie Kemsley, says: “Families now expect to see services like this in a care homes.” Kemsley is certain the salon has a positive impact on her residents. “The ladies and gentlemen have their hair done and it makes them feel really good about themselves,” she says. “We all like to be pampered – whether you are living in a care home or your own home, we all like to feel special.” Join the Social Care Network to read more pieces like this.

He spent more time on calculus than catwalks. Yet the great 17th-century scientist’s discoveries are the ultimate source of this season’s scintillating experiments in colour. When Newton used a glass prism to break up a beam of sunlight in a dark room, he produced a spectrum of colours and proved that white light is a mixture of all the colours of the rainbow. He mapped these colours on to a circle and created a way of thinking about colour that has fascinated artists and designers from Vincent van Gogh to Gucci. When you look at a colour circle, it reveals relationships between colours and what happens when they are put next to each other – effects that seem all the rage this spring from Victoria Beckham dressing like a walking Van Gogh painting in blue and orange, to Gucci playing with pink and green. Van Gogh and other 19th-century artists, from JMW Turner to Georges Seurat, were obsessed with the science of colour. The polymathic German poet, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, refined and rethought Newton’s colour theory. Turner’s painting Light and Colour (Goethe’s Theory) uses his ideas to portray the morning after the biblical deluge in a visionary gradation of bright whites and yellows – a juxtaposition of light hues that Burberry’s subtle play of cream and white echoes in a much less apocalyptic way. The buzzword in 19th-century colour theory was “complementary”. According to the “the law of complementary colours” that is (purportedly) revealed by a richly detailed colour wheel devised by the French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul, colours that are opposite each other on the wheel are complementary: for instance, blue and orange, purple and yellow, red and green. Does Victoria Beckham keep Chevreul’s colour wheel by her wardrobe? She has certainly hit on a classic example of complementary colours in her spring look. The joyous meeting of orange and blue is a great image of the world coming alive in spring. When Van Gogh arrived in Provence for the first time in spring 1888 (arriving in February he saw the new season start), he responded to the light of the south in paintings that abound in blue skies complemented by orange or yellow. All this is just a more arty (and scientific) way of saying that certain colours work together, something anyone can find out by trial and error. Gucci’s combination of bright pink and green may be outrageous, yet it’s also completely satisfying because these colours are opposites on the colour wheel. It all gets stranger if you ignore the colour wheel and mix colours against its rules, colours that clash. Mark Rothko’s abstract paintings experiment with all kinds of bizarre, deliberately uncomfortable colours juxtaposed in misty horizontal bands. Blue, green and mauve? Black and red? Pink, yellow and red? To look at Rothko’s potent, mysterious, revelatory work is to throw away your colour wheel. The psychology of colour can’t be explained away by science after all, as Balenciaga’s Rothko-like combo of pink and purple testifies. Pink and black, as seen on the Alexander Wang catwalk this season, is another vaguely disturbing echo of Rothko. Colour does not really change. It is a natural phenomenon, after all. It is amazing how this season’s fashions echo 19th-century art. Even the extreme and the cutting edge have their predecessors, because there are only so many colours and so many ways of combining them. Rothko tried them all until he could see nothing but black. So maybe black will be back next year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/mar/21/george-osborne-story-britain-ruled-never-ending-dinner-party","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T12:28:46Z","webTitle":"The George Osborne story reveals Britain’s ugly dinner party elite | Owen Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/21/george-osborne-story-britain-ruled-never-ending-dinner-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/21/george-osborne-story-britain-ruled-never-ending-dinner-party","fields":{"headline":"The George Osborne story reveals Britain’s ugly dinner party elite","bodyText":"Is politics a service, a duty, a means to represent the needs and aspirations of the people, or is it a launchpad for lucrative jobs in the private sector? George Osborne was terribly amused in the House of Commons yesterday: all this fuss over a trifling issue like the corruption of British democracy! Can’t we see he’s doing us a favour, having to suffer the indignity of being paid hundreds of thousands of pounds for multiple jobs rather than representing his constituents, all to make sure our “parliament is enhanced”, as he puts it? The sacrifice Osborne has made for all of us, having to be paid a juicy salary to further blur the distinction between media and political power, to make sure parliament is enriched by yet more MPs failing to devote themselves to the people who elected them. There isn’t a sick bag big enough. It turns out he didn’t bother waiting for the advisory committee on business appointments to decide whether there is a conflict of interest first. Either they rule that there is an obvious conflict of interest in a serving senior Tory politician editing a daily newspaper, or the rules are a farce. Regardless, there are a number of lessons here. One is that some politicians think they are simply too brilliant to be reduced to the mere level of giving a voice to those they exist to serve, exploiting the prominence that comes with constituents selecting them as their representative and then making a packet out of it. Another was David Miliband, who made hundreds of thousands of pounds for speeches and corporate advisory roles when he returned to the backbenches: at least he had the dignity to eventually resign from his seat. Then there is the revolving door of British politics. Public office gives you lots of marketable advantages: prominence, connections, knowledge of the inside workings of government. These can then be exploited by major corporations, wealthy individuals and media oligarchs to gain even more power over our corrupted democracy. Health ministers whose job it is to defend our sacred NHS end up working for private health firms who benefit from its privatisation; defence ministers end up working for arms firms bidding for government contracts. Our now foreign secretary was paid a quarter of a million pounds – described by Boris Johnson as “chicken feed” – for writing newspaper columns rather than, say, serving Londoners (although he did give up his regular column after becoming foreign secretary). Then there’s the parlous state of British journalism, increasingly an exclusive gilded club for those whose parents have healthy bank balances. Talented working-class aspiring journalists are discriminated against because they can’t live off the Bank of Mum and Dad. With few exceptions, only the well-to-do can afford to do the unpaid internships and expensive journalism masters’ degrees that increasingly must adorn the CVs of those with hopes of making it into journalism. Having parents with connections has helped multiple journalists, too. And yet a man with precious little experience in journalism – other than being rejected by the Times’s graduate scheme – can get parachuted into the editor’s seat of a major newspaper because of who he is and who he knows. A cushy job for the ex-chancellor while the salaries of overworked Evening Standard employees are slashed. And then there’s the attempt to rehabilitate Osborne as a liberal hero. To be fair, given there’s an ongoing operation to make George W Bush – who drowned Iraq in blood and chaos and who is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths – into a cuddly paragon of virtue in the age of Trump, I shouldn’t be surprised. Apparently Osborne will now offer the real opposition to this government. Rubbish. He’d be in government now, kowtowing to Theresa May’s line, if he hadn’t suffered the indignity of being sacked by her. He is a man whose ideologically driven cuts programme caused the longest squeeze in workers’ wages since the Victorian era, who callously tried (and failed) to balance the nation’s books on the backs of benefit claimants – who he relished stigmatising – all for partisan interests. Much of the mess Britain is now in is down to his disastrously failed policies. His victims are rarely heard by a press that champions the interests of the powerful while demonising disabled people, refugees, anyone without a voice. If he is the new champion of the remainer cause, then it is certainly doomed. But perhaps Osborne has done us all a service. In whose interests is this country run? They’re not even pretending any more. Britain is ruled by a never-ending dinner party, marked by limitless self-regard and contempt for those who don’t have a seat at the table. It is a grim spectacle. It is also a threat to our democracy, and it must be called out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/mar/21/terminally-ill-former-lecturer-challenges-uk-ban-on-assisted-dying","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T17:09:39Z","webTitle":"Terminally ill former lecturer challenges UK ban on assisted dying","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/21/terminally-ill-former-lecturer-challenges-uk-ban-on-assisted-dying","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/mar/21/terminally-ill-former-lecturer-challenges-uk-ban-on-assisted-dying","fields":{"headline":"Terminally ill former lecturer challenges UK ban on assisted dying","bodyText":"A terminally ill former lecturer has gone to court seeking permission to change the law so that he may be given assistance to die at home surrounded by his family. Noel Conway, 67, from Shrewsbury, was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in November 2014. His condition is incurable and he is not expected to live beyond 12 months. Supported by the organisation Dignity in Dying, Conway has instructed the law firm Irwin Mitchell to seek permission for a judicial review in the high court of the ban on assisted dying, which, he says, prevents him ending his own life without protracted pain. Assisted dying is prohibited by section 2(1) of the Suicide Act 1961 and voluntary euthanasia is considered murder under English and Welsh law. Conway’s challenge is aimed at establishing criteria and safeguards for terminally ill adults to enable them to make their own decisions about ending their lives. His legal challenge differs from the most recent, unsuccessful, right-to-die claim brought on behalf of Tony Nicklinson. Conway, unlike Nicklinson, has been diagnosed as terminally ill. The supreme court in Nicklinson ultimately ruled that it was for parliament, not the courts, to change the law on assisted dying. Conway, who is in a wheelchair and wears an oxygen mask to help his breathing, was in the high court to hear the claim. His main aim is to be allowed to spend as much time of the time remaining to him with his family and, ideally, at home. Before going into court, he told the Guardian: “If I decided I was going to [an assisted dying clinic in] Switzerland, I would have had to have gone by now. That would have deprived me of much more important and valued time with my family. At the moment, the quality of life and experience is sufficiently positive for me to want to continue. “But I’m not naive and I know full well it’s only a question of time. Who knows how long before it tips the other way? Then I want to be in a position to say that’s it. I would rather do it in this country and in my own home. I think that is my right and should be everyone’s right. “I have had a huge amount of support from both the young and the elderly. I was in a hospice recently and a 97-year-old leaned across from a neighbouring bed and told me: ‘I 100% support you, Noel. What you are doing is fabulous.’” Opening his argument in the high court, Richard Gordon QC, for Conway, said that if parliament did not deal satisfactorily with the issue of assisted dying then the courts must look at fresh evidence. The last time parliament debated a private member’s bill on assisted dying, Gordon said, it only gave four hours to the issue. Parliament had not moved an inch, he said, yet “one can see the way society is moving”. Sarah Wootton, the chief executive of Dignity in Dying, said: “Like Noel, we firmly believe that those who are terminally ill should be able to control and manage their final weeks and months of life humanely and with dignity. “People should have the right, when dying, to die well and that simply is not happening under the current law. Instead of being shown compassion and kindness when they need it most, parliament has turned its back on dying people by upholding the current blanket ban on assisted dying. James Strachan QC, for the Ministry of Justice, opposed the application for the courts to consider the case. “There is an absence of any material change to circumstances to justify revisiting these issues at this stage,” he said. “Parliament has continued to give this matter active consideration. We don’t see that there is any fresh or significant evidence.” A private member’s bill introduced by Lord Falconer to legalise assisted dying ran out of time in the House of Lords in 2015. A spokesman for the Care Not Killing Alliance said: “Changing the law on assisted suicide and euthanasia is opposed by every major disability rights organisation and doctors’ group, including the BMA, Royal College of GPs and the Association for Palliative Medicine. “It has been rejected by successive judges. Just a couple of years ago, three of Britain’s top judges – the lord chief justice, Lord Judge; the master of the rolls, Lord Dyson; and Lord Justice Elias – confirmed the blanket prohibition on assisted suicide in the UK is not contrary to article 8 of the European convention on human rights and that changing the laws on murder and suicide are matters for parliament alone, which has repeatedly rejected changing the law. “The current law exists to protect those who are sick, elderly, depressed, or disabled from feeling obliged to end their lives. It protects those who have no voice against exploitation and coercion. It acts as a powerful deterrent to would-be abusers and does not need changing.” Conway’s lawyers are seeking permission for a full hearing. The judges reserved their decision."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/mar/26/james-blunt-the-afterlove-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-26T06:55:24Z","webTitle":"James Blunt: The Afterlove review – likable isn’t listenable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/26/james-blunt-the-afterlove-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/mar/26/james-blunt-the-afterlove-review","fields":{"headline":"James Blunt: The Afterlove review – likable isn’t listenable","bodyText":"“I’ve been called a dick/ I’ve been called so many things,” sings go-to musical punchline James Blunt in the opening lines of his fifth album, on which he twice makes reference to his 2004 millstone megahit You’re Beautiful.

But I didn’t take it seriously until it happened to me.” Josh*, 36, works in TV production as an assistant. And for a long time everything in his career worked well. But being on a zero-hour contract meant there was no way to defend himself when things took a turn for the worse. “When my supervisor saw that I was friends with the person above him, he started being aggressive towards me,” he says. “He’d constantly try to undermine and humiliate me, and would talk down to me in front of other colleagues. He would make snide comments about what I was wearing and what I was eating. One time he told me to do a task, which I did straight away. But then he told me off, saying I shouldn’t have done it and denied he’d ever told me.” “It lasted for six months. But I was so scared of losing the job, I didn’t feel I could say anything back. One day, I had a personal issue to deal with, and I could tell he was deliberately trying to provoke me and give me a hard time. In the end, I started crying. He’d pushed me to that point.” For Josh’s bully, however, there was no comeback. “There was no one I could talk to about it. In a normal job, there’d be an HR department and procedures for dealing with bullying. But in this job there was none of that, and no one else could see what was happening. If I complained, they’d just get rid of me.” The rise of zero-hours contracts and the gig economy is likely to have an impact on workplace bullying. The relative job security afforded by permanent contracts can make it easier for victims to come forward and lodge complaints. But without the guarantee of work the next day, freelance and zero-hours workers risk everything when they speak out about mistreatment. “You feel disposable and that you should be grateful for getting any work,” Josh explains. “I rely on my contacts, so I felt that I had to just let this guy bully me. I didn’t want to get a reputation as being someone who causes trouble. “It’s like dating someone, rather than being in a relationship; you don’t feel settled and you’re always trying to impress.” Overall, bullying at work appears to be on the rise in the UK. In the late 1990s, a survey found that it occurred in just 3% of workplaces. But this figure rose to 7% in 2004. Then, in 2011, Unison reported that 60% of workers in the public sector had either been bullied themselves, or had witnessed it happen to someone else at work. But worryingly, more than half claimed they’d be “too scared to report mistreatment”. And the rise of zero-hours contracts can only make that figure worse. The latest findings suggest there are now nearly 1 million people on insecure contracts, yet little research has been done into the impact of such contracts on their wellbeing. In 2015, Acas received more than 20,000 calls from people seeking advice on bullying, harassment and abuse at work, on a range of different contract types. And its report [pdf] noted that job insecurity can “contribute to a climate conducive to negative behaviours, including bullying”. “The imbalance of power is a big thing that came out in our analysis of calls to our helpline from zero-hours and agency workers,” says Adrian Wakeling, a senior policy adviser for Acas. “Typically, if they wanted to assert a right of any kind, or challenge something, they often felt they couldn’t because they would just get less hours of work.” “People on zero-hours contracts don’t have the basic protections the rest of us enjoy, to be able to challenge mistreatment such as bullying,” says Hannah Reed, a senior employment rights officer at the TUC. “Individuals are often fearful to raise concerns about mistreatment, in case they are fired on the spot – or more likely their phone will simply stop ringing and they won’t be offered any more work. The existence of employment tribunal fees also means that many people on low pay cannot afford to enforce their rights, even if they’re brave enough to raise the issue.” One person who is trying to understand what lies behind the figures is PhD student, Leighann Spencer. She’s developed an app which allows employees to track their experiences, which will form part of her research. “Workplace bullying is an issue of power – and often people are bullied by their manager,” she says. “So if you’re on a zero-hours contract, you could be less able to properly defend yourself. If you’re being bullied at work, that has a serious detrimental effect on your emotional wellbeing. People can start to get very anxious about going to work and that, in itself, can heighten your ability to notice those sorts of behaviours. “Often these things are left to fester, so they just get worse and worse. One thing that I’d absolutely recommend is to keep a record of it, because it definitely helps when it comes to making a complaint.” It’s not just people on zero-hours contracts who have limited ability to defend themselves against bullying. Freelancers and agency workers, too, may feel the need to keep quiet about mistreatment or risk losing their income. Adam*, a freelancer in the tech sector, has experienced this first hand. “On one job I was booked to work three days working closely with a colleague,” he says. “When I arrived I was catching up with some people and handing over a project I’d been working on the day before. But my colleague had apparently been waiting for me in the next room and could see me through the window. “All of a sudden he burst out the door, stormed across to me and unleashed a verbal tirade, aimed directly at me. He was ranting about how long he’d been waiting, how unacceptable it was. All whilst I was trying to manage a junior colleague and in full view of the head of the company. “I was fighting an inner battle between shouting back, hitting him in the jaw, or bursting into tears out of shock. On top of this, I then had to spend the next three days working one-on-one with this same guy. “I later heard that it had been discussed by the management who’d decided never to work with him again. But no-one checked up on me, my mental health, anything of the sort. I was left in a confined space with the person who’d verbally abused me, working three very long days.” Most experts agree that help and protection for workers in the gig economy is desperately lacking. Employment lawyer Philip Landau, of Landau Law Solicitors, says: “As a self-employed person you have very limited employment rights.” “As an employee, if you were to feel forced to resign as a result of the unfair treatment, you may have a potential claim for unfair dismissal.” But he explains: “There is no such claim when you are self-employed. You can, however, bring a claim for discrimination under the Equality Act, regardless of your employment status. The relevant protected characteristics are age, disability, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.” And the TUC’s advice? “The best protection that anybody on a zero-hours contract has against bullying is to join a trade union,” Reed says. “Trade unions will cover the cost of employment tribunal fees and make sure members continue to have access to justice.” * Names have been changed to protect identities Looking for a job?

It wasn’t that long ago that Countryfile, a show regularly watched by 9 million a week, was accused by the Daily Mail of being TOO “relentlessly positive and upbeat” about the reality of life in the country due to its focus on pretty animals and flowers. Such pre-referendum views now seem as out of date as a Labour party with an imminent chance of governing. Which is partly the point of course. Both the timing and nature of the attacks on the BBC on Tuesday say more about our current political climate and vogue for blaming the messenger than any magazine report about farming. It is telling that the letter signed by 70 MPs which accused the corporation of being overly gloomy about Britain’s post-Brexit future landed on the front pages of the Mail and the Telegraph on the day after the government announced next week’s date to discuss article 50 and therefore trigger Brexit. With a slim majority and vexed talks looming, it is not a Labour party locked in bitter internal squabbles that Brexiteers fear, but the media. And in particular the news organisation that is committed to “impartiality” by the terms of its royal charter and that regularly tops the polls for most trusted news organisation. Hence, on the day after the article 50 date was set, the Mail’s front page screamed: “Brexit Bias Storm: dozens of MPs accuse Corporation of gloomy coverage.” The top of page two reported on the “viewers” accusing Countryfile of “anti-Brexit propaganda” alongside a table of other “questionable coverage” on the BBC. The Telegraph splashed on the BBC warning over its bias and followed up with a leader which said: “Brexit Britain deserves better from the BBC.” This leader even described the BBC coverage as presenting a “diplomatic risk” as “EU leaders might be persuaded by the BBC to mistakenly overestimate Britain’s regrets about Brexit, holding out hope we will change our minds”. Which says something for our negotiations with the EU if their leaders are forced to watch the BBC to understand where the UK stands. The letter, coordinated by Julian Knight – a man whose job as a former journalist at the BBC would surely seem to preclude his current role as a Tory MP – was addressed not just to director general Tony Hall but also to the BBC’s incoming chairman, David Clementi, who has already talked about the importance of policing the BBC’s impartiality. The BBC might have its funding more or less fixed for 10 years – barring any unforeseen Treasury snatch – but it will always be subject to political pressure, especially when public opinion is so finely split on a hugely important issue. But there is something more than classic political pressure going on here. Knight’s letter, also signed by several Labour MPs, is the latest example of the cross-party game du jour of blame the messenger. On the same day as the bias story splashed the papers, Ken Livingstone appeared to blame the media for Jeremy Corbyn’s poor poll ratings on Radio 4’s Today programme. Just like it was to blame, he said, for Neil Kinnock’s failure to win an election. Corbyn has not yet appeared as a lightbulb on a tabloid front page but the big difference between now and 1992 seems to be that Kinnock and his supporters were not constantly calling out the media every time it reported something they disagreed with. This is a not a party political point, but a cultural one. Witness the similarities between the tweeted support for the BBC by both deputy Labour leader Tom Watson and former Conservative minister Nicky Morgan. Morgan’s “Another attempt by leading Brexiteers to silence those whose coverage &amp; questions they don’t like #chilling” was better received by her followers than Watson’s comments in support of the BBC, tweeted by the Labour press team, which prompted one follower to respond that the BBC was run by “middle class New Labour lovey’s” [sic]. Such messenger blaming has been given the most powerful backing by the US president of course, who has risen to power by recognising that raising doubts about facts means you can call genuine questions about your policies lies promulgated by biased reporters. Tony Hall’s reply to Julian Knight said that “it is more important than ever that the BBC’s journalism is independent of political pressure” in “consequential times”. Brexit and the referendum will have far-reaching consequences for the UK, but so will the constant undermining of the media. If our political leaders continue to describe every report they disagree with as evidence of bias, the truth is that our future really will be gloomy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/mar/22/sheffield-tree-protesters-to-take-legal-action-against-police","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T10:19:52Z","webTitle":"Sheffield tree protesters to take legal action against police","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/22/sheffield-tree-protesters-to-take-legal-action-against-police","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/mar/22/sheffield-tree-protesters-to-take-legal-action-against-police","fields":{"headline":"Sheffield tree protesters to take legal action against police","bodyText":"Fourteen campaigners arrested in a dispute over tree-felling in Sheffield are to take legal action against South Yorkshire police. The protesters, who include a Green party councillor and university academics, were detained under trade union legislation for preventing council contractors from chopping down roadside trees. But the Crown Prosecution Service announced on 2 March that there was “insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction” and none of the group would be prosecuted. The long-running dispute over the future of Sheffield’s trees has its roots in a 25-year private finance initiative (PFI) deal signed by the Labour-run council in 2012. A statement on behalf of the protesters who were arrested said on Wednesday that they would take legal action against South Yorkshire police to “challenge the legality of their arrests, charges, and time spent in detention and on bail”. The 14 were arrested for preventing lawful work under section 241 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1992. Last week Dr Alan Billings, South Yorkshire’s police and crime commissioner, said campaigners would no longer be arrested after an outcry among those detained. Dr Simon Crump, a lecturer at Huddersfield University who was one of the first to be arrested in November, added: “We need to challenge the laws used against people who care about their community and environment, which means we need to take the police to court. “Fracking is coming to Sheffield and we’ll probably be seeing the police protecting the interests of big business yet again and they need to be stopped.” Alison Teal, a Green party councillor who was arrested last month, said: “The council are looking for legal alternatives to the trade union legislation to get campaigners off the streets. They value straight kerbs and flat paths more than mature healthy trees. I’d say we’ve reached an impasse.” A spokesman for the Sheffield Trees Action Group said on Wednesday: “The campaigners welcome the recent statement by the police and crime commissioner, Dr Alan Billings, that the law will not be used against peaceful protesters in future. “However, those arrested believe that this statement raises as many questions as it answers in relation as to why the law was used against them on several occasions. Campaigners would have welcomed the opportunity to address the charges and defend their actions in court. “Between 2 November 2016 and 8 February 2017 healthy trees across the city were cut down on the say so of South Yorkshire police asserting the legality of using the 1992 Trade Union Act against peaceful protest, a legality that is now in question. “Much damage has been done to the ecology of the city because of these actions. This is damage that can never be undone.” Calvin Payne, who was arrested in November for attempting to prevent the felling of a 100-year-old oak tree, added: “We are not going to accept 14 arrests for something that does not appear to have been a crime. We look forward to holding all those responsible to account.” The council contractor Amey is removing thousands of roadside trees it believes are “dangerous, dead, dying or diseased” in an effort to transform Sheffield’s roads “from some of the worst in the country to the best in the country within the first five years”. But campaigners insist the trees are healthy and have accused South Yorkshire police of stifling the right to peaceful protest. The row made national headlines when a 70-year-old emeritus professor and a 71-year-old retired teacher were arrested in a “dawn raid” by council contractors who ordered residents out of bed to remove their cars before taking the axe to eight old trees. It was, said the constituency’s MP, Nick Clegg, like “something you’d expect to see in Putin’s Russia rather than a Sheffield suburb”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2017/mar/22/markets-tumble-as-impatience-mounts-over-trumps-policies-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T15:24:45Z","webTitle":"Markets tumble as impatience mounts over Trump's policies - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/mar/22/markets-tumble-as-impatience-mounts-over-trumps-policies-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/mar/22/markets-tumble-as-impatience-mounts-over-trumps-policies-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Markets tumble as impatience mounts over Trump's policies - as it happened","bodyText":"Before we close up for the day, we’ll take a look at the markets. On Wall Street, markets are mixed now trading is fully underway: Dow Jones: -0.1% at 20,643 S&amp;P 500: +0.04% at 2,345 Nasdaq: +0.2% at 5,808 European markets are also mixed, with most indices down less they were earlier. FTSE 100: -0.7% at 7,330 Germany’s DAX: -0.5% at 11,908 France’s CAC: -0.3% at 4,990 Italy’s FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 19,970 Spain’s IBEX: +0.2% at 10,232 Europe’s STOXX 600: -0.6% at 374 Thank you for reading the blog and for commenting. We’ll be back tomorrow. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator for Brexit has set out the bloc’s conditions and priorities for talks. Among the priorities cited were the need for early agreements on citizens’ rights, money and borders. Guaranteeing their rights as European citizens, in the long term, will be our absolute priority from the very start of negotiations. Full story coming soon here. The Dutch government has come out in support of Jeroen Dijsselbloem after the Dutch finance minister faced calls to resign as the leader of the Eurogroup. The controversy centres on comments Dijsselbloem made to a German newspaper, which were taken as a criticism of Southern European countries. Specifically: I can’t spend all my money on booze and women and then ask you for your support. Reuters quotes an official close to Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte as saying the government “remains firmly behind” Dijsselbloem. The official added: The position has not changed. Premier Rutte has repeatedly said we are very supportive of Dijsselbloem in his role at the Eurogroup. The Portuguese prime minister has called for Dijsselbloem’s resignation. Dijsselbloem has not commented. Oil prices are at near four-month lows after the latest figures showed US crude inventories rose faster than expected, exacerbating fears of over supply. Brent crude is down 1.6% at $50.15 a barrel, and fell as low $50.05 earlier, the lowest since 30 November when OPEC countries agreed to cut output to ease oversupply fears. Figures from the American Petroleum Institute showed US inventories climbed by 4.5 million barrels to 533.6 million barrels last week, higher than analysts’ forecasts of 2.8 million. US shale oil producers have been increasing the number of rigs, pushing up production. Analysts at US bank Jefferies commented in a note: OPEC’s market intervention has not yet resulted in significant visible inventory drawdowns, and the financial markets have lost patience. Thames Water has been handed a record £20.3m fine after huge leaks of untreated sewage. The prosecution was brought by the Environment Agency, which said the enormous volume of sewage, at 1.4bn litres, was unprecedented. It relates to numerous offences in 2013 and 2014 at sewage treatment works at Aylesbury, Didcot, Henley and Little Marlow, and a large sewage pumping station at Littlemore. Full story here: The pound appears to have lost some of the boost it gained from the sharp rise in UK inflation revealed on Tuesday. (The consumer prices index jumped more than expected to 2.3% in February from 1.8% in January, pushed higher by food and fuel prices.) The pound is still above $1.24 but down 0.3% on the day at $1.2440. It is also down 0.2% against the euro at €1.1516. Wall Street will be closely monitoring any developments in the debate on the Republican health care bill, which seeks to overturn Obamacare. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill on Thursday, and failure to pass it would be a huge blow to Trump. And we’re off... US markets have opened lower, but the early falls are modest: Dow Jones: -0.2% at 20,629 S&amp;P 500: -0.1% at 2,342 Nasdaq: -0.1% at 5,790 Donald Trump is awake and would like to reassure markets: Wall Street bell goes in 10 minutes... Twitter has reacted with a combination of anger and humour to those Dijsselbloem comments that appear to be critical of the behaviour of Southern European countries. The FTSE 100 is currently down 65 points or 0.9% at 7,314. The FTSE 250 is down 1.1% at 18,788. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, provides this lunchtime summary: A partial reversal of the so called ‘Trump Trade’ has sent defensives and precious metal producers to the top of the FTSE 100 today, as investors worry that President Trump’s conflict with Congress will prevent him delivering the pro-business agenda on which he campaigned. Only six FTSE 100 stocks had made it into positive territory at lunchtime, with Randgold topping the list, up 0.8%. Despite recently warning that conditions remain challenging, hopes of an uptick in the global economy helped FTSE 250 shipping group Clarkson enjoy a strong run recently. However, with pro-Trump sentiment wavering it’s perhaps unsurprising to see this bellwether of global trade lose some of the wind from its sails, sending the shares down 4.5%. Earlier the Bank of England published its latest agents’ summary of business conditions. The Bank has 12 regional agents who have discussions with about 700 firms across the UK to glean the latest snapshot of conditions. The survey for the first quarter of 2017 found that growth in retail sales was slowing as the weak pounds feeds through to higher prices and reduces the spending power of consumers. Overall the report was mixed, with exports up and investment intentions picking up. Agents concluded: Moderate rates of activity growth had continued overall. Retail sales volumes growth had eased. It was expected to slow further during the year ahead as the fall in sterling fed through to higher prices, reducing households’ purchasing power. In contrast, export volume growth had picked up. That was due to the fall in sterling and stronger world growth. Investment intentions had picked up, pointing to modest growth in spending in the year ahead. That reflected continued moderate demand growth and less uncertainty about economic prospects, particularly in the near term. But a lack of visibility of the United Kingdom’s future trading arrangements was weighing on longer-term plans for some contacts. The fall in sterling was being passed through into higher manufacturing output and consumer goods price inflation. Business and consumer services price inflation had edged higher. Over in Brussels, Jeroen Dijsselbloem - head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers - appears to be in a spot of bother. Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner for competition, said Dijsselbloem was “wrong” to make comments that were interpreted as criticism of southern European countries. Speaking to the German newspaper, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Dijsselbloem said: In the euro crisis, the northern eurozone states demonstrated solidarity with the countries in crisis. As a Social Democrat, I believe solidarity is extremely important. But whoever demands it also has obligations. I can’t spend all my money on booze and women and then ask you for your support. This principle holds at personal, local, national and even European levels. His comments drew strong criticism in Spain and Italy and the Portuguese prime minister called for Dijsselbloem’s resignation. A spokesman for Dijsselbloem defended his comments along the following lines: He didn’t refer to any specific country or group of countries. His message was that solidarity comes with obligations, and the message was for all eurozone countries. Now for some news from Coventry, where the grand opening of the first new car plant in Britain for more than a decade is taking place today. The London Taxi Company (LTC), maker of the famous London black cab, will build electric cabs at the plant, creating more than 1,000 jobs. It is being funded by a £300m investment from China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, owner of LTC, plus a £16.1m government grant. As well as being a boost for Coventry it’s a boost for the UK automotive industry, which backed the remain camp in the EU referendum and has voiced concerns that Brexit will lead foreign investment elsewhere. The business secretary Greg Clarke said the new factory, where research and development will also take place, showed that the UK was a “world leader in the development of new automotive technologies”. Read our full story on the new plant here: Global equities could have quite a bit further to fall according to analysts at Saxo Bank, as Trump’s pro-growth policies hit several hurdles along the way. Peter Garnry, the bank’s head of equity strategy, explains: So much of the narrative has revolved around US president Donald Trump since his election on November 8 but the conviction in the reflation trade faded abruptly in the last US session with the S&amp;P 500 declining more than 1% for the first time since October. So what are we to make of all of this? Where do we go from here? Global equities could easily fall 5-10% in what would be a normal healthy technical correction. And the selloff will be driven by cyclicals: financials, materials, consumer discretionary - a big question mark here is whether technology stocks will hold the line. We see further upside in volatility as markets are now constructing a new narrative that essentially centres on the likelihood that the pro-growth Trump policies or set for a bumpy road with many road blocks . Credit growth has stalled lately and the energy impulse into inflation is gone by June. Gold is benefitting from the widespread equities sell-off and weaker dollar. Spot gold touched a three-week high of $1,248.47 per ounce, and is currently up 0.1% at $1,245. Edward Meir, analyst at INTL FCStone said gold would continue to benefit while investors sold shares: It seems that equity investors decided to take some money of the table, perhaps getting slightly wary about the progress in President Trump’s legislative agenda. Gold will likely continue to rally going into Wednesday’s session as Tuesday’s US stock market sell-off was significant and will likely have a knock-on effect on international equity markets over the next 24 hours. Some people are feeling the pinch more than others of course. A report by the Equality Trust found that the average FTSE bosses earns 386 times more than a worker on the national living wage. Taking 2015 annual reports from all FTSE 100 companies, the charity calculated that chief executives were paid £5.3m a year, compared with £13,662 for someone on the national living wage of £7.20 an hour. Here is the full story from the Guardian’s Katie Allen: Investors are not the only ones feeling pessimistic. UK households are the most downbeat about prospects for their finances since November 2013 according to the Markit Household Finance Index. Families are starting to feel the pinch of rising inflation, as everyday goods get more expensive and wage growth remains weak. It suggests that consumer spending - the main driver of UK growth currently - will start to weaken as households become more cost conscious. Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit, explains: UK households reported greater pressure on their financial wellbeing in March, as rising inflation has started to erode incomes and reduce cash available to spend. On average in the first quarter of 2017 survey respondents have reported the sharpest increase in their everyday living costs for three-and-a-half years. A combination of rising inflation and subdued pay trends has forced households to recalibrate their expectations for the year ahead. After holding steady last summer, UK consumers are now more downbeat about their financial outlook than at any time since late-2013. Expectations for finances in the next month fell to 45.3 on the index in March, from 48.1 in February, where anything below 50 signals contraction. People living in the East Midlands were the most downbeat about their financial outlook, followed by those in the North East and London. Meanwhile 58% of households expected the Bank of England to raise interest rates in the next 12 months. US futures suggest the sell-off on Wall Street is likely to continue when markets open later: Dow Jones futures: -0.3% Nasdaq futures: -0.2% Is this the end of the Trump rally, asks David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co? European stock indices are weaker across the board this morning. Investors are responding to last night’s sell-off on Wall Street which saw the majors close out on their lows. Not only that, but US stock index futures are weaker again this morning. Yesterday’s sharp reversal took many investors by surprise, particularly as the US session opened with fresh all-time highs for Facebook and the Nasdaq index. Unfortunately for traders, much of yesterday’s move was down to political factors rather than market technicals. There are fears that the Trump administration won’t have enough votes to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act when it goes to Congress tomorrow. There are thought to be around 26 Republican representatives who oppose their party’s new health care bill. This in turn could jeopardise Trump’s tax plan and this has worried investors who have watched equities soar on the promise of fiscal stimulus. The final scores in Asia: Back in the UK, estate agent Savills has published results. Shares are currently down 1.8%. Julia Kollewe reports: Savills, the upmarket estate agent, has posted annual pretax profits of nearly £100m, up 1%, despite “geopolitical distractions” and higher property taxes in the UK and elsewhere. The Brexit vote in June pushed revenues from its UK residential business down 3% to £124m last year. The firm explained: “A very strong first quarter, as buyers rushed to beat the increased stamp duty on second homes, was followed by low trading volumes in advance of the Brexit referendum at the end of June. Then a relatively quiet, but encouraging summer gave rise to a strong autumn selling season albeit with a slowing of transactions in December.” Savills said the sharp decline in the value of sterling since the referendum had drawn overseas buyers at the top end of the market. The average selling price in London increased slightly to £2.9m because the firm sold more properties worth £20m or more than in 2015. But it still recorded 5% fewer sales overall, while the market suffered even bigger declines. Outside London there was a 7% increase in exchanges. US bond yields are at three-week lows as investors dump equities in favour of lower-risk assets. The yield on benchmark 10-year US treasuries - an indicator of how much it costs the government to borrow from the financial markets - fell to 2.4%. Kingfisher, the company behind B&amp;Q and Screwfix, is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 this morning following the publication of annual results. My colleague Julia Kollewe reports: Shares in Kingfisher fell 4.8% despite better-than-expected results. The retailer warned of modest price increases and expressed concern that uncertainty around French and British politics could hit demand for its DIY products. Chief executive Véronique Laury, who is overseeing a five-year revamp of the business, said: “Looking forward, the EU referendum has created uncertainty for the UK economic outlook and we remain cautious on the outlook for France, especially in light of the forthcoming presidential elections.” The company beat City forecasts with a 14.7% rise in annual underlying pretax profit to £787m. A good performance in the UK &amp; Ireland, where like-for-like sales rose 5.9%, offset a 2.7% sales drop in France, where it trades as Castorama and Brico Dépôt. The retailer’s chairman Daniel Bernard is to step down in June after eight years in the role. He will be succeeded by Andy Cosslett, the former chief executive of InterContinental Hotels Group and Fitness First, who previously worked at Unilever and Cadbury Schweppes. He also chairs Rugby Football Union. Investors are not happy at all this morning. Losses are widening across Europe on fears that Trump is not going to be able to deliver on his policy pledges. Much of the optimism about his policies to boost US (and therefore global) growth has already been priced into markets since his election, with Wall Street and European markets hitting record highs. But as President Trump deals with the reality of governing, it seems determination alone is not enough to push through his flagship policies. If Trump hasn’t yet managed to overhaul Obamacare - his key priority - won’t his promises on tax giveaways and infrastructure spending get kicked into the long grass? Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, says markets are in a “sour mood”: Based on the mess Republicans are making of their healthcare reforms it seems increasingly unlikely that the Wotsit-in-Chief will be able to deliver on his sweeping tax changes and $1 trillion infrastructure spending. Combine that with the Wall Street Journal, a notably right-leaning publication, claiming that if Trump doesn’t ‘show more respect for the truth’ then ‘most Americans may conclude he’s a fake president’, and the optimism that caused investors to flock to the major indices has been seriously undermined by, well, Trump himself. The FTSE 100 is down 72 points as the negative sentiment spreads. The mining sector and financials are taking the brunt of it. Current scores on the board: FTSE 100: -1% at 7,306 Germany’s DAX: -0.8% at 11,871 France’s CAC: -0.8% at 4,963 Italy’s FTSE MIB: -1.1% at 19,706 Spain’s IBEX: -0.9% at 10,126 Europe’s STOXX 600: -0.8% at 373 The pound is just about holding on to the gains it made against the dollar on Tuesday following the sharp rise in UK inflation to 2.3% in February from 1.8%. In theory, the acceleration of inflation brings forward the prospect of a UK interest rate rise and adds weight to the decision by Kristin Forbes - member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee - to vote for a hike at the March meeting (she was outvoted). The pound is also being supported by dollar weakness, and is currently flat at $1.2477. It is also up 0.1% against the euro at €1.1550. European markets have opened lower, as fears ripple across the Atlantic over Trump’s ability to push through growth-boosting policies: FTSE 100: -0.6% Germany’s DAX: -0.8% France’s CAC: -0.7% Italy’s FTSE MIB: -0.9% Spain’s IBEX: -0.7% Europe’s STOXX 600: -0.3% Nouriel Roubini, the economist who is probably best known for predicting the global financial crisis, has also warned on Trump’s policies. Specifically, the professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business, says markets have over-estimated how many beneficial policies the President can carry through, while underestimating the potential negatives. Roubini told CNBC: [Markets] are overestimating the positives of the US-Trump policies. Infrastructure, stimulus, deregulation, tax cuts: I think Trump will achieve much less on those dimensions. And they’re underestimating the risk that the US protectionist policies are going to lead to trade wars, that the restrictions on immigration are going to slow down labor supply, and that micromanaging the corporate sector is going to be negative. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Shares in Asia are down sharply this morning following Wall Street’s worst day this year. It appears that hopes are evaporating of swift action on the growth-boosting policies promised by President Trump. With much of the upside already priced in, investors are now coming to the realisation that for all the talk, it might take longer than expected to push through reforms. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains: After the S&amp;P 500 posted its biggest one day fall since last October last year, the question being asked is whether the scales are starting to fall away from investor’s eyes as to whether President Trump will be able to deliver anything close to what has been priced into markets since his election last November. Even the mistiest eyed optimist appears to be coming to the realisation that even on health care, where there is some form of consensus, reforms are likely to take a lot longer than realised and as such any other programmes like tax and banking reform and infrastructure spending are likely to get pushed further out into the future. Here is how US markets closed: Dow Jones: -1.1% at 20,668 S&amp;P 500: -1.2% at 2,344 Nasdaq: -1.5% at 5,333 And in Asia: Hang Seng: -1.3% at 24,275 Nikkei: -2% at 19,041 Topix: -2% at 1,530 Shares in Europe are expected to open lower this morning: We will be tracking all the key developments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/mar/22/north-korea-missile-test-failure","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T05:53:37Z","webTitle":"North Korea missile test ends in failure – reports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/22/north-korea-missile-test-failure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/mar/22/north-korea-missile-test-failure","fields":{"headline":"North Korea missile test ends in failure – reports","bodyText":"North Korea’s latest missile launch appeared to have ended in failure on Wednesday, South Korean defence officials said, three days after the North claimed a major breakthrough in its rocket development program. The reported launch failure comes as the North is angrily reacting to ongoing annual US-South Korean military drills that it views as an invasion rehearsal. Earlier this month, North Korea fired four ballistic missiles that landed in waters off Japan, triggering strong protests from Seoul and Tokyo. On Wednesday morning, the North fired a missile from the eastern coastal town of Wonsan, but the launch was believed to have ended in failure, Seoul’s defence ministry said in a statement. The ministry said it was analysing what type of missile was launched but gave no further details. Yonhap news agency reported the missile was believed to have exploded in midair. “US Pacific Command detected what we assess was a failed North Korean missile launch attempt … in the vicinity of Kalma,” Commander Dave Benham, a spokesman for US Pacific Command, said in a statement, referring to an airfield in Wonsan. “A missile appears to have exploded within seconds of launch,” Benham said, adding that work was being carried out on a more detailed assessment. The failure might mean the missile is a newly developed one the North has not deployed before, according to South Korean media. Last year, the country suffered a series of embarrassing failed launches of its new medium-range Musudan missile before it successfully test-fired one. American officials said earlier this week that the US military expected another North Korean missile launch in the next several days. The officials said the US had increased its surveillance over the North and had detected a North Korean missile launcher being moved, as well as the construction of VIP seating in Wonsan. The North’s state media said on Sunday it had conducted a ground test of a new type of high-thrust rocket engine, which it hailed as a breakthrough for the country’s space program. Washington, Seoul and others view the North’s space program as a cover for its banned long-range missile development program. North Korea is pushing hard to upgrade its weapons systems to cope with what it calls US hostility. Many weapons experts say the North could have a functioning nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the continental US within a few years. The North carried out two nuclear tests last year.

The former ExxonMobil oil executive revealed his initial reluctance in an interview published after a controversial trip to Asia and hours before the biggest event of his two months at the state department, an international meeting on Wednesday about how to fight Islamic State (Isis). “I didn’t want this job. I didn’t seek this job,” Tillerson told the Independent Journal Review (IJR), in an interview conducted on his official plane during the three-nation Asia trip. “My wife told me I’m supposed to do this.” He said he had not met Donald Trump before being summoned to Trump Tower after the surprise election victory, ostensibly to talk to the president-elect “about the world” and his experiences as an oil company CEO. “When he asked me at the end of that conversation to be secretary of state, I was stunned,” he said, adding that at 65 years old, at the end of a four-decade career at ExxonMobil, he had expected to retire: “I was going to go to the ranch to be with my grandkids.” However, he said that when he returned to his Texas home after meeting Trump in New York, his wife, Renda St Clair, shook her finger in his face and said: “I told you God’s not through with you.” He said he now feels his wife had been right: “I’m supposed to do this.” Not everyone shares that view. Tillerson has been the subject of heavy criticism since taking the post as the country’s top diplomat at the beginning of February. He was left out of the loop of several critical foreign policy decisions made in the administration’s early days, most importantly the travel ban for refugees and visitors from a list of Muslim countries. He has also almost totally dodged the press for the first few weeks in his job. He did not take the Washington diplomatic press corps with him on his Asia tour, breaking with decades-old practice. The sole exception was the journalist from the IJR, a little-known outlet founded by a former Republican operative. The initial explanation from the state department was that he wanted to save money and take a smaller plane than usual. In his interview, Tillerson repeated that explanation but also suggested it would be his policy to avoid the press until and unless he had a specific message to deliver. He told the IJR: “I’m not a big media press access person. I personally don’t need it. I understand it’s important to get the message of what we’re doing out, but I also think there’s only a purpose in getting the message out when there’s something to be done.” When questioned about Russia, the IJR reported: “He was so cagey … his answer wasn’t even worthy of inclusion.” Tillerson has also been criticised for failing to defend the state department vocally enough in the face of a threatened budget cut of up to a third. Senior Republicans have said the cuts to diplomacy and foreign aid proposed by the White House would not pass Congress. In his remarks to the IJR, however, Tillerson appeared to relish the management challenge of cutting down the size of the US diplomatic establishment. “Looking at ongoing conflicts, if we accept that we’re just going to continue to never solve any of these conflicts, then the budget should stay at the current level,” he said. He said he had not yet talked to Trump about what a pared-down state department would look like or how it will be staffed: “We haven’t gotten that far yet.” While in South Korea, Tillerson was reported in the Seoul press to have snubbed the government by telling Korean officials he was too tired to dine with them. In response, he accused his hosts of being deliberately misleading. “They never invited us for dinner, then at the last minute they realised that optically it wasn’t playing very well in public for them, so they put out a statement that we didn’t have dinner because I was tired,” he told the IJR. On Tuesday, the state department was fighting off a new controversy, after it emerged Tillerson would skip what would have been his first Nato foreign ministers’ meeting in early April in Brussels so he could be in Florida for Trump’s first meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The state department spokesman, Mark Toner, insisted the administration was 100% committed to Nato and that Tillerson would be meeting many member foreign ministers at the anti-Isis meeting in Washington on Wednesday. Toner said the state department had proposed new dates for a possible Nato meeting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/mar/22/nba-resting-players-warriors-cavaliers","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T12:32:00Z","webTitle":"Everyone in the NBA controversy over resting players is right – and wrong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/22/nba-resting-players-warriors-cavaliers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/mar/22/nba-resting-players-warriors-cavaliers","fields":{"headline":"Everyone in the NBA controversy over resting players is right – and wrong","bodyText":"For the last few years, the NBA has mostly avoided the self-created problems that have plagued other US sports. So it was jarring to see a minor concern involving teams resting star players expand into a full-blown crisis in the span of two weeks, with figures on both sides doing their best to fuel the fire. In response, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver sent every team a memo on Monday saying there would be “significant penalties” for not following league rules about sending proper notice when resting players from primetime games. Silver is right to be upset, especially considering the amount of money the NBA receives from their deal with ABC, not to mention that the games in question – involving the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors – were supposed to draw in casual fans. The memo reignited an ongoing debate about the NBA schedule. Critics, most vocally head coaches, claim that it includes far too many games being played over the course of a too few days even before one factors in the marathon that is the postseason. Coaches rest their key players with the knowledge that too many minutes played in too many games, particularly in games played on consecutive days, dramatically increases their risk of injury. Nobody wants to see star players miss important regular season games, but it’s worse for everybody involved to lose them come playoff time. Both Cleveland and Golden State have had some recent experience with this. Silver is well aware of all of this, it’s part of his job to be, which is why his memo feels more like a knee-jerk reaction to two extremely high-profile incidents rather than the start of a serious change in policy. In pretending to not understand the underlying reasons behind the moves of both teams’ coaches, he may end up only succeeding in keeping them the news cycle that much longer. (Exhibit A: This column existing.) He’s not the only one feigning ignorance here, however, which is understandable. When publicly discussing an issue without an easy answer, it doesn’t help anyone’s case to present a multi-sided view of the situation. After all, it’s not as if anything about our current political climate suggests it’s a particularly bad move to defend one’s actions with blatant half-truths and see how far they will take you. For instance, Cavaliers head coach Tyronn Lue defended his decision by pointing out that Kyrie Irving had to come out of the previous game with a very real knee issue and that Kevin Love had just played his first game back after a long injury-related absence. Unfortunately, Lue also played the card of pretending to not understand where the criticism was coming from, something which would only ring true if he somehow forgot about the huge controversy that happened just one week prior. LeBron James himself also apparently forgot about the Warriors’ move later on when he responded to news of Silver’s memo by saying that the league only cared when it involved him. Golden State coach Steve Kerr, meanwhile, blamed his decision to rest Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala against the Spurs on the “worst stretch of schedule that [he’d] ever been part of.” Like Lue, Kerr wasn’t exactly lying. The Warriors were in a stretch where they played eight games in eight different cities, racking up an absurd number of flyers’ miles in the process. The problem comes when Kerr expects us to believe that he wasn’t, in part, attempting to send a message with the specific timing of his decision to pull almost all of his starters for what wasn’t just a primetime game (which his team has had more of than any other NBA team this season) but one that had long been tagged as a potential “game of the year.” Who knows, maybe the figure to bring both sides together will be the person who most famously made “sitting star players en masse for a nationally televised game” a fine-worthy offense. Back in 2012, David Stern, Silver’s predecessor, fined the Spurs $250,000 after head coach Gregg Popovich sat Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili and Danny Green before a TNT game against the LeBron James-led Miami Heat back in 2012 (okay so maybe James isn’t totally wrong when he says the fines always seem to come out in games involving him). At the time, it was widely believed that Popovich was sending a direct message to the commissioner about the schedule. So one would suspect that Popovich would be firmly on the side of Kerr and Lue here, but he was the first figure involved to state the obvious: both sides have legitimate concerns. He even seemed confident that the NBA would figure it out:, saying, “we know how the salaries are paid. We’ll get together a lot better than the Republicans and Democrats.” If part of the reason that these two coaches rested key players on back-to-back Saturday nights was to send Silver a message about the schedule, it’s clearly been received. Hopefully from this point forward, all sides will start working together to make sure that the sport’s best players are on the court for the biggest games, which is ultimately what everybody wants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2017/mar/23/informal-mental-health-carers-in-australia-contribute-13bn-a-year","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T19:02:33Z","webTitle":"Informal mental health carers in Australia 'contribute $13bn a year'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/23/informal-mental-health-carers-in-australia-contribute-13bn-a-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/mar/23/informal-mental-health-carers-in-australia-contribute-13bn-a-year","fields":{"headline":"Informal mental health carers in Australia 'contribute $13bn a year'","bodyText":"Informal mental health carers are contributing $13.2bn annually by caring for people with mental illness – 1.7 times more than Australian governments invest in mental health services each year, a report from the University of Queensland has found. The report, The Economic Value of Informal Mental Health Caring in Australia, was commissioned by community mental health service provider Mind Australia and will be launched at Parliament House in Canberra on Thursday. Researchers from the university’s school of public health collected data on the number of informal mental health carers in Australia, and the total hours of care provided by them. They then used national award wage rates to determine the cost to replace this care with formal services. The total annual replacement cost for all informal mental health carers in 2015 would have been $14.3bn, they found. After adjusting for the $1.1bn offset in Centrelink payments, the researchers determined it would cost governments $13.2bn to offset the unpaid informal care provided by the friends and families of people with a mental illness. It is the first time an economic value has been placed on informal mental health care in Australia. “The intention is never for government to completely replace the care provided by mental health carers,” the report said. “Rather, a replacement cost analysis is a method used to quantify the economic value of informal care, and in turn highlight the importance of carers.” The report also found the majority of mental health carers are women (54.4%) and that most of these women are of working age. Of primary mental health carers, such as a spouse, 40% provide 40 hours or more hours of care on average each week. A national mental health commissioner, Prof Ian Hickie, said mental health care remained “one of the greatest unrecognised contributions in the health area”. “We must grow the community support services available to people because we rely on families and friends to provide great majority of support outside of hospitals,” Hickie said. “They require support, training and backup services and they require respite, and increasingly we take their care and contribution for granted. When governments retreat, it is families who are left to provide support. The executive officer of Mental Health Carers Australia, Jenny Branton, said she was concerned that once some of the government-funded support mental health carers did receive was incorporated into the national disability insurance scheme, mental health carers may no longer be eligible for that support under NDIS guidelines. She wants reassurance from the government that there won’t be a shortfall once the scheme takes effect and that if there was, it would not be absorbed by informal carers and their families. “It is quite unclear what will be in the NDIS for mental health carers,” Branton said. “We know the NDIS has enormous potential for those eligible, but we are quite worried for those who aren’t eligible and their carers.” Informal mental health carers provided substantial emotional support to their loved ones on top of practical support, said the chief executive of Mind Australia, Dr Gerry Naughtin. “There is a particular level of emotional stress that carers experience,” Naughtin said. “There are a significant numbers of carers, and in particular women, who would like to move into workforce but are unable to due to the caring they provide. The impact is not only emotional distress, but stressed financial circumstances.” Last week the federal health minister Greg Hunt and the prime minister Malcolm Turnbull met with eminent psychiatrist Prof Pat McGorry and other mental health leaders to discuss mental health as a significant issue of national importance. “Mental health is a deep personal passion and is one of the four pillars of our long-term National Health Plan,” Hunt told Guardian Australia. “I’m very conscious of the fact that people of all ages can be affected by mental health problems and we need to have a range of different resources and services to provide help to those that need it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/mar/22/bill-shorten-says-prejudice-hurts-real-people-not-those-arguing-to-change-18c","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T09:31:31Z","webTitle":"Bill Shorten says prejudice hurts 'real people', not those arguing to change 18C","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/22/bill-shorten-says-prejudice-hurts-real-people-not-those-arguing-to-change-18c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/mar/22/bill-shorten-says-prejudice-hurts-real-people-not-those-arguing-to-change-18c","fields":{"headline":"Bill Shorten says prejudice hurts 'real people', not those arguing to change 18C","bodyText":"Prejudice hurts “real people” and largely not those pushing to change the Racial Discrimination Act, Bill Shorten has told a migration awards ceremony in Canberra. In the comments on Wednesday night at the Australian Migration and Settlement Awards, the opposition leader warned against demonising difference “in a world where political extremists seek to profit from an anti-migration message”. Malcolm Turnbull used his keynote speech to say migrants have a responsibility to “integrate and contribute” and stress the need for new Australians to commit to democracy and the rule of law, the same as existing citizens. Turnbull expressed pride at Australia’s migrant culture and announced the government has now issued all 12,000 visas to people escaping Syria and Iraq, first announced in 2015. The event comes as the Turnbull government introduced its proposed changes to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act to the Senate on Wednesday. The bill would remove “insult”, “offend” and “humiliate” from the prohibition on discriminatory speech and add “harass”, along with numerous procedural changes to the Australian Human Rights Commission’s handling of cases. Labor targeted the government over section 18C in question time, leading Turnbull to reveal that the bill “specifically states that a single act can constitute harassment”. It is unclear when the government will bring the bill on for debate, except that it will be after childcare changes are debated on Thursday, and whether Labor and the crossbench will seek to refer it to a Senate committee. Shorten said that “political extremists” are telling Australians “that cutting migration will clear-up traffic and make housing cheaper”. “It will make our internet faster, our schools better and our weather sunnier,” he said. “And citizens who feel like they’re not getting a fair go are told to blame minorities, to demonise difference.” The former prime minister Tony Abbott has called for the Coalition to explicitly link migration to housing affordability, as the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, did while debating housing affordability on Wednesday evening in the Senate. Shorten said that migrant attendees and award recipients are “an irreplaceable part of who we are ... the counter-argument to that dishonesty [and] living proof of the benefits of migration”. Shorten warned that prejudice hurts “people who make sacrifices, who work hard and who are wondering why their parliament is arguing whether it should be easier to insult, offend and humiliate them on the basis of race”. He cited the example of his mother telling him she had been knocked back for a job in a supermarket when she was a student, because they found out she was a Catholic. Shorten said he has never been the victim of discrimination based on the colour of his skin and “by an overwhelming majority, neither have the people who are arguing that the Racial Discrimination Act needs to change”. The opposition leader argue that “powerful, vocal, middle-aged men” were treating the issue as a philosophical discussion but “racism isn’t a theory” for an Asian student facing abuse on public transport, a Jewish family who see swastikas splashed in graffiti or a child bullied for their skin colour, name or lunch. “It’s easy to denigrate a protection you never need. It’s easy to dismiss a hurt you’ll never feel.” Turnbull said Australia is “a lesson in harmony and security amid diversity”. “We are proud of the role immigration has played in shaping the Australia we know and love,” he said, adding that Australia was built “by the hands, wits and ambition of its migrants”. Turnbull said Australians “welcome newcomers with open arms and mutual respect because we are confident in our culture, our institutions and our laws”. “In return, our newest Australians pledge loyalty to Australia and its people, affirm shared democratic beliefs and agree to respect and uphold our liberties, rights and laws.” Turnbull described it as a “precious compact” that binds both those already in Australia and those that wish to join. “Citizenship offers rights but it also confers the responsibility to integrate and contribute,” he said. Turnbull said he was proud that Australia had agreed in 2015 to take 12,000 people displaced by the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. He announced the government had now issued all 12,000 visas and 10,000 people had already settled. As recently as September, just 3,500 had come to Australia. Turnbull said Australia had achieved resettlement while prioritising women, children, families and persecuted minorities and “maintaining rigorous security checks and ensuring strong public support”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/mar/23/at-the-artists-colony-i-bathed-my-mind-and-fed-my-soul","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-23T01:21:30Z","webTitle":"At the artists' colony I bathed my mind and fed my soul | Brigid Delaney's diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/23/at-the-artists-colony-i-bathed-my-mind-and-fed-my-soul","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/23/at-the-artists-colony-i-bathed-my-mind-and-fed-my-soul","fields":{"headline":"At the artists' colony I bathed my mind and fed my soul","bodyText":"When I think of an artists’ colony, my mind wanders to that very average 1994 Hugh Grant film, Sirens, which depicted the life of the painter Norman Lindsay (played by Sam Neill) and the bohemian characters (Kate Fischer, Portia de Rossi, Elle Macpherson) who surrounded him in his country idyll in the Blue Mountains. It was all art, nude bathing in bubbling brooks and talk of culture and nature and morals – an exaggerated version of how artists might actually live. I am in an artists’ colony at the moment, four hours down the road in Bundanon, and I can tell you it is nothing like that. This colony is more like a country within a country – a republic of creation. On the south coast of New South Wales, gifted to the state by the painter Arthur Boyd (I’m writing this actual sentence while sitting on Boyd’s nice floral couch), there’s nothing to do, nowhere to go – you are just expected to work on your art, or think about it, or read. We are discouraged from swimming – the Shoalhaven river that runs along the border of the property is wide, fast-flowing and brackish – and I don’t fancy drowning before I finish my book. My fellow artists in the colony are an Indigenous hip-hop collective, a couple of visual artists (one of whom does almost brutalist architectural-style drawings), a couple of writers, a musician and a dancer. Nor do we don’t hang out talking for hours. We’re here to work. During the week when I went to visit one of the musicians (I needed to use his shower, my hot water was broken), his voice was croaky from lack of use and he’d had only a few hours sleep the night before. He’d had a creative breakthrough of sorts and had stayed up most of the night composing. He talked at a pace, then apologised for rambling; he hadn’t seen anyone in days. Most people stick to themselves but on Saturday night, one of the writers invited everyone to her cottage and we had a roast beef dinner, saw and trapped a funnel web spider and stepped over wombats on the walk home. The next morning the dancer led a movement class, which we did while the musician played the music he’d composed this week. It was like a summer camp for creative grownups. Then we all went our separate ways, to our studios overlooking fields of kangaroos. Artists’ colonies emerged in the late 19th and 20th century in European villages that welcomed a mix of a floating and permanent population of artists. The first world war ended a lot of them but their spirit can still be found in places such as Bundanon – intermingling different types of creative people in a rural setting, free from distractions. In these philistine years, when artists are treated with contempt by the government and are being starved out of creation, the fact that such a place exists feels like a miracle. Artists in this country are used to the spoils of their craft being meted out in a spiritual, not material, currency. The low four-figure advances for many Australian novelists are essentially a token amount – the real prize is the permission from the cultural mandarins to create and distribute the work. There are other consolation prizes – invitations to writers’ festivals, where you might be put up in a nice hotel, or being taken out for dinner by your publisher – but few go into the arts to get rich. Authors in Australia can expect to earn, on average, $12,900 a year and cuts to arts funding under this government have hit artists. The novelist Frank Moorhouse explores the knotty question of writers and money in an excellent essay in this month’s Meanjin. Could, he wonders, a fund be set up to support senior writers on renewable “long term (say 10-year) national contracts”. This would get around the fact that even a successful author in Australia doesn’t earn enough to live on owing to the demographics of the country (small population, therefore small sales). Ibsen, points out Moorhouse, received a lifetime pension from the Norwegian government when he was 38; it enabled some of the finest plays of the 19th century to be written. But artists’ colonies do fill a bit of the gap. Where else could you do writing workshops then play tennis in the hot Florida sun with the novelist Geoff Dyer, as my friend the writer Virginia Lloyd did. Or find yourself in one Australian retreat playing “naked chat roulette” with erotic fiction writers – as another writer friend did – who is still alarmed by the experience (which, come to think of it, sounds not a million miles from Sirens). Or have, as a poet friend of mine put it, Terrible Affairs I Should Not Have Had: The Residency Years. Where else could you have the time and space to do the work? These places of creation are a great solace to impoverished and isolated artists. It gives them a community, and space and time to create. It also takes them seriously. After all, isn’t most art a confidence trick? It is no accident that two of the most magical arts residencies in Australia – Bundanon and Varuna in the Blue Mountains – were bequeathed by artists themselves (the family of the writer Eleanor Dark bequeathed Varuna). They know what it’s like to create something when the barriers are against them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/mar/23/how-the-collapse-in-full-time-jobs-for-men-is-fuelling-record-underemployment","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T19:00:43Z","webTitle":"How the collapse in full-time work for men is fuelling record underemployment | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/23/how-the-collapse-in-full-time-jobs-for-men-is-fuelling-record-underemployment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/mar/23/how-the-collapse-in-full-time-jobs-for-men-is-fuelling-record-underemployment","fields":{"headline":"How the collapse in full-time jobs for men is fuelling record underemployment","bodyText":"The latest unemployment rate figures brought the bad news that the unemployment rate is again rising, but perhaps more concerning is that February saw a record level of underemployment. With weak full-time employment growth, underemployment is in many ways now a better indicator of the health of the economy than the unemployment rate. Before the 1990s recession, underemployment wasn’t really a thing. During the 80s the underemployment rate was rarely above 4%; after it, and the destruction it wrought on full-time work, it was rarely below 6%: The global financial crisis also had a significant impact. Before the GFC, at the height of the mining boom, 5.9% of the labour force were underemployed; last month this figure hit 8.7% and hasn’t been below 7% for more than five and a half years. The rise in underemployment has been a big factor in the dislocation of the unemployment rate from the real-world experience of the labour market. Traditionally, underemployment and unemployment are closely linked. When unemployment rises that is usually a sign that the economy is weakening and businesses cut the hours of workers, which increases underemployment. When things are going well, the opposite usually occurs – not only are businesses employing more people they also increase the hours worked by those already employed – ie, reducing underemployment. But in the middle of 2014, the relationship between the unemployment and underemployment broke down: The reason (as I have noted a few times) is the lack of full-time work compared with part-time. Since May 2014, 329,000 new part-time jobs have been created compared with just 152,000 full-time ones. That is a massive change given that two-thirds of all jobs are full time. And as I have also noted the hardest hit have been the youth, and not surprisingly they are the ones who have the highest level of underemployment. Nearly 20% of women in the labour force aged 15 to 24 are underemployed, and 16.2% of men that age – both records. Since May 2014, the rates of underemployment for both genders under 25 have risen by more than any other age group: And while it would be easy to think it is a just an issue of youth – and thus might be something that is quarantined from the broader economy – the reality is that underemployment is now affecting workers of all ages at record levels. A comparison of the unemployment and underemployment rates for workers aged 25 to 54 shows a similar disconnect occurring in 2014: The impact of weak full-time employment growth is evident when we compared the percentage of adults aged 25 to 64 who are employed and those employed full time. A decade ago 74.7% of 25- to 64-year-olds were employed; that has now risen to a near record 75.9%. By contrast the percentage of this prime-working aged group of adults who are employed full time has fallen from 56.7% to 55.7%: The last time so few prime-working aged adults were working full time was in 2005. The big reason is the absolute collapse of male full-time work since the GFC. Despite weak economic growth, women have continued to find more full-time work than in the past. Currently, 39.5% of women aged 25 to 64 work full time – just down on the record of 39.8% reached in the middle of last year. By contrast the proportion of prime-working aged men in full-time jobs has fallen in the past 10 years from 75% to a new record low in February of 72.4%: One difficulty in comparing underemployment with the past is that there are two reasons why people want more hours – one negative and one positive. Mostly with men the issue is a negative – men want more hours because they are seeking full-time work or more part-time hours. But for women the issue is not completely negative. There are more women underemployed now than ever before despite there also being more women working full time than ever before. Women not only are working full time more than ever before there are also more women than ever before desiring to work full time. That is not necessarily a bad thing but it does still indicate that there is a lot of spare capacity in the labour force. And that spare capacity is a big driver of the current record low wages growth. I noted last month that wages and unemployment normally are in sync – when one falls the other rises – but over the past two years the relationship has broken down. Wages growth has fallen even while the unemployment rate has fallen: But if instead of the unemployment rate we use the underemployment rate, we see the relationship remains in sync: While we still have wage growth slightly below what we would expect, it is not out as whack as it seems when comparing it with the unemployment rate. And the bad news is that given we have just hit a record high rate of underemployment, it suggests that for those hoping for an improvement in wages growth will probably have to wait a bit longer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/mar/23/starting-over-again-afl-season-begins-with-round-characterised-by-contrasts","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T19:00:42Z","webTitle":"Starting over again: AFL season begins with round characterised by contrasts | Craig Little","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/23/starting-over-again-afl-season-begins-with-round-characterised-by-contrasts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/mar/23/starting-over-again-afl-season-begins-with-round-characterised-by-contrasts","fields":{"headline":"Starting over again: AFL season begins with round characterised by contrasts","bodyText":"To quote Mickey and Sylvia, love is strange. On Thursday night, a 70,000-strong, noisy, passionate chorus is expected to accompany the AFL season opener between two football clubs who more closely resemble a decades-long conceptual art project. While it may be a hard-fought contest between two of the best-supported clubs in Carlton and Richmond, it is lamentably low-stakes. In terms of aesthetics for a marquee game, it is a bit like Kenny G doing a retrospective of Miles Davis’s Kind of Blue. On another kind of Blue, the Carlton tragedy aged into comedy when they appointed Mick Malthouse and died when the joke was no longer funny. It is hard to imagine how Ikon Park’s Augean stables might be cleaned, but last year his replacement Brendan Bolton appeared visibly delighted in sweeping a broom through the club. In saying that, “visibly delighted” seems to be his default setting. Carlton’s list management has simultaneously been an expression of optimism and an act of desperation, represented again last summer with a dutiful trip back to the GWS well. Two former Giants – Caleb Marchbank and Jarrod Pickett – will debut in navy blue at the MCG on Thursday. Where Carlton exceeded expectations last year, Richmond lived down to them. Damien Hardwick has the air of a man who never lost the appetite for discovery, it’s just that he keeps discovering the same thing: his team is not quite good enough. Richmond is now a club that rarely gets better or worse, instead finding new ways to stay the same. The difference on Thursday may be the contrasting Richmond key-position players at either end of the ground. At one end is Alex Rance, with a face on loan from a glossy magazine and an understated confidence. At the other stands the charming rogue Jack Riewoldt, whose demeanour within a game seems to vary between “curt teenager interviewing for a job he didn’t really want” to “man trying to direct traffic in a city where he doesn’t speak the local language”. He is fun to watch and hard not to barrack for. Friday night’s game is another that throws up the kind of contrasts that make for great art; the Bulldogs’ 2016 premiership victory and triumph over adversity was uplifting, but the string of defeats and De Goey-esque disappointments visited upon Collingwood in recent years have been utterly enthralling also. The Magpies’ signing of Chris Mayne and Daniel Wells to multiple-year contracts isn’t exactly fixing the problem, but it might make things funnier. It appeared as though Travis Cloke fell out of love with Nathan Buckley years ago. In Buckley’s defence, Cloke has been short of admirers for much of his career, but Bulldogs coach Luke Beveridge may be able to find a way to the hulking forward’s heart through a witty Dr Seuss metaphor, or a “Wocket in his Pocket”. Cloke will be one of the more interesting storylines for the Bulldogs, alongside the continued development of Tom Boyd. Trumping them both will be the return of Bob Murphy early this season. If the Bulldogs had the sense of theatre to align that comeback moment with the inaugural Good Friday fixture against North Melbourne, it could be topped only by the unveiling of a marble statue of Murphy standing at the feet of Ted Whitten – something reminiscent of a Pieta in which Christ is taken rom the cross and mourned by his mother. Still, the highlight of the opening round is likely to come from Etihad Stadium on Saturday afternoon when the two teams who currently labour under the longest premiership droughts look to provide their fans with at least a long-range forecast of rain. Both Melbourne and St Kilda are predicted to be the most likely teams from outside last year’s top eight to storm their way through to finals this year. It’ll be Melbourne’s midfield and St Kilda’s key position players who do the heavy lifting. The Demons’ formidable young midfield of Jack Viney, Angus Brayshaw, Clayton Oliver, Christian Petracca and Dom Tyson have the luxury of operating under not only the game’s dominant ruckman in Max Gawn, but also the tutelage of four-time Hawthorn premiership midfielder, Jordan Lewis. Meanwhile, St Kilda effectively adds Jake Carlisle to a list of key-position players that already included Nick Riewoldt, Josh Bruce, Paddy McCartin and Tim Membrey. Former Bulldog Koby Stevens, fresh from the heartbreak of missing an historic premiership, will be looking to establish himself as part of the Saints’ latest grab for football folklore. Of last year’s finalists, we should get an early read on how the Giants manage lofty expectations with a tough assignment first up at Adelaide Oval. To close out the round we’ll also see how well Geelong will handle the loss of hundreds of games worth of premiership experience in what could prove to be a tricky assignment at Domain Stadium against the Dockers. Last year the Cats were the competition’s second best defensive side. That defence however looks more fragile without Cory Enright. As much as Zach Tuohy will be warmly adopted by the Cats faithful, he is less convincing as their Enright faute de mieux. Fremantle is coming off what was, statistically speaking, the biggest fall from grace in the game’s history. Don’t be surprised if they start their season in a more positive note than the meek 10-goal loss to the eventual premiers in last year’s opener. But if you want proof that football’s love is indeed strange, venture to the MCG on Saturday night to see Essendon take on Hawthorn, or more specifically stop by the caps-lock-mode commemorative merchandise stand for the “COMEBACK” campaign, following the time their players were banned for anti-doping breaches. What won’t be strange will be the roar in the half-light of evening that welcomes the return of the universally loved Hawk, Jarryd Roughead. The 30-year-old has said his recent cancer scare had given him fresh perspective on life and has provided an inspiration, not just for his team-mates, but everyone who follows the game. Roughead has a generosity of spirit that is immediate and direct. For all its faults – and there are many – when it’s boiled long enough, the irreducible core of our love for the game can be found in the story of Roughead, and in the hope that comes with starting again.

Blame the leadership?","bodyText":"Top story: Labour party losing thousands of members Good morning, Warren Murray with today’s briefing. The Labour party is set to fall below half a million members, with the party leadership worried that it might get worse as tens of thousands of people decline to pay their dues. There are now about 483,000 paid-up members – last July there were 554,000 – and senior figures have warned more may have cancelled their direct debits without formally notifying an intention to leave. Some could be Corbynites who rushed to join but then lost their enthusiasm, while others may have quit in disillusionment over the direction of his leadership. Our editorial argues the party under Corbyn is failing to offer a credible vision. Rafael Behr says it may be time for an election anyway. Theresa May is trying to govern from the remnants of David Cameron’s shattered 2015 platform, and Labour MPs don’t know what they stand for any more. We’ve already had the Rump, Barebone’s, Cavalier, Blessed, Addled, Happy and Useless parliaments, and this might be the Craven Parliament, Behr writes. * * * Reluctant Rex – It may be the most truthful statement yet from the Trump administration. Rex Tillerson has revealed he didn’t want to be US secretary of state but his wife made him do it. “I didn’t want this job. I didn’t seek this job,” Tillerson told the Independent Journal Review (IJR). He was approaching retirement when the president-elect called him in to Trump Tower for a chat. “When he asked me at the end of that conversation to be secretary of state, I was stunned,” Tillerson said. “I was going to go to the ranch to be with my grandkids.” But his wife, Renda St Clair, told him “God’s not through with you” and now he thinks “I’m supposed to do this.” * * * ‘Supersized’ prisons – England and Wales will host four new correctional institutions that will together create more than 5,000 modern prison places. The sites are Full Sutton in east Yorkshire, Hindley in Wigan, Rochester in Kent and Port Talbot in south Wales. The government argues the new jails will complement today’s correctional practices, doing away with “dark corridors and cramped conditions”. But prison reform advocates say the £1.3bn project ignores the need to put fewer people behind bars in the first place. * * * Brexit ‘baloney’ – A new rift has opened in the Conservative party as some frontbenchers argue Britain can afford to leave the EU without a trade agreement. Their thinking: the remaining member states would only want to use any deal to exact vengeance. But the Tory MPs supporting this view have been accused of peddling “ideological baloney” in telling colleagues Britain should just fall back on World Trade Organisation rules. “Every credible assessment done says this would be the worst trading arrangement possible for jobs, investment and growth,” says Anna Soubry MP. * * * Visa reversal – Happy news from Australia where British war veteran James Bradley, 92, has been granted permanent residency after facing the threat of deportation. Bradley and his wife Peggie, 91, had been in a perverse situation. They moved to Sydney 10 years ago to be with their daughter, Sharon, and her family under the “aged parent visa” programme. But the visa took so many years to process that James eventually failed a required medical. After the Guardian reported their plight, the immigration ministry intervened and they are now allowed to stay. * * * Lovely at the top – Britain’s millionaires think they will only get richer under Brexit, while chief executives at FTSE companies are earning a staggering 386 times more than the annual living wage, according to findings we are publishing this morning. The Swiss bank UBS says 78% of its millionaire clients in the UK think leaving the EU will have a positive effect on their financial plans, and on the economy – but they are still keeping much of their wealth in cash, just in case. The Equality Trust, meanwhile, says firms should be forced to publish the difference in pay between their highest paid employee and average employee to highlight the kinds of gross disparities brought to light in its Pay Tracker report. * * * ‘Global Laundromat’ – Deutsche Bank, which loaned $300m to Donald Trump, was involved in dirty money leaving Russia under the $20bn criminal scheme that the Guardian has been investigating. Deutsche provided services to a now-defunct Latvian bank, Trasta, used by Russian criminals linked to the Kremlin. Germany’s biggest lender cut ties when Latvian regulators issued a warning about Trasta. Deutsche has previously examined loans to Trump for any Russian links but is understood to have found no evidence. Deutsche’s Private Bank – the division that lends to Trump – is identified in the Global Laundromat investigation as likely to have many rich Russians on its books. Lunchtime read: Will Donald Trump be impeached? About 46% of Americans think he should be, according to one poll. And with the scandal of Russian influence, plus claims of various constitutional breaches, calls for his removal from office seem likely to persist throughout Trump’s presidency. But there would be significant hurdles to clear before it could happen. So is it all just a liberal fantasy? Find out with Tom McCarthy. Sport Gareth Southgate has told his players their aim must be to win the 2018 World Cup as he prepares for his first match since taking the England job full time against Germany in Dortmund tonight. Meanwhile former England coach Roy Hodgson has described as “purely irrelevant and dishonest” the criticisms of his tactics during his team’s failed Euro 2016 campaign. Meanwhile, Team Sky and British Cycling must join the sport’s voluntary anti-doping group to have any chance of silencing their doubters, according to the president of the Movement for Credible Cycling; and the leader of the Paris bid for the 2024 Olympics has promised he can “100% guarantee” none of his team will accept or offer bribes for votes in September’s election. Business Trump may or may not be impeached one day, but financial markets are already reassessing their optimistic verdict on the president. Shares plunged in Asia on Wednesday following the biggest falls for five months in Wall Street on Tuesday night. Compounding Trump’s woes, the usually supportive Wall Street Journal (prop: Rupert Murdoch) lashed into the president in an editorial, saying he is losing credibility by spreading false claims he was wiretapped by Barack Obama. Overnight the pound was buying US$1.25 and €1.16. The papers The front pages are a mixture of reports/tributes/attacks after Martin McGuinness’s death, and the ban on passengers taking laptops on board some flights to Britain and the US. The Mail’s front is the standout because of its evident anger and dislike for McGuinness. It has two pictures of IRA atrocities and then McGuinness’s name under them. Inside it continues over multiple pages saying he was an evil man. The Telegraph says the former deputy first minister in the Northern Ireland assembly took the “secrets of his victims” to his grave. The paper’s splash is the laptop ban on flights into the UK. The FT goes for “Death of an IRA leader turned peacemaker” while also splashing on the ban on laptops on planes. The Times has a picture of McGuinness’s coffin being carried through Bogside but splashes on the laptop ban as well. The Mirror’s main story is that the contraceptive pill can protect women from cancer for 30 years according to a new study. It calls McGuinness “the IRA butcher who laid down his weapons”.

When I was asked to write a comment piece about dating, I thought it was a joke. Which made sense as I am in the business of cracking them. “Dating as a female comedian,” they clarified – a piece tied to my new comedy show. “Share with our readers what it’s like.” Honestly, my experience of dating is very similar to many women in 2017. (I should mention, I am talking from my experience as a cis, hetero-normative female, with that terribly boring dynamic of woman desiring man. Ugh, what a cliché!) I enjoy a wonderfully fulfilling single life until the odd weak moment strikes and I find myself sitting on the couch trying to ascertain from a blurry photo on an app if this man is likely to harm me as much as the gasping fish he is holding. Or if he will send me an unsolicited snap of his semi-erect wang. (Never requested, and yet in they flood ...) And in the dark, quiet moments, wondering: will I be enough? It seems, at times, I might be too much. We often hear that desirable characteristics in a woman are “mysteriousness” or “a girl-next-door quality” – but when your job compels you to regularly mime the very true story of that time a young man jizzed out of your third storey apartment window, it becomes quite evident you are nailing neither attribute. (Unless you actually live next door to me, in which case I am very much the girl next door. And I am also very sorry.) Scientists have done dozens of very expensive studies in order to conclude that honesty is the quality most desired in a partner. In my experience, however, it seems what we mean when we say “honesty” is, “please tell me you’re unhappy in this relationship before it gets to the point where you engage in heavy petting with Jamie from work and my feelings get hurt”. Not, like I am in the habit of doing, making the unfiltered yet honest observation that one’s partner looks like a hysterical Meryl Streep in Sophie’s Choice during one of his tantrums. I have never had a healthy filter. I have always felt there is great humour and groundedness in the balls-out honest truth. When that kind of arresting candour becomes your job, well, you’ve painted yourself into a bit of a corner when it comes to playing the damsel for love. To my knowledge, Cinderella never shared her “jizz out the window story” on a stage in the back room of a pub. The choice to go into comedy definitely coincided with the swift southward descent of any romantic life I had previously enjoyed. Maybe it was the late nights, or the aforementioned oversharing, but most likely it’s the power in the potential of presenting a prospective partner’s shortcomings to great mirth from a room full of strangers if the mood strikes me. Although I would never shame a partner on stage. That’s a promise, I am classier than that. (Hear that fellas? She’s the full package!) No one tends to approach the funny woman at the end of the gig. The guys might have wonderfully confident women draped upon them, hoarse from giggling. But for us ladies, it’s a wasteland. This is the only instance where the preface of “female” before “comedian” is a necessary differentiation, because when it comes to post-gig hook-ups, the experiences for male and female comedians are worlds apart. I don’t want to assume men feel threatened by a funny woman, but the traditional dynamic of comedic power in the relationship might be. Let’s not start unpacking those gender politics here though. Yikes! What I will say is this: playing small ain’t sexy. So gag it up as much as you like, people, and let the chips fall where they may. I can’t speak for all female comedians, but for this female comedian, dating certainly has had its unique challenges. Touring makes regular intimacy with a partner a very tricky undertaking. Facetime and Skype have transformed the long distance experience, but there is no substitute for sharing a couch with your partner, chewing on an antacid and watching something staggeringly inconsequential on TV before wrapping it up with a fond shag. On the plus side though, if a guy turns out to be a jerk, revenge comedy is deeply satisfying. It’s not as dramatic as a full social media character assassination, but making that jackass the butt of a joke in the dim light of a comedy room, and having strangers roaring with laughter, well … that can be more cathartic than a year of therapy. Dating is ridiculous for anyone. You feel vulnerable, then giddy, then resentful. There’s a constant dull itch as your pubes grow back. It’s a lot of anxiety, unsolicited dick pics (Really. Stop.), and hope. Just clinging to hope, like a cat on the curtains.

The suspect, Francis Rawls, has so far refused to comply with the court order, citing the fifth amendment, which protects him from self-incrimination. The case has become a battleground for civil liberties campaigners, who believe that citizens should have the right to protect their critical information and to be protected from self-incrimination. However, the suspected nature of the encrypted content makes for a challenging ethical quandary: those hard drives are believed to contain images depicting child sexual abuse. In order to stand up for the rights of citizens across the US, organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) must defend a suspected pedophile. According to court documents obtained by Ars Technica, the case started in 2015, when the Delaware County criminal investigations unit got a warrant to search Rawls’ home after investigating his online activity. Officers seized two iPhones, an Apple Mac Pro and two external hard drives and got a warrant to examine their contents. Rawls refused to give up the passwords required to decrypt the hard drives, which were encrypted with Apple’s FileVault software. That didn’t stop digital forensics experts from finding incriminating content, including an image of a pubescent girl in a sexually provocative position and logs showing the device had been used to visit sites with titles commonly used in child exploitation. The forensic investigation also revealed that Rawls had downloaded thousands of files known by their “hash” values to be child abuse images, although the files themselves couldn’t be accessed. The suspect’s sister also told police that she had seen hundreds of images of child sexual abuse on the hard drives. In August 2015, a court issued a decryption order, compelling the suspect to unlock the encrypted devices. He unlocked one of the iPhones, but said he could not remember the passwords to the encrypted hard drives – an assertion the court rejected based on testimony from his sister, who said she had seen him enter his passwords from memory. In September, a district court held the suspect in contempt of court for refusing to comply with the decryption order. On Monday, the third US circuit court of appeals upheld the decision. Rawls remains imprisoned without charges (for much of the time in solitary confinement) in Philadelphia’s federal detention center until he complies with the court order. “Theoretically, he could be held in jail for contempt forever ... until he’s dead,” said Dan Terzian, a lawyer from Duane Morris. “Given the powerful evidence here that the defendant knows the passwords, he holds the key to his own cell. It is his own refusal to provide the evidence covered by the search warrant that is keeping him there,” added Adam Klein, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. In ruling against Rawls, the court of appeals has decided that his constitutional rights against being forced to self-incriminate are not being breached. This is because of an exception to the fifth amendment known as a “foregone conclusion”, which is when authorities already know something exists – in this case, police say they know there are child abuse images on the hard drives because they have a witness who saw the files (Rawls’ sister). The EFF and ACLU argued in an amicus brief that they did not believe the government could demonstrate with “reasonable particularity” that it knew the documents existed. Why don’t they go to trial without the files allegedly stored on the encrypted devices? It comes down to reasonable doubt. “The government wants every piece of evidence they can get to show the jurors what a disgusting person the defendant is,” said Terzian, who has previously attended a trial where no actual images were presented as evidence in a case addressing child abuse images. “Witnesses said he was searching for it, but he was found not guilty because the defence convincingly argued that if there was child porn, the government would have shown it,” he said. There is also the issue of identifying child victims of sexual abuse and their attackers. In her essay on the topic, published in January, the Brookings Institution fellow Susan Hennessy explained the “immediate and real” problem: Whereas with respect to terrorism cases we often end up hypothesizing how law enforcement and policy makers will respond to “the next big attack”, in the child exploitation context the next attack is happening literally every day. Children as young as infants and toddlers are raped or otherwise abused on camera; those images are routinely shared among a community of offenders; and those offenders deploy technologies that make it difficult or impossible to discover the perpetrators, prosecute their crimes, or identify and rescue victims. Hennessy proposes that instead of forcing technology companies to create backdoors for law enforcement, “lawful hacking” – in which the government exploits vulnerabilities in encrypted systems – and regulation should be more broadly applied. The suspect’s attorney, Keith Donoghue, a public defender, said he was “disappointed in the ruling” and was studying the decision to determine the next course of action. “The fact remains that the government has not brought charges. Our client has now been in custody for 18 months based on his assertion of his fifth amendment rights against self-incrimination,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/mar/22/gay-panic-defence-thrown-out-in-queensland","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T23:21:58Z","webTitle":"'Gay panic' murder defence thrown out in Queensland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/22/gay-panic-defence-thrown-out-in-queensland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/mar/22/gay-panic-defence-thrown-out-in-queensland","fields":{"headline":"'Gay panic' murder defence thrown out in Queensland","bodyText":"Gay rights campaigners have welcomed Queensland’s move to abolish the so-called “gay panic” defence to murder but say they don’t know why it took so long. The partial defence to murder had allowed defendants to argue for a reduction to manslaughter by claiming an unwanted homosexual advance provoked violence. The passage through Queensland parliament on Tuesday night of a bill striking the partial defence from the criminal code leaves South Australia the only state where it remains. The push to repeal the defence was spearheaded by the Maryborough priest Father Paul Kelly after the fatal 2008 bashing of Wayne Ruks in his church yard, after which the killers raised the defence at trial. Kelly said he was relieved Queensland had finally ditched the “archaic” legal provision but was surprised it took so long. “So many people said this was a no-brainer and that it was clearly an archaic law, so I did feel the resistance to it was an ideological one,” he said. The Queensland attorney general, Yvette D’Ath, said the defence wasn’t specifically in the criminal code but had built up over time in common law through judges rulings. “Equality before the law is a fundamental principle of human rights and the amendment ... will ensure that this provision operates equally for all members of our community,” D’Ath said. Queensland law society president, Christine Smyth, said the decision “to remove this antiquated and discriminatory defence from the criminal statutes is a very strong and clear message that the law is in keeping with current community standards and expectations”. Smyth said the government had also gone some way to addressing the society’s argument that a similar partial defence of provocation should remain open “to a defendant where the victim had sexually assaulted or raped the defendant, or where the victim had sexually abused the defendant as a child”. She said the bill attempted to cater to those examples by using the term “circumstances of an exceptional character”. Smyth said while the government had not defined this term, she had “absolute confidence in the courts to administer the legislation effectively”. The South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, late last year promised to follow suit by striking the partial defence for homicide from law. Other states removed unwanted sexual advances as a partial defence a decade ago."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/mar/21/north-south-match-report-mason-crane-liam-dawson","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T20:35:57Z","webTitle":"Wisdom of ECB's desert trip still unclear as Mason Crane takes chance to impress","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/21/north-south-match-report-mason-crane-liam-dawson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/mar/21/north-south-match-report-mason-crane-liam-dawson","fields":{"headline":"Wisdom of ECB's desert trip still unclear as Mason Crane takes chance to impress","bodyText":"Andrew Strauss has poured hundreds of thousands of pounds and convened a full roster of staff – covering every base from umpires to anti-corruption via the analyst – into his pet project, the reopening of cricket’s North-South divide, and thus was not about to let some rare desert rain stop the third and final match, even if it was a dead rubber. After the South won twice in Dubai, a day game was delayed, condensed and the floodlights revved up, with the South eventually completing a clean sweep as the North fell 21 short of chasing 229 in 40 overs, thanks to some brilliant bowling from the 20-year-old leg‑spinner Mason Crane, who at one stage took four for one in 12 balls. One of Strauss’s incentives was making it winner takes all, so while the Southerners share £50,000, the North leave with nothing. The response of the wider cricketing public has been a shrug. What’s the point? Why can’t I watch or – in the case of the Dubai games, which were not broadcast because of the excessive financial demands of the stadium – even listen to it? Why is no one there? Certainly, none of the budget went into marketing, but the England and Wales Cricket Board believes spectators and a TV broadcast are areas of growth now that their dry run has worked. However, this event was never really about the wider cricketing public – it was about England’s inner sanctum. Strauss is committed to the venture for three years with the intention to broaden the playing base for the 2019 World Cup. It was for selectors and staff to get to know the next rung of players – whether on the field, over a beer or on the golf course – and for those players to appreciate the rigours of top‑level touring life. It was even to fuse the Lions and England programmes; the last time the Southern coaches Paul Farbrace and Andy Flower worked together was when playing in the same MCC team decades ago. Those wrapped up in the ultra-professional world of Team England took a peek into some of the chaotic corners of the county scene, such as the poor fielding, those who emerged from their winter hibernation sporting extra layers of insulation or the one who managed to miss the flight. The atmosphere was convivial but competitive and notes, you sensed, were constantly being taken. All those asked if they would like to play again agreed it had been an exercise with which it was worth persisting. Strauss will assess how the next two years will work, but he is not wedded to the United Arab Emirates as the venue (the Caribbean is an option) or that it has to be March; indeed, England’s tour of New Zealand this time next year may preclude the involvement of Trevor Bayliss, for whom it is most valuable, and his coaching team. There is hope that the 2019 edition could be played in the months leading up to the World Cup, with most or all of England’s first-choice players available. The cricket was intense, if at times one-sided, and certainly a step up from an average game in the unloved Royal London One-Day Cup. Generally, those closest to the England team – such as Toby Roland-Jones and Strauss’s official man of the series, Liam Dawson, who was superb with bat and ball and looks set to push Moeen Ali’s Champions Trophy place very hard – showed their class. With the bat, Ben Duckett flickered and Dawid Malan was wonderfully authoritative while Steven Finn bowled with rhythm and Mark Wood improved markedly in his second game, bowling with pace and snarl. Tim Bresnan showed what an estimable cricketer he is. For Bayliss, who knows so little of county cricket, there was a chance for a first viewing of Daniel Bell-Drummond, who followed up 92 in the first game with a composed 81 here, as well as Liam Livingstone and Tom Curran, who have had winters of such promise with the Lions, and Sam Northeast, a county star ignored by England since the Under‑19s. Bayliss will follow this up by, for the first time, spending the first few weeks of the county season touring the shires assessing contenders; there will be plenty more familiar faces now. All of this, as many players astutely observed, only matters if James Whittaker and the selectors pick the best performers. It would be a surprise, now, if Curran and Livingstone do not make ODI debuts against Ireland in the first week of May. We should expect, too, a whole raft of newbies in the long summer’s last task, the ODI series against West Indies which, bafflingly, finishes with a day-nighter six miles from Southampton on 29 September. A month later England will have landed in Australia for the Ashes, which seems reason enough to rest plenty of all-formatters. The poverty of West Indies’ performances this month suggests second-stringers would find it a fruitful series and another opportunity to stake a claim for 2019. One of those should be Crane, whose four wickets in the last game – having taken some tap in Dubai – trumped excellent performances from the North’s spinners, Graeme White and Josh Poysden. The North were cruising at 146 for two when Crane – fresh from his historic stint with New South Wales – intervened, bowling Sam Hain (round the legs) and Joe Clarke (pitching on leg and taking the top of off) with consecutive balls. Jack Leaning and Livingstone, deceived in the flight and stumped, were left baffled too. There were so many questions at the start, but Crane provided exactly the kind of answer Strauss was after."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2017/mar/22/coalition-may-split-omnibus-bill-to-get-childcare-reforms-past-senate-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T05:51:39Z","webTitle":"Sussan Ley found to have breached travel rules once in three-and-a-half years – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2017/mar/22/coalition-may-split-omnibus-bill-to-get-childcare-reforms-past-senate-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2017/mar/22/coalition-may-split-omnibus-bill-to-get-childcare-reforms-past-senate-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Sussan Ley found to have breached travel rules once in three-and-a-half years – as it happened","bodyText":"The day began with the PM and senior minister at a childcare centre. This is because the government split their omnibus bill – the political artifice to tie a generally good childcare package to unpalatable welfare cuts. Overnight, it was made clear that the bill would be split up (as it was originally) in order to get the childcare package through. The cuts would be put through in a separate bill. The rest of the cuts, some of which stretch back to the 2014 Abbott budget, will be held in abeyance. They include measures like the four-week wait for the dole, which the social services minister, Christian Porter, was eager to point out had not been dumped but rather parked. Nick Xenophon and Pauline Hanson are in negotiations with the government over the package. Their parties both supported changing Senate sitting hours to deal with the bills so presumably they are getting close to a deal. Sussan Ley released the finance investigation that found she only breached travel rules once in three-and-a-half years and paid it back. She said she was not complaining but merely releasing the report and allowing people to draw their own conclusions. In the federation, Ley said: “Regardless of these facts, the public impression was cast. I can understand the facts can get lost in the search for a good story.” That was why she resigned from the ministry, Ley said. The industry and science minister, Arthur Sinodinos, said marriage equality should be settled in this parliamentary term as the Liberal MP and campaigner Warren Entsch welcomed Peter Dutton’s attempts to land a solution behind the scenes. Why would an anti-marriage equality conservative do such a thing? Machiavelli might suggest to own the process ahead of Labor but nothing has actually been confirmed on the record by PDuddy. The bill to amend 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act will be introduced but not debated in the Senate shortly. Li Keqiang, the premier of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China, and Madame Cheng Hong will visit parliament tomorrow. That is your lot for the evening. Thanks to Gareth Hutchens, Paul Karp, Katharine Murphy and Mike Bowers. Thanks for your company today and see you on the morrow. Goodnight. I will just clean up some photos but what I am really waiting for is the 18C bill to come into the Senate. This week it has been Old Members Central, with Wyatt Roy, Mary Jo Fisher and serial enthusiast Bruce Billson. Question time is over and now I can address the former health minister Sussan Ley. I missed this statement which was in the Federation chamber, a secondary chamber. Julia Holman of the ABC reports: An independent report into all of Liberal MP Sussan Ley’s work travel expenses has found she breached the rules once over a three-and-a-half year period. The former health minister was forced to step down from her position in the cabinet earlier this year following revelations she bought an $800,000 apartment during a work trip to the Gold Coast. The independent report, conducted and released today by the finance department, found the sole breach of the rules occurred when Ms Ley used a government-funded car to take her from her hotel to the apartment. The trip lasted about five minutes. Prior to her resignation as a minister, there were other claims she had breached the rules, including billing taxpayers to attend two New Year’s Eve events hosted by a prominent Queensland businesswoman and donor, and piloting a plane when other, less-expensive options were available. But the report found Ms Ley did not breach the rules in any of those instances. Plibersek to Turnbull: The former PM, the member for Warringah, cut billions from schools. Why is this PM continuing with the $30bn cut to schools at the same time as he’s giving a $50bn tax cut to big business? Turnbull repeats the standard line about record funding for schools, which of course it is because school funding is indexed. (The school funding agreements for the next two years, years five and six of the former Gillard agreements, have yet to be revealed.) Brendan O’Connor to Turnbull: Why is it when the Commonwealth Bank reports a record half-year profit of $4.9bn he wants to cut company tax and, when there is a record low wages growth, he wants to give workers a pay cut? Turnbull says the law is now optional for Labor and the union movement. Having a long and distinguished career in the union movement, the honourable member would say what a fundamental issue and principle it was for the Labor party to defend the independent umpire in setting wages and conditions. But not any longer, because now in line with the new ideological leader of the Labor movement, Sally McManus ... the law is optional for trade unions, apparently. The PM follows on in that vein and takes a comment from Labor that he is obsessed. I’m obsessed, am I? We’re obsessed about the law. We’re obsessed about obeying the law. We’re obsessed about integrity. We’re obsessed about ensuring that the members of the unions you claim to represent are represented honestly and fairly and with the respect and the diligence that they deserve and you have failed them. Peter Dutton gets a question on border policy all about the CFMEU. Elsewhere, I hope this meeting on the floor relates to the endangered swift parrot. Shorten to Turnbull: Approximately 323,000 people are employed in the club, restaurant, cafe, hair and beauty industries. Can the PM guarantee that these workers will not have their pay cut because of the precedent set by the penalty rates decision which the PM supported. And will the PM make a submission to the Fair Work Commission to protect the penalty rates of workers in these industries? Turnbull makes the point that Bill Shorten and Brendan O’Connor had previously agreed to abide by the Fair Work Commission on penalty rates. No one can complain that the opposition’s question time strategy doesn’t have a lot of variety. Leaping from one topic to another. No plan for childcare. No plan for energy. No plan for question time. Christian Porter is obviously expecting a big question time. Dreyfus to Turnbull: On Sky News last night, Andrew Bolt was asked how many insults would constitute harassment under the PM’s new laws, which give licence to racist hate speech. Mr Bolt replied, “Let’s say five.” Given the government has cited Andrew Bolt as a reason for watering down race hate protections, is it the intention of the government that Australians must be subject to five separate instances of racist abuse before before it constitutes harassment? Turnbull says the bill specifically states that a single act can constitute harassment. He says the law on sexual harassment establishes that a single act can constitute harassment for that area too. It is expressly stated in the bill. Tony Burke to Turnbull: Is the PM aware that while speaking about the government’s watering down of protections against racist hate speech, One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts said he’s very happy the government is starting to follow One Nation. And a Liberal senator said it would help win back One Nation votes. Was it One Nation or the conservative backbench who convinced the PM to abandon his long-held beliefs and instead to water down protections against racist hate speech or was it both? The PM is getting shouty. He says he has long been a supporter of free speech and it is not right that Bill Leak should be hauled into the Human Rights Commission. He quotes “great Labor figure” Jim Spigelman and others who support change. The language of that section lost its credibility a long time ago. He continues shouting well after his mike is turned off. Bowen to Morrison: Will the government’s full $50bn worth of corporate tax cuts that were in the 2016 budget be in the 2017 budget? Morrison: If the member opposite wants to support corporate tax cuts that he has long supported, then vote for them. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: I refer to the government’s centrepiece $50bn handout to big business. Today in question time the treasurer said the government would not recoil from its company tax cut. Does the treasurer guarantee that the full $50bn handout will remain on the books in the budget? Morrison says the Labor shadow, Chris Bowen, has nominated a cut to company tax to 25%. I refer you to the comments of the shadow treasurer who said this in 2015, he said it’s a statement of fact which I agree with, ‘I have previously said the nation should be aiming for a 25% corporate tax rate’. It’s all lined up, mate. All you have to do is come into this place and vote for it and you’ll hit it. Morrison says Bowen knows its the right policy but had to bend his “desperately populist” leader who is just a “sucking vacuum”. The social services minister, Christian Porter, raises Labor’s characterisation of the pause to indexation on family tax benefits, contained in the Xenophon deal over omnibus bill, as a “sledgehammer”. He reads a list of past Labor freezes. Labor, July 2009, reduced the indexation of family tax benefit part A from the pension rate down to CPI. Not pausing, reducing. Labor, 2009, paused the higher income threshold for FTB, saving $1.4bn over three years. Labor paused the indexation of the FTB part A and part B supplements for three years in 2011. Labor paused the indexation for the income threshold for two years in July, 2012. Labor paused the indexation of the higher income threshold for three years. None of those were sledgehammer blows. None of them. And none of the money was spent on reforms in childcare. Independent Andrew Wilkie to the environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg: Regrettably the Tasmanian government is pursuing legislation to allow logging in 356,000ha of protected forests. These forests contain large areas of habitat that are critical to the survival of nationally listed threatened species, wildlife that the minister’s responsible for protecting. Can the minister outline what steps he’s taking to prevent damage to this habitat, including for the critically endangered swift parrot and the giant freshwater lobster? Can the minister update the house on the Tasmania government’s response to the freshwater lobster recovery plan, which proposes permanently reserving 30,000ha of the publicly owned reserves that are now proposed for logging by the Tasmanian government. Frydenberg says the government appointed the first-ever threatened species commissioner, Gregory Andrews, who has been able to galvanise more than $210m, including $150m to prevent habitat destruction. The Coalition launched the first-ever threatened species strategy. He says the regional forest agreements have been in place for some two decades and they work well because balance will be required. Jenny Macklin to Turnbull: Given the treasurer has overseen linking the childcare package to cuts to family payments, the delay of the childcare changes, linking the omnibus bill to budget repair, then the childcare changes, finally to the NDIS, before today splitting the childcare changes and family payment cuts. Does the PM continue to have confidence in his treasurer? Turnbull says he is doing an outstanding job. You have probably caught up with this but AAP reports: Former Howard government minister Peter Reith is in hospital after a “serious medical emergency”. Mr Reith is due to challenge Michael Kroger for the Victorian Liberal party presidency at the state council on April 1. “Our thoughts and prayers are with Peter Reith who was this morning hospitalised following a serious medical emergency,” Victorian Liberal leader Matthew Guy said on Wednesday. Shorten to Turnbull: 1.5 million families will have their payments cut. Millions of children will be worse off because of the PM’s decision today. Why is the PM pitting families against each other, robbing Peter to pay Paul and leaving 1.5 million families worse off? Turnbull says Labor has no alternative plan and the opposition should be supporting the childcare reforms. First government question is on the government’s childcare and energy policies. Shorten to Turnbull: I refer to the PM’s new social services bill introduced into the Senate today. Can the PM confirm that every cut to families and vulnerable Australians in this bill is lifted directly from the Abbott government’s 2014 budget. Labor has fought these cuts everyday since then, defending pensioners and families. When will the PM stop recycling cuts from the 2014 budget and stop hurting families? Turnbull says Labor has no plans for childcare at all. Then he riffs on childcare and the union corrupting payments bill but not the welfare cuts bill. Labor asks him to come to the welfare bill. Speaker Smith says he is sure that the PM is coming to it but it was a broad question. A family earning less than $55,000 a year would only pay around $15 for childcare. And a family earning $50,000 a year with two children in daycare would be more than $3,000 a year better off. You’d think Labor would support that. Question time coming up people. Grab a beverage. The other interesting bits from Arthur Sinodinos’ questions. He won’t respond to speculation on the government splitting or ditching of the company tax cuts. The government is trying to keep its promises. Asked about same sex marriage, he said: I think it would be good for that to be settled, if possible, in this parliament. He doesn’t really answer a question on the Coalition government having initially no science minister and then four different ministers, coupled with low spending on science and research and development, except to say company tax cuts will help. Sinodinos: One of the reasons we want to cut tax is precisely to encourage investment, business investment. That will also include investment in R &amp; D, over and above what we do in the R &amp; D tax incentive. Someone asks about science advisors in ministerial office which Sinodinos notes happens in some countries. Sinodinos: You can have the best advice in the world but you have got to meld it with things you face politically. What people have said or not said in the past, we are all the prisoners of what we have said. I may have said something now that will rebound and out the room and once it is gone, it is out there. But the point is, where possible and we can’t be a technocracy, ruled by clinical technical advice because at the end of the day, you have got to take people with you. And lastly, he was questioned by former diplomat Peter Phillips on Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership and its shelf life. I think his leadership is actually quite secure. And I think that the honesty he’s shown in tackling some difficult issues since he got the job has been fantastic to watch. And yes, there have been some hard moments but things we’ve done, like in the superannuation space, which are not easy because they affect in large part, our own base, mean that we can say to the community, when we’re asking you to do something, we’re not exempting the big end of town or our own base. I think he deserves real marks for that. Arthur Sinodinos is asked, given your presentation on the importance of science and facts, will you lead the push back on climate change? (Not in so many words.) From my point of view, I don’t see we have turned our back on climate science in that context. What we do, particularly through the good work of [former minister] Greg Hunt working with [CSIRO] Larry Marshall, we make sure our science capability is protected and it will provide its own input in terms of basic climate science information. The industry minister, Arthur Sinodinos, has started taking questions. First up is a question for scientists getting their message to government. It is an interesting lesson in lobbying generally. Deal with the government of the day but develop relationships across both sides of politics and, if necessary, with the crossbench as well. The important thing is the government today may be the opposition of tomorrow. If the Senate is the Senate, there are crossbenchers who will be influential for some time. Relate what you do to the groups you are talking to and don’t limit the groups you are talking to and try to develop a relationship rather than a one-night stand. When you are looking to lobby Canberra, relate what you do it the objectives of the government of the day, use their language. If you are dealing with Shorten and Carr, you go through their manifestos and work out, OK, how can I pitch what I am doing that is relative to the aims and objectives of this government? In the case of the prime minister, are there areas they are interested in that I can push their buttons? Or do I know people who are influential with the prime minister or the cabinet minister who carry credibility and can go in there and say, ‘Look, Malcolm, or Julia, I have had a good look and ... the Yanks are out to use this’. The things politicians love is to say, ‘I did this and it was best in class, best in the world, and whatever.’ The government has split the omnibus bill into two sections: the $1.2bn childcare package and the social services package ($2bn welfare cuts). The Senate had a fiery debate in which the government succeeded in forcing the Senate to sit until the omnibus/childcare bill is passed. That means this week. Conservative and immigration minister Peter Dutton is trying to broker a solution on same-sex marriage in this term of government so that the Coalition can control the process rather than Labor. Malcolm Turnbull has introduced the bill to ban “corrupting payments” between unions and employers. Bill Shorten attempted to debate 18C in the lower house but lost on the numbers, as expected. Arthur Sinodinos is delivering a speech on the importance of science and #facts at the National Press Club. Digital disruption is here to stay. We are expecting the 18C bill to come to Senate at 3.30 after question time but it won’t be debated today because of the childcare bill. Here is the list of the corrupting benefits bill, announced on Monday. This is from the explanatory memo. The bill responds to TURC report recommendations 40, 41 and 48 by amending the act to: make it a criminal offence to give a registered organisation, or a person associated with a registered organisation a corrupting benefit; make it a criminal offence to receive or solicit a corrupting benefit; make it a criminal offence for a national system employer other than an employee organisation to provide, offer or promise to provide any cash or in kind payment, other than certain legitimate payments to an employee organisation or its prohibited beneficiaries; make it a criminal offence to solicit, receive, obtain or agree or obtain any such prohibited payment; require bargaining representatives for a proposed enterprise agreement (employers, employer organisations, and unions) to disclose financial benefits that the bargaining representative, or a person or body reasonably connected with it, would or could reasonably be expected to derive because of a term of the proposed agreement. Failure to comply with these requirements can give rise to civil remedies, but will not preclude the approval of the enterprise agreement. Disclosure of financial benefits obtained as a consequence of enterprise bargaining is intended to improve transparency and ensure that employees who are asked to vote for an enterprise agreement are properly informed about its effect. Sounds like the government is saving the four-week wait for the dole measure in the bottom drawer. Turnbull says such these deals have the real potential to corrupt employers and unions and disadvantage workers. Turnbull is outlining the history of the Australian Workers Union (Shorten’s old union) to illustrate the need for his bill. Malcolm Turnbull introduces the bill to ban “corrupting” payments. The social services bill has landed. Just on childcare, Julie Doyle of the ABC did a very good explainer on the government’s package last month. It does this: Currently the government provides two payments to families to help with childcare costs: the means-tested childcare benefit and the childcare rebate, which is not means-tested. The proposal is to create one means-tested payment instead, called the childcare subsidy. I’m so glad I am not the only one flying blind this morn. Negotiations continue on the bill. Nick Xenophon is now speaking on the social services legislation. He is supporting a compromise on the welfare cuts in order to get the childcare package through. He says his concerns related to measures which would have: abolished the pensioner education supplement reduced from 26 to six weeks the period during which age pension and other payments with unlimited portability can be paid outside Australia at the means-tested rate; cut the energy supplement for those on of welfare payments or concession cards from 20 September 2017. We assume those elements are no longer there but there is no bill on the senate site yet. Xenophon says reluctantly, he has agreed to freezing indexation in family tax benefits for two years. This is not ideal but, in my view, this is the least worst option ... the alternative would have been a stalemate, the alternative would be a childcare package held up. I believe this bill is a significant improvement. The childcare bill passes the house. The Senate continues to debate the social services bill. The irrepressible C.Pyne The lower house is now voting on the childcare bill, ready to be punted up to the Senate. You would have seen the news that the UK government has announced a sweeping cabin ban on laptops and tablets on inbound flights from six countries, following a similar move by the US on Monday. The UK ban on any electronic item larger than a normal smartphone applies to all direct passenger flights from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia. Six UK airlines – British Airways, EasyJet, Jet2, Monarch, Thomas Cook and Thomson – and eight foreign carriers are affected. The Australian government has confirmed there are no plans to introduce a similar rule here. Peter Dutton, fancy meeting you here. That Bowers is always in the right place at the right time. The government leader in the Senate, George Brandis, has read a list of savings contained in the new social services legislation which contains the new savings being presented to the house. He says it is the government’s intention to secure both the social services bill and the childcare bill through the Senate this week. I would like to acknowledge the positive way in which the crossbench has worked with the government to deliver this significant reform package that will make a real and positive difference to 1 million Australian families. I commend the bill to the Senate. In recent days there have been reports that Peter Dutton and Mathias Cormann back a voluntary postal plebiscite on marriage equality, which Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman has argued would appear “tricky and sneaky”. On Wednesday Liberal MP Warren Entsch told Guardian Australia: “I commend [Dutton] for looking at options. I welcome the acknowledgement that something needs to be done.” I’ll work with him. To me, it’s not a matter of should we or shouldn’t we [deal with marriage equality], it’s a question of how. If we can find a way that we can get this matter dealt with with the maximum cooperation and participation, I think we can get a level of civility in the debate. People don’t have to change their views about whether they support it or not, it’s how we develop [a process to resolve it]. Entsch said his own position was clear: “I would rather have had a [free] vote a long time ago ... That has always been my position.” Labor Senate leader Penny Wong. Unplugged. That is not orderly dispatch of business of the Senate. That is a secret deal to take money off Australian families and that they’re not even prepared to demonstrate it to the Senate. We still haven’t seen the bill. The bill that the crossbenchers have agreed to bring on for debate we haven’t even seen. That’s no way to run the Senate. I am not going to descend to the sort of personal innuendo that this leader of the government uses as his stock-in-trade. I will just say this: in that speech we saw again why no one in this place likes him, because he is unable to have a political debate that does not offend, or impugn the personal motivations of other senators. He can’t debate the issues. So let’s be clear: this is an hours motion to rush through a secret deal, to come in here to the Senate, upend the order of business, suspend standing orders because we have to rush through and immediately debate other cuts to social security, other cuts to what families get that we haven’t even seen. It is an extraordinary proposition, and it is a deal that has been done in secret. And I have to say to the crossbench, as I have said previously to Senator Hanson and to others in this place: I may disagree with what your policy position is, but you are entitled to negotiate with the government on policy. But I fundamentally disagree with the way you are walking over the way this Senate should operate. Labor loses the attempt to bring on a bill to protect penalty rates. So Brandis introduces the original omnibus bill. This is confusing because we know the bill will be split. Which must mean Brandis will do legislative surgery on the floor of the Senate. Now that the government is splitting the omnibus welfare bill, Pauline Hanson’s chief of staff, James Ashby, has told Guardian Australia that cuts to family tax benefit A and B are dealbreakers for One Nation. On Tuesday One Nation threatened to block the bill and gave the government 24 hours to make changes. Ashby said that further negotiations and changes are needed on the pension because “we don’t want to see pensioners lose their entitlements”. At the same time we recognise those that live 20 weeks a year outside the country are obviously collecting the pension and sometimes living in countries where they can get two pensions. We want to have a look at that in greater detail. Ashby said Hanson supports paid parental leave but is concerned that mothers who work one day a week get paid the equivalent of a full-time wage for the 20-week period they take leave. She’s got no issue paying them for the time they’ve taken off. I’ve you’ve worked one day a week for the last 12 months, you should get paid eight hours a week [when on paid parental leave], don’t top it up to a 38-hour week for the sake of topping it up. One Nation supports changes to the dole to encourage Australians to pick fruit. Penny Wong is cranky. She has moved a suspension motion to bring in a bill which would protect penalty rates. Labor is offering this up to force Nick Xenophon and Pauline Hanson to vote against a bill which would protect penalty rates. Wong says One Nation is just a rightwing faction of the Liberal party. Senator George Brandis says jump and senator Hanson says how high. Wong goes on to talk about the effect of penalty rate cuts on low-paid workers, migrants and women and Brandis heckles. This sneering laughing from the leader of the government in the Senate is a disgrace because he has never cared for low-paid workers. There is a lot of shouting and heckling. Democracy in action. George Brandis has won the right to move his sitting hours motion. The hours motion relates to both the omnibus bill and a bill before the lower house right now. The lower house is considering the family assistance legislation amendment (jobs for families child care package) bill 2016. Think of this as the childcare bill. It will go to the Senate soon-ish. There will also be a grab bag social services (welfare cuts) bill. We don’t know what this is or what it will be called at this stage. We understand the government proposes to deal with the welfare cuts bill first. All things liable to change without notice. The Senate is now voting. The Nick Xenophon Team is supporting the hours motion. While he has not agreed to a deal on the omnibus, they must be close to a deal to support the suspension. The Labor senator Katy Gallagher is hooking into the crossbenchers, suggesting the welfare cuts are cruel. Now the communications minister, Mitch Fifield, says, as Mathias Cormann did before him, that it is a little rich to suggest that you don’t know what the measures are. To suggest: We have never met these measures before, they are newborns, they have transmogrified into newborns. The government is moving: (1) That the following bill may be introduced immediately and considered in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this resolution: Social services legislation amendment bill 2017. (2) That the family assistance legislation amendment (jobs for families child care package) bill 2016 be considered after the bill mentioned in paragraph (1), in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this resolution. (3) If by 7.20 pm today, the bills listed above have not been finally considered then: (a) The hours of meeting for today shall be 9.30 am to not later than midnight; (b) The routine of business from not later than 7.20pm shall be consideration of the bills listed above; and (c) the Senate shall adjourn without debate after it has finally considered the bills or at midnight, whichever is the earlier. (4) If by 2 pm on Thursday, 23 March 2017, the bills listed above have not been finally considered then: (a) The hours of meeting for that day shall be 9.30am to not later than midnight; (b) The routine of business from not later than 6pm shall be consideration of the bills listed above; (c) Divisions may take place after 4.30pm; and (d) The Senate shall adjourn without debate after it has finally considered the bills listed above or at midnight, whichever is the earlier. (5) If by midnight on Thursday, 23 March 2017 the bills listed above have not been finally considered then the Senate shall meet on Friday, 24 March 2017, and: (a) The hours of meeting shall be 9am to adjournment; (b) The routine of business shall be consideration of the bills listed above; and (c) The Senate shall adjourn without debate after it has finally considered the bills listed above, or a motion for the adjournment is moved by a minister, whichever is the earlier. (6) Once the bills listed above have been finally considered, the order of the day relating to the social services legislation amendment (omnibus savings and child care reform) bill 2017 shall be discharged from the notice paper. The numbers usually tell the story. If the government are moving an hours motion, it means they have the numbers to change the sitting hours for the omnibus bill. Unknown crossbenchers will only support the sitting change if they support the bill for which it is required. That is why a simple debate on parliamentary sitting hours is relevant. The lower house is voting to gag Bill Shorten. Meanwhile, in the Senate Penny Wong is railing about a move by George Brandis to extend the sitting hours to ram the omnibus bill (in whatever form/s) through the Senate. The Brandis motion would extend the sitting hours of the Senate until midnight Thursday and into Friday. Wong is saying obviously the government has done a deal with the crossbenchers to make the cuts needed for the childcare package. Penny Wong points out Labor has not even seen the legislation. Bill Shorten is seeking leave to suspend standing orders. Speaker Tony Smith is adjudicating because Christopher Pyne is moving a motion as well. He is trying to use the wisdom of Solomon and may well cut the baby in half. After delicate negotiations, the Speaker tells Pyne to sit and wait. Askance looks are given and Labor’s Catherine King yells, “that’s a reflection on the chair”. Bill Shorten moves a motion on 18C. The purpose of the motion is for Labor to point out the PM is introducing the 18C bill in the Senate. Given the 18C bill has not enough Senate support, if the government puts the bill in the Senate and it dies, it protects their Liberal lower house MPs in diverse ethnic seats from being seen to vote for the bill. Turnbull was asked about this yesterday and he said, nonsense. It is the attorney general’s bill so it will go to the Senate first. This is often the case but not always the case. It is more likely to be a way to protect his members. The houses are opening. There are a large number of senior Labor people in the house. Unusual. Stay tuned. Shorten was asked if he ever expected Peter Dutton to be the minister making the case for marriage equality? I never expected him to be a serious contender to replace Malcolm Turnbull, so we live in a surprising world. But, again, it doesn’t matter if it is on section 18C or marriage equality, their whole logic about marriage equality is about, “we need to get the votes, not Labor”/ It is not about Labor or Liberal. It is about the right of people to get on and marry the people they love. This is a government that is talking about some postal vote, nonbinding, using the snail mail – I mean, this is an opinion poll? Bill Shorten has just visited a Gonski rally out the front of parliament and was asked about the omnibus bill. He is being equally coy about Labor’s plans. I think this is what you might call a moveable feast. Q: If the bills are split, will you support any savings? Let’s wait and see what they’ll do. This government changes their position between breakfast and lunch, don’t they? The other thing on today is a speech by Arthur Sinodinos at the press club. Katharine Murphy reported on the theme of his speech for the Science Meets Parliament fest which happens every year. This is where a whole lot of scientists come to parliament to remind certain people that science is important, it needs to be funded and is not a bunch of feelpinions. (I’m looking at you Malcolm Roberts.) The innovation minister, Arthur Sinodinos, says disruption is the new constant as we enter the fourth industrial revolution and, if Australia doesn’t acknowledge change, we risk “being overwhelmed and disadvantaged by it”. Sinodinos will use a speech at the National Press Club on Wednesday to hit back at recent criticism from the tech entrepreneur Mike Cannon-Brookes, the cofounder of Atlassian, that the Turnbull government has dialled down its once surround-sound commitment to innovation. The minister will also warn an emerging lack of respect for experts and for scientific method, and the substitution of ideology for evidence, is a disturbing trend that needs to be countered by more research and by more innovative thinking. “We see the conclusions of experts being cast aside, in favour of ideological positions and selective use of facts,” Sinodinos will tell the press club. “Denying the threat of climate change is a well-worn example; however, rejecting vaccinations – at the risk of children’s lives and public health – resurfaced just this month. “The only credible response to these positions is scientific fact. And more research and more innovative thinking.” In a strange story designed to mess with my mind, Matthew Knott over at Fairfax reports the immigration minister and arch conservative Peter Dutton is working behind the scenes to help Turnbull legalise same-sex marriage in this term so Labor does not get to do it. Fairfax Media can also reveal he said privately it was inevitable that same-sex marriage would become law in Australia so it would be better for the Coalition, rather than Labor, to control the process. This would ensure there would be maximum protections for religious freedom in any legislation. The forcefulness of Mr Dutton’s attack on corporate chief executives last week – in which he told them to “stick to their knitting” – has aroused suspicion among some colleagues who believed he was committed to achieving a breakthrough on the issue. Mr Dutton’s actions are increasingly viewed through a leadership prism given he has been touted as a potential replacement for Mr Turnbull if the polls don’t improve. Turnbull was asked “Is Peter Dutton secretly negotiating for gay marriage behind the scenes?” Our position on that matter is very clear. The obstacle to same-sex marriage being lawful in Australia is Bill Shorten. We went to the election with a policy for a plebiscite which would give every Australian a say, a plebiscite, I might say, that Mr Shorten himself had supported only three years ago, but on so many things he has done a backflip. He is inconsistent, has no regard to what he said in the past and yet again ... he has done a switch and he is the one that is denying same-sex couples the right to marry. Goulburn and the New South Wales central coast have been nominated by assistant immigration minister Alex Hawke as areas to send new migrants. The Daily Telegraph reports: Send migrants bush to rein in Sydney house prices: government Sharri Markson reports Hawke says its a “key priority” for the Turnbull government to find ways to encourage migrants to settle outside of Sydney, where house prices have risen by 16% over the past year. While the government recognises that Sydney will still be an attractive destination for migration, we are looking to work with state governments and regional governments to partner with them to see what could attract migrants to other regional centres. That means employment prospects and the right infrastructure. There are no concrete plans in the story apart from talking to state governments. Here is another answer to the question on splitting the bill ... Q: Prime minister, are you cutting up the omnibus bill? Well, as Senator Birmingham has said, we continue our discussions with the crossbench. We’ve had a lot of success in the past in circumstances where even members of the press gallery have predicted that we would have no success, so we will continue our negotiations and discussions but the important thing is that these are very valuable reforms are supported and we seek the support of Senate for them. I’m loving Xavier. Good morning blogans, Trying to nail down the government’s plans this morning is like chasing butterflies. From Mike Bowers’ fabulous pictures, you can see the issue du jour is childcare. And that is because the big fat omnibus bill sits on the Senate agenda in the No 1 spot at 9am. Labor, the Greens and the majority of the crossbenchers cannot live with the welfare cuts which have been nominated to pay for the childcare reform package. As you may have seen last night, Pauline Hanson has worked out since the Western Australian election preference deal, that cosying up to major parties is probs not a good look. Paul Karp reported: In a statement on Tuesday Hanson linked the proposed welfare cuts in the omnibus bill to the issue of multinational tax avoidance, saying the government needs to realise companies must “pay their way ... before those with the least are asked to tighten their belts”. This morning, the ABC and Sky are reporting the omnibus bill will be split, though those exact words have not fallen out of any minister’s mouth. To underline the need for the Senate to negotiate, Malcolm Turnbull, the education minister, Simon Birmingham, and Canberra senator Zed Seselja have been visiting local sandpits to hang out with kiddies. Asked repeatedly why he would not split the bill if the Senate had said nyet, Turnbull said the media had predicted the demise of bills in the past. Wait and see. Time will tell. We are focused on results and outcomes and we found the best way to negotiate with the crossbench is to negotiate directly with them rather than through the pages and screens of the media. Notwithstanding his coyness, the childcare package is worth $1.6bn so the speculation is that the childcare bit and most palatable welfare cuts will be split into a separate bill. The welfare savings include cuts to family tax benefits. The other issue that hangs around like a fish in the sun is section 18C. Yesterday, the government unveiled changes to remove insult, offend and humiliate as offences and insert harass. That also looks doomed in the Senate and the prime minister was pressed on that too, this morning. Why bring it on when no one likes it? Why did you change your mind on it, having said five times prior to the election that you had no plans to change it? What we said before the election was that we did not have any plans to change 18C and that was absolutely true. So again, as a guardian of the truth, you should be more careful with the language you attribute to me. Any other questions? Let’s get cracking. It is going to be a long day and all eyes will be on the Senate. Talk to me in the thread or on the Twits @gabriellechan or Facebook. Mike Bowers is in the sandpit and you can reach him @mpbowers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2017/mar/21/neil-gorsuch-hearing-legal-mentor-gay-sex-bestiality","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T20:51:12Z","webTitle":"Neil Gorsuch distances himself from mentor who compared gay sex to bestiality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/mar/21/neil-gorsuch-hearing-legal-mentor-gay-sex-bestiality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/mar/21/neil-gorsuch-hearing-legal-mentor-gay-sex-bestiality","fields":{"headline":"Neil Gorsuch distances himself from mentor who compared gay sex to bestiality","bodyText":"Judge Neil Gorsuch, Donald Trump’s nominee for the supreme court, was forced to distance himself on Tuesday from a series of controversial comments made by his doctoral supervisor, a conservative Catholic scholar, during a testy exchange on the second day of his confirmation hearing in the US Senate. Gorsuch studied for a doctorate at Oxford University under the supervision of the renowned natural law professor John Finnis, who once compared same-sex relations to bestiality and warned of “reverse colonization” in Europe. Under questioning from the Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin, who quoted repeatedly from an article published by the Guardian in February that first brought attention to Finnis’s comments and his relationship with Gorsuch, the judge was asked whether his former supervisor’s remarks were something “we should condemn or congratulate”. Gorsuch responded: “I’ve been blessed with some wonderful professors, and I didn’t agree with everything they said, and I wouldn’t expect them to agree with everything I’ve said.” Durbin had compared a 2009 paper authored by Finnis, in which the scholar suggested that England’s population had “largely given up … bearing children at a rate consistent with their community’s medium-term survival”, with comments made last week by the Republican congressman Steve King, who tweeted in support of the far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders: “We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.” Gorsuch told the senator he had not read the 2009 paper in question and added: “I’m not here to answer for Mr King or for Professor Finnis.” Gorsuch studied under Finnis as part of a Marshall scholarship at Oxford between 1992 and 1994, eventually receiving his doctorate in 2004. At Tuesday’s confirmation hearing, Gorsuch described his mentor as a “very generous teacher”, adding: “I remember sitting next to the fire in his Oxford office; it was like something out of Harry Potter.” He confirmed the two had stayed in contact since and last saw each other “a couple of years ago”. Durbin also asked Gorsuch to distinguish his views on same-sex relationships from those of his former supervisor, who, around the same time he taught Gorsuch, compared gay sex to bestiality. Finnis articulated this comparison in his role as an expert witness for the state of Colorado during a 1993 lawsuit to block a voter initiative that would have prevented the state from protecting gay, lesbian and bisexual people from discrimination. Colorado’s solicitor general asked Finnis to provide a philosophical defense of the voter initiative. Finnis obliged by calling same-sex relationships “deeply hostile” to people “who are willing to commit themselves to real marriage”. “Copulation of humans with animals is repudiated because it … treats human bodily life, in one of its most intense activities, as merely animal,” Finnis wrote, according to contemporary reports. “The deliberate genital coupling of persons of the same sex is repudiated for a very similar reason.” Durbin asked Gorsuch if he was aware of Finnis’s involvement in the lawsuit, which was eventually heard in the supreme court, or of Finnis’s controversial testimony. “This is a man who apparently had an impact on your life, certainly your academic life,” Durbin said. “I’m trying to figure out where we can parse his views from your views [and] what impact he has on you today with his views.” Gorsuch replied that he knew Finnis had testified, but he couldn’t recall if he had known the specifics of Finnis’s testimony or deposition. “I’ve been a lawyer and a judge for 25 or 30 years,” Gorsuch said. “That’s my record, and I guess I’d ask you, respectfully, to look at my credentials and my record.” A terse exchange followed in which Durbin pressed Gorsuch to articulate his views on LGBT rights. Gorsuch’s judicial record contains few hints about how he regards issues such as same-sex marriage and transgender rights, although he has criticized what he sees as the use of the judiciary to enact societal change. “What about LGBTQ individuals?” Durbin asked. Gorsuch replied: “What about them?” He continued: “I’ve tried to treat each case and each person as a person, not a this-kind-of-person, not a that-kind-of-person. A person.” Without giving his own thoughts on the court’s ruling, Gorsuch noted that the supreme court already “has held that single-sex marriage is protected by the constitution”. On day two of Gorsuch’s confirmation hearing to fill the 13-month vacancy on the supreme court, the judge also faced questions arising from Trump’s campaign promise to nominate a justice hostile to Roe v Wade, the supreme court decision that established a right to abortion. In an October presidential debate, Trump said the court would “automatically” overturn Roe if he were elected, “because I am putting pro-life justices on the court”. On Tuesday, the Republican Lindsey Graham asked Gorsuch if Trump had asked him directly to overrule the 44-year precedent on abortion rights. “No, Senator,” Gorsuch said. If Trump had asked such a question, Gorsuch added, “I would have walked out the door. It’s not what judges do.” Gorsuch’s judicial record offers little direct evidence to suggest how he would rule on the issue of abortion rights. Still, neither side of the aisle seems to doubt that his jurisprudence on abortion rights will come to resemble that of his predecessor, the conservative justice Antonin Scalia. “Neil Gorsuch has all the makings of an extreme anti-abortion justice,” David S Cohen, a Drexel University law professor and a board member of the Abortion Care Network, told the Guardian after Trump named Gorsuch his nominee. “He is devoted to originalism, has decried using the courts for social change, and has protected the rights of religious Christians to impose their views on everyone else. “Whether he will vote to overturn Roe v Wade is unknown, but the signs don’t point in the right direction.” Conservatives who oppose abortion feel equally confident that Gorsuch would rule to limit abortion rights. “I look at his interpretive methodology and his character and it gives me great comfort,” said Ed Whelan, the president of the conservative thinktank the Ethics and Public Policy Center. “I feel comfortable about where he would end up on that case,” meaning a case that challenged Roe v Wade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/mar/21/the-guardian-view-on-labour-not-up-to-the-job","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T19:39:38Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Labour: not up to the job | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/21/the-guardian-view-on-labour-not-up-to-the-job","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/21/the-guardian-view-on-labour-not-up-to-the-job","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Labour: not up to the job","bodyText":"In last week’s Dutch general election, only 5.7% of the electorate voted for the Labour party; five years ago, its share was 25%. In France, opinion polls have the Socialist party’s presidential candidate averaging around 13%, compared with 29% in 2012. By such yardsticks, the UK Labour party’s 26% support level in this week’s Guardian ICM poll may not seem all that bad. If nothing else it is a reminder that Labour’s manifest problems are in some respects part of a more general slump and challenge for parties of the centre-left. But not in all respects. Such a slump is not an iron law of history. There is nothing predetermined about the centre-left’s decline. In Germany, the return of Martin Schulz as the Social Democratic party’s chancellor-candidate against Angela Merkel has reinvigorated Europe’s most important centre-left party after a long period of decline; the latest Insa-YouGov survey has the SPD in the lead. In Portugal, António Costa’s socialist coalition government continues to defy the doomsayers; Mr Costa’s socialists are currently averaging 40% in the polls. It remains possible, both in theory and practice, for centre-left parties with the right combination of imagination, credibility and good leadership to turn events in their countries to political advantage even in tough times. That ought to be happening in Britain with the Labour party. It palpably is not. This week’s Guardian-ICM poll spelled out the scale of the problem facing Labour. The Conservatives have a 19-point lead. If it was not for the standard ICM adjustment – which is designed to take account of the “shy Tory” factor – Labour would have recorded its worst score ever in the series. Almost every demographic prefers the Tories to Labour – by 41% to 29% among supposedly more leftwing 18- to 24-year-olds, with even unskilled manual workers in the DE grades tied. Labour prides itself on its principles, but the Tories are seen as the more “honest and reputable” party. Theresa May and Philip Hammond have a 33-point lead on economic competence over Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell – an increase on their pre-budget advantage. This last fact ought to flash a particularly bright warning light for Labour. Two weeks after a lacklustre budget whose most headline-grabbing measure fell apart within days, with the prime minister slapping down the chancellor, Labour has not dented the Tory lead at all. On the contrary, the lead has increased. On Tuesday inflation ticked upwards to 2.3%. Prices are now on a par with wages across the economy as a whole. This almost certainly marks a crossover point. Real incomes seem set to decline in the months ahead. This ought to be a moment for the opposition to hold the government’s feet to the fire. Instead, Mrs May commands the political landscape with ease. So what is Labour doing? As Britain heads for the EU exit door and Labour loses a byelection in a seat it has held for more than 80 years, much of its energy is focused not on the government but on its own factions. Mr McDonnell says the Labour right is attempting a soft coup. Tom Watson, the deputy leader, accuses Momentum and Unite of taking over the party. The hard left is the scene of bitter infighting. Unite’s Len McCluskey accuses Mr Watson of skullduggery, which is a fine charge from someone who didn’t need to put his union through a premature leadership contest. Labour seems bent on rerunning to the 1980s, only this time with the unions and the party’s big figures lacking the heart, the curiosity or the heft – and the command in Scotland – to pull it around. Labour isn’t necessarily in terminal decline. A quarter of voters still support it. But the decline is enormous and it can’t go on like this. Labour needs to revitalise its vision and values, rebuild a coalition of interests and find leaders to start turning the current failure around. It won’t do that by obsessing over internal issues. It requires a massive change of direction at the top. Right now, though, Labour simply isn’t up to the job."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/mar/21/berta-caceres-murder-honduras-juan-orlando-hernandez-dc","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T20:27:03Z","webTitle":"Protesters in DC confront Honduran president over Berta Cáceres murder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/berta-caceres-murder-honduras-juan-orlando-hernandez-dc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/mar/21/berta-caceres-murder-honduras-juan-orlando-hernandez-dc","fields":{"headline":"Protesters in DC confront Honduran president over Berta Cáceres murder","bodyText":"Supporters and family members of Berta Cáceres, the Honduran environmental and indigenous rights activist who was assassinated last year, have confronted the country’s president in Washington to demand an independent investigation of her murder. President Juan Orlando Hernández traveled to Washington to meet with lawmakers on Tuesday and was greeted by protesters carrying signs with photographs of murdered activists and chants of “asesino” – Spanish for murderer. Cáceres was one of more than 120 land and environmental campaigners murdered since a military-backed coup d’état ousted the democratically elected president Manuel Zelaya in 2009, according to the anti-corruption NGO Global Witness. Eight men have been arrested in connection with her murder, including one serving and two retired military officers. Human rights organizations have joined the family in calling for an international independent investigation into her death. “We want to have an independent investigation to follow up on what the justice in Honduras has done so far,” said Neery Carrillo, Cáceres’s sister. “We don’t trust the justice in Honduras.” The Honduran government has denied any role in Cáceres’s killing, but records obtained by the Guardian show that one of the suspects had been appointed chief of intelligence for elite special forces and that he and another suspect received military training in the US. During the meeting, Mark Pocan, a Democratic congressman from Wisconsin, raised concerns that some of the suspects in the murder had received US training, according to an aide in the congressman’s office. The congressman asked the president how to ensure that US aid money was not being used to abet human rights violations. Pocan, who met with Cáceres’s sister and niece before the meeting with the president, said he raised their demand for an independent inquiry into her murder. Hernández argued that his government was making strides in combating the violence that has devastated this country, one of the most deadly in the world, and said local authorities had done an adequate job investigating her death, according to Pocan’s office. Cáceres led the decade-long struggle against a project to build a dam along the Gualcarque river, on territory that is sacred to the Lenca people and could flood large areas of ancestral lands and cut off water supplies to hundreds. She was murdered late in the evening on 2 March 2016, after at least four gunmen stormed her home in a gated community on the outskirts of a town called La Esperanza. The murder of Cáceres, recipient of the prestigious Goldman Environmental prize in 2015, sparked international outcry and calls for US to suspend aid to the country. The Honduran government, which receives tens of millions of dollars in annual US aid, is under mounting pressure to conduct an independent inquiry into the crime. Her family is supporting the Berta Cáceres Human Rights in Honduras Act, a bill that would suspend US funding for security assistance until basic human rights conditions are met. The legislation was reintroduced by Hank Johnson, a Democratic congressman from Georgia, on the one-year anniversary of Cáceres’ death. Silvio Carrillo, her nephew, a US citizen who lives in Oakland, California, said the government was “absolutely implicated” in his aunt’s death. “They’ve got eight guys in custody there but these aren’t the intellectual authors,” Carrillo said. “There is a direct tie – straight up, way high up into the army and into the government, but I think there’s a fear of finding out too much.” Last year, a former Honduran soldier told the Guardian that he had seen Cáceres’s name on a hitlist that was passed to US-trained units by the Honduran military joint chiefs of staff. The soldier said that two elite units had been given lists featuring the names and photographs of activists – and ordered to eliminate each target. Honduran authorities have denied the allegations. The protesters waited outside of a meeting room in the Cannon building. As Hernández left, Cáceres’ niece shouted a question about the investigation but the president, swarmed by security, did not turn his head."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/mar/21/the-guardian-view-on-the-french-campaign-a-defining-election","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T19:06:26Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the French campaign: a defining election | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/21/the-guardian-view-on-the-french-campaign-a-defining-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/21/the-guardian-view-on-the-french-campaign-a-defining-election","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the French campaign: a defining election","bodyText":"The French will vote in a month’s time for what has arguably become the most consequential and unpredictable presidential contest since the founding of the Fifth Republic in 1958. These elections will be a defining moment not just for one country but for Europe at large. The second and final round on 7 May will settle whether France blocks the rising tide of populism that has shaken the west. Last week, Dutch voters showed it could be done. The danger that must be confronted now is Marine Le Pen, leader of the Front National, Europe’s largest far-right party. Polls currently indicate Ms Le Pen will lead in the first round, or come out neck-and-neck with the centrist former economy minister Emmanuel Macron. They then predict she will be comfortably beaten in the run-off. Those statistics have put Mr Macron in something like a state of bliss: his ascendency at age 39, an outsider to party politics, a reformist and staunch pro-EU voice certainly ranks as a political phenomenon that few initially bet on. Yet to relax now in the belief that the dice have already been rolled, and that far-right demagoguery is on its way to the dustbin of history would be a risky assumption – if not folly. On Monday, a first TV debate involving the top five presidential contenders (there are 11 in total) has highlighted that the Le Pen threat is nowhere near to being entirely defused. It said a lot that the discussion livened up only when the themes she likes to promote – identity politics, immigration, secularism – were raised. Squabbles followed, in which she came under attack especially from the left and centrist candidates – but she was hardly on the defensive. Le Pen casts herself as an anti-establishment, anti-globalisation voice speaking for the disenfranchised lower and middle-classes. Her message carries a mix of social grievances and nationalist hubris. Anti-Muslim sentiment and xenophobia are wrapped up – supposedly camouflaged – in dubious arguments about defending gender equality and the pillars of the Republic. She has impressively widened the political scope that her father, the founder of the Front National, once enjoyed. And she’s easily weathered financial scandals – unlike François Fillon, the mainstream right-wing candidate, whose ratings have been slipping. It’s true a majority of French people find Ms Le Pen worrying. All the same, some of her ideas are now shared or imitated both on the left and the right. It was striking that Fillon refrained from criticising Ms Le Pen on immigration (he only targeted her economic programme) and equally so that on geopolitics and Russia, she stood on common ground with the hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon. According to polls, roughly half of Mr Macron’s supporters are still hesitant, whereas over 70% of Le Pen voters say their choice is final. Turnout levels could be decisive. In a country where distrust of institutions and the political class have reached record levels, Ms Le Pen benefits from never having been in office. The anxieties fuelling France’s populism echo those of Geert Wilders and Donald Trump supporters, including “democratic fatigue” and nostalgia for how life supposedly once was. But the picture is bleaker. Terrorist attacks have taken a deep toll, fuelling security obsessions and tortuous debates about diversity and the colonial past. The Front National has become the number one political party among 18- to 25-year-olds. This alone sets France apart. What happens next will matter greatly to the rest of Europe, including Britain, and the west. The continent’s fate may well be determined by these elections, arguably much more so than by Germany’s vote in September. Ms Le Pen’s party is intent on dismantling the EU, on setting up protectionist barriers, stigmatising Muslims and upending traditional western alliances. It is a recklessly destructive course whose effects would be felt far and wide. The coming weeks will show whether – and how soundly – it can be defeated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/mar/20/no-african-citizens-visas-california-annual-trade-summit","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T20:54:19Z","webTitle":"No African citizens granted visas for African trade summit in California","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/20/no-african-citizens-visas-california-annual-trade-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/mar/20/no-african-citizens-visas-california-annual-trade-summit","fields":{"headline":"No African citizens granted visas for African trade summit in California","bodyText":"An annual African trade summit in California had no African attendees this year after at least 60 people were denied visas, according to event leaders. The African Global Economic and Development Summit, a three-day conference at the University of Southern California (USC), typically brings delegations from across Africa to meet with business leaders in the US in an effort to foster partnerships. But this year, every single African citizen who requested a visa was rejected, according to organizer Mary Flowers. Some are now questioning whether the denials to the Los Angeles event could be tied to the anti-immigration policies of Donald Trump, who is pushing forward with a travel ban against six Muslim-majority countries despite ongoing legal challenges. Flowers said roughly 60 to 100 people from at least a dozen nations were denied entry to the summit, which went on as planned with a much smaller group last Thursday through Saturday. “I don’t know if it’s Trump or if it’s the fact that the embassies that have been discriminating for a long time see this as an opportunity, because of talk of the travel ban, to blatantly reject everyone,” Flowers said in an interview on Monday. “These trade links create jobs for both America and Africa. It’s unbelievable what’s going on.” The problems for the trade summit mark the latest example of restricted travel to the US under Trump, whose controversial immigration policies and rhetoric have impacted a wide range of industries and communities. Soccer players, musicians, doctors, tech workers, protesters and others from across the globe have been denied access to the US, which has also experienced a slump in tourism since Trump’s inauguration. Rejected participants at the trade summit came from Nigeria, Cameroon, Angola, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Ghana, South Africa and more, according to Flowers. Trump’s travel ban covers Somalia, Sudan and Libya in Africa, and citizens from those countries did not seek visas for the event. “This conference puts Americans in touch with real people so they can do real business,” said Flowers, CEO of Global Green Development Group, which does economic development work in Africa. A spokesperson for the US state department declined to comment on claims of rejections for summit participants, saying in a statement: “We cannot speculate on whether someone may or may not be eligible for a visa, nor on any possible limitations … Applications are refused if an applicant is found ineligible under the Immigration and Nationality Act or other provisions of US law.” This is not the first time the summit has struggled with visa problems, according to Flowers, who has been organizing the event since 2013. In past years, she said, roughly 40% of interested African participants were denied entry. But the 100% rejections this year meant there were only 50 to 75 participants total instead of the 150 to 200 who typically attend, she said. “Financially, that’s a gaping hole – a whole bunch of people who would have contributed not just to the event and to USC, but to the city around.” She said many of the applicants who were rejected had already registered for the event and paid initial visa fees, but then were denied after short interviews – even when they brought extensive documentation, such as bank statements and property records. The long-term impact of the visa denials is a lack of new trade links and business partnerships between US entrepreneurs and African nations, said Flowers, who also represents southern California as a member of the District Export Council, a trade group affiliated with the US commerce department. “This summit is designed to bring Africa to America’s doorstep for investments and trade,” said Flowers, who is now working on a power plant project in Nigeria, with a collaboration that emerged from a past trade summit. “We can’t have the government telling us to go do business with Africa and then you slam the doors in their face,” she added, noting that Trump has been in contact with Nigeria’s president. “We can’t survive as an internal country. We have to operate globally or we won’t be powerful.” Following the visa rejections, Flowers is now also in contact with US congresswoman Karen Bass, who represents Los Angeles and is the ranking member of the Africa subcommittee. “When restrictive policies and practices are followed by US embassies when granting visas to Africans, it can hurt opportunities between US and African business entities,” Bass said in a statement to the Guardian on Monday. “I encourage the Department of State to make sure these policies are flexible enough to encourage the free flow of business ideas and opportunities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/mar/20/white-house-trump-wiretapping-claims-sean-spicer-fbi","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T21:24:45Z","webTitle":"White House defends Trump wiretap claim despite FBI finding 'no information'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/20/white-house-trump-wiretapping-claims-sean-spicer-fbi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/mar/20/white-house-trump-wiretapping-claims-sean-spicer-fbi","fields":{"headline":"White House defends Trump wiretap claim despite FBI finding 'no information'","bodyText":"The White House on Monday refused to back off Donald Trump’s extraordinary and unfounded claim that Barack Obama wiretapped the phones in Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential campaign, despite the head of the FBI saying he had “no information” to support the claim. A visibly agitated White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that the investigation into Trump’s wiretapping accusation was only in its “first chapter” and there was “interesting news” yet to come. He also said Trump would not apologize to his predecessor. By contrast, Spicer denounced reports of possible collusion between individuals with the Trump campaign and Russia in an effort to influence the outcome of last year’s presidential election as “a bit of a stretch” and “ridiculous”. On Monday, FBI director James Comey, speaking at a public hearing before the House intelligence committee, confirmed for the first time that the bureau is investigating whether members of the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow to influence the 2016 election. During the briefing, Spicer sought to distance the Trump campaign from aides who have come under scrutiny for their contacts with Russia after they were the subject of a line of questioning during the House committee hearing. He dismissed Carter Page, an informal foreign policy adviser to Trump, and Roger Stone, a longtime Trump confidant, as “hangers on”. “To look at some individual that was there for a short period of time or separately individuals who really didn’t play any role in the campaign and to suggest that those are the basis for anything is a bit ridiculous,” he added. But Spicer’s claim that Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manger, had only played a “limited role for a very limited amount of time” drew immediate skepticism from the press corp. Manafort joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 before being promoted to campaign manager, and resigned amid scrutiny of his business dealings to pro-Russian leaders in Ukraine. Spicer also called former national security adviser Michael Flynn a “volunteer of the campaign”. Flynn was an adviser to the Trump campaign and spoke on the first night of the 2016 Republican national convention before being appointed national security adviser once Trump won the election. He was forced to resign last month after misrepresenting his contacts with the Russian ambassador to Washington. The White House has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia over its meddling in the 2016 election. Spicer on Monday said he was unaware of any White House officials currently being under investigation by the FBI. The press secretary said there was a “big difference” between the investigations into Trump’s wiretapping claim and the one into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow. “When the people who have been briefed by the FBI about collusion between individuals [within the Trump campaign and Russia] the answer continues to be ‘no’ and at some point take ‘no’ for an answer,” Spicer said, appearing to suggest that those briefed on the collusion allegations felt there was no substance to them. He added: “So you can continue to look for something – but [you’re] continuing to look for something that doesn’t exist, doesn’t matter.” He took a different attitude towards Trump’s wiretapping claims, which the White House has refused to back away from despite bipartisan statements from the Senate and House intelligence committees, and now the FBI, National Security Agency and Department of Justice, that there is no evidence to support the accusation that Obama spied on Trump during last year’s campaign. During the Monday briefing, Spicer also clarified his conversation with British officials after he repeated an unsubstantiated report from a Fox News pundit that the country’s spy agency had helped Obama eavesdrop on Trump during the presidential campaign last year. “There was merely an explanation of what we did and why we did it,” Spicer said. Last week, he quoted from a Fox News report that suggested the Obama administration had asked the UK to conduct surveillance on Trump. In a rare move, GCHQ called the accusation “nonsense”, “utterly ridiculous” and an assertion that ought to be “ignored”. During the House intelligence committee hearing on Monday, the NSA director, Michael Rogers, said that it would have been violation of US law to ask the British to conduct such an operation. Asked whether he, or anyone else, had asked GCHQ to spy on Trump or his allies, Rogers replied: “No, sir, nor would I.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/mar/20/george-osborne-brexit-war-evening-standard","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T19:57:46Z","webTitle":"Osborne could be a potent weapon in this Brexit war | Polly Toynbee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/20/george-osborne-brexit-war-evening-standard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/20/george-osborne-brexit-war-evening-standard","fields":{"headline":"Osborne could be a potent weapon in this Brexit war","bodyText":"They booed George Osborne at the 2012 Paralympics, and what a joy it was to hear that great national raspberry ricochet round the stadium. Back then, the public couldn’t know how much damage this pernicious chancellor would inflict or how long his blight would stretch ahead. And yet, and yet, just possibly, almost inconceivably, he may rally round him the only effective resistance to the coming catastrophe of Theresa May’s article 50 plans. Day by day, Brexit is turning the world upside down in ways unimaginable a year ago. A war – and Brexit is a civil war – creates the strangest bedfellows. Think Churchill embracing Stalin, Movietone News hymning praises to Uncle Joe, our mass-murdering ally – just for the duration. Normal hostilities resumed afterwards. So it may be with Osborne. Nothing will be forgotten or forgiven but, just for the duration, hold back the vitriol if he can indeed stiffen the backbone of the majority of remain Tory MPs to take back control from the Brexit extremists and their bully press. Facing down those wreckers needs this schemer, yet more Machiavellian than they are. That’s what he seems to have been hired to do as editor of the London Evening Standard – his new owner, Evgeny Lebedev, proclaims: “He will provide more effective opposition to the government than the current Labour party,” (an abysmally low threshold). Osborne says: “I am going to continue to play a big role in public life,” as he smirks threateningly across at Theresa May. Is this pure revenge and opportunism? But if he means to use the Standard as an antidote to killer Brexit, then urge him on: go for it, George! Lest we forget, nothing will be forgiven. Let me count the ways he has infected British politics with mean-minded malice, kicking the weak, and leaving in his wake a trail of 500 food banks feeding over a million people made destitute by his policies. As he trousers squalidly greedy rewards for failure, his plan to dwindle the state away continues apace, shredding public services, crippling local authorities, stripping the public realm bare. Wherever you look, things are falling apart. The £3bn skinned from schools, the overflowing NHS, the fewest houses built in living memory, social care collapsing, children’s centres closed, prisons at riot point – wherever you look, his pigeons are staggering home to roost. His genius was in persuading enough voters that all this was essential due to Labour profligacy, a calumny branded into Labour’s hide. Benefits took the brunt. How cleverly he corroded public faith in all benefit recipients, from newborn babies to the terminally ill in wheelchairs, treating them all as frauds and scroungers. His last budget took £12bn from the pockets of the bottom half, with some cuts sheer populism, such as the two-child limit, the benefit cap mendaciously suggesting £26,000 was the standard benefit level, or the welfare cap that limits the total sum paid out to a family, regardless of how many are in need. He mainlined poison into the veins of the body politic, removing the last traces of trust in the 1945 welfare state. Only triple-locked pensioners were bribed to flock to vote Tory in gratitude. Behind him he left death traps for his successor – the extravagant raising of personal tax allowances benefiting mainly the upper half, and his deadly manifesto pledge of no tax rises, ever. Remember his oft-repeated smear about the hard worker leaving home in the dark only to see his benefit-dependent neighbours’ blinds down? Remember his shocking use of deaths of the six Philpott children – who died in a house fire started by their parents – to query taxpayers “subsidising lifestyles like that”. Economically illiterate, his tourniquet on spending held down growth and ensured the slowest ever “recovery” from any recession, with incomes still not restored. Revenues falling below forecasts caused yet more spending cuts, like a doctor using leeches to bleed a patient dry. His “balanced budget” slid from his promised five years to nowhere in sight. At least he has proved Keynes right, again: never cut into a depression. But hey, incompetence is no bar to £650,000 worth of advice to BlackRock – a job he should drop at once if he hopes to regain a shred of political credibility. If Osborne now steps forward as national protector against a savage Brexit, he should apologise for all he did to cause that Brexit vote: tumbling living standards and public squalor fostered that sense of abandonment by the “metropolitan elite”. In speech after speech, he sprinkled populist anti-EU abuse: warning of “the constant drip, drip, drip of powers to Europe” earned him Tory party conference applause. When Tony Blair on the Andrew Marr Show welcomed Osborne taking over the Standard, saying “He’s a highly capable guy and it should make politics more interesting,” he was right to acknowledge the man’s evil genius. He’s a political paladin and a master tactician anyone would want on their side. Too late now to regret all the previous political leaders of all parties who never tried to win hearts and minds or public understanding of the EU. But we are where we are – in a very bad place. Whatever and whoever it takes, pulling the country back from a Brexit disaster is the great national struggle. A lot of hypocritical cant has been talked about Osborne’s double role as politician and editor. Britain’s press has been forever corrupted by mainly Tory owners using newspapers to promote their party interests. Only the Guardian and the FT are free to plough their own furrows, their views their own and not their proprietors’. Otherwise, the sanctimonious stuff about “independent” journalism should be read with a salt-laden cup of Galaxy Ultimate Marshmallow Hot Chocolate. Journalists posture as a priesthood of truth and beauty, but hear them resist the promised part two of the Leveson inquiry into the press, or the most basic independent regulation that would apply to any other trade (no, we are not a profession). Osborne can try his hand along with the rest of us unqualified, unregulated practitioners if some owner seeking social cachet wants to hire him. If Osborne can turn the Evening Standard into a truth-telling instrument to strengthen the weak battalion of pro-Europeans, then we should cheer on whatever blows he can land against Brexiteer misinformation. But only for the duration, after which normal politics resumes, with a vengeance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/mar/24/fathers-and-sons-howard-cunnell-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-24T09:00:28Z","webTitle":"Fathers and Sons by Howard Cunnell review – a poignant, poetic memoir","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/24/fathers-and-sons-howard-cunnell-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/mar/24/fathers-and-sons-howard-cunnell-review","fields":{"headline":"Fathers and Sons by Howard Cunnell review – a poignant, poetic memoir","bodyText":"There are several precursors nodded to in the title of Howard Cunnell’s light-filled memoir of childhood, parenthood and gender transition. One thinks of Edmund Gosse’s Father and Son, in which the author, finally cutting himself off from his pious and overbearing father, sets out “to fashion his inner life for himself”. There’s Turgenev’s tale of an ageing man unable to keep pace with his fast-living nihilist son. Then there’s Hemingway’s short story, “Fathers and Sons”, in which the Hemingway figure, Nick Adams, talks to his son about his own father, a man “both cruel and abused” who is dead now, and who was severe and distant in life. In all cases, the message is that parenthood is a different country, that the old are unable to speak to the young, that men are destined to harden with age and repeat the mistakes their fathers made. This is a book of two halves, the first dominated by an absence – that of Cunnell’s own father. Jason Cunnell is a chancer and a fly-by-night who walks out on Howard and his brother, Luke, before Howard is born. The young Howard finds that he’s “terrified by how badly somebody that doesn’t exist can make me feel. My small hands turn to fists when I hear the word: Dad.” The boys’ mother moves to her parents’ in Eastbourne, where Howard and Luke grow up in a familiar muddle of art, literature, music and provincial violence. It’s a charming if well-trodden narrative path, redeemed from the commonplace by the flair Cunnell exhibits in his descriptions of the South Downs. He close-reads the landscape like a poem. “We travelled in a wash of southern light that filled the car and seemed to push at and past the edges of the world,” he writes early on. Later, further west, the “sky is a blue wash. The green downland, silver sea and southern sky fold into one another in curves of limitless colour.” At one point a “sunflower stretches the full length of itself in light”, while at other times the light is “quince” or “lemon gauze”; cliffs are “distant, peachy slabs in the afternoon light”. Here Cunnell is writing in a proud tradition, summoning the paintings of Samuel Palmer and Eric Ravilious, and the prose of Richard Jefferies, who wrote of the “champagniness” of downland light, which “brings all things into clear relief, giving them an edge and an outline”. I also thought of Ann Wroe’s beautiful evocation of the luminosity of this Sussex landscape, Six Facets of Light. There follows the inevitable escape to London and several bleak years drifting in an alcoholic haze around bedsits, as Cunnell attempts to drink away the emptiness left by his father: “The only thought was to have more to drink. For the missing layer of skin it put on me.” Then he meets Araba, a Ghanaian woman with a daughter, and another on the way. He helps her through the birth of Jay, a girl whose Greek father has also run off. There’s a further daughter – his own, this time, Rosie – and he proves himself a half-decent dad, only occasionally storming off after rows or drinking jags. He and Jay laugh and wrestle together, he takes her to football practice, he is her father in all but blood. Then Jay tells her parents she’s deeply unhappy in her own skin, that she is a boy, that she wants to transition. Here the second half of the book begins, and we see what all the light in the opening section was for. Jay’s despair threatens to swamp the family, and now there is only the darkness of Jay’s room, his black clothes, the blood that he carves from his wrists with filched kitchen knives. Cunnell writes that he remembers “going up to his room once – his bed a messed heap of stale and dirty bedclothes red with blood. Piles of bloody tissues on the floor and in the bed Jay’s arm bloody red and gaping with long cuts. His lovely face pale and blank with sorrow.” And yet, slowly, out of this misery, something hopeful grows. Cunnell speaks to Jay in a matey half-language that acknowledges the inability of words to cross the great barrier between them. Cunnell is able to be the father to Jay that Jason never was to him, and the very size of the task he’s faced with summons reservoirs of courage and kindness. We recognise that, for Jay, Howard’s unquestioning, dogged presence is the difference between coping and falling apart. This isn’t a perfect book. Cunnell is a Kerouac scholar, and I blame Kerouac for the narrative tic that we find repeatedly here of rambling sentences that are followed by brief spurts of Beat banality. “Why am I living in this place and time? Why this skin and body and not another?” is given a paragraph to itself. There are other clunkers, and also several sections – about a trip to Mexico, a diving holiday in Cuba – that would have benefited from a more ruthless editorial pen. Any minor gripes fade, though, when we return to Jay and his tentative, courageous steps towards living and loving as a man. In his 1972 book Sincerity and Authenticity, the critic Lionel Trilling argued that the idea of an absolute moral code had been superseded by the concept of authenticity, of “being true to yourself”. A third category might be added to this in our age of postmodern irony and disaffection: books that feel like they have neither. Fathers and Sons has both. It is one of the most good-hearted, big-souled books I’ve read, a memoir about what it means to be a man, but more importantly what it means to be a parent. I don’t cry easily, but I read the final pages through a luminous wash of tears. • Fathers and Sons is published by Picador.

With no vote, no power and no say, children are easy to ignore when it comes to divvying up dwindling resources. Councils have already said they may not be able to meet basic obligations to schools, such as checking staff for criminal records and making buildings asbestos-free. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. As a former children’s minister I’ve seen first-hand that children’s social care is hugely challenging. Social workers step in where other services can’t. They work with children who have been let down by other adults, and with families in crisis. Recently, though, it’s become clear that local authorities are increasingly unable to meet demand for services. Growing awareness of the scale of child sexual abuse and exploitation has led to more children coming to the attention of professionals, which of course is a good thing. It has also had a significant impact on resources. Overall, the number of children on a child protection plan rose by almost 30% between 2010-11 and 2015-16. For context, local authority costs for children’s services rose by just 2% in the same period, and overall local authority expenditure dropped by more than 21%. I have just chaired a cross-party inquiry into children’s social care, supported by the National Children’s Bureau. We repeatedly heard evidence that in order to fund services for those children most at risk, other types of support are being cut. In the current economic climate, it comes down to a zero-sum game. Protecting children in immediate danger has to take precedence, leaving little left for early intervention or preventive services. Strikingly, in a survey conducted for the inquiry, 89% of directors of children’s social services reported finding it increasingly challenging to fulfil their statutory duties towards children who need help to achieve or maintain a “reasonable” level of health and development. This includes children who are disabled, those whose parents are in crisis and children who may be at risk of harm. But of course failure to act early has consequences. Problems can escalate, meaning children will need more significant (and costly) help later on. There are signs that this is happening already. Between 2010-11 and 2015-16, the number of children taken into care rose by almost 17% and is now at its highest since 1985. Back in 2011, the Munro Review of Child Protection (which I commissioned while minister for children and families) recommended that the government introduce a new duty on local authorities and others to provide early-help services for children, young people and families. Today, this seems even more important. Significantly, though, national government must also provide protected funding, so that alongside tackling abuse, we can also intervene early, to help families stay together and give children the best possible chance of a positive future. Alongside resource constraints, our inquiry also identified another significant area of concern in children’s social care. We found that there is huge variation in the way in which local authorities decide to support the most vulnerable children. Perhaps most strikingly, the proportion of children in care varies from just 22 per 10,000 in one local authority to 164 per 10,000 in another. This cannot simply be explained by differences in deprivation – it points instead to variation in policy and practice. Given we know that children in care are far less likely to gain good GCSEs and to go to university, and more likely to have poor physical and mental health, such a postcode lottery is deeply worrying. It’s clear to me that the government’s priority should be to improve standards of care for all vulnerable children in our society. For this reason I strongly opposed plans to allow local authorities to opt out of statutory duties towards children and families for up to six years. This would have risked entrenching and legitimising the fact that children in one borough aren’t getting the same quality of care as children in the neighbouring borough. I applaud ministers’ brave decision this week to drop these misguided and potentially dangerous proposals. We’ve stepped back from a cliff edge that threatened the whole fabric of children’s social care legislation. This doesn’t mean, however, that nothing needs to change. We know that the system is failing far too many children. Innovation is essential for driving improvement, and we should continue to support local authorities in finding better ways to meet the needs of their population. Crucially, we should put effort and resources into spreading good practice so that children across the country can benefit. What we should never do is endanger the sanctity of universal legal entitlements. Children and families must know that their rights under the law are the same, no matter where they live. Equally, every local authority must be held to account in meeting a fundamental set of duties. The government has made the right choice. The next question is where we go from here. I urge ministers to focus on two key themes. First, realistic resourcing of all children’s services, from prevention to early help for families, to care and child protection; and second, tackling the stark variation in standards across the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/mar/20/classification-system-for-paralympic-track-and-field-open-to-abuse","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T22:00:48Z","webTitle":"Classification system for Paralympic track and field 'open to abuse'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/20/classification-system-for-paralympic-track-and-field-open-to-abuse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/mar/20/classification-system-for-paralympic-track-and-field-open-to-abuse","fields":{"headline":"Classification system for Paralympic track and field 'open to abuse'","bodyText":"The classification system for Paralympic track and field athletes is flawed and open to abuse by the unscrupulous, according to a report into the subject by the sport’s own governing body. UK Athletics’ review found a variety of ways in which the existing classification rules could be undermined, and uncovered a widespread belief inside Paralympic sport that a system designed to ensure fairness can be exploited. A copy of the report has been shown to the Guardian ahead of its publication. Produced by a panel of four experts, and chaired by Anne Wafula Strike, it concluded: “There was wide consensus that the current UKA national classification system could be abused, should an athlete or support personnel be sufficiently motivated, have an understanding of the classification process and have an impairment that lends itself to exaggeration. “This issue is not exclusive to athletics but reflected across Paralympic sport.” The report identifies several ways in which athletes could cheat the system by making themselves appear more disabled during classification. These include: Athletes in classes for those with neurological conditions, such as cerebral palsy, tiring themselves out ahead of classification in order to perform poorly in tests. Athletes altering medical forms and evidence prior to submitting them in support of their classification. Athletes presenting medical reports from doctors who are sympathetic to the athlete. The report’s findings suggest that UK Athletics, which has been criticised over classification, is keen to introduce reforms ahead of the World Para Athletics Championships in London this summer. It is also understood that could lead to some UK Paralympic athletes’ medical records being looked at again as a result. Classification is at the heart of Paralympic competition, with the aim being to put competitors of similar disability up against each other. However, the classification of disabled athletes has become increasingly contentious with claims that some have gained an unfair advantage – potentially helping them win races and medals – as a result of being classified as more disabled than they actually are. For track and field atheletes in the UK, classification is handled by UK Athletics; for international competitions classification is controlled by World Para Athletics. Other sports handle their own classification. The UKA review interviewed a number of people with experience of the classification process. The review found that although the national classification system could be exploited “there was no substantive evidence to suggest that this is the case”. Professor John Brewer of St Mary’s University, one of the authors of the review, said: “There is clearly the opportunity that if someone decides to be unscrupulous and cheat the system the opportunity is there to cheat. The opportunity is there in all sports in some way or another. “We did hear some anecdotal evidence of athletes who had perhaps tried to pre-fatigue prior to classification and then obviously that then impacts on coordination.” The review makes a list of wide-ranging recommendations which UKA has agreed to implement in full. The team behind the review said they hoped that their report would prompt other Paralympic governing bodies around the world to follow suit. The list includes improving the quality of medical documentation relating to competitors’ disabilities which are presented to classifiers. “We felt there was a lack of consistency in the way some of the records had been collected,” said Brewer. The report also calls for a new review into medical processes to “reduce the opportunity of information being manipulated”, and recommends the establishment of a panel of independent clinicians to review medical data. Athletes with fluctuating conditions, meaning that the level of their disability varies over time, should be given particular scrutiny, the report says. Brewer said: “We were very aware that someone can have a condition which is fluctuating, it’s progressing, whatever it might be. But it’s a changing condition, as opposed to some athletes who have a condition that is fairly stable. That’s why we want these recommendations, the process to be swifter, more responsive, perhaps a bit more flexible so if athletes are changing we can look at that and if there was a need for them to be reviewed and go into another category then that will happen.” Despite identifying a number of areas requiring improvement the report concludes that the UK classification system is “robust” and “recognised as one that is world-leading with a strong ethical culture and an exemplar of best practice in many areas”. It adds that the areas of improvement had been highlighted in order to “ensure the system’s ongoing integrity and improve understanding of classification”. Ed Warner, chair of UKA, welcomed the report and confirmed that the recommendations would be implemented in full. But he said that money was tight and called on funding bodies to improve the money available for Paralympic sport. The report comes on the back of concerns expressed by Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson, one of Britain’s most decorated and best-known star of the Paralympics. As first reported by the Guardian last September, she had contacted various figures within Paralympic sport to pass on her suspicions that some athletes had obtained an unfair advantage due to being grouped with competitors more disabled than themselves. She told the Guardian at the time: “It’s absolutely vital that classification is taken seriously. It goes to the heart of the integrity of the sport. I am concerned about anything that threatens the integrity of our sport.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2017/mar/20/raymond-hardman-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T18:30:31Z","webTitle":"Raymond Hardman obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/20/raymond-hardman-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/mar/20/raymond-hardman-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Raymond Hardman obituary","bodyText":"My father-in-law, Raymond Hardman, who has died aged 96, was a modest man from a working-class family who overcame his relative poverty to rise to academic excellence in his chosen field of electrical engineering. Raymond was born in Oldham to Joseph Hardman, a carder in a cotton mill, and his wife, Jessie (nee Oliver), a cotton mill worker. As a result of injuries sustained during the first world war Joseph died when Raymond was only two, and he and his younger sister, Mabel, were brought up by their mother and her sister, their Auntie Bina. His formal education at Hathershaw school ended at 14 when, to support the family, he started work in the electrical engineering firm Ferranti, in Hollinwood, putting capacitors together on a production line. While there, Raymond developed an interest in engineering and enrolled in evening courses at Oldham Municipal Technical College. His studies were duly rewarded when he was elevated from the shop floor to work in the research and development laboratories at Ferranti. He continued his night classes and by 1939 was awarded national certificates in electrical engineering. At the outbreak of the second world war Raymond was kept out of the army as he was deemed to be more useful working on the improvement of gun sights and the trajectory of missiles for the Royal Navy. Raymond continued to study and gained higher national certificates in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering at Manchester Municipal College of Technology (which became Umist). In 1952 he was admitted as a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineering (later the Institution of Engineering and Technology). Raymond’s cycling forays were famous. After work on Friday afternoons he would often cycle towards Settle, Hawes, Castleton and other parts of the Yorkshire Dales and the Peak District. In 1946 he cycled from Oldham to the Swiss Alps. Raymond also had a love of hiking, particularly in the Lake District. In 1952 he married Peggy Kenworthy, a draughtswoman, and they settled in Garden Suburb, Oldham. Leaving Ferranti in 1954, Raymond taught at the Oldham College of Technology, becoming a senior lecturer in electronics and electrical engineering. In the 1970s he took a degree in mathematics at the Open University, graduating in 1978 with first-class honours. Raymond was a keen amateur radio enthusiast and an avid Guardian reader. He had a daily subscription to the paper from 1952 until last year, when he developed macular degeneration and so found reading difficult, but his mind was always capable of solving tricky Sudoku problems. Peggy died in 2010.

Or you did it on the tactics board because he was happy for you to come in and put your opinion across. “Apparently the meeting that got him sacked I read one story that said it was straight after the Sevilla game. Absolute shambles. It said I was personally involved in a meeting when I was actually sat in anti-doping for three hours. The stories were quite hurtful. A lot of false accusations were being thrown out there and there’s nothing us, as players, could do about it.” Vardy, preparing to lead England’s attack in their friendly against Germany in Dortmund on Wednesday, admitted it looked strange that Leicester’s players did not express any support for Ranieri on their social media accounts until they started receiving criticism for their collective silence. Ranieri was sacked after arriving back in England from Leicester’s Champions League last-16 first leg against Sevilla and Vardy, for example, took 48 hours – from Thursday to Saturday evening – before posting his reaction, citing one of the reasons being that he had to bath his children. “I can understand what you are saying but, personally, my tweet was [meant to be] going out straightaway, but I wrote it that many times I couldn’t quite get the wording right. You don’t know what to say. It was 24 hours before I did it but we had just got back from Seville. We were delayed, landed, then went straight home, kids in the bath and straight to bed myself. “It’s hard. Don’t get me wrong, what he did for Leicester was unbelievable and nobody would have expected that [title] in a million years. We can only thank him for that. The way this season has gone, players never seem to be the ones who get the sack. It always falls on the manager and that is what has happened. We are all sincerely gutted that it did.” A year since the first publicity about his life story being turned into a film, Vardy admitted he had not heard any updates and did not know if it was still going ahead. “You tell me,” he said. Leicester have won all four of their matches and qualified for the quarter-finals of the Champions League since Ranieri left, with the former assistant manager, Craig Shakespeare, in charge until the end of the season. The episode, according to Vardy, has been bad for his reputation. “I get abuse at every stadium that I turn up at. You are always going to get stick from fans. It is part and parcel of football. I’m one that carries on and winds them up a bit. Do I enjoy it? Yeah, it’s just me. I couldn’t tell you why I get it, but it’s part of the game. I am not really fussed about it. It’s fine by me.” Vardy also explained why he had not chosen to report the death threats or road-rage incidents to the police. “All that can happen is they get banned on Twitter,” he said. “People get cut up but if there’s no cameras you’re screwed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/mar/20/labour-party-divisions-gather-momentum","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T18:49:00Z","webTitle":"Labour party divisions gather momentum | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/20/labour-party-divisions-gather-momentum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/mar/20/labour-party-divisions-gather-momentum","fields":{"headline":"Labour party divisions gather momentum","bodyText":"I am not a member of Momentum, although I have thought about joining. In my 70 years’ Labour party membership, I have mostly resisted becoming tied to any factions, even ones with which I largely agreed on particular issues. Factions exist because there are genuine differences on many issues. And they have every right to campaign and organise for the adoption of their views, provided they do it openly. Which Momentum does. But I have always been totally opposed to dismissing groups simply by labelling them: “hard left”; “centre left”; “Trotskyist”; “moderate”; even, on the other side, “Blairite” (Labour MPs rally against Momentum plan, 20 March). What is needed is constructive, in-depth debates on the whole range of policies, from those where there is general agreement, to those where policy development is ongoing, and to those where there are still deep divisions. Yet there is not one word on any policy in this or the vast majority of similar articles. Frank Jackson Harlow Labour party • It would appear that, contrary to the non-story that Momentum members describe, we are witnessing the latest move to make the Labour party an instrument of the hard, sectarian left. The trade unions are too divided to act, so it is up to the parliamentary Labour party to ensure that we have a credible mainstream socialist party that represents Labour voters and reaches out to win power. Yes, they need to connect with lost voters, but the first move is to ditch Jeremy Corbyn and the current chaotic, discredited leadership. This needs to happen by the PLP forming a new parliamentary party and opposition. Despite the obvious risks, there is no other route back to power. When Labour lurched to the left in 1983, James Callaghan wrote about the virtues of Clement Attlee, who led Labour from a rump of MPs in 1935 to power in 1945: “If Attlee were alive today ... (he would argue) that radical change needs to be persuasive if it is to become acceptable and permanent; and that party members have an obligation to work as a team and have no right to insist on the last drop of their sectarianism above all else.” Jeremy Corbyn has failed utterly to emulate our greatest Labour leader. The PLP needs to act to save Attlee’s legacy: an electable left. Steve Flatley York • It is the timing of these latest revelations about Momentum which is more significant than the not very startling content itself. It appears to me – a Labour party, Unite and Momentum member – that this is an attempt by Tom Watson and other MPs to interfere in the forthcoming Unite election by undermining Len McCluskey. It’s ironic that these are the same individuals who decry the influence of trade unions and other organisations on Labour party elections. Momentum was set up after Jeremy Corbyn’s election to represent us grassroots members because a section of the parliamentary party refused to accept the result. Their continuing contempt for the democratic decisions of the membership is why Momentum was needed in the first place and why it will continue to have my support. I’ll also be voting for Len McCluskey. Karen Barratt Winchester • Irrespective of what many leftists think of Tom Watson (not a lot), how can they believe the delusional cant spouted by Momentum’s Christine Shawcroft on the Today programme? Her insistence that mass membership – 550,000 out of a UK population of 65 million – should dictate the party’s direction of travel, no matter what, is Labour’s “will of the people” moment; an arrogant assertion that traduces the greater democratic good outside their political echo chamber. To then imply that the failure of their leader to reach out beyond the echo chamber and capitalise on the vulnerability of one of the most chaotic governments in recent memory is the fault of the media rather than his own shortcomings is risible. We’re not all thickos who can’t see beyond the naked agenda of rightwing newspapers; the empirical evidence is there for all to see. Corbyn had his chance and he blew it. He’s incompetent, aloof and vain, and not fit to be a leader of anything other than a protest group. Colin Montgomery Edinburgh • Having signed up as a Guardian supporter to help ensure the future of its independent journalism, it was nice to be welcomed to the website recently with a large “Thank You” banner. I even completed the survey indicating my willingness to take an online subscription, should they become available, such were my feelings of warmth at the time. However, I swiftly found myself somewhat discombobulated to find one of your leading columnists stating that I was a “fucking fool” (Don’t tell me you weren’t warned about Corbyn, theguardian.com, 18 March) simply for disagreeing with his viewpoint. I’m not going to lose much sleep over this, but I think it’s only fair that I am sent another canvas bag bearing the legend “fucking fool who supports the Guardian”, which seems more appropriate.

Because, you see, my mother gave me hell. She was rarely physically abusive; she is much cleverer than that. Everything is in the realm of plausible deniability. Why does she give me the cold shoulder for months? Who knows, but if confronted, she denies it. Why is there rank favouritism between me and my siblings and grandchildren? Not possible: strictly my imagination. When people assume that those who have given birth automatically know how to feel (and express) “motherly love”, it only makes things worse. The assumption creates a mystique about the mother-child relationship that damages those raised by a mother who doesn’t know how to love. Many spend their lives wondering what is wrong with them, and why their mothers don’t behave lovingly. To have society then tell them that their mother is a de facto source of love to be adulated is brutal. Are times always difficult for children (adult or not) in our situation? Ironically, no. In classic abuser cycles, our mothers will reel us in with kind phrases and expressions of support. Desperate to think that we are worthy of our mother’s acceptance, we cautiously take the bait. Once she is sure of our submission, the manipulation begins again. The sad fact is, some women who give birth – and who may think of themselves as very loving – are long on control and short on love. These mothers may seem proud and supportive of their children, but in private are critical and naysaying. Their superficial charm isolates us, as outsiders can’t understand why we would not want to spend time with such lovely people. Mothers such as this play the victim beautifully: with tears in their eyes, they will tell others (particularly relatives, because they might get involved on their behalf) that they don’t understand what they could have done … while giving the silent treatment to said daughter or son for months over a perceived slight. After years of being blamed for the problems in our relationship, I have had enough. This Mothering Sunday, those of my children who wish to may accompany me to lunch (my treat), and those who are not available will be loved vocally nonetheless. I will not be calling Mum. And I will not feel guilty about it. She has had her chance; sadly, while she thinks that her relationship with me is the only one where she has difficulties, her grandchildren see her manipulations and don’t want any part of them. Because they are still young and trying to be kind, they don’t let her know this. But the chickens have come home to roost, and my mother is sensing their lack of willingness to engage with her and is panicking. To those of you lucky enough to have mothers you want to celebrate, do it with love and enthusiasm. But please, please, when you hear someone respond less than positively about their mother … don’t act as though they are somehow deficient and it’s their fault. If nothing else, celebrate your own mother’s love and care by showering it on that person who never had it.

MPs on the department for culture, media and sport committee heard allegations from music industry figures and fans about Viagogo, which allows touts to advertise tickets for huge mark-ups even before they go on sale, in return for a cut of up to 25% of the selling price. Internet giant Google, already under fire for placing adverts next to extremist content, now looks likely to be dragged into the inquiry, after it was accused of “colluding” with Viagogo by advertising the reseller at the top of search results. MPs were told that all four major ticket resale sites – Viagogo, StubHub, GetMeIn and Seatwave – are routinely flouting laws designed to protect consumers. But MPs and witnesses reserved their sharpest barbs for Viagogo, which was summoned to give evidence after revelations about the company in The Guardian. Committee chair Damian Collins MP said Viagogo’s absence showed “contempt for parliament”, while Nigel Huddleston MP accused the company of a “lack of respect [...] for the British public.” Among Viagogo’s written excuses for not attending, MPs said, was a claim that the company does not sell tickets, and only allows others to do so. The Switzerland-based company also said it did not have “adequate representation” in the UK, even though it has a large office on London’s Cannon Street. It is extremely rare for company executives to refuse to appear at a select committee inquiry. Irene Rosenfeld, then boss of food group Kraft, provoked fury when she twice ignored an invitation to face MPs over the US company’s controversial £12bn takeover of Cadbury’s. But unlike Viagogo, Kraft did at least send three middle-ranking executives to face politicians’ questions. In Viagogo’s absence, the company was accused of “naked mis-selling and fraud” by John Nicolson MP. He accused the company was “lying to the public”. Huddleston said the evidence suggested Viagogo’s business was “smelling of exploitation and deception at every level”. Nigel Adams MP said Viagogo “makes Stan Flashman look like Mother Teresa”. Flashman was a renowned tout who claimed he could even get tickets for the Queen’s Garden Parties. The committee heard that fans who buy from Viagogo, sometimes for thousands of pounds, are being turned away from venues and events that ban resale. Keith Kenny, tickets director for hip-hop musical Hamilton, told the committee he had written to Viagogo executive Ed Parkinson urging him not to resell tickets, but received no response. Tickets for Hamilton appeared on Viagogo for more than £2500 moments after going on sale and are now changing hands for even more. Nigel Adams MP said: “Taking thousands of pounds off people, knowing they are not going to be able to get in, is effectively selling a product that never existed.” Google was also accused of “colluding” with Viagogo, because the company usually appears at the top of search results for major events. The company is understood to be reviewing the situation. “We have a set of strict policies which govern what ads we do and do not allow on Google,” said a spokesperson. “We do not allow fraudulent or misrepresentative ads, and when we discover ads that break our policies, we quickly take action.” Stuart Galbraith, who promotes artists including Ed Sheeran, said this is because Viagogo pays to appear at the top of the Google’s paid-for sponsored rankings. “I can pay 50p per click, they can pay £10,” he said. Google did not return a request for comment. Galbraith and Stuart Camp, Ed Sheeran’s manager, said all four major ticket resale sites routinely breach the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which says resold tickets must show data such as face value and the ticket’s exact location. Galbraith said the companies omit this information because it would allow promoters and venues to cancel resold tickets. The Competition and Markets Authority is icurrently investigating whether companies are complying with the legislation. And the House of Lords was on Tuesday evening due to debate plans that include outlawing “bots” - the automated software used by some touts to harvest tickets in bulk. One witness, SeeTickets boss Rob Wilmshurst, told MPs that bots were a “red herring” because touts have many ways to get hold of tickets. Asked if he would instead support a cap on the price of resold tickets, for example at face value plus 10%, Galbraith said: “We would be happy with that”. The committee also heard from Claire Turnham, who started a Victim of Viagogo campaign group after she and dozens of other fans were overcharged due to what the company said was a “glitch”. She said Viagogo did not make its prices clear, with hundreds of pounds in booking fees applied at the last minute. Turnham also pointed to messages on the website telling customers that they are running out of time to buy tickets and must hurry up or face disappointment. Huddleston , who used to work for Google, said Viagogo was “one of the most psychologically manipulative websites i’ve ever seen”. Viagogo declined to comment. MPs summoned Viagogo after revelations in The Guardian, including that it resold tickets for an Ed Sheeran gig in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust. It was also accused of trying to manipulate online reviews of its service in the light of negative publicity. The Guardian has previously revealed the names of some of the UK’s most powerful ticket touts, who use sites including Viagogo to make vast profits."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"law/2017/mar/27/donotpay-founder-too-many-students-still-have-the-establishment-mindset","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-27T14:45:01Z","webTitle":"Will robolawyers price humans out of the game?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/mar/27/donotpay-founder-too-many-students-still-have-the-establishment-mindset","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/mar/27/donotpay-founder-too-many-students-still-have-the-establishment-mindset","fields":{"headline":"Will robolawyers price humans out of the game?","bodyText":"Joshua Browder first made headlines last year with the success of his chatbot DoNotPay, designed to challenge parking fines as the “world’s first robot lawyer”. Inspired by a brush with London traffic cops after he passed his driving test, Browder thought only a handful of his friends and others would use it. Three years since DoNotPay’s launch, it’s been used to challenge $5m worth of tickets in London and New York, and help more than 250,000 people. “I can’t believe it,” he says. He has since expanded the service to help travellers claim compensation for delayed flights, homeless people in the UK apply for government housing and, most recently, to help those seeking asylum support in the UK and aid asylum claims in the US and Canada. Browder has several more projects up his sleeve – including developing applications around pensions, benefits and sexual harassment in the workplace. Few lawyers, Browder says, really understand how technology can be used for the benefit of clients, to provide quick solutions to their legal problems without the need for an expensive appointment. But then most legal professionals have no incentive to do so. “Many lawyers are charging hundreds of pounds for copying and pasting documents – and the public knows it,” he says. Law firms are eager to use artificial intelligence to carry out document and contract review, due diligence and legal research. But advanced technology has generally only been used for the benefit of the law firms themselves, says Browder, and “there is not enough focus on the consumer”. So where do robots have the edge over lawyers? “Robots don’t show as much bias as humans,” he says, citing a US news article that suggested sleep-deprived judges pass harsher sentences once the clocks have sprung forward in the annual daylight saving change. In many areas of work, he suggests that robots will replace lawyers in the next 20-30 years. “I think my bot does a good job at replacing parking lawyers. I know there are thousands more technologists with decades of experience working on similar issues.” But Browder, who is now working with HMCTS (Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service) in its plans for online dispute resolution, accepts there are limits, and sees a distinction between applications in civil law and criminal law, where cases will generally be dealt with in court. “The law involves a lot of compassion. For example, [when deciding] whether someone should be granted bail. I think it is difficult for a bot to replace that. The legal system requires humans; technology isn’t allowed to argue in court.” Despite what he predicts will be a declining need for some roles in law, Browder says those entering the profession shouldn’t be too worried. But “many students still have the establishment mindset”, which they’d be better off dropping, he says. None of the law students he knows are being taught technology. “I’d teach every law student computer science.” Browder, who completed his A-levels at University College School in Hampstead, before heading to the US to study economics and computer science at Stanford University, California, doesn’t fancy crossing further over into the legal world. “In law, you have to work your way up for years to become a partner. In tech, if you have created something useful, you can see the impact from day one.” He says he is not driven by money, success or fame; he just wants to use his skills to help people. The public don’t pay to use his creations and that is something he wants to maintain. “If you are in a position to help people for free, it’s appropriate to take it.” Browder’s great-grandfather, Earl Browder, was the leader of the Communist Party in the US and ran for President against Franklin D Roosevelt in 1936. At the end of the Great Depression, he fought for workers’ rights and forced the largest steel company to increase their wages. Browder says he wants to emulate his ancestor using Facebook and the internet – and to help drag the law into the 21st century. “It’s really exciting to make the law free, and so fun to be able to create things that people use.” Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at @GdnStudents – and become a member to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/mar/21/trump-trade-deal-argentina-g-20","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T09:00:01Z","webTitle":"Argentina warns Trump: 'Nationalism will not make your economy richer'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/trump-trade-deal-argentina-g-20","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/mar/21/trump-trade-deal-argentina-g-20","fields":{"headline":"Argentina warns Trump: 'Nationalism will not make your economy richer'","bodyText":"Argentina, which is poised to take over the leadership of the G20 group of developed and developing nations later this year, has warned Donald Trump that protectionist trade strategies do not work. Nicolás Dujovne, the country’s finance minister, said that Argentina’s own recent anti-free trade policies showed that closing borders did more harm than good. “We’ve been there,” Dujovne told the Guardian . “Protectionism and nationalism will not make your economy richer and will not accelerate growth. It will increase stagnation and poverty.” Argentina’s centre-right president, Mauricio Macri, has moved the country in a markedly free-market direction after succeeding Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in December 2015, ending capital controls, and introducing an austerity programme and reduction in subsidies. Dujovne, in Britain after attending the weekend meeting of G20 finance ministers in Germany, said he wanted to send out a message that his country was keen on attracting inward investment from Britain and would be interested in a post-Brexit free trade deal. “The slogan of Kirchner was that she would like not to import even a single screw into Argentina,” Dujovne said. “We are opening up gradually but are still the most closed economy in Latin America. Argentina tried to follow a model of autarchy. Isolation was the goal of the government. We are just starting to join globalisation.” “Even if we see more protectionism in other parts of the world, at the end of that road these countries will never be as protectionist as Argentina has been for the past 15 years.” Dujovne said that one benefit of Trump’s protectionist approach was that the EU was now much keener on finalising a free-trade deal with Mercosur, the trade bloc that includes Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina. “We are in favour of globalisation,” Dujovne said. “We see trade as a source of opportunity and not as a threat.” Macri’s shock treatment for the Argentinian economy led to a deep recession during his first year in office, but Dujovne said the economy was finally growing again. He blamed Argentina’s economic problems in 2016 on the legacy of the previous government and a recession in Brazil, which he said had knocked 1% off growth in Argentina. Growth in the fourth quarter of last year on an annualised basis had reached 3.5% . Argentina’s largest trade union is preparing to mount a one-day general strike on 6 April – the first since Macri took office in December 2015. Labour unions claim wages have not kept up with inflation that reached 40% last year. Dujovne accused the strike instigators of being politically motivated ahead of midterm elections later this year. “There are sectors of society linked to the former government. There are a lot of people who depend on creating a sensation of instability, whether they will face judicial charges or not,” he said. Macri does not have an overall majority in the congress requiring him to build coalitions to win support for his plans to boost Latin America’s third largest economy. The finance minister said the vexed issue of sovereignty over the Falklands would not prevent closer economic ties with Britain. The focus of the new government has been to emphasise its areas of agreement with the UK, rather than the points of difference. “The issue of the sovereignty of the Malvinas is a national cause with 100% consensus, but I do not think the Argentinian population is against having close ties with the UK,” he said. In recent months, the UK and Argentina have opened up flights from the Falklands to South America, and started work on identifying the Argentinian war dead on the islands, part of a small number of confidence-building measures attempted by London and Buenos Aires."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/mar/20/england-biggest-crowd-olympic-stadium-world-cup-2019","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T22:13:00Z","webTitle":"England’s largest cricket crowd could fill London Stadium at World Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/20/england-biggest-crowd-olympic-stadium-world-cup-2019","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/mar/20/england-biggest-crowd-olympic-stadium-world-cup-2019","fields":{"headline":"England’s largest cricket crowd could fill London Stadium at World Cup","bodyText":"A deal to stage cricket World Cup matches at the London Stadium, potentially creating the biggest crowd in England in the modern history of the sport, is close to being secured as part of a wider push to popularise the game with new, younger audiences. As exclusively revealed in the Guardian in December, the ECB is understood to be hopeful of staging two separate matches at the former Olympic Stadium during the next ICC World Cup, taking place in England and Wales in 2019. One of the fixtures will feature England and could be watched by a crowd of 66,000, more than double the capacity of Lord’s. Negotiations are yet to be completed, but when asked about the possibility, the chief executive of the ECB, Tom Harrison, said: “It would be an amazing statement – 60,000 people in a ground in the UK watching World Cup cricket. It’s making a statement about what cricket means in this country.” Harrison was speaking at the launch of the ECB’s All Stars Cricket initiative, a scheme to attract children into the sport. It also comes as plans for a T20 tournament, with teams featuring, in Harrison’s words, “the best players in the world”, look set to be ratified. The initiatives will be seen by some as an attempt to redress a decade of lost opportunities as live cricket disappeared from free-to-air television and the Twenty20 format, invented in England, flourished to a greater extent overseas in the form of the Indian Premier League and Australia’s Big Bash. All Stars Cricket hopes to attract upwards of 50,000 children between the ages of five and eight each summer through an eight-week scheme run by local cricket clubs and funded by the ECB. The money comes as part of a £4m uplift in funding to increase participation in the sport. “It’s the right time to put cricket at the forefront of a child’s experience” said Harrison of the scheme. “It’s about winning the battle of the playground. We know that this age is crucial in a child deciding what they want to do in their spare time and in the past [learning cricket] has been a frustrating experience. It has been very much a case of ‘turn up in your whites and sit at third man for an hour’.” Harrison places an emphasis on persuading mothers to enrol their children in the scheme. He also sees mothers bringing children to watch live cricket as integral to the success of the T20 tournament expected to launch in the summer of 2020. Running alongside the successful T20 Blast tournament, the competition is expected to mimic the structure of Australia’s Big Bash League and will feature eight, new city-based teams. “I think it will be incredibly different,” said Harrison of the tournament. “It will feature the best players in the world, delivering ‘appointment to view’ [must-see TV] on a regular basis, and crucially you’re targeting a new audience, delivered through new brands that connect with them in a different way. We’ve seen what’s happened elsewhere in the world and we’ve got our own take on how we get that done. “Blast has been very successful for local audiences in grounds on Thursday and Friday evenings,” he added. “We will be creating a very different experience built around family entertainment and built around mum and dad feeling comfortable bringing the children down. It will run during weekends in the school holidays and we’ve positioned it deliberately because of that.” The tournament would begin at the same time as the ECB’s TV rights deal with Sky comes to an end, with some speculation suggesting it could be broadcast on free-to-air TV.Harrison stressed that if cricket is to find a new audience it must also develop its digital strategy. The ECB, he said, had visited California to meet social media companies and it “wouldn’t be long” before such a business made a “big bet” on sports rights. “The young positioning is right for cricket and it’s right for media partners”, Harrison said. “If you can get young people involved it’s a different conversation. We don’t want to have a question mark about being relevant.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/mar/20/robert-downey-jr-to-play-doctor-dolittle","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T18:38:03Z","webTitle":"Robert Downey Jr to play Doctor Dolittle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/20/robert-downey-jr-to-play-doctor-dolittle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/mar/20/robert-downey-jr-to-play-doctor-dolittle","fields":{"headline":"Robert Downey Jr to play Doctor Dolittle","bodyText":"Robert Downey Jr is set to play Doctor Dolittle in a new film based on the Hugh Lofting character. In The Voyage of Doctor Dolittle, the Iron Man star will follow in the footsteps of Rex Harrison and Eddie Murphy in the role of a physician who lives with a variety of animals that he’s able to talk to. There was a competitive battle for the project with Universal ultimately winning out. The project will be written and directed by Stephen Gaghan, who won an Oscar for his Traffic script and most recently directed Matthew McConaughey in Gold. The character originated in a set of books from Hugh Lofting in the 1920s and it’s unclear as to whether the new film will retain the same time period. The first big-screen adaptation saw Rex Harrison take on the role and it picked up a nomination for best picture at the Oscars. In 1998, Eddie Murphy played the character and the film was a hit, making $294m worldwide which led to a less successful big-screen follow-up and three later sequels which were released direct to video.

The former Manchester United defender revealed that without his wife or a football club to lean on, he “didn’t have a clue” how to make a doctor’s appointment. Ferdinand has also spoken of how difficult he found coping with being a single parent to his three children after he lost Rebecca to cancer in 2015. His sons, Lorenz and Tate, were then nine and six and his daughter, Tia, was four. The former England international made his remarks to the Radio Times before the broadcast of a BBC documentary, Rio Ferdinand: Being Mum and Dad. The hour-long programme will be shown at 9pm a week on Tuesday. “In football you don’t lift a finger until you go over the white line to play,” Ferdinand said. “Everything is done for you … Then at home we’d go on holiday, for instance, and all I had to do was pack my own bag because Rebecca packed.” He needed to adapt. “It was even, like: ‘How do I go to the doctor’s?’ I’d only ever seen the club doctor. I didn’t have a clue.” Ferdinand admits he initially felt inadequate when dealing with his children in Rebecca’s absence. “She used to fix their beds a certain way, and when they’d tell me it almost felt like a slight. I’d think: ‘Whatever I do isn’t going to be good enough.’” He also began to appreciate how much Rebecca had done for the children to ensure the smooth running of the house. “I used to wake up, get dressed, have some breakfast with them, and then I’d take them, drop them off and get out and go to training, and think I was doing my bit. But that’s the easy bit … Where are their shoes? Where are their clothes? Where are their bags?” The most difficult problem he faced was how to deal with his bereaved children and help them grieve. Ferdinand said one of his sons noticed a wall of greetings cards on their way out of the hospital. “He said: ‘What’s that Dad?’ I said: ‘Oh, that’s some of the thank you cards patients and families have left for the doctors and the nurses on the ward, for helping their mum and dad or whoever they’ve had up there.’ He went: ‘Well, they didn’t help my mum,’ and he just walked off.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/mar/20/momentum-no-secret-plot-want-fair-say-labour-party","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T16:11:24Z","webTitle":"There’s no secret plot.

Momentum just wants a fair say in the Labour party","bodyText":"Another week, and yet another fierce debate as the battle for the soul of the Labour party continues. Tom Watson has warned of an “entryism threat”, and, for his part, been accused of “a concerted attempt to interfere” in Unite’s general secretary election. The row follows the publication of a secret recording of a Momentum meeting, which Sunday’s Observer said revealed a “hard-left plot by supporters of Jeremy Corbyn to seize permanent control of the Labour party and consolidate their power by formally joining forces with the super-union Unite”. In the recording, Momentum founder Jon Lansman says Unite and the Communication Workers Union are likely to affiliate to the left faction. He calls on party activists to mobilise to ensure Corbyn supporters are selected as delegates for this year’s party conference – where a controversial rule change that would reduce the threshold of votes needed for leadership nominations from MPs and MEPs could be heard. The reality is that this is not a secret plot at all, but the natural machinations of an unpleasant but inevitable internal struggle. Labour First, the “traditional right” faction, has avidly fought to win positions at constituency level. Its own admirable organising efforts ahead of last year’s conference ensured that equally controversial changes to weaken Corbyn’s majority on the national executive were carried. Though we’re now well used to senior Labour figures deploying the “late-night typewriter”, the party’s deputy leader telling a fellow member, “you have to be stopped” on Twitter is still extraordinary. But perhaps it speaks to a desperation that is felt by many Labour MPs at present. Not only is the party led by a faction they thought was dead in the water, but they are completely powerless to stop it. Though they were intending to weaken affiliated unions, party chiefs unwittingly shifted the balance of power from the parliamentary party to the grassroots with the Collins report. The biggest lesson from Owen Smith’s failed leadership challenge last year is that this shift is now irreversible. MPs’ no-confidence vote proved entirely futile, and an attempted fix to keep Corbyn off the ballot paper also failed. Party operators were successful in denying votes to new members, but this was not enough to change the outcome. Indeed, these moves strengthened Corbyn’s position. Not only did they fuel the “coup” rhetoric of the time, they also alerted new members to the importance of Labour’s arcane, confusing and downright boring party structures. So Momentum’s strategy of mobilising members within these structures is undoubtedly the winning one. Labour MPs may argue that a leader without parliamentary support lacks legitimacy, but they may as well argue, to paraphrase Brecht, to dissolve the Labour membership and elect another. Keeping a left candidate off the ballot paper, which is the essence of opposition to the “McDonnell amendment”, would be the death knell for the party. So-called moderates hope to change the tide by getting Gerard Coyne elected to lead Unite in place of Len McCluskey, but this looks increasingly unlikely. If Labour’s right wing is to regain control of the party, it will certainly not be thanks to the efforts of MPs. To some extent Labour First and the Blairite faction Progress recognise this, which is why they are investing time and effort in organising in the local lay structures. But in a mass-membership party, they will struggle to carry on winning once the Corbyn-supporting membership wakes up to the importance of process. Labour’s conference arrangements committee, the body that will decide if the changes to leadership election rules will be heard at the conference, is partially up for election this year. Members are currently represented on this body by the MP Gloria De Piero and former MEP Lord Cashman, who were backed by Labour First and Progress. But they were elected before there was much consciousness in the membership as to the importance of such structures under a left leadership. Given the left’s overwhelming victory in the national executive elections last year, former union leader Billy Hayes and left activist Seema Chandwani could well be on course to unseat them. Internal warfare is undoubtedly doing damage to Labour’s prospects. But it’s easily forgotten these days that Labour lost two successive general elections before anyone even contemplated Corbyn becoming its leader. Social democracy across Europe is in crisis: the Dutch Labour party lost three-quarters of its seats in last week’s elections. Until MPs see mass membership as an asset rather than a menacing, entryist force, it is hard to foresee reconciliation. If the Labour right or the “soft left” wants to win over members, they must offer a vision of what they stand for that goes beyond Tony Blair’s third way or Ed Miliband’s “responsible capitalism”. And until they do, more importantly, it is hard to believe they are more likely to win a general election than Jeremy Corbyn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2017/mar/21/abel-prize-2017-yves-meyer-wins-maths-nobel-for-work-on-wavelets","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T11:02:26Z","webTitle":"Abel Prize 2017: Yves Meyer wins 'maths Nobel' for work on wavelets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2017/mar/21/abel-prize-2017-yves-meyer-wins-maths-nobel-for-work-on-wavelets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2017/mar/21/abel-prize-2017-yves-meyer-wins-maths-nobel-for-work-on-wavelets","fields":{"headline":"Abel Prize 2017: Yves Meyer wins 'maths Nobel' for work on wavelets","bodyText":"French mathematician Yves Meyer was today awarded the 2017 Abel Prize for his work on wavelets, a mathematical theory with applications in data compression, medical imaging and the detection of gravitational waves. Meyer, 77, will receive 6 million Norwegian krone (about £600,000) for the prize, which recognises outstanding contributions to mathematics and is awarded by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. The Abel Prize has been awarded annually since 2003 and was last year won by Briton Andrew Wiles for his work on solving Fermat’s Last Theorem. It is considered by many to be a maths equivalent of the Nobel Prize, which has no prize for mathematics. The Norwegian Academy released the following biography of Meyer this morning, written by Philip Ball, which explains his work in an accessible way. I’m reprinting it here in full. A biography of Yves Meyer Yves Meyer, professor emeritus at the École normale supérieure Paris-Saclay in France, proves that, in contrast to what F. Scott Fitzgerald said about American lives; in mathematics a life can indeed have a second act, and perhaps even several more. Having made important contributions in the field of number theory early in his career, Meyer’s boundless energy and curiosity prompted him to work on methods for breaking down complex mathematical objects into simpler wavelike components – a topic called harmonic analysis. This led him in turn to help construct a theory for analysing complicated signals, with important ramifications for computer and information technologies. Then he moved on again to tackle fundamental problems in the mathematics of fluid flow. That tendency to cross boundaries was with him from the start. Born on 19 July 1939 of French nationality, he grew up in Tunis on the North African coast. “The Tunis of my childhood was a melting pot where people from all over the Mediterranean had found sanctuary,” he said in a 2011 interview. “As a child I was obsessed by the desire of crossing the frontiers between these distinct ethnic groups.” Meyer entered the élite École normale supérieure de la rue d’Ulm in Paris in 1957, coming first in theentrance examination. “If you enter ENSUlm, you know that you are giving up money and power,” he later said. “It is a choice of life. Your life will be devoted to acquiring and transmitting knowledge.” After graduating, Meyer completed his military service as a teacher in a military school. But despite his deep commitment to education and his students, he wasn’t suited to the role. “A good teacher needs to be much more methodical and organised than I was,” he admits. Moreover, he was uncomfortable with being the one who was “always right”.“To do research,” Meyer has said, “is to be ignorant most of the time and often to make mistakes.” Nevertheless, he feels his experience of high school teaching shaped his life: “I understood that I was more happy to share than to possess.” He joined the University of Strasbourg as a teaching assistant, and in 1966 he was awarded a PhD there – officially under Jean-Pierre Kahane, but Meyer assertsthat, like some others in France at that time, he essentially supervised himself. He became a professor of mathematics first at the Université Paris-Sud (as it is now known), then the École Polytechnique and the Université Paris-Dauphine. He moved to the ENS Cachan (recently renamed the ENS Paris-Saclay) in 1995, where he worked at the Centre of Mathematics and its Applications (CMLA) until formally retiring in 2008. But he is still an associate member of the research centre. Searching for structure Yves Meyer’s work has, in the most general terms, been concerned with understanding mathematical functions with complex and changing forms: a character that can be described by so-called partial differential equations. Fluid flow, for example, is described by a set of such equations called the Navier- Stokes equations, and in the 1990s Meyer helped to elucidate particular solutions to them – a topic that ranks among the biggest challenges in maths. Meyer’s interest in what might be called the structures and regularities of complicated mathematical objects led him in the 1960s to a theory of “model sets”: a means of describing arrays of objects that lack the perfect regularity and symmetry of crystal lattices. This work, which arose from number theory, provided the underpinning theory for materials called quasicrystals, first identified in metal alloys in 1982 but prefigured by quasi-regular tiling schemes identified by mathematical physicist Roger Penrose in 1974. The discovery of quasicrystals by materials scientist Dan Shechtman earned him the 2011 Nobel Prize in chemistry. Meyer has sustained his interest in quasicrystals, and together with Basarab Matei in 2010 he helped to elucidate their mathematical structure. In the 1970s Meyer made profound contributions to the field of harmonic analysis, which seeks to decompose complex functions and signals into components made of simple waves. Along with Ronald Coifman and Alan McIntosh, he solved a long-standing problem in the field in 1982 by proving a theorem about a construction called the Cauchy integral operator. This interest in harmonic decomposition led Meyer into wavelet theory, which enables complex signals to be “atomised” into a kind of mathematical particle called a wavelet. Wavelet theory began with the work of, among others, physics Nobel laureates Eugene Wigner and Dennis Gabor, geophysicist Jean Morlet, theoretical physicist Alex Grossmann, and mathematician Jan-Olov Strömberg. During a conversation over the photocopier at the École Polytechnique in 1984, Meyer was handed a paper on the subject by Grossmann and Morlet, and was captivated. “I took the first train to Marseilles, where I met Ingrid Daubechies, Alex Grossmann and Jean Morlet”, he says. “It was like a fairy tale. I felt I had finally found my home.” Breaking down complexity From the mid-1980s, in what he called a “second scientific life”, Meyer, together with Daubechies and Coifman, brought together earlier work on wavelets into a unified picture. In particular, Meyer showed how to relate Grossmann and Morlet’s wavelets to the work of Argentinian mathematician Alberto Calderón, which had supplied the basis for some of Meyer’s most significant contributions to harmonic analysis. In 1986 Meyer and Pierre Gilles Lemarié-Rieusset showed that wavelets may form mutually independent sets of mathematical objects called orthogonal bases. Coifman, Daubechies and Stéphane Mallat went on to develop applications to many problems in signal and image processing. Wavelet theory is now omnipresent in many such technologies. Wavelet analysis of images and sounds allows them to be broken down into mathematical fragments that capture the irregularities of the pattern using smooth, “well-behaved” mathematical functions. This decomposition is important for image compression in computer science, being used for example in the JPEG 2000 format. Wavelets are also useful for characterising objects with very complex shapes, such as so-called multifractals, and Meyer says that they prompted his interest in the Navier- Stokes equations in the mid-1990s. In the past twenty years Meyer’s passion for the structure of oscillating patterns has led him to contribute to the success of the Herschel deep-space telescope mission, and he is working on algorithms to detect cosmic gravitational waves. Meyer’s contribution to image processing is also wide-ranging. In 2001 he proposed a mathematical theory to decompose any image into a “cartoon” and a “texture”. This “cartoon plus texture” algorithm is now routinely used in criminal investigations to extract digital fingerprints from a complex background. In such ways, Meyer’s work has a relevance extending from theoretical areas of mathematics such as harmonic analysis to the development of practical tools in computer and information science. As such, it is a perfect example of the claim that work in pure mathematics often turns out to have important and useful real-world applications. An intellectual nomad Meyer is a member of the French Academy of Science and an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His previous prizes include the Salem (1970) and Gauss (2010) prizes, the latter awarded jointly by the International Mathematical Union and the German Mathematical Society for advances in mathematics that have had an impact outside the field. The diversity of his work, reflected in its broad range of application, reflects his conviction that intellectual vitality is kept alive by facing fresh challenges. He has been quoted as saying that when you become too much an expert in a field then you should leave it – but he is wary of sounding arrogant here. “I am not smarter than my more stable colleagues,” he says simply. “I have always been a nomad – intellectually and institutionally.” Some feel that Meyer has not yet had the recognition his profound achievements warrant, perhaps because he has been so selfless in promoting the careers of others and in devoting himself to mathematical education as well as research. “The progress of mathematics is a collective enterprise,” he has said. “All of us are needed.” He has inspired a generation of mathematicians who have gone on to make important contributions in their own right. His collaborator on wavelet theory Stéphane Mallat calls him a “visionary” whose work cannot be labelled either pure or applied mathematics, nor computer science either, but simply “amazing”. His students and colleagues speak of his insatiable curiosity, energy, generosity and openness to other fields. “You must dig deeply into your own self in order to do something as difficult as research in mathematics,” Meyer claims. “You need to believe that you possess a treasure hidden in the depths of your mind, a treasure which has to be unveiled.” I blog about maths for The Guardian here.

Throughout these years, he was closely involved with the CIA and the White House, allowing weapons to pass through Panama for use against the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua, and supplying information on Central American guerrilla movements. At the same time, he was linked to the Medellín drug cartel and the drug lord Pablo Escobar in Colombia, who used Panama as a staging post for trafficking to the US. Although Noriega was convinced that his links with the CIA and Washington would protect him, by the time of the 1988 US presidential elections his name and reputation had become an embarrassment to them. A committee of the US Senate accused him of establishing, with US connivance, the “first narco-kleptocracy in the western hemisphere”. He was indicted in the US on drug trafficking charges but would not hand himself in. His refusal to accept the results of the 1989 elections in Panama, which gave victory to an anti-Noriega candidate, Guillermo Endara, and the violence his followers used against the politicians who had won the vote, proved the last straw. The newly elected George HW Bush ordered the invasion of Panama, and the arrest of Noriega. In December 1989 some 25,000 US troops – the largest number deployed since the war in Vietnam – took over Panama City. Hundreds of Panamanian soldiers and civilians were killed by bombings and in combat. Noriega fled to the Vatican embassy for asylum, but surrendered after several days of a tense stand-off. He was taken in chains to Florida to face trial. Although the United Nations General Assembly condemned the US action as a gross violation of international law, and there were protests around the world at this latest example of high-handed intervention by the US in Latin America, Noriega received little popular support in his own country. In September 1992 he was sentenced to 40 years in prison in the US for drug trafficking, money laundering and racketeering. Imprisoned in Miami, he was treated as a prisoner of war, and accorded the privileges due to his rank as a four-star general, including a suite of rooms. In jail, he told a British journalist: “I have not changed my ideals, my patriotism, my nationalism, my concept of the US. I am not changed. I regret nothing.” Born in Panama City, the son of Ricaurte Noriega, an accountant, and his maid, Maria Feliz Morena, Manuel was brought up in a foster home from the age of five. He joined the army as a cadet at the age of 14: since he had both African and indigenous blood, this was one of the few institutions in Panama that could offer him social advancement. He acquired the nickname “Pineapple Face”, his heavily pockmarked features the result of a childhood illness. Part of his military training was carried out in the US, where he was recruited by the CIA. In 1967 he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Panamanian National Guard, and in the years that followed became a supporter of the head of the army, Omar Torrijos, who appointed him chief of military intelligence. Following Torrijos’s death in a plane crash in 1981, which some claim Noriega orchestrated, he became the head of the renamed National Defence Forces and thus the most powerful man in Panama, where the elected president and congress did not have any real power. His mixed race background initially gave him a popular base of support, but he was opposed by the traditional political parties. Under pressure from the US, Noriega permitted presidential elections in 1984, but the results were manipulated so that his placeman, Nicolás Barletta, was adjudged to have won. In the 1989 elections, Endara’s victory was so decisive that even Noriega’s placeman accepted it. Nevertheless Endara and his vice-president, Guillermo Ford, were badly beaten up when they tried to hold a parade claiming victory, and Noriega declared the election null and void. This was the beginning of the end for him. Although Noriega was due to be released from prison in the US after serving 17 years of his sentence, he faced charges of money laundering in France, and so in 2010 was flown directly from jail in Florida to Paris. This time he was sentenced to seven years. However, he was handed over to Panama a year later as he was also a wanted man there. After several years in El Renacer prison, near Panama City, he was released under house arrest early this year for an operation to remove a brain tumour. He is survived by his wife, Felicidad, and three daughters, Thays, Sandra and Lorena. • Manuel Antonio Noriega Moreno, politician and military officer, born 11 February 1934; died 29 May 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/mar/25/you-know-what-you-could-be-by-mike-heron-and-andrew-greig-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-25T09:00:05Z","webTitle":"You Know What You Could Be review – a Scottish tale of psychedelic folk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/25/you-know-what-you-could-be-by-mike-heron-and-andrew-greig-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/mar/25/you-know-what-you-could-be-by-mike-heron-and-andrew-greig-review","fields":{"headline":"You Know What You Could Be review – a Scottish tale of psychedelic folk","bodyText":"This book is a freak, a fairground mermaid, half monkey, half fish. It is therefore entirely in keeping with its subject, the Incredible String Band, the 1960s group that was never quite one thing nor another – folk or rock or world music – but always a mingling of influences, voices and styles. You Know What You Could Be is a joint memoir, at times a joints memoir, written by the String Band’s Mike Heron and the poet Andrew Greig. Despite being the marquee name and main draw, Heron here plays the support act in his own story. His contribution comes first and takes up not quite a third of the book. He sometimes uses the present tense (“I’m back at the drug emporium two days later”) to describe the years between 1957, when he is a 15-year-old Edinburgh schoolboy, and 1966, when he is on the brink of becoming a star. Greig picks up the story in the late autumn of ’67, writing in the past tense about how he, still at school in Fife, had his mind blown by the String Band, and was inspired to form his own version, Fate &amp; ferret, the ampersand and lower case “f” a nod to ee cummings. A cynic might view this as the incomplete autobiography of Heron, a cut’n’shut that required Greig’s writerly talent and experience to bulk it out and make it work. Even if that is true, the book does work, in part because of the similarities between the two men. Heron and Greig are sons of the stifled Scottish middle class. Heron’s father was a teacher, Greig’s a doctor. The sounds of their homes were the rustling pages of the Scotsman and the mantelpiece clock, ticking down the seconds until they would have to leave school and get that dreaded thing – a proper job. Heron’s descriptions of life in 1950s and early 60s Edinburgh have a winningly dour Ivor Cutler-ish air. It is a place that smells of half-strained jam, stewed tea, overheating Bakelite. Heron attends George Heriot’s, the fee-paying school where his father is head of English. He could almost be one of the boys at the start of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, holding their bicycles in front of them as a shield against the girls of Marcia Blaine, except one senses that Heron was never much of a flirter, and was mainly attracted, at this time, to rock’n’roll and then folk. Back in 1962, Heron was still “almost an accountant”, packing a bong and the I Ching to liven up evenings in Perth while on a five-day audit of the Hydro‑Electric Board. He could not have known it, but that train journey over the Forth Bridge took him into an area of Scotland that was home to his future acolyte, Greig. “A beggar’s mantle fringed with gold” was James VI’s description of Fife, a very String Band sort of image, and Greig lived on that golden fringe, in the coastal area known as the East Neuk. He has a knack for refracted memoir, viewing his own life through strange prisms and other lives. This is his third book of that sort, following Preferred Lies (“A journey to the heart of golf”) and At the Loch of the Green Corrie, an account of fishing and friendship with the late poet Norman MacCaig. As he writes towards the end of You Know What You Could Be, “Other people’s memories can lodge in us as though they were ours.” The Incredible String Band – Heron and Robin Williamson – were artists from the margins who found themselves, for a time, at the centre of things. As Fate &amp; ferret, Greig and his friend George Boyter were on the margins of a margin, the fringe of the fringe; living in Fife, not even in Edinburgh, and a long way from London, they regard the counterculture from afar and create their own version, heading into the woods and fields to play their songs. That they never make it is no shame; the String Band, too, fell short of the massive commercial success they might have expected. This, after all, is how most stories go. Could turns into ought and finally won’t. Accepting that is a condition of contentment. As Greig puts it, with typical elegiac wisdom, “Not getting what you once dreamed of is the story of most of our lives. What you do get is your actual life – which, looked at closely, may turn out to be what it is because of the manner in which your hopes, ideals and delusions did not come to pass.” • You Know What You Could Be is published by riverrun.

In a speech at the inauguration ceremony in the Belgian capital’s European quarter, King Philippe urged citizens to listen to each other and draw lessons from the attack. “It’s the responsibility of each and every one of us to make our society more humane, and more just. Let’s learn to listen to each other again, to respect each other’s weaknesses,” he said. “Above all, let us dare to be tender.” The memorial sculpture, called “Wounded but still standing in the face of the unthinkable”, is 20 metres long and 2 metres high and takes the form of a pair of stainless steel slabs bending to the sky in a gesture of hope. The Brussels-born sculptor Jean-Henri Compère said he wanted the work to evoke hope and pay tribute to public resilience in the face of the attacks. The monument is dedicated to the victims of terrorist attacks in Brussels, but also those who lost their lives or suffered injuries in recent attacks in France, Tunisia and Turkey. The ceremony was also attended by Queen Mathilde, as well as some of the survivors and victims’ families. Earlier on Wednesday morning, the royal couple joined the prime minister, Charles Michel, for a ceremony at Brussels airport, where a one-minute silence at 7.58am marked the moment the first explosion ripped through the departure terminal. Airport staff, security and rescue personnel stood watch as King Philippe laid a wreath outside the departure hall. Another event took place at Maelbeek metro station, where a bomb exploded at 9.11am. Instead of silence, the Brussels public transport authority, known by its French acronym Stib, called on the travelling public to join staff in “a minute of noise to show that we have not forgotten but remain standing against hate and terror”. The entire metro network stopped for one minute and passengers were invited to applaud. One year on from the worst violence on Belgian soil since the end of the second world war, the country is still coming to terms with the attacks. Michel said at the weekend that authorities could have done a better job in providing support to some of the victims, amid concern about patchy follow-on care for people with severe, life-changing injuries. “In a certain number of cases there has not been enough proactivity, individualised follow-up of the victims,” he told public broadcaster RTBF. Michel said he had felt “shaken” after a recent meeting with victims’ families and urged insurance companies to speed up compensation payments. Commemorative events are also taking place in Place de la Bourse in front of the old Brussels stock exchange, scene of a spontaneous memorial in the days after the attacks. Services are being held in cathedrals and churches, including in Molenbeek, the socially mixed district in western Brussels that became notorious after it was found to be a base for the network that launched a series of terrorist attacks. Compère discovered to his surprise that he lived only 500 metres away from a flat used by the Brussels attackers in Schaerbeek, another district where social deprivation and solid middle-class families are mixed together. The sculptor, equally well known in Belgium for his long career as an actor in film, theatre and TV, was chosen by a government commission to make the memorial, following a competition. He said Belgium had been changed by the attacks, which had made the country more vigilant. “It happened and it can happen again,” he said. Soldiers in army fatigues carrying guns continue to patrol streets and metro stations, guard embassies and public buildings. The lower parts of the sculpture that sit on the ground are pitted with holes and marks intended to evoke the violence of terrorist attacks. The surface becomes smooth again as the steel bends to the sky. “The stainless steel is wounded, crushed [and] when you walk along those marks disappear,” Compère said. The shiny material is also intended to reflect the weather and mood of the passing seasons. “I want this sculpture to be a reflection of what people feel and the weather will help me to do that. When it rains, it reflects tears. [When it is] just grey, sadness. When the sun is shining, there is hope and pleasant thoughts about the wounded and those who are not there.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/mar/20/schools-funding-formula-change-risks-childrens-futures","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T18:46:50Z","webTitle":"Schools funding formula change risks children’s futures | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/mar/20/schools-funding-formula-change-risks-childrens-futures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/mar/20/schools-funding-formula-change-risks-childrens-futures","fields":{"headline":"Schools funding formula change risks children’s futures","bodyText":"I chair the Barnsley comprehensive school featured by you last week (Education, 17 March) and for Deborah Orr (Opinion, 18 March) to say, in effect, that those of us fighting for fair funding in our schools are “wilfully damaging” education elsewhere is deeply offensive. We know that all schools need more money, but surely some need it more than others and the idea that with more money we can level-up is pure rhetorical fantasy. Last week’s Education Policy Institute report on the implications of the national funding formula laid bare the fact that 882 schools are more than 10% above their proposed fair funding. To level all schools up to this would cost over £3bn – on top of the £3bn needed to cover the 8% rise in schools’ costs. Expecting £6bn from any government is disingenuous stalling, and playing games with our children’s futures. Equality is never quick or easy, and vested interests always start with the loudest voice and most power. If we are serious about social mobility, we must press on with the funding reforms and stop playing politics. David O’Hara Chair of governors, Penistone Grammar school • Our borough of Tower Hamlets remains one of the most deprived in the country, and yet despite all of the difficulties that our residents face, school standards have continued to improve. This is all now at risk as the government pushes ahead with new school funding proposals that will take money away from poor areas such as ours and hand it to schools in areas that are frequently better off. A report by the Education Policy Institute into the effects of the plans on Tower Hamlets has revealed that 83 primary and secondary schools would face budget cuts, with spending per pupil set to drop from £6,906 to £6,718 a year. The new formula will result in cuts in the number of teaching assistants, increased class sizes, fewer subject options at GCSE and A-level, and increased pressure on leaders in schools as the number of senior and middle leaders is reduced. This will result in a further negative impact on our nursery schools. Years of real progress are being put at risk by these reckless proposals. It seems to many in our borough that we are being punished for being successful. I have written to the education secretary outlining the objections that so many parents and teachers have voiced in our borough. Yet Tower Hamlets is far from being the only deprived area set to lose out. What is needed is a united voice from across the country demanding that the government think again – and think again fast before irreparable damage is done to the prospects of our young people.

But it also changed literary history. A group of friends working in the world of books and magazines were dismayed at the decline of American literary journalism and book reviewing. With no New York Times to review new books and nowhere for publishers to place their advertising, they thought they saw an opportunity. Working quickly, they produced a new journal, which appeared for the first time on 1 February 1963, and was called the New York Review of Books. None of the contributors was paid, which was the more remarkable given their eminence: “Bill Styron, Cal [the poet Robert Lowell], Gore [Vidal], Norman Mailer on Hemingway; and then of course Lizzie [Hardwick] did a piece on Ring Lardner.” Those were the words of Robert Silvers, who co-edited the Review with Barbara Epstein from the beginning, who outlived her and almost everyone else concerned with its creation, and who has died at the age of 87, still editor after 54 years. And far from only in name: he edited much of the content until Epstein died in 2006, and all of it from then until his final illness. Silvers was born in Mineola, a village on Long Island, the son of a businessman, James, and a music critic, Rose (nee Roden), and his early life was a story of astonishing precocity. The University of Chicago then had a minimum age limit and Silvers entered just after his 15th birthday. By 19 he had graduated and, after briefly and fruitlessly studying law, had found a first job, as press secretary to Chester Bowles, the governor of Connecticut. Drafted into the US Army, Silvers had the good fortune to be posted to the SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe) base in Paris, where military duties left him time to study at the Sorbonne and Sciences Po. He remained in Paris after he left the army, working for the small Noonday Press before George Plimpton asked him to join his new Paris Review. Plimpton later said that Silvers “made the Paris Review what it was”. Becoming an editor “seemed to me quite a natural thing,” Silvers told Andrew Brown of the Guardian more than 50 years later, “something I could do without even making a choice”. In 1958, still in his 20s, Silvers was hired as literary editor of Harper’s, the long-established New York monthly, by its editor John Fischer, who may have had second thoughts the following year. Silvers commissioned the critic Elizabeth Hardwick to write a long essay, The Decline of Book Reviewing, a trenchant attack on the prevailing middle-brow mediocrity found in the books pages of the New York Times, among others. Fischer was so alarmed by its vehemence that he published a disavowal at its foot. At the time Hardwick was married to Lowell, and it was they, Epstein and her husband, Jason, who plotted over supper about a new review to take advantage of the strike. They asked Silvers to join them, and Fischer gave him leave, saying his job would be open when the new venture collapsed within a few months. “We wanted to show what a paper could be,” Silvers said, and they did, inspired by Silvers’s own creed, not to waste time on books “trivial in their intentions or venal in their effects, except occasionally to reduce a temporarily inflated reputation or call attention to a fraud”. Before long the New York Review of Books had become an indispensable feature of literary life on both sides of the Atlantic. Its glittering early roster of contributors included, apart from those in the first issue, WH Auden, Hannah Arendt, Susan Sontag, Saul Bellow, Mary McCarthy, James Baldwin, Isaiah Berlin and Edmund Wilson, the last of whom conducted a famous feud with Vladimir Nabokov in the pages of the Review. Quite soon, the Review had found a political cause and become a sounding board for opponents of the Vietnam war. One issue published a diagram of a homemade bomb on the cover which, along with the Review’s large array of transatlantic writers, prompted someone to call it the “the journal of mad dogs and Englishmen”. For Tom Wolfe it was “the chief theoretical organ of radical chic”, and Bellow derided “the New York Review of each other’s books”. Inevitably there was some truth in these barbs, if not much, but any defects were always outweighed by the Review’s sheer scope, and the excellence of its writing under Silvers’s tutelage. Few editors have ever shown such total devotion to their paper. Silvers appeared to work all day and often all night, seven days a week, all year round, sometimes sleeping in the office. Stories abounded of his obsessive attention to detail, and indifference to clock or calendar. Timothy Garton Ash’s family lunch on Christmas Day was interrupted by Silvers on the telephone saying that “on column six of the third galley, there’s a dangling modifier,” and when Daniel Mendelsohn was on board a ship in the Aegean, he was summoned to receive a call with an urgency which made him think there must be a death in the family, but heard instead Silvers’s voice suggesting that a semicolon should be changed to a full point. In 1979 the New York Review begat the London Review of Books, in similar circumstances to its own birth: the year-long closure of the Times and TLS. They went their different ways and developed diverse characters. Years later Perry Anderson contrasted the two, suggesting that the LRB was more daring politically, but the NYRB less respectful of literary reputation, citing John Banville’s mauling of Saturday by Ian McEwan in the New York Review as something the LRB would not have published. However that might be, the political point was unjust, since the Iraq war proved in some ways the New York Review’s finest hour, and Silvers’s. It is too conveniently forgotten that the war was supported at the time by most of the American media (not to say most of the London press) and the rare voices of opposition came from an likely pair of comrades. One was the Knight-Ridder newspaper chain, whose reporters sought out sources lower down in the intelligence community to expose the fraudulence of claims about Iraqi weaponry. For its part, the New York Review provided the heavyweight analysis needed to expose the chicanery of the Bush administration. At the same time, Silvers encouraged a debate in his pages over Israel and Zionism, of a kind the mainstream American press shied away from. “I put my name on the paper, and the rest I don’t care to be known,” Silvers said many years ago, adding in a comparatively rare interview in 2008 that “The editor is a middleman. The one thing he should avoid is taking credit. It’s the writer that counts.” This might give a misleading impression of a hermit, which Silvers was not. When the New York Review began, the English revue Beyond the Fringe was playing on Broadway. Silvers met Jonathan Miller, one of the quartet in the show, and recruited him to review John Updike’s novel The Centaur in the first issue. Years later Miller remembered Silvers at that time, dishevelled, overweight and chain-smoking, a contrast indeed to the figure of notable elegance and urbanity he became in later years, in well-cut suits, with the ribbon of the Legion D’Honneur in the lapel. He was often seen around and about in New York, at dinner parties, and at the opera, which he loved. He was showered with many honours. Silvers was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, was awarded the National Humanities Medal by President Barack Obama in 2012, and received honorary degrees from Harvard, Columbia, Oxford and Bard College. He co-edited Thirty Years of the New York Review of Books 1963-1993, and edited other anthologies, including Writing in America (1960), Hidden Histories of Science (1995), and two volumes (2006 and 2011) of The Company They Kept: Writers on Unforgettable Friendships. At his most alarming, Silver could “unfriend” (to use a term he wouldn’t have understood) a contributor, who would be bewilderingly dropped for years without explanation. At his most endearing, he was like a stern but kindly don. His quiet rebukes were devastating, but a word of praise from him would leave a writer exhilarated for days. With all his meticulosity, Silvers treated writers with complete respect. Nothing written for the New York Review was rewritten without the writer’s approval. Although Silvers was unmarried, he was not celibate. The women in his life included Lady Caroline Blackwood, between her marriages to Lucian Freud and Lowell, before he met Grace Dudley, a fascinating woman of Yugoslav origin, once married to Prince Radziwill and widow of the 3rd Earl of Dudley, with whom he lived for many years in an apartment on Park Avenue, and at a house in Lausanne in Switzerland. Her death in December devastated Silvers. In the end, nothing about what Silvers was mattered beside what he did, and what he achieved with the New York Review of Books, his enduring monument. To say that he was the greatest editor of his age is superfluous: he had no possible rival. • Robert Benjamin Silvers, editor, born 31 December 1929; died 20 March 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2017/apr/13/i-liked-elephant-heart-it-was-soft-and-very-tasty","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-13T05:00:17Z","webTitle":"‘I liked elephant heart.

It was soft and very tasty’","bodyText":"I was born in Kinigi, in Rwanda’s Musanze district, about 65 years ago, and it is still my home. I come from the Batwa community; we are very short people. There are about 400 of us, which makes us the smallest tribe in Rwanda. We lived in the forests long before the government took them over, and we were known as their keepers. They meant everything to us. I did not even know what a school was. Like my parents, my brother and my two sisters, all I knew was life in the forest. For many years we depended on bush meat to feed ourselves. We also gathered fruit. We are good hunters and got used to killing any animal we wanted. I started hunting at the age of 15, mostly with arrows but sometimes with traps. I could not afford a gun. My friends liked me because no animal could escape when we met. As well as small creatures like squirrels, hares and porcupines, I killed at least 200 big animals such as bushbucks and buffaloes – maybe more. We sold some of the meat for small amounts of money that we used to buy things like maize flour to supplement our diet. When I got married, this helped me to feed my wife and five children. Sometimes we chanced upon “the big one” – the elephant. This was dangerous because it would fight back and chase us. And elephants are fast. We were happy when we killed one since it would feed us for many days, but I only liked the heart and the liver. These are very soft and tasty. We would also trade the ivory for other foodstuffs. I hear some people made a lot of money selling ivory. But all the Batwa wanted was food, by whatever means. I loved bush meat – it was always fresh. But it was also very tough, as you can see from the number of teeth I have lost. I used to think I was as strong as a lion but I was wrong. One day the government came and told us that killing animals was illegal. Animals must be protected so that visitors could come and see them and pay money. This did not make sense to me. I only killed what my family and I needed to survive. I had been looking after the forest, although nobody had paid me for it. I could not understand how after 40 years it was now illegal to hunt animals. And so I carried on. I was not the only one, and many of the other hunters were arrested and sent to jail. It was sad. How can you be locked up simply for eating your staple diet? However, I learned that some had been capturing baby gorillas and selling them to white people as pets. The government called us ba rushimusi (poachers). Was I a rushimusi? I didn’t think so. Then, in 2004, Edwin Sabuhoro arrived, with the job of protecting animals in what was now the Volcanoes National Park. He was a clever man. He met 100 of us and said he wanted to help us get food without killing animals. Again, I could not understand how that would be possible. But he told us he had a plan. He had convinced the government not to jail us if tried another way of putting food on the table. Edwin told us that he had saved some of his salary and that he was going to use the money to rent farms where we could grow food. We liked the idea, though we had never farmed before. I stopped hunting that same year. Within six months, we were producing enough potatoes, maize and wheat to feed ourselves – and a surplus to sell. When others in the forest heard about it, they came and joined us. Two years later, Edwin helped us to establish the Iby’Iwacu cultural village, where we now entertain foreigners who come to Rwanda to see the gorillas. Tourists pay to stay here, and we sell our arts and crafts. We use the proceeds to preserve the same animals we used to kill. As well as accompanying tourists on gorilla tracking expeditions, I try to hunt down anybody who wants to harm the elephants and gorillas and buffaloes. I have not caught anyone yet – but nobody will hurt the animals as long as I live. I am ready to die to protecting them. Being a rushimusi is bad. Anyone still killing animals in the forest should find another way to make a living. If I can, they can. With thanks to Edwin Sabuhoro."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/mar/21/french-interior-minister-resigns-holiday-jobs-daughters-bruno-le-roux","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T18:08:19Z","webTitle":"French interior minister quits over holiday jobs for his daughters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/french-interior-minister-resigns-holiday-jobs-daughters-bruno-le-roux","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/mar/21/french-interior-minister-resigns-holiday-jobs-daughters-bruno-le-roux","fields":{"headline":"French interior minister quits over holiday jobs for his daughters","bodyText":"The French interior minister has been forced to resign in a row over employing his teenage daughters as parliamentary assistants during the school holidays, in another blow to the country’s beleaguered political elite with one month to go until the first round of presidential elections. Bruno Le Roux stood down hours after the financial prosecutor’s office announced they were putting him under preliminary investigation. He had offered his resignation earlier in the day to the president, François Hollande, who accepted it. The scandal broke a week after presidential candidate François Fillon was subject to a mise en examen – the French equivalent of being charged – over allegations he paid family members from public funds for “fake” jobs. Le Roux, 51, has admitted he paid his daughters, now aged 20 and 23, €55,000 (£48,000) of public money over seven years. They were given 24 short-term contracts, known as CDDs, between 2009 and 2016 while he sat in the national assembly. French parliamentarians are allowed to employ relatives if the jobs are real and work is actually done. Le Roux says his daughters’ roles filled these requirements. The sums involved in Le Roux’s case are considerably less than hundreds of thousands of euros that Fillon, who has denied wrongdoing, is alleged to have paid his British-born wife Penelope and children over more than a decade. Nevertheless, this latest jobs-for-the-family scandal is deeply embarrassing for the Socialist government in the runup to leadership and legislative elections. At the height of the Fillon scandal in February, Le Roux was one of the first to call for greater transparency in French political life. Le Roux’s resignation, even before judges have decided if there is a case to answer, is a damage limitation move by Hollande in the face of public outrage at previous scandals. Fillon, the candidate for the rightwing Les Republicains party, is also facing fresh allegations over an undeclared €50,000 loan and the gift of bespoke suits from a businessman friend, while far right Front National candidate Marine Le Pen is also under investigation for misusing public funds. She is accused of spending €300,000 of European parliament money to pay the salaries of FN party staff, including a personal bodyguard. France elects a new president in a two-round process on 23 April and 7 May. The most likely scenario according to opinion polls is that Le Pen and the independent centrist Emmanuel Macron will progress from the first round, and that Macron will win in the second. In a brief statement on Tuesday evening, Le Roux insisted he had done nothing wrong. His daughters were employed on “specific and official contracts ... that corresponded to work done”, he said. “This work was as important for me as it was educative for them,” he added. “I affirm my honesty on a human level and in all my political acts.” Earlier in the day Le Roux rejected comparisons with the Fillon scandal. “Yes, my daughters worked with me, mainly during the summer or other school holidays, but never on a permanent basis,” he told the television programme Quotidien, broadcast on the TMC channel, which broke the story on Monday night. “We’re talking about a summer job with a parliamentarian. When it’s a case of doing filing or a number of parliamentary tasks, I think it’s a good life experience.” The eldest Le Roux daughter was 15 when she first worked for her father, for 12 days in 2009, it is claimed. The legal work age in France is 16, unless the person is employed by a parent. However, Le Roux is under pressure to explain how the date of one contract, during the 2013 summer holidays, coincides with the time his daughter was doing work experience at the cosmetic company Yves Rocher in Belgium. Le Roux, 51, was appointed interior minister last December, after Hollande reshuffled his government following Manuel Valls’s resignation as prime minister to concentrate on his presidential campaign, which ended in a primary vote defeat in January to Benoît Hamon. On Tuesday morning, Le Roux cancelled an official engagement to inaugurate a national security and intelligence institute in Paris. The new interior minister was named on Tuesday afternoon as Matthias Fekl. Luc Rouban, a political expert at the Centre for Political Research at Sciences Po, told 20 Minutes newspaper: “The problem with employing family members, even if it’s legal, even if it’s done in good conscience, is that it touches a very sensitive nerve: the confusing of public and private. There is a form of privilege that gives the impression of returning to the Ancien Régime [the system in France prior to the revolution], at a time of deep economic crisis and confusion in the country.” Rouban added: “The high rate of unemployment makes the idea that some people can benefit from their position to get rich, even if it’s legal, seem even more intolerable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/mar/21/nicola-sturgeon-accused-of-hypocrisy-as-independence-debate-begins","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T18:13:20Z","webTitle":"Nicola Sturgeon accused of hypocrisy as independence debate begins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/21/nicola-sturgeon-accused-of-hypocrisy-as-independence-debate-begins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/mar/21/nicola-sturgeon-accused-of-hypocrisy-as-independence-debate-begins","fields":{"headline":"Nicola Sturgeon accused of hypocrisy as independence debate begins","bodyText":"Opposition parties have accused Nicola Sturgeon of hypocrisy after she insisted Theresa May had to respect Holyrood’s call for a second independence referendum. The Conservatives and Labour said the first minister repeatedly ignored majority votes in the Scottish parliament on issues she disagreed with yet claimed the UK government had to give way if Holyrood voted for a new referendum. Sturgeon opened a two-day debate at Holyrood on Tuesday by demanding Westminster grants the Scottish parliament the powers to stage the new referendum, insisting its will had to be respected by the prime minister. The first minister said the Scottish National party’s election victory in 2016, on a manifesto promising an independence referendum if Scotland were forced to leave the EU, and Scotland’s vote in favour of remaining in the EU last June gave her an “unquestionable democratic mandate”. “To suggest that an emphatic election victory on the basis of a clear manifesto commitment and a parliamentary majority on an issue does not provide a mandate begs the question: what does?” she told MSPs. “It runs the real risk of undermining the democratic process.” Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, retorted that the first minister had failed to listen to parliament when it had voted against her five times over the past six months. She had ignored: a ban on fracking; a vote for ministers to review hospital maternity ward and A&amp;E department closures; votes to save Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Scottish Funding Council from separate mergers; and a vote to abolish an act criminalising sectarian chants at football matches. “Five times in six months the will of the Scottish parliament has been clear and five times in six months this SNP government has chosen to ignore it,” Davidson said. “Will the SNP explain [to the public] why votes on crucial issues such as health and education funding and enterprise and energy should be wilfully ignored by the SNP government, but when it comes to independence and only when it comes to independence, Holyrood is sacrosanct?” Referring to repeated opinion polls showing only about 35% of Scottish voters want a referendum before Brexit takes place, Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, said Sturgeon was guilty of double standards. “We have already heard from the first minister about the need to respect the will of this parliament,” Dugdale said. “If only she respected the mandates given to government by this chamber before now. “When this parliament votes for another referendum as it inevitably will, thanks to the perpetual crutch that the Greens provide, let’s not pretend it reflects the will of the Scottish people, because it doesn’t. The Scottish people don’t want a divisive referendum.” Leading a minority government two seats short of an overall majority, Sturgeon is expected to narrowly win Wednesday’s vote with the support of six Scottish Green MSPs asking Theresa May to start talks on the timing of a new referendum. All four opposition parties have put forward amendments to Sturgeon’s motion asking for a mandate to seek the referendum. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have rejected a referendum and said the UK should be restructured on federal lines; the Tories have said no referendum should take place until after Brexit and not until a majority of Scots want one; the Scottish Greens want EU citizens and 16- and 17-year-olds to be allowed to vote in it. Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, accused Sturgeon of misleading pro-EU voters in Scotland on her plans for rejoining the EU if she won a future referendum. While insisting at the weekend her party policy was to retain EU membership after independence, Sturgeon has refused to confirm that would be the proposal in a new referendum. He said Alex Salmond, the former first minister, had told the BBC the SNP plan was to join the European Free Trade Association, and not the EU, in order to keep the third of nationalist voters who backed leave last year happy. “So they will use the EU to get their referendum even though they won’t use the referendum to get the EU. Attacked by the other opposition parties for backing the SNP, Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green party leader, defended his party’s stance. His party’s manifesto last year said a new independence referendum should only “come about by the will of the people, and not be driven by calculations of party political advantage”. Harvie said that since the EU referendum showed the majority of Scots wanted to stay in the EU, the circumstances had changed. Describing Labour and Lib Dem proposals for a federal UK as a fantasy, he said the UK government had repeatedly ignored Scotland’s wishes. “It is absurd to suggest that we should not respond to and react to the fundamentally-changed circumstances we now find ourselves in,” he told MSPs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/mar/21/googles-extremism-apology-only-came-after-uk-pressure-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T18:45:09Z","webTitle":"Google's extremism apology came after UK pressure – minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/21/googles-extremism-apology-only-came-after-uk-pressure-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/mar/21/googles-extremism-apology-only-came-after-uk-pressure-minister","fields":{"headline":"Google's extremism apology came after UK pressure – minister","bodyText":"Google’s public apology over placing advertising next to extremist material came only after it was “read the riot act” at a Whitehall summit last Friday, it has emerged. The company’s bosses are expected to meet Cabinet Office ministers again this week, setting out further action to strengthen their advertising policies and ensure government ads do not appear next to YouTube videos featuring US white supremacists or banned Islamist hate preachers. Government advertising remains suspended from the social media platform while an action plan and timetable are agreed to deal with the problem. The Home Office minister told the Commons home affairs select committee on Tuesday that the government ruled nothing out, including legislation. Sarah Newton said ministers would very carefully study the German draft law proposing fines for hate speech of up to €50m (£43m) on social media companies. But Yvette Cooper, the committee chairman, made clear that though Google had apologised, they had still not made a commitment to proactively search their content for material from terrorist or illegal organisations. Cooper told the committee about a recruitment video posted by National Action, a far-right group banned in Britain, that was still live on YouTube despite the MPs’ complaints last week over similar content. Cooper also raised with ministers the question of whether Google was aiding and abetting a banned organisation if it continued to host their content. The solicitor general, Robert Buckland, agreed that a criminal offence of “recklessly disseminating this material” did exist in law. Newton told MPs that the example of the National Action video still on YouTube showed that Google was not yet doing what it had promised. She disclosed that the social media giant “had been read the riot act at a Downing Street meeting” and had been told to construct an action plan and a timetable to ensure such material was taken down within 24 hours. Newton said ministers social media companies to tackle online hate crime and potential terrorism with the same vigour and tools they use to tackle child sexual abuse online, including disruption and the use of “counter-narratives”. But MPs on the committee said this did not go far enough and that they wanted proactive searching for terrorist and banned material. They asked whether it was time to consider the German approach of fining social media companies which hosted hate crime material. The minister promised nothing would be ruled out: “We will be looking very carefully at the German draft legislation,” she said. Later, Cooper said the government’s response was insufficient. “Ministers need to tell us what action they plan to take. It should not be beyond the wit of Google to use one of their much-feted search engines or algorithms to remove this illegal material.” Twitter said on Tuesday it had suspended more than 375,000 accounts for violations linked to the promotion of terrorism during the last six months of 2016. It said in its latest transparency report that 636,000 accounts had been suspended since August 2015 for links to extremism. The majority had been shut as a result of the firm’s spam account-scanning technology. Earlier the committee heard evidence from the parliamentary authorities that social media companies were not reacting quickly or “sensibly” enough to reports of the online abuse of MPs. Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons deputy speaker, revealed that an “embedded team” to monitor social media comments about MPs was being put in place to advise them when they were being targeted for online attack. He said MPs, particularly minority ethnic women, were increasingly being targeted for online abuse. MPs who spoke in emotive debates on issues such as badger culling or abortion often received threats, even death threats, Hoyle said, and warned that such behaviour was in danger of undermining democracy. Hoyle said if common sense did not prevail and social media companies failed to recognise their corporate responsibility, legislation might be needed. “It’s about drawing the line in the right place, not what they believe is the right place, so … if we have to put legislation through the House, so be it,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/mar/21/fa-pfa-plan-fast-track-players-referees","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T22:30:18Z","webTitle":"FA and PFA outline plan for fast-tracking players to become top referees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/21/fa-pfa-plan-fast-track-players-referees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/mar/21/fa-pfa-plan-fast-track-players-referees","fields":{"headline":"FA and PFA outline plan for fast-tracking players to become top referees","bodyText":"Professional footballers are to be encouraged into a second career in refereeing by an initiative to be set up by the Football Association and the Professional Footballers’ Association within the next two years. At present former footballers who try to break into refereeing have no advantage over members of the public with no experience in the game. With the journey from Sunday leagues to Premier League taking at least 10 years, a player who retires in their mid-30s will be approaching 50 and pondering a second retirement before they reach the highest level. Though age limits have been abandoned in recent years the oldest referees currently officiating in the top flight are Neil Swarbrick and Roger East, who are 51. “The PFA have been looking to do it for a number of years and now we’ve got to the point where we need to try to do something about it,” said Neale Barry, the former Premier League official who is the FA’s head of refereeing. “We’re trying to make sure that those who do come into refereeing understand you don’t finish playing and you’re refereeing in the Premier League in two years’ time. It’s a long haul. But we’re looking to get more players to become part of refereeing.” The move comes in response to demand from the PFA, coaches, managers and former top footballers. “Players have an instinctive understanding of the game, the challenges and tackles and dynamic on the pitch and would know how to communicate in a way teams respect and understand,” Alan Shearer said in January. “If we could change the attitude to refs and make it an appealing option post-career, with a top salary that gives guys a future, I believe former players would go into refereeing.” Barry is considering options that will allow former players to speed up the process of qualifying to officiate in the Football League without giving them such a head start that interested amateurs are put off. “We need to try to get them into refereeing and give them the opportunity to move through a little bit quicker, so they can use their experience as a player in refereeing,” he said. “It’s something that we’re looking at in conjunction with the PFA and the PGMOL [Professional Game Match Officials Limited]. And we’re also looking at allowing them to referee while they’re still playing and that way they could start a few rungs higher than the bottom rung of the ladder to take into account the knowledge they will have as players. “Within the next couple of years we want a group of players who want to become referees and have that group working together. What we really need is one of those to come through and become a role model. The first time it happens it will draw all those ex-players in because there’s a lot of them asking the question about becoming referees. Certainly we would expect during the 2018-19 season to have a cohort of ex-players who want to become involved, and to give them the opportunity to become part of refereeing in the future.” In modern times the only former professional player to forge a successful second career as an official was Steve Baines, who played more than 100 games for Huddersfield, Bradford and Chesterfield and went on to spend eight years as a Football League referee, retiring in 2002. The former Newcastle goalkeeper Steve Harper, a qualified official, works as a referee’s assessor for the Premier League. “This is something we’ve been looking at for decades,” said John Bramhall, the PFA deputy chief executive. “We’ve had meetings recently with the PGMOL and the FA looking at potential pathways for individuals with talent – not necessarily former players – who should be able to progress through the system more rapidly. “We’re looking at having a system which identifies individuals with ability and helps them progress, like academies. There would be resistance if one group of people started getting preferential treatment, we’re just saying there should be credit given to their knowledge and experience of the game.” Next month BT Sport will broadcast a documentary, Ref: Stories From the Weekend, that profiles eight referees working at various levels in English and Welsh football. One of them, Jason Jarrett, is a former professional, having played for 16 league clubs. Since filming the documentary he has stepped away from refereeing after five years having become disillusioned by the hurdles placed in his path. “The time frame was a big factor,” he says. “I think I know a lot about the game. I’d played it for a long time and as a professional for 16 years. Five years had gone by and I was still doing semi-professional teams. Even though I’ve been escalated very quickly I’m five or six years away from getting where I want to be. “I believe ex-players could offer a lot. I’m not saying they should miss out all the steps but I do believe they should be escalated a little bit quicker because of what they’ve experienced as a footballer. It has to count for something.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/mar/26/canyon-offspring-al-16-childrens-bike-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-26T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"Canyon Offspring AL 16 children’s bike: preview | Martin Love","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/26/canyon-offspring-al-16-childrens-bike-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/26/canyon-offspring-al-16-childrens-bike-preview","fields":{"headline":"Canyon Offspring AL 16 children’s bike: preview","bodyText":"How much is too much for a kid’s bike?

One in six teaching positions in government schools is empty – altogether, that’s a shortage of a million teachers across the country. The Open University’s TESS-India (teacher education through school-based support in India) project aims to meet fill this gap by training more teachers using high-quality online resources. Teachers get access to educational resources, practical strategies to use in their classrooms, and the massive open online course (known as Mooc) called enhancing teacher education through open educational resources. The Mooc is a six-week task-based online course which combines support through the course forums and social media with face-to-face contact sessions. TESS was developed in partnership with state bodies, teacher education institutions and NGOs. TESS-India activity does not follow a template; but takes different shapes and focus in each region according to local context. Following the initial phase of the project, the OU selected Save the Children India as a partner, based partly on their extensive delivery infrastructure across seventeen Indian states. The Mooc has been accessed by 33,448 participants, with a completion rate of over 40% (compared with a global average of 14%). The project was initially funded by aid from the UK government, but has since secured funding from Save the Children India.

The settlement – which was given world visibility by Danny Boyle’s film Slumdog Millionaire – is home to some 1.5 million people, and only one square mile in size. Selina Busby, course leader in applied theatre MA at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, University of London, and her students have been working annually for the past seven years with an NGO in Mumbai and alongside a collection of local, Indian artists and practitioners on a project to improve English language skills and use theatre to create intercultural dialogue. In June 2016, Busby began a new project collaborating with a local school in Dharavi. The school caters for 381 local children aged three to six. The teachers at the school are women from the local Dharavi community, who are given support and in-house training. They aim to teach the children English, as they see this as a “career defining path” through which they will have access to job opportunities and improved life chances. Throughout June, the team facilitated workshops for 20 of the young women employed as teachers at the school, and helped them develop their English language skills. Creative interactive sessions using songs, drama and dance were also held – with the teachers encouraged to take these tools back to their classrooms and use them with their own students. Through work with the school’s team of educators, Busby’s methods are now used with the young students. Runner up: University of Nottingham Project: UK-China Creative Economy Talent Building The International Creative Economy Leadership Academy (ICELA) is a partnership involving campuses in Nottingham, China and Malaysia. The project engages national and international industry partners from the screen industry and museum sectors. Partners include Shanghai Museum, New York Met, the V&amp;A, National Portrait Gallery, Xinhuanet and Beijing Youth Arts 100 Alliance. ICELA has expanded its activity in China beyond traditional continuing professional development to not only upskill Chinese creative educators, industry professionals and young, entry-level professionals, but also to support creative SMEs in the UK to work through barriers to developing trade links with China. It is the first of its kind in being a regional (east China) international knowledge exchange network and hub that delivers training, trade and investment support, policy and industry networks, hotdesking space, and research development opportunities. The project has brought together people who would not have worked with each other before – both within individual universities, and between universities and industry. It has proved to be a springboard for research collaboration and by establishing a large knowledge-sharing consortium which will work to address skills issue collaboratively.

A poll of more than 400 Britons with at least $1m (£800,000) in liquid assets in addition to their homes found that 78% thought Britain’s decision to leave the EU would have a “positive effect” on their financial plans. Nick Tucker, UK head of UBS Wealth Management, said many of the bank’s clients were anxious about the effects of Brexit on their finances but most of the richest of the rich were “now taking a more positive view”. “UBS Wealth Management doesn’t take a political view on Brexit,” Tucker said. “But our client conversations around the country have revealed significant levels of anxiety. This latest data of UK millionaires suggests a more complex picture. Over the longer term, most are now taking a positive view.” The survey, published a week before Theresa May will pull the trigger on article 50 – the two-year process of Britain exiting the EU – found that young millionaires are even more bullish on Britain’s future outside of the bloc. UBS found that 83% of millionaires aged 18 to34 thought Brexit would have a positive impact on their long-term financial planning. This compared with 70% of 35- to 44-year-olds feeling positive about the impact of Brexit on their finances, and 74% of over-64-year-olds. According to polling data from YouGov, 75% of 18- to 24-year-olds voted to remain in the EU. Three-quarters of the millionaires surveyed by UBS said they thought Brexit would have a positive impact on the overall UK economy in the long term, despite the collapse in the value of the pound since the referendum and concerns that it may be more difficult for the UK to trade goods and service after it leaves the EU. However, Tucker said that despite being bullish about their personal finances in a post-EU world, rich people are holding an increasing amount of their wealth in cash to give them more flexibility in case of any financial shocks. “We still see many investors holding on to cash, rather than investing,” he said. “This is especially true of younger investors. In an environment of returning inflation and low interest rates, we recommend looking for investments with a higher return – whether in the UK or around the world. “UK assets have proven more resilient than feared and we expect this trend to continue in the coming months. Even with this positive picture, and the bullish confidence we see on Brexit, investors should still look for a balanced portfolio, rather than sticking all their eggs in this one British basket.” The global super-rich are expected to continue to flock to London despite Brexit, according to a recent report by property consultants Knight Frank. The number of UK-based ultra high-net-worth individuals – those with more than $30m (£24.2m) in assets – is expected to increase by 30% to 12,310 over the next decade. Liam Bailey, Knight Frank’s head of research, said London would remain “the city of choice” for the super-rich from Asia and the Middle East despite concerns over Brexit. “In a European context, London is without doubt the dominant city for the wealthy,” he said. “London is just more accessible for more wealthy people, it is more convenient, more connected and more open than other cities. London attracts talent from around the world, and it will continue to do so.” Bailey said Brexit may have some impact on London’s global appeal, but the UK’s membership of the EU was less important for the world’s richest people than the general population.

For the medical marijuana company OrganiGram, this is simply the latest round of production. But for New Brunswick, the small east coast Canadian province where this facility is based, the plants are part of a bigger gamble – one that aims to transform Canada’s looming plans to fully legalise marijuana by July 2018 into an economic boon capable of solving the problems of chronic unemployment and a rapidly ageing population. “We see here an industry that we think has extreme growth potential,” Brian Gallant, the Liberal premier of New Brunswick, told the Guardian. His province has embraced the country’s nascent marijuana industry like no other, betting heavily on its potential to shake up an economy long dominated by fishing and forestry. “We’re very optimistic that we’ll see significant investments and significant jobs created in the province because of it.” Some 100,000 Canadians currently use medical marijuana – and the number is growing by 10% each month, according to the Canadian National Medical Marijuana Association. This growth, along with promises from the federal Liberal government, led by Justin Trudeau, to make Canada the first G7 country to fully legalise marijuana, have led analysts to estimate Canada’s cannabis industry could eventually be worth somewhere between C$5bn and C$7bn annually. The industry’s potential growth spurt comes just as New Brunswick stares down a fast-approaching perfect storm of an ageing demographic and economic decline. “We’re desperate for growth,” said Moncton-based economist Richard Saillant. In some ways New Brunswick has more in common with countries, such as Greece or Portugal, than with other regions of Canada, said Saillant. “We share the same characteristics as those countries to the extent that they’re slow-growing peripheral economies that are fast aging and that are facing major financial stress.” Home to some 750,000 people, the province is the only one in Canada with a shrinking population, as deaths outnumber births and younger residents head west for jobs. In their wake they leave an unemployment rate that hovers around 10% – one of the highest in Canada. One in five residents in New Brunswick is currently aged 65 years or over, said Saillant, compared to about one in eight in western Canada. Within two decades, the number is expected to balloon to one in three, posing a significant challenge for the province’s healthcare system. The demographics may help explain why a province with conservative tendencies has become so open to the marijuana industry. “I think it’s just the attitude that we have to have – as a smaller province with some challenges – that we have to look at these economic opportunities and be aggressive about them,” said Gallant, the province’s premier. His government has invested C$4m in a loan to one medical marijuana startup, Zenabis, in order to help build a facility in northern New Brunswick that aims to create more than 200 jobs. In August, a senior government official suggested that these jobs may just be the tip of the iceberg; telling reporters that the sector could become a major economic driver in the province and create thousands of jobs. The expectation saw New Brunswick become among the first jurisdictions in Canada to establish a working group to explore the issues around legalisation, ranging from how it will be sold to where products could be used. “There’s going to be production and distribution and sales of this across the country,” said Gallant. “So it’s a question of whether we as New Brunswickers can make sure we act quickly to benefit as much as possible from that.” The provincial government has also invested in OrganiGram – currently the province’s only licensed marijuana producer – providing up to C$990,000 in payroll rebates for the creation of dozens of jobs over the next three years. The government’s investment came just as OrganiGram acquired another 136,000 sq ft of industrial space in order to ramp up production, said Ray Gracewood, the company’s chief commercial officer. “It’s fair to say that there really isn’t a model that we can look to to provide a turnkey solution,” said Gracewood. “So in a sense, I think Canadian industry is blazing a trail internationally from a legitimate sort of regulated industry. We’re already starting to get calls from representatives from other countries, asking what we’re doing.” It hasn’t all been smooth sailing: OrganiGram and two other licensed producers in Canada recently issued a voluntary recall of much of its products sold in 2016 after five lots tested positive for low levels of two unapproved pesticides. The company has since put in place new growing and harvesting protocols. The fast-growing industry has also been in a holding pattern as of late. Some worry that the federal government’s timeline of July 2018 is too ambitious, given the scope of work likely to be left to the provinces. A date of 2019 has been floated as more likely. And while eight US states and the District of Columbia have voted to legalise recreational marijuana, the White House has hinted that the Department of Justice will do more to enforce federal laws prohibiting recreational marijuana, raising concerns over how Canada’s approach will coexist with a potential crackdown south of the border. Nearly 400,000 people a day cross the shared border between Canada and the US, and any clampdown on the border could have economic repercussions for Canada, which last year sent three-quarters of its exports to the US. Still, many in this province continue to push forward. In October, a New Brunswick college announced it would launch a specialised program on marijuana cultivation aimed at prepping potential workers for everything from quality control to harvesting. The program, which could be on offer as early as autumn of this year, will compensate for the fact that “most of the experience that exists within the cultivation of marijuana happens in the black market”, said Gracewood. It’s a necessary development as the industry moves out of the shadows and into legalisation – and another building block that could help the province reap the benefits. “This industry is going to exist whether New Brunswick likes it or not. And the thing that’s most encouraging to me, is that as a province, they’ve truly embraced the opportunity,” said Gracewood. “My sense is that New Brunswick will be one of the most prepared provinces in Canada when the opportunity arises.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/apr/01/diversity-doesnt-make-racism-magically-disappear","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-01T12:46:53Z","webTitle":"Diversity doesn't make racism magically disappear | Daniel Jose Camacho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/01/diversity-doesnt-make-racism-magically-disappear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/01/diversity-doesnt-make-racism-magically-disappear","fields":{"headline":"Diversity doesn't make racism magically disappear","bodyText":"We can’t screw our way beyond racism. Many think mixed-race babies and browner demographics will automatically usher in a post-racial world. They interpret the projections of a “majority-minority” shift in our nation – now set to take place in 2044 – as a sign of guaranteed progress. Changing faces in the US are seen as anti-racist destiny. But don’t overestimate the power of this post-racial cocktail. Jordan Peele’s brilliant film Get Out reminds me of the importance of questioning overly optimistic narratives of racial progress. Made by someone who has been open about being biracial and married to a white women, this film creatively uses the genre of horror to depict the persistence of racism through a story about an interracial couple. In many ways, it can be seen as a strident critique of a liberal brand of racism that has blossomed in the post-Obama era. The perspective that multiracial demographics naturally erode bias and inequality tends to lack historical and global perspective. Consider Brazil. There, white people are a minority – but are still dominant. Despite being outnumbered, their incomes are more than double than that of Afro-descendants; white men are also vastly over-represented in Brazil’s new government. If more mixed people guarantee greater tolerance, then Brazil – and most of Latin America – should be a racial paradise. Although a great degree of ‘mestizaje’ or racial mixing has taken place since the time of conquest, Indigenous and Afro-descendent people in Latin America remain disproportionately poor, discriminated against, and locked out from opportunity. Sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, in his book Racism without Racists, has speculated whether the racial order in the US might eventually resemble that of Latin American and Caribbean nations. In this case, white supremacy and racial stratification will continue to operate in the US even as it becomes a “majority-minority” nation. Even the idea of a “majority-minority” shift obscures the fact that the US will be better described as a racial plurality. It’s not as if non-whites constitute one homogenous group. The legacy of blanqueamiento (“whitening”) in Latin America demonstrates that ideals of multiraciality can run alongside white supremacy. This theory, widely adopted and practiced by Latin American nations at the turn into the 20th century, encouraged racial mixing for the sake of moving entire populations towards whiteness. This is a reminder that desires for a mixed future can be, and have sometimes been, grounded in anti-blackness. To be sure, all of this does not discredit the importance of diversity and the unique perspectives that people of multi-ethnic/racial backgrounds possess because of their social location. Speaking of the consciousness of the mestiza, Chicana thinker Gloria Anzaldúa writes: “In our very flesh, (r)evolution works out the clash of cultures.” People with mixed backgrounds can disrupt notions of purity that undergird race and synthesize vast cultural traditions. People with mixed backgrounds can also internalize and carry out racism. Instead of reducing mixed people to being inevitable harbingers of a post-racial future, there needs to be an acknowledgement of agency in how mixed people choose to relate to the problem of racism and how society, in turn, chooses to receive mixed people. Merely looking optimistically into the future erases the past that the US has with multiraciality. The figure of the “Tragic Mulatto/a” arose in US literature and film precisely because our racial architecture is based upon a series of denials. Speaking to the West Indian Student Center in London in 1968, James Baldwin captured this incisively: “What is really happening is that brother has murdered brother knowing it was his brother. White men have lynched Negroes knowing them to be their sons. White women have had Negroes burned knowing them to be their lovers … the American people are unable to face the fact that I’m flesh of their flesh, bone of their bone.” Baldwin exposes the naïve belief that racial intimacy and mixture are some inevitable bulwark against racism. Demographics are not destiny. Having a multiracial background may no longer be necessarily tragic but it is not automatically heroic. What is the racial future of this nation? As a social construct tied to political and economic power, racism has proven itself adept at employing difference to prolong its entrenchment. Notwithstanding Trump’s efforts to engineer a white nationalist future, where we go from here is not determined. It’s up to us. It depends on what we all decide to do."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2017/mar/30/business-partnership-category-award-winner-and-runners-up","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-30T06:30:19Z","webTitle":"Business partnership category: award winner and runners up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/mar/30/business-partnership-category-award-winner-and-runners-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2017/mar/30/business-partnership-category-award-winner-and-runners-up","fields":{"headline":"Business partnership category: award winner and runners up","bodyText":"Winner: The Open University Project: True Potential PUFin The Open University Business School wanted to deepen its relationship with its 25,000 MBA alumni and build better corporate partnerships. To do so, it asked alumni to partner with the university to create “centres of excellence” – that combine rigorous research with free online learning and resources in critical, yet under researched areas. The True Potential Centre for the Public Understanding of Finance (True Potential PUFin), was established in partnership with True Potential LLP, one of the fastest growing financial services organisations in the UK today. It was founded by one of the OU’s MBA alumni to help address the growing personal debt crisis through enhancing personal financial literacy. True Potential LLP committed to a five-year programme of financial support to establish the centre of excellence, totalling £1.4m. As the first and only personal finance research centre in the UK that has an active teaching programme freely available to the public, the centre has successfully delivered a suite of open educational resources via OpenLearn and FutureLearn (titles include Managing my Financial Journey, Managing my Money and Managing my Investments), which have helped over 215,000 people since launch. In cooperation with experts from True Potential LLP, the centre’s team has informed industry understanding of risk and how the UK can be made more financially resilient. Two of the centre’s academics gave evidence at the House of Lords select committee on financial exclusion, in November 2016. The combined total of learners across all platforms for all courses has exceeded 215,000 individuals. Evaluation has also demonstrated a positive impact on people’s confidence, knowledge and bank balances. In a survey of over 800 Managing My Money learners, 94% reported they had improved their understanding of personal financial management with 57% stating that studying had resulted in them becoming financially better off. Runner up: Newcastle University Project: BE:WISE The water industry faces unprecedented global challenges such as population growth and climate change while having to meet stringent environmental standards. New technology and new thinking are essential for developing sustainable and affordable wastewater (sewage) treatment techniques. However, the costs and uncertainty involved in scaling up lab research to application in the real world means that, for decades, there’s been little change in the main technologies for wastewater treatment. Opened in July 2016, Newcastle University’s Biological Engineering: Wastewater Innovation at Scale (BE:WISE) research facility is the largest of its type in Europe. Based at Northumbrian Water’s sewage treatment works at Birtley, Gateshead, it’s the result of an integrated, cross-disciplinary relationship between Newcastle University and Northumbrian Water Group (NWG) that is helping to drive industry-relevant innovation and opening up opportunities for students. While previously research has largely focused on computer simulations of wastewater treatment by microbial action, this provided a realistic, large-scale setting, giving academics the chance to better understand how complex biological interactions work in practice. BE:WISE is funded through a £1.2m Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) grant, with Newcastle University and NWG each contributing a further £0.5m to its value. Additionally, NWG provides support from its staff and stakeholders, as well as other day-to-day support such as telecoms and wifi access. As well as access to wastewater, NWG also provides real data drawn from its operations serving more than 1m properties across the north-east and maintaining 413 sewage treatment works. BE:WISE will shortly be available for use by researchers from around the world. Runner up: Swansea University Project: COATED Coated2 is a four-year joint project between Swansea University, Tata Steel and the local supply chain. The aim is to produce engineering doctorates in the field of industrial functional coatings, with a focus on developing coatings that generate, store and release energy. The project, also known as the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Industrial Functional Coatings: Coated2, allows Tata to tap into the university’s expertise in the field of advanced materials and manufacturing. By working with the university, it is able to develop an advantage in the sector, enhancing its established processes and adopting to new technologies. The £14m project funds 40 engineering doctorates over four cohorts with part-time company doctorates, one year masters students, and £2.6m worth of work-based learning opportunities. The project is funded both privately and publicly through the EPSRC and the European Social Fund through the Welsh European Funding Office (WEFO). Some 16 companies are currently sponsoring projects to a value of £36,000 per four year project equating to £1,620,000 in cash with an additional £1,620,000 of in-kind contributions. The project has also led to the creation of a university spinout company, Hexigone, following research into chromium replacement technologies.

It is one of the seductive images submitted by architects Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM) in their entry for the New Scotland Yard competition in 2013, along with a picture showing their building as the dashing backdrop to a live TV news report. Another shot shows how it would look at night, its glazed rooftop pavilion transformed into a glowing blue lantern. Image is clearly important to the Met but, four years on, it comes as a relief to find there are no £5,000 chairs or £150 kettles on the top floor of London’s new police HQ, a compact building about a sixth the size of its vast 1960s predecessor. In a move that is hoped will save £6m a year in running costs, Scotland Yard has downsized and returned to its handsome 1930s home in Westminster, a few doors down from the Houses of Parliament on the Embankment, in a symbol of the new-look lean policing. “It’s all about agile working,” says Roger Harding, the Met’s director of real estate development, who, despite working on the design of the new building, doesn’t have a desk here. Instead, he works nomadically between the Tate, Royal Festival Hall and Starbucks. “We’ve gone from a building with 3,500 workstations to one with 550, so it’s taking some getting used to.” Fighting crime from cafes might sound like a risky business, but Harding insists the Met are simply “changing the IT footprint” to allow for secure working on the move, as detectives join the capital’s growing tribe of wifi workers. The £58m extension and refurbishment of this neoclassical riverside pile marks the latest unlikely chapter in the Met’s almost 200-year history of moves. It has successively outgrown its premises since it was founded in a simple building in Whitehall in 1829. It moved to its namesake, Great Scotland Yard, in 1875 (which is now being converted into a luxury hotel, where bedrooms will cost up to £10,000 a night), then in the early 1900s it went to a palatial block next to Parliament that was designed by Norman Shaw as an eccentric cross between a French chateau and a medieval fortress, now occupied by MPs’ offices. The Met outgrew this brick castle and built two more rambling buildings next door before, in 1935, it commissioned William Curtis Green, architect of Mayfair’s Dorchester hotel and the Wolseley restaurant, to build the Portland stone annex into which the Met has now returned. AHMM has cleverly inserted what is essentially an entirely new building into Curtis Green’s stripped-stone shell, retaining its concrete frame and adding a series of volumes to the rear to increase the floor area by more than a third. A new facade peeps out towards Whitehall with staggered square windows and a screen of brightly coloured fins, sampled from the shades of nearby brickwork – what the architects call “urban camouflage”. It is a cheery mode of stripy cladding perhaps more suited to the practice’s award-winning schools than a police HQ, but it sets the tone for a lighthearted mood that continues within. The toilets, for example, have been tiled with colour schemes inspired by police car liveries, from the ubiquitous blue and yellow chequerboard to the red, blue and orange stripes of diplomatic protection group vehicles. “It’s a moment of light relief,” says architect Paul Monaghan. “We quickly learned that the police have to have a sense of humour to be able to do their job.” In response to former Met commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe’s desire for transparency, a new curved-glass entrance pavilion stands at the Victoria Embankment frontage, a streamlined art deco-ish form that sits well with the 1930s building behind. It is raised up and set back behind a hefty stone-clad concrete barricade that frames an entrance ramp and steps, as gracefully designed as these cumbersome lorry-proof barriers can be, while a replica of the iconic triangular New Scotland Yard sign rotates atop another truck-proof pole. Following last week’s attack on Westminster, when PC Keith Palmer was fatally stabbed just 200 metres away, it has become a poignant backdrop for the laying of flowers, beneath a small reflecting pool where an eternal flame burns in memory of officers who have died on duty. For all the obligatory security, it is a surprisingly open and airy entrance, a feeling that extends inside in the glass lifts that give you views of all the floors as you rise through the building. As we tour the five storeys of open-plan office space, we pass officers perched on stools, working away on laptops at a hot-desking bar, while others sit at high-backed sofas nearby, arranged to create the sense of little enclosed meeting rooms. There are conventional desks aplenty, but nesting has been outlawed: there are ever-present banks of lockers for possessions to be packed away at the end of the day. It is a far cry from the old New Scotland Yard, a 20-storey office block on Broadway in Victoria, which had changed little since the Met moved in in 1967. “It was like the set from Life on Mars,” says Monaghan, referring to the police TV series set in the 1970s. “It felt very institutional and that, in turn, affected the way they were working.” In contrast, the new space is more like the set from BBC spoof W1A, complete with break-out zones. “The move is part of our wider hub concept,” says Harding, describing how this compact building is supplemented by a series of nine others around London. The Met’s property diet has been long overdue. An estate audit in 2013 found the force had 500 buildings costing more than £200m a year to operate, while more than 40% of desks were unoccupied at any one time. It calculated that the cost of 14 desks was the same as one police officer, so it makes sense to prioritise boots over buildings. “New Scotland Yard was like your garage,” says Harding. “We had filled it up with everything except the car.” The 60s building was sold to the Abu Dhabi Financial Group for £370m in 2014, which plans to build another complex of luxury apartments, offices and shops on the site. There are plans, meanwhile, to sell up to 200 of the Met’s buildings, with the aim to save over £60m in annual running costs. It remains to be seen if this downsized estate can cope with ever-increasing policing demands, and how the Met’s new commissioner, Cressida Dick, rises to the challenge. Walking into the diminutive new press conference room, it hits home how cramped the new building may well become: the national media will be briefed on major terror events in a space the size of a GP’s waiting room. It is an apt reflection of the fact that the Met has had its budget slashed by almost one-fifth during Hogan-Howe’s tenure. “The bottom line is there will be less cops,” he said in a recent interview. “There’s only so much you can cut. You need cops. You can’t throw laptops at crowds.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2017/mar/30/buildings-that-inspire-category-award-winner-and-runners-up","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-30T06:30:20Z","webTitle":"Buildings that inspire category: award winner and runners up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/mar/30/buildings-that-inspire-category-award-winner-and-runners-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2017/mar/30/buildings-that-inspire-category-award-winner-and-runners-up","fields":{"headline":"Buildings that inspire category: award winner and runners up","bodyText":"Winner: Nottingham Trent University Project: The Pavilion Nottingham Trent’s Pavilion building, a space for collaborative learning and socialising, is at the heart of the university’s Clifton campus. It is also central to the university’s sustainability strategy: the building is cleverly designed to generate more energy than it consumes. The Pavilion optimises energy performance using Passivhaus principles, a type of design that creates buildings that require little energy for space heating or cooling. The full height glazed facade, giving the building its iconic look, is energy efficient. Automated louvers (shutters) provide natural ventilation, while floods of daylight throughout the building enable reactive LED lighting that responds to external light levels. Low energy, air-tight design maximises operational efficiency – for example, revolving doors minimise annual heat loss, while huge 96kW solar panels on the roof supply energy for building services. Outside of the building, a landscaped plaza provides habitats for biodiversity, benefiting wildlife and attracting native species to its outdoor spaces. The design has achieved a carbon negative energy performance certificate rating of A+. Renewable energy sources, such as solar panels on the roof, have resulted in a building emission rate of -3.94 kgCO2/m². In other words, it’s a carbon negative building. In addition to this, 95% of waste from the project was recycled and 80% of the construction workers involved in building the Pavilion travelled to the site from within 20 mile radius of campus. This not only helped ensure support for the local community and economy, but also reduced the project’s emissions. The project was entirely self-funded and cost approximately £10m. It was delivered within a 15 month programme. Runner up: University of Essex Project: Essex Business School Essex Business School (EBS) is the UK’s first zero-carbon business school building. Sustainable features include its timber frame, ground source heat pump, solar panels and efficient lighting. It also features a winter garden with an Eden Project-style roof, which creates its own microclimate and is the centrepiece of the building’s energy efficient design. But it’s not just the sustainable design that makes the building special. Inside, students enjoy a virtual Bloomberg trading floor, flexible group learning spaces and dedicated postgraduate facilities. There are also plenty of informal meeting spaces, including a light-filled atrium where staff and students can share ideas or do business. It’s a bustling and lively place: EBS is home to over 1,700 students from 130 different countries, including 300 postgraduates. The building also forms a link between the university campus and the neighbouring Knowledge Gateway research and innovation park, and so helps create a business-focused environment where students interact with external businesses. The budget for the project was £21m capital funding. Runner up: Cardiff University Project: Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre Built on a former industrial space, Cardiff University’s Brain Research Imaging Centre (CUBRIC) has brought cutting-edge science to a neglected area of the city. The building is four times the size of the previous facility and enables all staff to be housed in one place alongside multiple MRI scanning facilities, MEG scanning, EEG facilities, brain stimulation, sleep laboratories and drug trial facilities. CUBRIC compares favourably with the leading centres in the US, housing one of only two Siemens 3 Tesla Connectom systems in the world – an immensely powerful facility described as the Hubble space telescope of neuroscience. The building houses a unique cluster which brings clinical facilities together within an academic setting, to promote increased collaboration with clinicians and researchers in the NHS. It also encourages involvement from the pharmaceutical industry, as well as other industries allied to neuroimaging development. Since opening, the centre has received increasing numbers of expressions of interest from researchers keen to use the new facilities, including industrial partners. CUBRIC has also been given the status of the National Microstructure Imaging Facility, further boosting the university’s reputation as a centre of excellence for neuroscience and mental health. The total cost of the building was £44m, including the construction as well as the specialist equipment housed within it. Over £27m of the cost of the project was provided by the following funders: Wellcome Trust, Medical Research Council, EPSRC, the Wolfson Foundation, Welsh government and the European Regional Development Fund.

There’s a full ashtray, beer, a hamburger. “It’s odd, you know, you walk in and it’s exactly like he’s just out,” says David, the older brother. “Except there’s blood everywhere.” There’s blood around the bed, and over here where it soaked through the floor. The blood is from their dad Bob Massey, and their cousin Amy Hatfield. I see David set up a crowdfunding page to help with the clean-up, though it didn’t get anywhere near its target figure. Bob and his niece Amy were killed – strangled and their throats cut –in a double homicide. “I think it’s really going to hit me after we’re done and we get everything finished,” says younger brother Michael. The little girl running around I assume is the daughter of one of them, Bob’s granddaughter. It’s a side to serious crime you don’t often see on television – not exciting, or glamorous. Just horrible, and really really sad. This sobering documentary, American Justice (BBC2), goes everywhere in the legal system, and it’s not much more glamorous on the side that administers it. “I need you to pack me a bag again,” says gloomy, bearded detective Bobby Bowers down the phone, probably to his wife. He’s off chasing Amy’s boyfriend Thomas Brown, known as TJ, who’s heading towards Georgia. TJ doesn’t remain on the run for long; he’s picked up at a drug rehabilitation clinic. “I’ve never done anything like this before,” he tells Bobby. “I never hurt anybody like this before.” Still, the state prosecutor will be seeking the death penalty. The only other option for murder in Florida is life without parole. Jacksonville has a couple of reputations when it comes to law and order: it has been called the murder capital of Florida; it’s also known for tough justice. Too tough, some think, and controversial state attorney Angela Corey faces a battle to get re-elected. Not that she’s apologising. “I will not apologise for being tough on those criminals,” she says, often. Oh, but then maybe she is sorry. “I also want to apologise to them for doing what we have to do,” she says – them being the people, and doing what we have to do being sending a lot of people to death row. Well, it’s political here, so you expect a bit of contradiction. That – the state attorney election – is the backdrop against which American Justice is set, and what makes it so fascinating. Not only does it cover every part of the process – from courtroom to sordid bloodstained trailer, and everyone involved, including the state attorney, prosecutors, defence lawyers, judges, police, defendants, bereaved families – but it also has an extra layer on top: political context. I don’t think this first of three episodes, called Punishment, necessarily needed another case, or to yo-yo between the two. Sometimes television makers underestimate an audience’s ability to focus on and become involved and immersed in one thing (Exhibit A: Making a Murderer). But, having said that, the other case is an extraordinary one, and takes in ground not covered in the first, such as court. Trey Wright is being prosecuted for murder even though no one thinks he actually killed anyone, or meant anyone to get killed. Here though, if there’s a violent death, someone needs to be held responsible, and the argument is that Trey was, despite the victim being his cousin and best friend Bryant Collier. I don’t know which is more extraordinary – that or the fact his defence lawyer seems to expect Trey to plead guilty even if he believes himself to be innocent. Because of the fear of a trial, and fear of the sentence if found guilty. He doesn’t. He gambles (because it is a gamble) and wins. Not guilty. I don’t know if the next episodes will feature the results of Angela Corey’s attempt last year to get re-elected but I couldn’t wait. I think the people got both those right, which is reassuring I suppose. After the stark reality of American Justice, Inside No 9 (BBC2) was exactly what was needed. More death and retribution, but this time served up by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, in a trendy east London gallery. With a little help from Felicity Kendal, Fiona Shaw, Morgana Robinson and Peter Kay. Horrible, macabre and gruesome, but gloriously and hilariously so. Agatha Christie meets Damien Hirst – with puns. The only shame is that this was the last in the run.

Later he turned to cinematography and directed commercials for clients such as British Leyland, Guinness and Land Rover, often on expensive shoots in faraway locations. Ray’s famous photograph for the Salvation Army campaign in 1967 featured a peak-capped volunteer holding a small child in a blanket next to the words: “Now will you care?” A 1969 Radio Times cover introduced a striking new Doctor Who, Jon Pertwee, with his black and red cape flowing, eyes bulging and hands moving towards the camera, while his Time cover for a 1983 feature on the tribes of Britain showcased a Mohican-haired “punk”, hands on hips, in ripped T-shirt and leather accoutrements. Ray’s pictures were made rather than taken: not so much products of Henri Cartier-Bresson’s “decisive moment” as of many unsatisfactory moments when some aspect or other of the image in his viewfinder didn’t please him. It might be the light or the composition, too much movement – or too little. John Chillingworth, who began his career in the more carefree documentary traditions of Picture Post, thought that Ray’s meticulous picture-making “came from something deep inside him, something that translated into his idea of perfection”. In journalism as well as in advertising, his dedication to the perfect had remarkable results. In the winter of 1976-77 we visited India together on a couple of assignments for the Sunday Times: the first on the country’s railways, then still mainly steam-powered; the second on the “eye camps”, the tented operating theatres that toured rural India, where near-blind villagers queued to have their cataracts removed. Ray took an assistant with him as well as a bewildering heap of equipment over which the assistant would stand guard in turbulent bazaars and railway stations. It was the opposite of how photo-reportage is meant to be – unobtrusive and quick – but out of it came a series of painterly images that dignified rather than disguised the reality. An only child, Ray was born in Trealaw in the Rhondda valley and grew up in Hammersmith – his parents moved to London after his father, a lorry driver, got a job with Ford’s at Dagenham. He left school at 15 and, gripped by a passion for photography, began work as a freelance assistant to photographers such as Chillingworth and James Mortimer, who mixed editorial and commercial work. Like every assistant he worked as a general dogsbody, carrying bags and setting up lights, but he soon began to be noticed for his clever anticipation of what equipment would be needed, as well as his ability to calm and charm the subjects of portraits. When John Hedgecoe was asked to photograph the Queen in profile for a new series of stamps, it was Ray who went with him to Buckingham Palace. Ray’s big break came during a visit to New York, when he was hired as an assistant to Richard Avedon, then near the peak of his celebrity as a fashion and portrait photographer. The experience with Avedon made him confident enough to set up as a photographer in his own right on his return to London, where he established his first studio in St John’s Wood. For a time he shot fashion pictures for the Observer and a few features for the Sunday Times, but it was already clear that advertising offered a far more lucrative career and one to which his technical gifts were well suited. Money from his advertising work paid for an office in London, a succession of powerful cars and a house in the Wiltshire village of Lacock, where the pioneer photographer Henry Fox Talbot had lived and died. Latterly Ray lived in the Roseland peninsula, Cornwall, in a house surrounded by olive trees that he had expensively imported on the grounds that if he could not live in St Tropez (he said his French wasn’t up to it), St Tropez could come to him. Ray was at his most confident behind a camera – in other situations he had a hesitant charm. He never married, though female partners came and went and he remained close to most of them. He doted on his terrier, Poppy, and spent many thousands on the operations that kept her alive. His friends remember him for his loyalty, generosity and sense of fun. • Ray Rathborne, photographer, born 19 September 1943; died 13 February 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/mar/27/holocaust-survivor-antisemitic-art-arthur-langerman","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-27T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"'Their message is urgent': the Holocaust survivor and his 7,000 pieces of antisemitic propaganda","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/mar/27/holocaust-survivor-antisemitic-art-arthur-langerman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/mar/27/holocaust-survivor-antisemitic-art-arthur-langerman","fields":{"headline":"'Their message is urgent': the Holocaust survivor and his 7,000 pieces of antisemitic propaganda","bodyText":"The drawing is detailed, dramatic and disgusting.

As the dates in the title suggest, the exhibition chronicles how anti-semitism grew at the end of the 19th century and reached a horrible culmination in the Holocaust. The works all come from private collection of Arthur Langerman, a Holocaust survivor. Born in Antwerp in 1942, at the age of two he was placed in an orphanage by the SS after his father and mother were sent to Auschwitz. Although his father perished, his mother survived and recovered her son, but never spoke to him about her wartime suffering. Langerman went on to found a successful diamond dealership, specialising in coloured gems. The trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961 jolted him awake to the horrors of the Holocaust. Fascinated, and finding a strong desire to understand, he began collecting antisemitic objects. Today, he has assembled some 7,000 pieces, including postcards, posters and paintings, not to mention dozens of wooden figurines from Strasbourg. At the end of the 19th century, these intricately carved images of grotesquely bearded, disfigured representations of Jewish peddlers and rabbis were popular in eastern France – an example of how hatred of Jews had for centuries pervaded western art, politics and popular culture, from fine arts and crafts for the elite to everyday toys and knick-knacks. “The collecting has became an obsession,” says Langerman, who says its purpose is “to illustrate various forms of hatred”. The exhibition is in three parts. It begins with the 1886 publication of Edouard Drumont’s publication of the antisemitic tract La France Juive (Jewish France) and the Dreyfus affair. The second section looks at the interwar period, 1918-33, and the third Nazism. While some objects are included, the focus is on postcards and posters. Among the most devious are Czech artist Karel Relink’s drawings, spread across 33 postcards, that misinterpret sayings from Talmud to deride Jewish traditions and rituals. The posters are more powerful. In one unsettling image, a black saxophonist sports a Star of David under the title Degenerate Music. In one work from Serbia, a white bearded Jew stares over a balance, with coins and banknotes in one side against trapped Yugoslav soldier in the other. A creepy poster from occupied Russia in 1942 shows an evil-looking Jew dressed up as a communist in red pyjamas striding over a pile of human skulls. Given the deplorable nature of their message, can any of these works really be called art? Yes, says Langerman. Many of the artists, such as Rupprecht, demonstrate a talent for creating strong, powerful images, he says. Rupprecht’s paintings show technical finesse, while Relink’s pastoral impressionist-like scenes continue to be sold at prestigious auctions. But Stéphane Grimaldi, the museum’s director general, disagrees. “These are historical documents,” he says, “they have no artistic value. They’re everything art isn’t.” He refused to put any paintings on display, preferring to focus instead on the graphic propaganda. Many historians agree with Grimaldi’s assessment. Steven Baum, editor of the Journal for the Study of Antisemitism, calls the collection “a gem and guidepost into understanding the transmission of hate”. Unsurprisingly, there is no real logic or consistency to the charges made against Jews. They are shown to be behind plots to undermine the nation. They are vilified, on the one hand, for being repugnant, fat, rich, money-obsessed capitalists who take advantage of the misery of the people; and on the other, as the violent, dangerous communists embodying the Red Terror. “The contradictions are so striking,” says Grimaldi. “One day, the Jews are poor. The next, rich. One day, they are the supreme capitalists. The next, communist.” Until now, Langerman’s collection has largely remained out of sight, tucked away in his Brussels home. Museums generally only showed works as parts of larger exhibitions, such as the US Holocaust Memorial Museum’s show on Nazi propaganda titled State of Deception. Now touring Europe, it arrives this month at Les Milles memorial outside Aix-en-Provence. Last year, Langerman allowed 12 posters to be shown at Belgium’s own Holocaust memorial, the Kazerne Dossin in Mechelen, the place where Jews were interned and then deported to Auschwitz. After he met Grimaldi, he decided to loan his museum parts of his collection. Today, with most of his objects stored in the third-floor office of his apartment, he ponders how best to preserve them. “If I donate them to a museum, I fear they will keep them in the basement,” he says. “I would prefer it to be the basis for an institute dedicated to studying and fighting antisemitism.” Langerman believed antisemitism was on the decline when he began his collection. Today, he’s no longer so sure. In 2014, he heard pro-Palestinian demonstrators in his native Antwerp scream “Kill the Jews”. This convinced him his collection still had “an urgent message – to show to the world what happened”. The rise of present-day extremism in Europe and the US adds to his anxiety. “After the war, the type of antisemitism found in my collection was a taboo,” he says. “Today, it no longer is.” Heinous Cartoons 1886-1945 is at the Caen-Normandy Memorial Museum, France, until 15 December • This article was amended on 27 March 2017.

The wind cut straight across the common. Underfoot it was all mud and straw. There were maybe 10 women in this protest camp. We were stood around a fire in big coats, woolly hats and wellies. Then, all of a sudden, gliding towards us in nothing thicker than a sweater, came Dora Russell. She was in her 90s by then. She looked so small and fragile, I thought she’d freeze to death, but she didn’t shiver once. I’m not sure she even noticed the cold. She was an old lady made of steel. It was the early 1980s. I’d just finished university in Sheffield and had joined protesters living at the women’s peace camp outside RAF Greenham Common in Berkshire. We were objecting to cruise missiles being based there. It was a remarkable protest. Not just its length – the camp lasted 19 years – but its achievements, too. Under our pressure, the missiles were removed and the base closed. It showed women everywhere that by using non-violence, we could influence global events. That’s perhaps why it appealed to Russell. She’d been a feminist and pacifist all her life. As a writer and activist, she’d pursued sexual and political liberation in an age when those ideals were totally alien to many. She was a pioneer; a giant. She came down that day for a Channel 4 interview. I can’t remember the specifics, but I think, during a previous visit, she had cut a hole in the RAF fence and was arrested; so the interview may have been about that. While everything was being set up, she spoke to us all individually – keep up the good work, stay strong, that kind of thing. Her voice was so soft that, even standing next to her, I could hardly hear it above the wind, but it was completely commanding. She was little and white-haired, but she had such astonishing presence. It’s difficult to know what to say to your heroes. I was 23. I wasn’t about to blurt out how I’d been reading about her since my teens. It wouldn’t have been appropriate anyway. In that camp we were equals – two women demanding peace. I didn’t say much actually. I listened. Besides, my main feeling, strangely, was wanting her to leave quickly. I wanted her out of the cold. In those temperatures a fire and cup of tea doesn’t keep you warm. I was relieved when she went. The whole visit lasted maybe 15 minutes, but I suppose her appearance ended up influencing my whole life. It made me feel that if she was still prepared to fight for her ideals at 90, then I should be, too. I decided I’d never let age stand in the way of doing what was right. I stayed living in a tent at the protest camp for 17 years.

As Tuchner was an unshowy man who allowed the performances and narrative to dominate a film, his contribution often went unsung, even though he made more than 40 television and big screen movies. Nevertheless, after his debut feature, Villain (1971), starring Richard Burton, he was always considered a safe pair of hands by producers and was nominated for four Bafta awards, winning one for the acclaimed BBC Play for Today production of Jack Rosenthal’s Bar Mitzvah Boy (1976). Tuchner was born in Berlin, the son of Martin, a tailor, and his wife, Rosa (nee Wolochwiansky). When he was seven, the family moved to the UK, just as the last remaining Jewish enterprises in Germany were being shut down by the Nazis. After the second world war the family settled in Manchester and Tuchner was awarded a scholarship to Manchester grammar school. He studied classics at University College London and was the president of the film society there, before joining the BBC as a trainee editor on the Tonight programme. He moved up to be a full-blown editor and director alongside Jack Gold and Kevin Billington, and worked on a number of television documentaries, many of which featured the BBC’s roving reporter Alan Whicker. Tuchner then directed two works in The Wednesday Play series – Sling Your Hook (1969), starring Michael Bates, and The Hunting of Lionel Crane (1970), with Robert Powell. Following in the naturalistic tradition of Mike Hodges’ Get Carter, Villain was a gritty crime thriller with excellent location work in London, including a gripping heist sequence. In it Burton played with relish a sadistic, snarling, gay gangster whose cockney accent had to be dubbed for baffled American audiences in the US release. So violent was Burton’s character, modelled on the East End crime boss Ronnie Kray, that, according to the publicity, “by the time he’s ready to kill you, it’s an act of mercy”. Continuing in action mode, Tuchner directed Fear Is the Key (1972), based on an Alistair MacLean novel. Mainly shot in Louisiana, it featured a spectacular 13-minute car chase with the hero (Barry Newman) driving a Ford Gran Torino. Mr Quilp (1975) was a cheery musical version of Charles Dickens’ The Old Curiosity Shop, providing a vehicle for Anthony Newley in the title role of the evil, misshapen moneylender. Tuchner’s Likely Lads film (1976) was a cut above most spin-offs from television comedy series. However, although it starred the same leads, James Bolam and Rodney Bewes as Geordie best mates, and had the same writers (Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, who also wrote Villain), the inflated sequel could not but suffer in comparison with the popular small-screen version. At the same time Tuchner directed several works in the Play for Today series (1974-76), including Bar Mitzvah Boy, a bittersweet comedy about the anxieties of a young working-class Jewish boy from north London approaching his big day. Despite having moved to Los Angeles in 1978, when he claimed to have been “the hottest director in Hollywood for 15 seconds”, Tuchner continued to work in the UK, where he made the Emmy-nominated television movie, Summer of My German Soldier (1978), a touching love story about an American teenage girl and a German PoW set in the second world war. He also made two episodes of Tales of the Unexpected (1979), introduced by Roald Dahl, who wrote the short stories on which the series was based. Tuchner was kept busy in the 80s directing television movies such as The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1982), with Anthony Hopkins impressive in the title role. The actor’s make-up alone, which took five hours each day to apply, was worth applause. Among Tuchner’s other notable television dramas, many of which dealt with social issues, were Not My Kid (1985), with George Segal as a doctor dealing with drug-addicted teenagers, and Amos (also 1985), with Kirk Douglas as a rebel in a nursing home. In 1989 Tuchner returned to the big screen with Wilt (known as The Misadventures of Mr Wilt in the US), a witty black comedy skilfully adapted from Tom Sharpe’s novel and starring Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith. In it Tuchner proved once more that he knew how far to go too far, particularly in a scene where Rhys Jones appears to be having sex with a lifesize, inflatable plastic doll. Nothing if not eclectic, Tuchner’s last feature was Back to the Secret Garden (2001), a charming sequel to Frances Hodgson Burnett’s classic children’s book. He is survived by his second wife, Dina Eaton, and by two children, Rebecca and Jonathan, from his first marriage, to Gillian Barton Cook, which ended in divorce. Ronald Bergan Michael Apted writes: In an unusual way, Michael Tuchner and I were kindred spirits, both happy to move between drama and documentary. He did very well at it, and through the rough and tumble he never lost his sense of humour and his love of life. I can still hear in my mind his penetrating laugh, which was mostly engaging, occasionally annoying. We worked side by side, competed with each other and fought for the same material. But the only time there was any bad blood between us was when we talked football. That, I suppose, is par for the course for English males. • Michael John Tuchner, film and television director, born 24 June 1932; died 17 February 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/mar/23/fleetwood-mac-tango-in-the-night-reissue-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-23T15:00:07Z","webTitle":"Fleetwood Mac: Tango in the Night review | Alexis Petridis' album of the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/23/fleetwood-mac-tango-in-the-night-reissue-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/mar/23/fleetwood-mac-tango-in-the-night-reissue-review","fields":{"headline":"Fleetwood Mac: Tango in the Night review – timely reissue coasts from gloss to gloom","bodyText":"The mid-80s were not the kindest time for 60s and 70s rock legends. For every gimlet-eyed operator who successfully navigated an alien and unforgiving landscape of power ballads, crashing snare drums, Fairlight synthesisers and MTV moonmen – the Eagles’ Don Henley and Glenn Frey; Tina Turner – there were scores who seemed utterly lost. It was a world in which the natural order of things had been turned on its head to such a degree that the drummer from Genesis was now one of the biggest stars on the planet. David Bowie, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Lou Reed … at best, they ended up making albums that diehard fans pick over for tiny morsels that suggest they’re not as bad as the reputations preceding them; at worst they made stuff they’d spend subsequent years loudly disowning, involving terrible clothes, inappropriate producers, awful cover versions and – in extreme cases – attempts to rap. In theory at least, Fleetwood Mac should have been in more trouble than anyone. The band that reassembled after a four-year hiatus to record 1987’s Tango in the Night was in even greater disarray than usual. The celebrated complications in their personal lives that had fuelled 1977’s 40m-selling Rumours were still taking a psychological toll, as was the band’s celebrated capacity for excess. Singer Stevie Nicks emerged from rehab, free of cocaine but soon to become addicted to clonazepam, a tranquilliser so strong she claimed not to remember a subsequent four-month US and European tour. Nicks rarely turned up to the recording sessions at guitarist and vocalist Lindsey Buckingham’s home studio; when she did, Buckingham banished her and drummer Mick Fleetwood to a Winnebago on the driveway, horrified at the state they were in. Bassist John McVie’s drinking was out of control; he had an alcohol-induced seizure the year Tango in the Night was released. The era was brought to a suitably miserable close when Buckingham and Nicks had a physical altercation after the former announced his departure from the band. Tango in the Night should have been a disaster; instead it sold 15m copies. But despite Buckingham’s belief that its synthesised slickness successfully “bulldozed” away the chaos behind its making, this 30th-anniversary edition, complete with two CDs of outtakes, B-sides and remixes, reveals Tango in the Night isn’t quite so straightforward. It is certainly polished to gleaming perfection – the only outtake that isn’t improved on is the version of closer You and I, four minutes longer and packed with gorgeous vocal harmonies and dreamy atmospherics, curiously excised from the album. And there’s some bulletproof pop songwriting here, a lot of it from the pen of Christine McVie, always the most poised of Fleetwood Mac’s trio of composers: Little Lies, the peerless Everywhere and Isn’t It Midnight, the latter a confection of booming drums, precise, tinkly synth and wailing guitar solos that sounds as if it’s just waiting to appear in the background of a film starring Ally Sheedy. But there are also tracks that speak loudly about Tango in the Night’s background. Most obviously, Nicks’s performances, which are pretty frayed at the edges. She pulled herself together for Seven Wonders, a song as gold-plated as any of McVie’s – though, in fact, it was written by Sandy Stewart and her contribution to its composition extended to mishearing and thus mis-singing a line. The reality of Nicks’s situation is revealed in Welcome to the Room … Sara, a fractured retelling of her time in rehab (“This is a dream, right?”) and When I See You Again, an acoustic ballad – or as acoustic as anything got in Tango in the Night’s heavily buffed sound world – on which she sounds authentically zonked, a spectral presence at the centre of her own song. Buckingham, meanwhile, couldn’t seem to stop an unsettled twitchiness seeping into even his most commercial songs: the staccato vocals of Family Man; the title track’s surges from quiet tension to florid solos; Big Love’s backing of grunts, moans and scampering guitar riffs. The latter found an unexpected audience in Ibiza as a Balearic anthem, but it’s hardly blissed out. Quite the opposite: it’s edgy and self-loathing (“I wake up alone with it all”); music with its eyes nervously darting about. This deluxe reissue feels timely. Buckingham may publicly fret that Fleetwood Mac are “incredibly unhip”, but we now live in a world where their influence hangs heavy over pop, from the sound of Haim to hipster DJ collective Fleetmac Wood, who play nothing but Fleetwood Mac records. Rumours is hailed as a work of consummate songwriting power, rather than the kind of thing punk came to save us from, Tusk is viewed as an experimental tour de force rather than a confused sprawl, and even 1982’s soft-rock compromise Mirage is lauded by artists including Hot Chip. But somehow Tango in the Night has escaped critical re-evaluation: something of what you might call the unrevived 80s – the aspects of the decade too crushingly uncool to warrant nostalgia – still clings to it. But if anything, Tango in the Night seems even more deserving of the “flawed masterpiece” tag than Tusk. The gloss can’t hide the turmoil, no matter how thickly it’s applied. As with Roxy Music’s Avalon, you’re struck by the sense of an album with something far darker and odder at its core than its reputation as a yuppie soundtrack suggests. In the 30 years since its release, the five people behind Tango in the Night have not managed to make another album together. That’s a pity – as the run of albums that began with 1975’s Fleetwood Mac and ended here demonstrates, the quintet were once an unstoppable musical force, even when forces conspired to stop them. But listening to Tango in the Night’s repeated lurches from breeziness to angst and sparkle to gloom, it doesn’t seem terribly surprising."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/ng-interactive/2017/mar/26/simone-lia-on-mothers-day","type":"interactive","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-26T07:00:24Z","webTitle":"Simone Lia on Mother's Day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ng-interactive/2017/mar/26/simone-lia-on-mothers-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/ng-interactive/2017/mar/26/simone-lia-on-mothers-day","fields":{"headline":"Simone Lia on Mother's Day","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/apr/04/french-presidential-election-how-the-candidates-compare","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-04T10:00:48Z","webTitle":"French presidential election: how the candidates compare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/04/french-presidential-election-how-the-candidates-compare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/apr/04/french-presidential-election-how-the-candidates-compare","fields":{"headline":"French presidential election: how the candidates compare","bodyText":"Voters cast their ballots in the first round of the French presidential election on 23 April, with candidates ranging from far right to hard left vying to reach a second round run-off and, from there, the Elysée Palace.

When I asked if we could reschedule some non-urgent work, you replied: “Have I showed you what *Emma did yesterday with her new hat?” Emma is your baby daughter. Two minutes later I try to ask again about rescheduling the work, but you cut me off to tell me another story about Emma. During the 40 or so hours we spend together in the office each week, the majority of our conversations are about Emma. I was very happy for you when you had a baby. But since you came back from maternity leave, your whole personality has changed. You are no longer a scary, impatient and irritable leader – but much happier, more positive and relaxed. The only downside is that you only ever talk about your baby. Each day I listen to what Emma said this morning, what she ate last night, and how much cleverer she is than other children. You compare her constantly to other babies, and explain how she is infinitely more intelligent. You call your husband every morning in the office and gush: “How’s my gorgeous darling doing?” Emma is put on the phone and I am subjected to rounds of: “Mummy loves you, Mummy misses you.” Last afternoon you asked me to update some finance figures. Before I even had a chance to answer, you burst out: “Oh Emma did the silliest thing last night, I have to show you!” before pulling out some photos of her in different outfits. I’m 36, single and child-free. Every mention of Emma feels like a reminder of my own failure to settle down and start a family. As you delight in happy baby chatter, I sit there in silence feeling like a failure, bearing it as best I can. I expect you have no idea you make me feel this way. Perhaps it’s only fair to let you know. But it’s not easy in the competitive environment we work in. I worry that I will offend you, or expose myself as being overly emotional. I don’t want you to see this as a weakness. At the same time I feel guilty about not wanting to hear more about your baby. It’s such a happy time – bringing a new life into the world. I should want to hear about it, but I don’t. In your happy bubble, you forget how other people are feeling. I wish you could be more empathetic. I wish one day you would ask me how I am, and how things in my life are going.

It is time to treat abortion like any other medical procedure, and control it with regulation and the GMC. It is wrong that three women have been jailed or had a suspended sentence, and that doctors responding to women’s requests may face criminal prosecution. Many people (and even some gynaecologists) do not realise abortion is a criminal offence unless it conforms with the conditions set out in the Act. Up to 80% of people polled believe the woman should make the decision in consultation with her doctor and 90% of a random sample of gynaecologists surveyed in 2015 said that the woman should make the decision to end her pregnancy. It is time for women to be treated as autonomous adults capable of making their own decisions about continuing a pregnancy, a view that the some tabloid newspapers seem incapable of understanding.

An entourage of 100 people quaffed wine in tents on this holy island while Edward I dispensed alms after his brutal conquest of Wales. Whoever is governing Britain in 2023 would be wise to study Edward I’s canny statesmanship. This is when the Houses of Parliament are due to be emptied of politicians for six years for a £4bn refurbishment, with parliamentary business continuing in other London buildings. By 2023, Britain’s political landscape will be transformed. Brexit will be complete, Scotland may have departed, and there will be no hiding place for our political class. Living in Norfolk and roaming Britain’s countryside without Edward’s wine or entourage, I encounter a deep disgruntlement with globalisation. After Brexit, this hostility will turn from the European Union to the city-state of London and its global elites, currently absurdly embodied by George Osborne’s straddling of Westminster, the City of London and Fleet Street. Insularity is viewed as a characteristic of isolated villages, but Westminster suffers from it too. Policymakers would find their groupthink challenged by sessions in Truro, Newcastle, Cardiff, Belfast or Glasgow (optimistically assuming that Scotland is still with us). Of course London is not all rich and elsewhere all poor, but a travelling circus could dispense some of the alms needed to narrow the economic gulf between capital and country. It might also bridge a growing cultural rift. The countryside receives a trickle-down taste of city glamour from weekending DFLs (as Down From London folk are called in these parts) but feels patronised and invisible. A people who don’t see themselves in government or media stop engaging with both. In 1284, two boys were paid 4d for clearing nettles for Edward’s tents on Ynys Enlli. I’d happily hack away some brambles. Osborne and the like can pitch tent in my neck of the woods. On the road to nowhere When I trek, bumpkin-like, to the Guardian’s London office, I gaze at the lavish modernised tube stations and Crossrail. Norwich’s out-of-town hospital opened in 2001 within a mile and a half of a railway, but no new station was built. In fact, Norfolk hasn’t had a new railway station for 25 years. I live near a station 10 minutes from Norwich that is surrounded by fields and used by just 35 people each day. Instead of planning a sustainable suburb around this ghostly facility, the austerity-strapped county council is part-funding a dual carriageway “road to nowhere” a mile away to enable new car-choked housing estates. A study for the Campaign to Protect Rural England finds traffic increases by an average of 47% above equivalent places in areas where new roads are built. Just one in five new roads demonstrates evidence of economic benefit, and that is weak. Perhaps post-Brexit we’ll take our pitchforks to the dismal vision of car-based suburbs that dominates many provincial places. Why the Cornish 500 matter As a provincial punter, I greatly appreciate the BBC’s shift to Salford. But the BBC has been criticised in a recent Council of Europe report for not providing more Cornish language programming . More significantly, the council criticises the government for cutting up to £150,000 of annual funding for the language. Cornish is fluently spoken by barely 500 people. But we’re diminished if it becomes extinct."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/mar/20/nsa-british-intelligence-trump-wiretap-spy","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T16:28:15Z","webTitle":"NSA director says British intelligence was not asked to spy on Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/20/nsa-british-intelligence-trump-wiretap-spy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/mar/20/nsa-british-intelligence-trump-wiretap-spy","fields":{"headline":"NSA director says British intelligence was not asked to spy on Trump","bodyText":"British intelligence officials were formally exonerated on Monday by the director of the US National Security Agency from an extraordinary accusation of improper surveillance of Donald Trump. The NSA director, Michael Rogers, made clear that it would have been a violation of US law to ask the British to conduct such an operation. Asked at the first public hearing into Trump’s ties to Russia whether he, or anyone else, had asked GCHQ to spy on Trump or his allies, Rogers replied: “No, sir, nor would I.” GCHQ took rare public exception last week when the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, cited a Fox News report that implied Barack Obama’s administration had asked the UK to conduct surveillance on Trump. GCHQ, which typically does not comment on news reports, called the accusation “nonsense”, “utterly ridiculous” and an assertion that ought to be “ignored”. Rogers, his voice passionate, said that using GCHQ to effectively launder illegal surveillance on Americans would be “against the Five Eyes concept”. Five Eyes is the surveillance alliance between the US, UK, New Zealand, Canada and Australia, which include widespread intelligence sharing and mutual development of surveillance tools. GCHQ in particular is the closest intelligence partner the NSA possesses. NSA and GCHQ personnel share code, and, in several locations, physically work side by side. Their intimate nature was underscored by Rogers’ deputy, Rick Ledgett, telling the BBC that the accusation showed an ignorance of the GCHQ-NSA partnership. “Of course they wouldn’t do it. It would be epically stupid,” Ledgett said. Spicer recycled the GCHQ allegation, made by a Fox News pundit, in order to defend Trump’s 4 March accusation, made on Twitter, that Obama placed Trump’s associates under surveillance at Trump Tower. Obama has unequivocally denied the accusation, which, if proven, would mean that he had committed a felony. The FBI director, James Comey, on Monday publicly called the accusation groundless, the first time he has commented on the explosive accusation. Comey joined the Republican and Democratic leadership of the intelligence committees in finding no basis for Trump’s incendiary claim. Yet Trump has still not backed away from the accusation of GCHQ surveillance on him, even after GCHQ expressed its anger. Trump, in a White House press conference meeting last week with Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, said he was merely citing Fox News. Trump joked that he and Merkel, whom the NSA had indeed spied upon, had something in common. That remark prompted Sir Peter Westmacott, former British ambassador to Washington, to accuse Trump of “peddling falsehoods”. “This is a dangerous game,” Westmacott wrote in the Guardian. “The intelligence relationship between Britain and America is unique and precious. It is critical to our shared efforts to counter terrorism.” Asked by the House intelligence committee whether the false assertions might damage the intelligence-sharing relationship, Rogers, the NSA chief said: “It clearly frustrates allies of ours.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"voluntary-sector-network/2017/mar/23/charities-lose-third-staff-digital-skills","type":"article","sectionId":"voluntary-sector-network","sectionName":"Voluntary Sector Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-23T07:36:05Z","webTitle":"Charities could lose a third of staff if they don't get a grip on digital skills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2017/mar/23/charities-lose-third-staff-digital-skills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/voluntary-sector-network/2017/mar/23/charities-lose-third-staff-digital-skills","fields":{"headline":"Charities could lose a third of staff if they don't get a grip on digital skills","bodyText":"The government has signalled its intention for the UK to lead on technology: its digital strategy, published earlier this month, commits to training millions of people. Yet little has been done to map the current state of digital skills in charities. Earlier this year we surveyed the sector for our charity digital skills report on how charities are using technology and the challenges they face. Almost 500 charity professionals from a range of organisations across the UK responded. The results are worrying. Our report shows that the sector is struggling as skills gaps and a lack of funding seriously impede progress. Charities told us they fear missing out on fundraising opportunities if their organisations do not get to grips with digital, and could lose touch with their supporters. A significant number of staff are considering leaving if progress isn’t made. Main findings A lack of digital strategy is hampering charities’ progress: 50% of charities don’t have one. Yet 80% of respondents to our survey want their leadership team to provide a clear vision of digital and what it could help them achieve, while 66% want a good digital strategy – so this is not due to a lack of willing. Without a digital strategy in place, time and money can be wasted on digital activities that become an end goal in themselves. A good strategy involves thinking more comprehensively about how digital can help achieve your charity’s goals and how to get there. The reason why some charities don’t have a strategy seems to be partly because they don’t see digital as a priority. Of the charities surveyed 50% told us that they are facing other challenges, all of which are seen as more important. Dave Evans, product marketing manager at Skills Platform, says “digital appears to be pushed down the priority list. One respondent told us that boards and senior managers dismiss it as just being about social media or websites. Digital skills should really be seen as business skills.” Meanwhile, 57% cite skills and 52% lack of funding as the biggest barriers to getting more from digital. While it’s not unusual for charities to be constrained by resources, the sector is going to have to find creative ways to tackle these issues. For example, Jamie Ward-Smith, chief executive of Do-It Trust, believes funders need to step up too. He says: “They have huge potential to influence how charities engage with digital, such as by requiring funding bids to outline how digital will be used to deliver services and at the very least using digital themselves to engage with applicants and secure feedback.” Charity leaders in particular need to invest in digital skills or their organisations may not be sustainable in the long-term. There is a huge skills gap on charity boards, and almost three quarters (71%) of charities stated that their board’s digital skills were low or had room for improvement. If their board and leadership team do not develop their digital skills, more than half are worried about giving competitors an advantage (53%), losing touch with their audience (53%) or becoming irrelevant (53%). Vicky Browning, chief executive of Acevo, is clear that “charity and social enterprise leaders have a crucial role in identifying and capitalising on the opportunities digital technologies present because only strong leadership can drive change”. Meanwhile, 66% of charities are worried that if they continue to remain unprepared for the shift towards digital fundraising, they will miss out on fundraising opportunities, not to mention exposing themselves to a range of risks including cyber-attacks and reputational damage. Using, managing and analysing data emerged as particular areas of concern in the survey, with 64% of respondents rating themselves as fair to low. This has worrying implications for how charities tackle new regulations around data protection. Charities were more confident about some digital channels. 70% say they have good to fair email marketing skills, and 44% rate themselves as good at social media. Charities are, however, struggling to attract and retain digital talent – 86% of respondents told us that it was important to them to work for a charity that is progressing in its attitude to digital. If they feel their charity is not progressing, 36% of respondents will either look for a job with a digitally-savvy charity or are unsure if they can commit to their role for the long-term. While this is a bleak picture, we believe that it represents a huge opportunity for charities. Charities must seize the moment to lead on the digital agenda and use these tools to generate more income, reach more supporters and be more relevant than ever.

It’s the sound of the Rhythm Method, the London duo who are managing to accomplish the hitherto impossible seeming task of making indie music that feels brand new. But where there is innovation, there will be derision, something the makers of this divisively odd sound are all too aware of. “I feel like we’re in for a lot of hate once more people hear us,” says Joey, the band’s 27-year-old frontman. If the fledgling outfit’s current following is anything to go by – Elton John and Suggs are fans, while Mike Skinner produced their latest single – that surge in popularity, and vitriol, could be just around the corner. With their wonkily infectious takes on everything from UK garage and lover’s rock to pop house and new wave, the band are responsible for some of the most distinctive music of the past couple of years. But they are also on a mission: to restore British pop to its former glory. “These days it’s so polarised. You have 6 Music which is so serious, and then you have Radio 1, which just sounds like a bunch of people having the time of their lives in Ibiza,” Joey’s bandmate Rowan says, explaining the present divide between pop and indie. “We want to have songs that a massive amount of people are singing along to, but we’re never ever being idiotic about it.” The pair look back to the new wave heyday of the 70s and 80s when bands trod a middle ground between ebullience and introspection. “All my favourite bands have been in the middle whether it be Aztec Camera, Style Council or Madness,” Rowan explains. “They were indie bands but they had this massive pop appeal.” The Rhythm Method began life as a solo project, started by Joey during a spell of unemployment four years ago. “I was living this depressed life, getting quite high every day and eating a lot of food,” he remembers. “I started fiddling about on Garageband on my mum’s iPad. I wrote about 25 songs and put them straight on Soundcloud. I think they averaged about seven listens.” Soon afterwards, he moved in with his old friend Rowan, and they began rejigging the results of Joey’s songwriting splurge. “It was like nothing I’d ever heard”, says Rowan. “Like Magnetic Fields done by someone who didn’t really understand anything about music”. Despite that naivety, the pair weren’t total amateurs. They first met as teenagers in the 00s indie scene and were both in bands (Rowan’s group, Burmese Days, were once supported by Florence + the Machine). When that moment passed, they were free to indulge their own, more esoteric tastes. “These are things to amuse ourselves,” says Rowan of the band’s material. Their pub rock song Local, Girl was born when they decided “let’s write a song about pubs. It was all just an in-joke basically,” says Rowan. “And it got played on Radio 1.” Not that the band itself are a joke. Although their music is frequently laugh-out-loud – not only in the pun-heavy lyrics, but the sound of the songs themselves (“Local, Girl sounds very Phoenix Nights, very cheap,” says Joey) – their combination of silliness and seriousness aligns them with acts such as Lil Yachty, Grimes and London collective PC Music, for whom irreverence is not at odds with sincerity. “It’s the difference between being funny and being ironic,” explains Rowan. In fact, much of the jarring – even eye-watering – nature of the Rhythm Method’s output comes from the fact they don’t have anything to hide behind, whether it be irony, generic conventions, or a group of like-minded peers. “I feel like people are put off by [our music] because it’s too honest”, reveals Joey. “My lyrics are a bit close to the bone.” It’s true that the band’s songs are almost awkward in their specificity – whether they are referencing Cherie Blair, Wetherspoons or George Best – and the impression is compounded by the vulnerable nature of the sound: Rowan’s offish backing vocals, Joey’s half-spoken lyrics. “I thought if you’re not doing a cockney, mockney accent it would be weird to do it in my neutral lower-middle-class voice,” he says. “But that’s kind of what it’s all about now. That honesty, that suburban boring accent.” Rhythm Method’s songs gild that suburban mundanity with glimpses of the sublime. Local, Girl imbues the world of slightly depressing boozers with a strange majesty, whereas Home Sweet Home is a paean to a hometown being obliterated through gentrification, injecting everything pedestrian – from yellow lines to Magic FM – with a sense of awe. It’s part of a heritage of sentimental city songs, from Waterloo Sunset to Up the Junction, that evoke an almost unbearable nostalgia for a crappier but happier time. Joey’s dad lived in Putney in the 1970s and “filled me with stories. You’d have rock stars and footballers and gangsters all running round with each other and I kind of see the world through those rose-tinted glasses,” he explains. Rowan agrees. “My dad and my uncle were very big Dr Feelgood fans, they would have gone to see Squeeze, and I grew up with that music. We both have this second-hand lineage.” This misty-eyed view of the 70s is something they attribute to growing up in the 90s. “Nothing had actually changed since the 70s and 80s,” Joey says of his childhood. “They were still showing Rising Damp on telly, Only Fools and Horses.” This sense of nostalgia once-removed is something the pair are keen to capture in their music. Their tour driver Mitch once told them it reminded him of “being in a pub as a kid and hearing songs on the radio”, says Rowan. “And I feel like that’s one of the best things ever said about us.” Making music about how much you miss the 70s when you weren’t even there might seem a strange concept, but that doesn’t mean Rhythm Method haven’t got their eyes firmly fixed on the future. “I genuinely want to be the most important slash biggest band of our generation,” says Joey, as they prepare their debut album. “I feel confident about it and I’m not a very confident person. I would know if we were shit, and I don’t think we are.” For now, the pair are playing the long game. “People get won round by it,” says Rowan. “‘I fucking hated you at first, but now I can’t stop listening’ is the reaction we get a lot.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/apr/11/housing-associations-face-storm-of-complaints-over-new-build-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-11T10:00:41Z","webTitle":"Housing associations face storm of complaints over new-build homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/11/housing-associations-face-storm-of-complaints-over-new-build-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/apr/11/housing-associations-face-storm-of-complaints-over-new-build-homes","fields":{"headline":"Housing associations face storm of complaints over new-build homes","bodyText":"Housing associations responsible for more than 175,000 homes are facing allegations of serial neglect of their residents and properties, focused on an array of new-build developments in London that have received more than £60m in public money. The issues uncovered by a Guardian investigation include damp, mould, nonexistent security, outages in heating and hot water, inadequate repairs, and infestation by rats and mice. There are also many complaints about poor and often misleading customer service. The investigation found issues with five housing associations: Catalyst, Sanctuary, Notting Hill Housing, Wandle, and the One Housing Group. Residents raised problems including: Failing lifts that rendered a wheelchair user housebound for a week and a half. Security failures that meant premises were open to intruders over a period of months. Families repeatedly left without heating or hot water. The cases involve both tenants, and some among the rising numbers of people in London who live in shared-ownership properties in which housing associations retain a stake. Some of them also highlight alleged failings by big building firms. Housing associations are not-for-profit organisations that have come to play a dominant role in social and so-called affordable housing. Critics say the findings raise concerns about standards in the new-build housing market, linked to the government’s ongoing drive to deregulate housing in the capital and the decision of many associations to concentrate on commercial property development. The latest developments follow revelations in the Guardian about Orchard Village, a new estate in east London owned and run by Clarion Housing, the UK’s largest housing association, and funded by £30m of public money. Over the past three years, residents there have complained about a huge range of problems, many apparently related to poor building standards. Last month, after Clarion agreed to buy back some of the affected properties, the association’s chairman resigned. In response to inquiries from the Guardian, a spokesperson for Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said that in all the cases concerned, grants had been awarded by the previous mayor, Boris Johnson. Steve Hilditch, a housing expert who has worked as the head of policy for Shelter and a housing adviser to the last Labour government, said the cases highlighted two linked trends. “There’s clearly something going wrong in the new-build housing market to do with standards, and it needs to be tackled,” he said. He also saw a problem in the changing culture of many big housing associations. “The big housing associations have become massive developers. They’re expanding very quickly. To my mind, some of them have lost their focus on housing need, and managing their existing homes,” he said. Catalyst Housing oversees more than 21,000 homes across London and the south-east. At its Caulfield Park development in south Acton, west London, which was completed in 2011 and assisted by £19.5m in grants from the Greater London Authority (GLA), residents say they have complained for five years about repeatedly broken lifts, infestation by rats and mice, and faulty plumbing. Chris Babet, a Catalyst tenant who has multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, lives in a fifth-floor flat with his family. He says in early 2016 both lifts in his block broke down simultaneously and he was left housebound for a week and a half. He also says he requested electronic door-opening equipment from the housing association, which he needed to avoid his wheelchair being damaged by opening and closing doors, but that it only arrived after the intervention of his MP, 18 months after his initial request. He says hot water in his family’s flat is often intermittent, at best. Though Willmott Dixon, the builders which constructed Caulfield Park, say “there are no openings left within walls and ceilings of individual properties following our work”, other residents say mice and rats get into their properties through such cavities, and that their presence results in a smell traceable to the animals’ urine and excrement, and noise they can hear in their flats. “In the evenings, you can hear them going through the ceilings and in the walls – just running around,” said Zakirya Mohammed, who has lived in his flat since 2012. “We’ve complained to Catalyst several times about this, and got nothing.” Catalyst says it has come up with a “thorough action plan” for the development. A spokesperson told the Guardian: “On behalf of Catalyst, I’d like to apologise to the residents of Caulfield Park for any discomfort or inconvenience that they have experienced.” Sanctuary is among the UK’s biggest housing organisations, with a portfolio that contains around 100,000 homes. At its Artizan Court development in Wood Green, north London, completed in 2014 and assisted by a Greater London Authority (GLA) grant of £1.9m, residents say that security issues, shabby building work and issues around leaks, damp and mould have been compounded by Sanctuary’s slow and sometimes misleading responses to their complaints. Between December 2016 and February this year, after problems in a shared-ownership block with the main gate and front door, both failed, which left the development completely open. As well as intruders, some of whom were homeless people who took up temporary residence, residents say there were reports of people’s doors being tried in the small hours. Sanctuary claimed that issues with security were a result of vandalism, which residents say does not answer their questions about why repairs have taken so long. “It took three months for the door to be fixed – it was vandalised once,” said one Artizan Court resident. Beyond an assurance that “if we haven’t met expectations, we will put things right ”, Sanctuary offered no direct answers to accounts of bad customer service, or poor building and plumbing standards. In January, Sanctuary was confirmed as the single biggest recipient of government money under the new shared ownership and affordable homes programme, and is set to receive £90m of public funds between now and 2021. Last year, its chief executive, David Bennett, was paid £340,000. Housing associations’ new commercial tilt is exemplified by Notting Hill Housing, which was founded in 1964, and now owns and runs about 32,000 homes. Like many housing associations, it now partly funds its operations via commercial property development. In 2007, it announced the completion of Carillon Court, a 51-flat development in Aldgate, east London. The Sunday Times claimed it had succeeded in “making small look sexy”. Now, Carillon Court is the focus of a dispute involving residents, the housing association, and Bugler, the construction firm who built it. Residents began to complain about leaks and damp in 2009, when one resident claimed that “the property that I bought in good faith and paid a large sum of money for is now, I, believe uninhabitable … My health is suffering, not only due to the stress but also because of the damp.” Among the other people affected are a family of seven living in a flat in which damp and mould are present in all but one room, who have serious concerns about resulting ill-health. Bugler construction say s it has not been notified of any problems since 2010. Notting Hill told the Guardian it was aware of “both latent defects and maintenance and repairs issues” and was working to remedy them. One recent case involving a new-build development highlights many of the same issues. Solomon’s Passage, in Peckham, south London, was completed in 2010 and owned and run by Wandle, who oversee 7,000 homes across nine London boroughs. Last year, it was announced that two blocks containing 48 homes were to be demolished, because of issues including water damage and faulty roofs and balconies. The entire development attracted £9.4m of public money. Wandle said it was working with its lawyers to ascertain who was legally responsible for what ha d happened. It said there remain ed “a huge amount of work to do” to bring the rest of the development up to a good standard . The GLA sa id that once the blocks ha d been demolished, it “will be able to recover” the relevant amount of public money.

Patients lie in beds lined up along soft hallways with harsh light, and the doctors have what they call a “campfire” going, a ring of moaning patients huddled in beds around a central dispatch area. An alarm sounds, and Dr Gerard Martin has two minutes to prepare. He doesn’t yet know what tragedy will arrive by ambulance into the resuscitation bay, but he knows it’s a matter of life or death. The doctor and the patient arrive at the resus (short for resuscitation) room at the same time: Martin in a white lab coat with a rapid energy devoid of panic, and the patient naked and unresponsive. One of two resuscitation bays where the most severe cases are taken, the room is all stainless steel and focused dynamism. Fourteen medical professionals swirl the room, unwrapping plastic packages and holding needles while paramedics perform CPR. Two nurses ready a yellow and black machine that looks like a drill press with an oversized button where the chuck would be. “We call that the thumper,” Martin winks before guiding a resident who is threading a needle into the flesh near the patient’s collarbone. “The thumper” is an automated CPR machine, manufactured in Michigan. A tech attaches it around the man’s body. The piston compresses his chest with a pneumatic sound and a click, like one of the stamping machines in Detroit’s long-gone factories. The patient’s belly fat roils, his ribs break. Five minutes. Another resident squirts blood into a pan. Ten minutes. The patient’s son is escorted from the room. Twenty minutes. The ambulance asks for its stretcher back. Time of death: 7.26pm, heart attack. Detroit is one of America’s most violent and impoverished cities, and Martin has spent nearly 30 years on the spear-tip of the health crisis in a violent and ill country. From crack (not as big a problem now as in the 1980s) to gunshot wounds (fairly steady, worse when it’s hot) to heroin (currently at epidemic proportions), the challenges have varied. But Martin and the staff at Detroit’s last not-for-profit hospital have tackled them all. When other civic institutions were leaving Detroit, along with prosperity and civic order, Henry Ford hospital stayed to care for the sick. Even in what may be the most desperate city in the US, if you have a heart attack, medicine has reached a level of sophistication where no fewer than 14 people will work to keep you alive if you reach the hospital, regardless of your ability to pay. As healthcare in the US continues to change, namely in the battle over government run and administered insurance, it makes sense to take a look at one of America’s most august and storied hospitals and their staff for insight and guidance. “One of the best things about Henry Ford is, if the guy’s homeless, and they’re having the same symptoms as the mayor, they get the same treatment,” Martin said one evening, finishing an interrupted thought from the ER. “To the people that do it, it’s not that remarkable. It’s the way it should be done. In my opinion, everyone should have healthcare – ” He’s interrupted. Another alarm, another patient, another life in his hands. ••• Slight and physically unimposing, Martin is an accomplished cyclist as well as a superbly talented doctor. He often rides his bicycle to work from his house in Grosse Pointe, an inner-ring suburb of Detroit. He has also ridden it clear across the country. “I rode from Oregon to New Hampshire,” he says at dinner one night, characteristically humble about his accomplishments. It took him only 50 days. Formerly the head of the ER department and now semi-retired, Martin has the particular characteristic of bowing his head and smiling sheepishly when someone praises his long list of accomplishments. He commands a staff of hundreds at the apex of a hierarchy resembling the military, yet when speaking with patients he says things like “belly” rather than “stomach”, and “sick” instead of “injured”. As he speaks, he guides hospital beds through doors with the relaxed demeanor that comes after 30 years removing bullets, suturing knife wounds and watching people live or die on his watch. His countenance on the whole suggests a retired and beloved elementary school principal more than a man who has been up to the forearms inside a chest cavity due to axe wounds. “He has thousands of lives to his name,” I hear as I make my way through the corridors of the dignified red-brick hospital. “He just walks on water.” “I would follow him anywhere.” In the triage bay, Martin explains the workings of a sonography machine, while a woman in ripped jeans and an orange T-shirt yells at a rubber-gloved nurse. Each bed is separated by a curtain, but the woman in orange has ripped hers open. She entered the ER complaining of chest pains and is drunk. The patient’s shouts become insults and the nurse moves to restrain her. “Fuck you, you fucking faggot,” the woman screams at man. “I know my rights.” A scrum of police officers, EMTs and technicians move to help the struggling nurse, but the woman’s cries and insults only become louder and more full of pain, her struggles more ferocious. Martin stops his demonstration and steps into the middle of the crowd, waving everyone’s hands off the woman. In less time than it takes to hand-wash a coffee cup, and with mysterious grace, Martin has defused the situation. As he checks the woman’s heart with a stethoscope, he explains exactly what is about to happen to her – the nurses will hook her up to an EKG machine, among other procedures – and gets the woman to lie down, still muttering at the original nurse but pliable. Martin seems unfazed and almost joyous through the ordeal. He leads with quiet slyness, kindness and confidence – and 30 years of experience practicing those traits. “When I was young, I thought: ‘I’m going to go to medical school, I’m going to become a doctor, and I’ll make enough money so that I can live in the woods in Vermont on a farm and I’m going to work two days a week,’” he said one evening. “I never in a million years pictured myself in the inner city, of any city, working in the situation I do.” Henry Ford hospital has 877 beds, with 77 of them in the emergency room. Its intensive care unit holds more patients than any other in Michigan, and its emergency department is the third-busiest based on volume. More than 100,000 people visit the ER at Henry Ford every year. The ER itself is split into four categories, numbered one through four, with category one holding the most acute patients. Martin is on this rotation today: a man who took too many seizure meds and is in a coma; a “heavy user” who shows up to ERs across the city multiple days a week because he is lonely or mentally ill; a woman who has been in an auto accident and is wearing a neck brace. Martin touches each in turn, with ungloved hands. The physical proximity in the ER isn’t exactly cramped, but it is close. “Ah, some residents always use gloves, but I don’t really mind,” he says matter-of-factly when washing his hands between patients. Next, he attends a woman with acute diabetes. “Oh, your hands are cold,” winces the woman. “Cold hands, warm heart,” the doctor replies. She laughs, and Martin asks the woman about the nurse taking her blood. “She was great! She got [the needle] in on the first try!” “We usually call her five-poke Sarah,” Martin jokes. “They do not!” the nurse laughs. According to the hospital, statistically at least one of these patients is on Medicaid, the healthcare program run by both federal and state governments for low-income Americans. Of Henry Ford’s patients, 18% are on Medicaid or a Medicaid HMO, and another 43% are on Medicare, the federal program for seniors. One of the cornerstones of the Republicans’ new American Health Care Act is a plan to begin rolling back the increased support that the Affordable Care Act gave states for Medicare expansion, starting in 2020. “I’m a big supporter of the Affordable Care Act for its principles and policies,” Wright Lassiter III, the president and CEO of Henry Ford Health System, tells me in his office. It’s less gaudy than I would have expected for the head of a $6bn organization, possibly owing to the hospital’s not-for-profit nature. But it’s still spacious and stately. “I think our principle problem in society, with healthcare, is that as a society we haven’t decided yet, like every other industrialized country, that every citizen should have healthcare and that makes our society better.” He pauses for effect. “Now, how you pay for it or who provides it – is it a tax credit or a block grant, or is it a government subsidy, or whatever – we can debate that on political lines or on economic development lines or on social justice lines or on a number of fronts. But our fundamental problem is we’re still debating what most countries believe is a truism, which is: everyone should have healthcare insurance.” The Affordable Care Act (ACA), colloquially known as Obamacare, cut the number of uninsured people in America by about two-fifths. It increased the number of insured individuals by approximately 20 million, with 30 or so million left uninsured. In Michigan alone, more than 630,000 became insured through the law’s Medicare expansion and another 345,000 or so via the healthcare exchanges. It’s about one in every 10 people in Michigan. What is less clear is what effect that has had on the overall health of the state’s population and the health of its urban hospitals. Nearly everyone interviewed for this story agreed that the ACA hadn’t had time to “reach equilibrium”, as Manu Malhotra, associate chief medical officer, put it while sitting next to Martin in the ER. Predicted drastic spikes in ER visits haven’t come to pass, but neither have drastically increased revenues for hospitals such as Henry Ford. The equation has now simply changed in complex ways, and hasn’t had time to bear economic or medical fruit – or fail to do so. There simply hasn’t been enough time to tell. “Society at large, and people with the ability to pay, currently already shoulder the burden of providing the cost of healthcare coverage to the people who are unable to afford it – and do that in the most expensive and inefficient way possible by providing care only in emergency situations,” Malhotra said. “Finding a better way to do that is essential, and the Affordable Care Act is the only cohesive effort that we’ve seen on the national level.” On a Wednesday, Malhotra and Martin are deciding whether to remove the bullets from a man who has been shot multiple times. Contrary to televisual opinion, bullets are generally left inside the body unless they actively present a danger to the patient or interfere with future medical procedures. They decide one bullet will need to be removed, so a screening can be performed, while the others will stay. All the residents are out taking tests this day, so Martin will perform the procedure himself. “Get the metal pan!” Martin jokes, aping the Hollywood convention of a gruff doctor dropping each slug into a brass surgical tray with a solid “plink”. Martin pantomimes the motion, holing up his fingers dramatically, and Malhotra chimes in with a “ding!” when the phantom bullet falls. Everyone laughs. “We have 50 of those pans in the back,” he says to me, clearly kidding, but the joke belies the typical gallows humor used as a coping method of those – cops, firefighters, soldiers – who work with death daily. “The children are the most difficult,” Martin tells me later, shaking his head. “I like joking around, but when someone’s sick it’s no time for joking. You need to buckle down and know what to do and take care of the patient. Put the patient first.” A woman sits with her elderly mother, who wears a breathing mask. She has a degenerative nervous system disease and will one day stop breathing, her mind fully alert, because her brain can no longer tell her diaphragm to contract. The same day, another family, in the corner and speaking a foreign language, huddles around a matriarch quite literally kept alive by machines. Although this person they love cannot communicate with them, they cannot in turn let her go. A scared teenager has a dislocated shoulder. A hilarious elder gentleman tells anyone within earshot his historic life story as he lies in bed with chest pains. A professional woman is terrified by a mysterious rash. Martin inspects them all with the care of a good dad scrutinizing scrapes and bruises on a calming child. The national healthcare battle seems to be waged largely with swords of political ideology and money rather than bodies and souls, and the man lying with bullets lodged inside his frame can seem an afterthought. They say a single death is a tragedy and a million is a statistic. Some of those statistics, the faces and the names and the bodies behind the giant numbers thrown around by politicians, are sitting in the ER today. “I can feel the bullet in the skin right here,” Martin tells the gunshot victim. (As with every other patient in this story, US law protects the privacy of medical information and thus prohibits providing identifying details of patients or their situations.) “I’m going clean it off, numb it up and pull the bullet out.” As he cleans the wound on the man’s upper arm, a circular bruise about the size of a basketball with a small slit in the center, the aural landscape in the ER is lush. Beeps and blips and alarms and dozens of voices are overpowered only by the heart monitor tracking the man’s pulse, a steady ding, ding, ding. The procedure takes about two minutes. The blips from the heart monitor become faster as the doctor places a needle loaded with numbing drugs inside the man’s forearm – DING DING DING – and faster still when the doctor expertly digs around in his body for the bullet –DINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDING. “Is it out?” the patient asks. Martin drops the bullet in a plastic pan with a hollow thud. The bullet appears to be .45 caliber, with bits of flesh and blood attached, jagged and mushroomed from the impact. If not for the rifling inscribed on the body, it might look like a moon rock or a miniature bonsai tree. Almost all bullets, regardless of provenance, go to the police. “Can they reuse it?” Martin jokes, as he whisks on to the next person. The man in bed is apparently relieved the procedure is over, the hands of the doctor having preformed their work perfectly. His heart rate has slowed back to a steady, plodding rhythm. ••• The American Health Care Act keeps certain popular provisions of the ACA, such as guaranteed coverage for those with pre-existing conditions and allowing children to stay on their parents’ plans until they’re 26 years old. It does away with others, including the “individual mandate”, or forced enrollment, and many of the taxes levied on the wealthy to pay for the program. Starting in 2020, the bill proposes to reduce the planned Medicaid expansion and, over time, in effect eliminate it. Roundly criticized from nearly every corner of the political spectrum, the bill will undoubtedly go though many revisions, and the House speaker, Paul Ryan, has promised that this is only the first step in a Republican overhaul of healthcare. What does seem clear is that the bill will do little to further reduce the number of Americans without health insurance – approximately 30 million – and will probably reduce the number currently insured. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has put the number at 24 million fewer people insured by 2026. And although the figure is notoriously difficult to predict with scientific rigor, as creating control groups in giant healthcare studies of this nature would be unethical, two Harvard Medical School professors put the number of deaths directly due to an ACA repeal at 43,000 people each year. As the Republican healthcare bill and, more generally, healthcare in the US is debated, the broader question outside of the minutiae of individual bills and policies is: how, as a society, do we define success in healthcare reform? Is it measured by how many individuals receive healthcare? Or how comprehensive the coverage is? Is it how much money is saved on the national level, or how many people no longer have to declare bankruptcy because of medical bills? Is it about the patient with the blonde braids lying before Martin on the operating table? She has been dropped off by a good Samaritan who found her unresponsive and lying in a gutter. Rushed into the recess room by nurses, the patient is nearly catatonic and slipping further into herself, barely able to answer questions, finally drifting completely out. One of the residents lifts her hands and they stay as they were placed, stiff, like when a dog lies on its back. Doctors yell to her. Nothing. “Watch this,” Martin tells me. A resident loads clear fluid into a needle and injects it into the woman. Fifteen seconds, nothing. Thirty seconds. Nothing. Sixty seconds. The woman snaps out of bed and opens her eyes, absurdly conscious and alive, wonderfully lucid. She’s just received a dose of Narcan, a drug to reverse heroin overdoses. The result is stunning and immediate, as if she’s arisen from the dead. “Where am I?” she asks. “You’re in a hospital,” the doctor replies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/mar/23/lars-eidinger-ss-gb-personal-shopper-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-23T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"Lars Eidinger: 'The Nazis cramp us Germans up.

But Brits have a Third Reich fascination'","bodyText":"When Lars Eidinger first appeared as a careerist Nazi officer in the BBC’s recent TV show SS-GB, some drama critics snapped their pencils in despair. Here was one of Europe’s finest young actors, already hailed as one of the great Hamlets of the 21st century, cheapening himself as a cartoon Nazi, complete with creaky leather trench coat, shiny boots and skull-and-crossbones cap. And all that for a series with a whiff of Brexit agitprop about it, as the new German rulers of Britain rhapsodise about “citizens of a united Europe” while plotting expansions for Siemens and Bosch. But by last Sunday’s final episode of this alt-history of the second world war, something had changed. Eidinger’s SS officer, Oskar Huth, who had stormed into post-Battle of Britain London as a snappy workaholic, had quietly transformed into a world-weary existentialist, overcome by the futility of it all yet stoically refusing a blindfold as he faces the firing squad. It was an audacious heist of a performance: even the Daily Telegraph thought the Nazi had stolen the show. “In the past, I’ve turned down a lot of Nazi-era roles because I think we Germans should approach that era with a lot more responsibility than we do,” says Eidinger, slicing through a schnitzel at the Schleusenkrug cafe in Berlin’s Tiergarten park. “Watching well-fed actors re-enact scenes from a concentration camp repulses me.” What he found tempting about SS-GB, he says, is that the material was “obviously a fiction”, and the Third Reich setting became above all a vehicle for exploring conflicts between power and resistance. “And of course, it is extremely tempting to play a real villain. In Germany, the Nazis still cramp us up, rightly so, but the Brits have this unbridled fascination with the aesthetics of the Third Reich.” When he turned up on the set in his full leather outfit, he recalls, all the British extras wanted to take pictures with him. Seductive evil is the 41-year-old’s speciality. His crystal-blue-eyed stare is currently unsettling an even wider audience, thanks to modern ghost movie Personal Shopper, in which Eidinger plays Ingo, a journalist whose brief encounter with Kristen Stewart’s protagonist has a subtle menace that lingers throughout the film. His portrayal of the ultimate irresistible villain, Shakespeare’s Richard III, left audiences charmed and outraged in equal measure when he visited the Barbican last month in a Thomas Ostermeier production originally devised for Berlin’s Schaubühne theatre, where he has been part of the ensemble since 2000. In Germany, most people know him as a postman-turned-murderer in the popular Sunday evening crime series Tatort. Two years ago, in the film Dora or The Sexual Neuroses of our Parents, he played a man who has a sexual relationship with a mentally disabled woman. It comes as no surprise to hear his dream role would be the baddie in a James Bond film, though he thinks he’s jinxed his chances by announcing it. “One of the great advantages of my job is that you can’t really plan your career. I wrote a letter to Lars von Trier telling him how much I wanted to work with him and he never even wrote back. And then other directors you admire suddenly get in touch, out of the blue. When I started out, my wife told me to piss into my little corner until it starts to stink. And she was right.” The secret behind the stellar trajectory of Eidinger’s career may have a lot to do with the fact that he hasn’t just taken his wife’s advice metaphorically. For productions at the Schaubühne, he has urinated into a sink on stage, pushed sausages up his behind and, in Ostermeier’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, ventriloquised Puck’s monologue through his penis. He frequently improvises and veers off script. When his Hamlet reached London in 2011, Eidinger’s Dane wandered into the auditorium and ripped up a critic’s notepad. Meanwhile, his Richard III threw chocolate mousse into the Duke of Buckingham’s face and tried to enlist the audience in a chant of “You look like shit today, have you not eaten any pussy?” until spectators either left or shouted at him. “It’s like a form of Tourette’s: if I can see that someone has a problem, I have to confront it.” After one show in the same run, a fellow cast member told him he would break his arm if he ever spat in his face again. “That sort of thing annoys me,” the Berlin-born actor says. “I don’t get it. Break my arm then, but at least do it on the stage.” The next day, he spat in his colleague’s face again. “My great quality is that I have found a way of acting which makes you aware of the risk involved,” he says. “Here is an actor who is willing to risk the whole thing blowing up in his face, because he’s improvising without knowing where it will end. In terms of what I have the courage to do, there’s not really anyone else out there. Productions I am not involved in lack that same radicalism.” Along with Sandra Hüller (Toni Erdmann) and Nina Hoss (Barbara), he is a graduate of the Ernst Busch Academy of the Dramatic Arts. Located in former East Berlin, it used to have a reputation for churning out technically flawless but slightly soulless performers. But in Eidinger, technical ability has become wedded to an almost mystical belief in radical self-expression. “People think acting is all about dazzling the audience and disguising yourself: lying, basically. In fact, the opposite is true. I try to be as present as possible when I’m acting. I don’t try to use the role as a mask I hide behind, but as a vehicle for expressing myself.” Eidinger’s SS officer Huth starts out as a man of the shadows – popping up unexpectedly at every turn, breathing at the end of every phone line – but by the end of SS-GB he looks as if he has grown tired of the eternal game of bluff and double bluff. It’s a perfect fit an actor who, for all his boyish charm, seems allergic to false modesty. Does he never worry that he will be found out one day, or that he’ll run out of steam? “Luckily I don’t feel that way. With me, it’s more a kind of arrogance or hubris that I worry that people only get to see a tiny fragment of my talent. One day, I always think, I’ll get the role that allows me to show what I am capable of – and then I’ll win an Oscar.” One wonders how that attitude went down with self-effacing British actors he had to share a set with. Eidinger says he had always been a fan of his UK counterpart in the film, Sam Riley, and he studied Benedict Cumberbatch’s Sherlock in preparation for his own lines. Ironically, given the complaints about BBC actors mumbling, what fascinates him about British actors is how fast they talk, “how little effort there is behind it”. But Eidinger wouldn’t be Eidinger if he could leave it there. A lot of British actors, he says, are content copying something they have seen on a stage or in a film before: “I end up feeling that what I have just seen wasn’t really an actor’s personality, but an actor working his way through the history of British drama and the interpretative history of the respective play. I rarely feel: that’s a real person there, and he is opening himself and making himself vulnerable. Due to their virtuosity, they come across as very much trapped in a form that makes them unassailable.” Eidinger’s best performance in film to date remains his turn in Toni Erdmann director Maren Ade’s second feature, Everyone Else, a romantic drama about a young couple holidaying on Sardinia. His character Chris is a far cry from officer Huth or King Richard: an introspective architect with a receding hairline and a soft belly, paralysed by doubts about his career and his relationship. It suggests that the secret behind all those villains is not just their hard edges, but their deep insecurities. While Eidinger has little doubt in his talent as an actor, he remains unsure whether it actually means that much. “I like being an artist, but I also know how vain that is, because I am not going to make much of a difference.” Lunch over, he puts down his knife and fork. “Even great artists and geniuses like Shakespeare or Brecht weren’t able to make a difference politically, in spite of the fact that they predicted everything. We watch and reflect and yet nothing changes. How sobering and frustrating is that?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/mar/22/rights-gig-economy-self-employed-worker","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T09:00:30Z","webTitle":"What everyone assumes about rights in the gig economy is wrong | Jason Moyer-Lee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/22/rights-gig-economy-self-employed-worker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/22/rights-gig-economy-self-employed-worker","fields":{"headline":"What everyone assumes about rights in the gig economy is wrong","bodyText":"So Matthew Taylor, Theresa May’s appointee to lead an inquiry into the so-called “gig economy”, has called for employment rights for the self-employed. You might expect that we at Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), many of whose members work in the so-called gig economy to be delighted. And yes, employment rights should certainly be improved, but a category of self-employed person who carries their work out as part of someone else’s business and as such has employment rights already exists. It’s called a worker (or limb (b) worker, to use the legal term). Ever since couriers joined the union we have been raising the issue of the complete lack of workers’ rights in the “gig economy”. The lack of employment rights, and the total impunity with which companies have been allowed to act, is nothing short of astounding. A prime example is the case of the courier firm Hermes, which has been accused of abusive practices and failing to pay the minimum wage. Similarly, despite the fact that bike courier Maggie Dewhurst wears a CitySprint uniform, has a CitySprint ID and delivers goods only for CitySprint, the company claimed she was an ”independent contractor”, ie running an independent courier business, and used this as an excuse to not give her holiday pay. This was later found to be unlawful. These companies present themselves, via their impressive marketing machines, as “platforms”, linking customers with independent businesses. This portrayal is encapsulated in the response of a Deliveroo manager to an ITV reporter denying that the riders worked for Deliveroo: “The way that it works is they will provide us with their availability. We will take that availability and we’ll match that with consumer demand.” This is like the owner of Starbucks saying the people who serve their coffee don’t work for them because Starbucks simply matches up the availability of baristas with peak times for caramel macchiato consumption and then lets the baristas use their espresso machines. Thankfully, due to media coverage, recent court and tribunal decisions and announcements of government inquiries such as Taylor’s, it appears as though a general consensus is forming on the undesirability of large-scale deprivation of employment rights in this sector. But the justification from employers when called out on their failure to provide employment rights always comes down to the same thing: these workers want flexibility and their model provides this. For example, following the tribunal ruling stating that Uber drivers were not independent contractors, Jo Bertram, the company’s regional manager in the UK, said: “The overwhelming majority of drivers who use the Uber app want to keep the freedom and flexibility of being able to drive when and where they want.” Similarly, in response to an IWGB campaign over pay for Deliveroo riders in Brighton, a spokesman for the company said: “The IWGB does not accurately represent the majority of our riders who overwhelmingly support the flexibility and good pay which comes with being self-employed.” And so the media reporting, in an admirable aim of fairly presenting both sides of the debate, therefore presents flexibility and employment rights as a trade-off. This is the so-called gig economy’s false dichotomy. There is nothing, either logically or legally, to suggest that “workers” can’t work flexibly. In fact, all of the evidence suggests the opposite. The court judgments have looked at the reality of the working relationship between workers and employers, including a detailed review of the amount of flexibility allowed, and nonetheless concluded that the CitySprint courier and the Uber driver were workers. In the Uber case it was acknowledged that the drivers turned the app on and off when they liked – it is hard to imagine a more flexible working arrangement – and they were still found to be workers. Indeed, were an employer to deny workers this flexibility we would instead argue that they were employees, as we do in our most recent test case on behalf of in-house couriers at The Doctors Laboratory (for which we are currently crowdfunding). Given that employee status comes with more rights as well as employer deductions for tax and national insurance, I hardly think these companies would want to play with that fire. Of the six test cases currently being brought by the IWGB over employment status, five are claiming worker status. Why? Because our courier members tend to like their flexibility and see themselves more as workers than as employees. When our union campaigns and submits tribunal claims against courier companies we are not saying that every aspect of those companies is bad. Many of our members are happy that it’s easier for them to get time off than it is for many employees. Flexibility that works for the worker is a marvellous thing. What we do say is that these companies need to abide by the law. Just because some of their workers have flexible work arrangements, that doesn’t mean you can deny them basic rights."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/mar/22/four-supersized-prisons-to-be-built-england-and-wales-elizabeth-truss-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T00:01:20Z","webTitle":"Four 'supersized' prisons to be built in England and Wales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/22/four-supersized-prisons-to-be-built-england-and-wales-elizabeth-truss-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/mar/22/four-supersized-prisons-to-be-built-england-and-wales-elizabeth-truss-plan","fields":{"headline":"Four 'supersized' prisons to be built in England and Wales","bodyText":"The justice secretary is to announce plans to build four new “supersized” jails in England and Wales, creating a total of 5,000 modern prison places. Sites at Full Sutton in east Yorkshire, Hindley in Wigan, Rochester in Kent and Port Talbot in south Wales have been earmarked for development as part of the government’s £1.3bn programme to transform the prison estate. Although the individual capacities of the new jails will not be decided until they go through the planning process it is expected each will have a capacity of more than 1,000 inmates, consolidating a new generation of “supersized” prisons. The justice secretary, Liz Truss, said: “We cannot hope to reduce reoffending until we build prisons that are places of reform where hard work and self-improvement flourish. “Outdated prisons, with dark corridors and cramped conditions, will not help offenders turn their back on crime – nor do they provide our professional and dedicated prison officers with the right tools or environment to do their job effectively.” But the plans dismayed penal reformers who said the new building programme was not being matched by a plan to reduce the use of prison in the first place. The prison population has stabilised at about 85,000 over the last five years in a system with an “operational capacity” of just a thousand more. Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said the “massive investment in new prisons is not matched by a credible plan to reduce our reckless overuse of prison in the first place”. He added: “The prison estate certainly needs an overhaul, but reducing demand would mean closing prisons, not opening them. The government has admitted that it has no idea when overcrowding will cease, and this announcement takes us no closer to an answer to that crucial question.” The four new prisons are part of a wider building programme to create up to 10,000 modern prison places by 2020. A total of nine new prisons are to be built, five by the next general election. HMP Berwyn near Wrexham, which opened last month, is expected to become one of the largest prisons in Europe, holding more than 2,100 inmates when it is full to capacity. Most of the prisons built over the last 30 years had an original capacity of about 600, so Wednesday’s announcement marks a change of scale in British penal architecture. Announcements are also expected later this year on the closure of old Victorian inner-city jails as part of the government’s “new for old” policies. HMP Holloway women’s prison, which shut last summer, is the latest to close under the “new for old” policy. The expansion in the size of prisons has happened on a piecemeal basis, with Wandsworth prison in south London, for example, now holding 1,560 inmates in a jail supposed to hold fewer than 1,000. Nearly 30 prisons now hold more than 1,000 inmates each. Ministry of Justice officials say the final decisions on the new prisons will be subject to planning approvals as well as considerations of value for money and affordability. It will be open to the public prison service to bid to run the new prisons alongside private prison operators. They also stressed that the new jails would create 2,000 jobs in the construction and manufacturing industries and provide a boost to regional economies across the country. Truss said: “This significant building programme will not only help create a modern prison estate where wholescale reform can truly take root, but will also provide a thriving, economic lifeline for the local community – creating hundreds of jobs for local people and maximising opportunities for businesses.” Council of Europe figures showed last week that England and Wales has the highest incarceration rate in western Europe. Although the prison population is within “operational capacity” it is far above its “certified normal accommodation” – the official measure of “good, decent” accommodation. Nearly 21,000 prisoners – a quarter of the prison population – are held “doubled up” in cells designed for one. The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, said: “We need modern prisons fit for the modern age. But simply replacing one prison with another prison doesn’t deal with the overcrowding crisis. No amount of press releases can distract from that.” Lord Woolf in his landmark 1990 report following the Strangeways prison riots recommended that prisons should not normally hold more than 400 prisoners. He said: “The evidence suggests that if these figures are exceeded, there can be a marked fall-off in all aspects of the performance of a prison.” The last Labour government proposed a series of 2,500-place Titan prisons but dropped the scheme in the face of cross-party opposition."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/mar/21/pro-brexit-ministers-relaxed-about-leaving-eu-without-trade-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T19:59:05Z","webTitle":"Pro-Brexit ministers 'relaxed about leaving EU without trade deal'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/21/pro-brexit-ministers-relaxed-about-leaving-eu-without-trade-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/mar/21/pro-brexit-ministers-relaxed-about-leaving-eu-without-trade-deal","fields":{"headline":"Pro-Brexit ministers 'relaxed about leaving EU without trade deal'","bodyText":"Brexiters in the cabinet and other Conservative frontbenchers have privately told colleagues they are relaxed about the prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU on to World Trade Organisation rules, the Guardian understands. Senior figures within the party have been persuaded by the argument that members of the WTO are less likely to try to punish the UK, while the European Union is looking to exact a political price for Brexit. They now want to convince others that they should embrace the idea. “People are being told that WTO rules would be the end of the world. We need to explain to them why it isn’t,” said a senior government source. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has also suggested the outcome would be “perfectly OK”. But with opponents within the Conservative party who previously supported remaining in the EU branding the stance as “ideological baloney”, and even cabinet ministers expressing concerns, the issue looks set to be one of the most divisive facing Theresa May during the EU negotiations. The tensions over the future trading relationship come as it was revealed that the EU would not hold its first Brexit summit until 29 April, a month after Theresa May triggers article 50 next week. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, announced that he would call a summit on the last Saturday in April to allow the EU’s 27 remaining members to agree on Brexit guidelines, a broad-brush outline of the political principles that will guide them through the next two years of negotiations. May told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that the triggering of article 50 would be a “historic event and will precipitate a shift in our role in the world and see Britain begin a bold new chapter as a prosperous, open and global nation”. The issue of the future trading relationship is causing tensions behind the scenes, with some ministers said to be almost banging the drum for no deal. A briefing by a senior WTO official in Westminster stressed that the Geneva-based organisation offered a different tone to Brussels, with “no undercurrent of tension [and it is] more pragmatic and commercial”. They claimed WTO rules would only pose challenges at the margins, and there need not be a “cliff edge [or] drama”. The former cabinet member and Brexit supporter, Theresa Villiers, told the Guardian that it was in the best interests of the EU and the UK to secure a trade deal before the end of negotiations, but admitted it was not guaranteed. “If it isn’t possible, WTO rules would still allow us to do billions of pounds of business in goods and services with the EU,” she said, arguing the option was “by no means disastrous”. But a source close to a cabinet minister disagreed, saying a number of senior figures were still warning of the impact of not having a deal. Others revealed that senior civil servants were still trying to persuade their political masters to keep open the prospect of a transitional deal, with some suggesting it could take five years after the 2019 Brexit date for a final trade deal to be hammered out. Some Tory MPs believe that now the Brexit bill has become law, they face a major battle in preventing the government from caving into Eurosceptic backbenchers’ demands to walk away from the negotiating table without a deal. They are alarmed that the idea of diverting to WTO trading terms is becoming widely talked about, and fear it is the preferred option for hardened Eurosceptics. Bath MP Ben Howlett said: “Anyone that suggests that WTO would be a good thing is bonkers. This ideological baloney has to stop before we face an absolute disaster.” Anna Soubry added: “There is nothing to be blase or relaxed about choosing for Britain to trade with our biggest economic partner under WTO rules. Every credible assessment done says this would be the worst trading arrangement possible for jobs, investment and growth.” In the run-up to the referendum, Treasury research suggested reverting to WTO rules would knock between 5.4% and 9.5% off GDP after 15 years, and blow a £45bn hole in the public finances — though the basis of those forecasts was fiercely contested. “Relying solely on the WTO rules would result in a significant reduction in the openness of the UK economy to the outside world,” it said. “It would be the alternative with the most negative long-term impact.” But the campaign group Economists for Free Trade, which was known as Economists for Brexit during the referendum campaign, has been making the intellectual case for leaving the EU without a trade deal in place. Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said the issue was likely to define the “ideological split” between the most ardent Brexiters and others. He said that the most vociferous out campaigners wanted a deregulated economy, without the EU’s social protections or rights. “Under this view, not having a full collaborative and co-operative relationship with social Europe is a positive, not a risk,” he said. The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, argued that WTO rules would be like “Britain falling into the abyss. But ministers, frankly, don’t seem to care.” It comes as David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is due to appear before a Lords EU committee. Its chair, Lord Boswell, said that most people believed a reversion to WTO rules would have a significant impact. He said his committee would push Davis on the process after article 50 is triggered. “We are interested in the nuts and bolts of the process, indications of the timescale, any indications of how that might work and interest in flow of information,” he said, insisting that parliament wanted to play a “constructive part rather than requiring a running commentary or micromanaging”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/mar/22/germany-v-england-international-friendly-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-22T21:44:21Z","webTitle":"Germany 1-0 England: international friendly – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/mar/22/germany-v-england-international-friendly-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/mar/22/germany-v-england-international-friendly-live","fields":{"headline":"Germany 1-0 England: international friendly – as it happened","bodyText":"Peep peep! That was a decent night’s work for England, despite the scoreline. They lost to a screamer from the retiring Lukas Podolski but played some sophisticated football and were the better team for plenty of the game. The 3-4-2-1 system worked well, and Alli and Lallana were outstanding in everything apart from their finishing. Thanks for your company; goodnight. 88 min Schurrle drags a good first-time effort just wide of the far post. In fact it nicked off the boot of Stones, which is why it went wide. Germany have been a lot better in the second half. 85 min This minute’s substitution: John Stones for Chris Smalling. 84 min Lukas Podolski takes his leave as an international footballer, to be replaced by Sebastien Rudy. He went out in the grand manner with a magnificent goal. 84 min England have a lost a bit of impetus in the last few minutes. The substitutions don’t help. Here are two more: James Ward-Prowse (another Southampton debutant) and Luke Shaw replace Jake Livermore and Ryan Bertrand. 81 min “I know I write in all the time to talk about Romario but that goal is really something else,” says Phil Podolsky. “It gave a 10-year-old me a clear notion of what is talent, after I was obsessively trying to reproduce it on the playground for months.” I love that it was against Real Madrid, too. It’s fascinating how often the greats save their highest peaks of genius for the toughest opponents. 78 min Bertrand’s cross is only half cleared to Lingard, whose snapshot from 15 yards is blocked by a defender. That was a chance. Bertrand has had a good game tonight. 77 min Another Germany change: Timo Werner off, Thomas Muller on. 73 min Hart makes a terrific save from Sane. Keane made his first mistake of the night, misjudging a bouncing ball and allowing Sane to burst clear in the inside-left channel. He got into the box and cracked a low shot across goal that was almost behind Hart when he plunged to his left to keep it out. That’s a seriously good stop. 71 min Marcus Rashford is on for Jamie Vardy, and Jesse Lingard has replaced Dele Alli. Lukas Podolski, on his farewell appearance, has given Germany the lead with a stunning goal. Schurrle laid the ball off to him 30 yards from goal; he touched it to the side and screamed an unsaveable rising drive into the top right-hand corner. It’s his 49th goal for Germany, and it was a belter. Oh my goodness! 67 min Dier is fouled 70 yards from goal, springs straight to his feet and clips the free-kick over the top. Vardy’s pace is too much for Rudiger but he just can’t pull the ball down on the stretch. 65 min An England change: Nathan Redmond, making his international debut, comes on for Adan Lallana. And Germany bring on Emre Can for Julian Weigl. 63 min A fine move from England: Alli crunches a lovely pass out wide to Walker, who slips in the underlapping Lallana. His first-time clip across the box is deflected behind for a corner. 62 min The substitute Schurrle goes on a glory mosey from the right wing, eventually lacing a good effort from 20 yards that flies just wide of the far post. 61 min This is not a night on which to draw conclusions, good or bad, about England. But the one thing we can say, and which bodes well, is that they have been fun to watch. That sure isn’t always been the case. 60 min An England corner breaks to Alli, whose shot is desperately smothered by Hummels. 59 min The first substitution: Andre Schurrle for Julian Brandt. 58 min “I think Lallana has one of the best first touches in world football, outside of the truly elite players,” says Matt Dony. “The way he regularly kills a ball and turns in one action is amazing. It just doesn’t lead somewhere quite often enough. I’m a big fan, and I’m very happy to have him at Liverpool, but he’s one of those players who always promises just a tiny bit more than he delivers. (See also: Arsenal 2009-present.)” 57 min Germany have been much better going forward since half-time, and as a consequence it feels like a goal is coming at one end or another. 55 min Another chance for England. Dier stumbles through the Germany defence, taking advantage of a couple of ricochets to strike an excellent cross shot from a narrow angle that is superbly saved by the diving ter Stegen. 54 min Kroos clips a glorious short-range pass over the top of the England defence, where the stretching Podoslki can’t connect with an attempted close-range volley. Moments later, Podolski’s shot is deflected for a corner. 53 min Livermore curves a ball down the right for Vardy, who easily beats Hummels for speed. His cross is deflected towards Alli, who arrives late but can’t connect properly with a left-footed volley on the stretch. 50 min A snappy one-touch move from England. Eventually Lallana crosses towards Vardy, and Rudiger heads behind for a corner. 49 min “Are you adopting a policy of not publishing all the emails commenting on the greater fluidity, pace and cohesion of the post-Rooney England?” says Geoff Wignall. “Or is it simply so taken for granted that it doesn’t elicit comment?” The latter. 48 min A miserable punch from Hart goes straight to Brandt, whose left-footed howitzer from inside the D swirls fractionally wide of the left-hand post. Advance apology. There will be a lot of substitutions in this half. If I miss one, sue me. 46 min Peep peep! Germany begin the second half, kicking from left to right. “Is Lallana maybe not quite clinical enough to be a top-rated player?” says Neil Hattersley. “I like him a lot - but would he get a start for e.g. Chelsea?” I know what you mean. There is so much to like about him - Ryan Giggs just came out with a nice line on ITV about Lallana “setting traps” before nicking the ball high up the pitch - but he’s not a killer. I do think he’s becoming more efficient under Jurgen Klopp though, and I’d always have him in the England team. “Not to rain upon the parade – well done all around and all that – but Germany are notorious for not taking friendlies serious,” rains Andreas. “Just ask the Argentinians: they beat Germany in the last three friendlies and got kicked out of the last three World Cups for their trouble. And Jogi Löw has taken this to a whole new level, handing out debuts like vaccinations and having already said that he will be using the Confed Cup to “experiment”. And let’s face it – this is not even a friendly, this is a vehicle for Podolski, who’d never even play under different circumstances.” Oh it’s okay, having an open-top-bus parade for winning a friendly is so 2016. We’ve changed now. “You’ve got to feel for Podolski,” says Charles Antaki. “All dressed up, house decorated, bunting out, favourite mixtape in the cassette player, and along come some much cooler kids and take the party over. He might as well be back playing for Arsenal.” England should be ahead; they aren’t. But they have played well, with Dele Alli and Adam Lallana very lively. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 45 min Weigl smacks an ambitious long-range shot well wide of the far post. 43 min England look much sharper and hungrier than Germany, which I suppose is a qualified compliment given the status of the game. They have played really nicely going forward. 41 min Alli misses a great chance! Germany lost the ball in their own third, with Bertrand and Vardy working the ball quickly from left to right to give Alli a clear shooting chance. He was 15 yards from goal but hit it too close to ter Stegen, who spread himself to make an excellent save. “He’s got to score,” says ITV’s ever excellent co-commentator Glenn Hoddle. “It’s not good enough just to hit the target from there. You’ve got to pick a spot.” 40 min Dier took the free-kick - and sidefotted it a few yards over the bar. 40 min Scotland have equalised against Canada. You probably want to know about that England free-kick, don’t you? 39 min Alli, the best player on the pitch so far, is fouled just outside the area by Rudiger. It was a bit of a soft free-kick but it’s in a great position for England. 37 min A couple of scares for England: Brandt’s cross hits the arm of Cahill inside the area, and then Hart is almost dispossessed by Werner while dealing with a backpass. Hart got himself out of trouble with a Cruyff turn in the end. It could easily have been a penalty against Cahill, who leaned into the ball when it hit his arm. 35 min “After booing the German anthem, England fans do their 10 German Bombers bit,” says Dave Hickey. “How predictably tasteless.” What’s the point? Of anything, but specifically war-themed banter like that. 33 min Alli beats Hector on the right wing with a wonderful piece of skill - the same glue-on-the-boot drag used by Romario in his legendary goal against Real Madrid. Hector did not have a solitary clue what day it was. 31 min: Lallana hits the post! It was all his own work. He intercepted a poor pass by Kimmich towards Rudiger on the halfway line, stabbed it past him and set off. He had to run half the length of the field with the ball but had enough pace to keep ahead of the defenders. Eventually he got into the box and place a low left-footed shot that beat ter Stegen and bounced off the far post. 30 min “So far no game for those of us in the U.S. due to technical difficulties at ESPN so please do extra good describing for us,” says JR in Illinois. “Instead I am watching Scotland v Canada. Canada is winning 1-0. Oof.” 29 min Weigl is off the field receiving treatment. He hurt himself in a 50/50 with Dier. Actually Weigl went slightly over the ball, a poor challenge, and injured himself in the process. 28 min Keane waves a nice pass over the top for Alli, who gets behind the defence on the right of the box and hits a cross that is headed behind by Rudiger. 27 min “Is Michael Keane the first Burnley player to debut since Martin Dobson v Portugal in 1974?” says Harry Williams. “(Yawn.)” It’s a no from me. He’s the first outfield player from Burnley to play for England since Martin Dobson though. 26 min Lallana’s outswinging corner is headed towards goal by Dier, with Ter Stegen making an easy save. He scored the winner in Berlin a year ago from a right-wing corner; this time he was under pressure and couldn’t get any power on the header. 24 min There’s a breezy enterprise to England’s attacking, exemplified by Alli and Lallana. There are still medium-term areas of concern, particularly when it comes to the spine of the team, but the love handles of Walker, Rose, Lallana and Alli have a lot going for them. 23 min Alli coaxes a really imaginative deep cross to Walker, who just keeps the ball in play and lobs it to far post on the stretch. Lallana does well to pull it down under pressure before Weigl clears. 23 min “Of course, the only problem with having Millings in charge of England is, every team selection will be more influenced by some overarching theme (possibly music-related) than current form,” says Matt Dony. “Good news for, say, John Rolling Stones. Less so for plain Gary Cahill.” 22 min It’s a bit of a quiet spell, the football equivalent of the boring middle overs in a one-day international cricket match. 19 min “That Vardy pen shout sums up why players often dive,” says Hugh Molloy. “It’s clearly a foul, even if Vardy hurdles the keeper cleanly because he has to jump to avoid being taken out. Vardy, however, knows he won’t be given the foul so his only option is to try to manufacture contact.” Yes, fair point, although the players who cheat are partially responsible for that refereeing reluctance. 18 min Germany are coming into the game a bit more, with Weigl and Kroos having plenty of touches in the centre of midfield. Weigl looks so good for a 21-year-old, especially as he plays in a position that usually demands maturity. 16 min A loose ball breaks to Podolski, who whacks a shot against the legs of Keane from 20 yards. I do hope he intends to shoot every single time he gets the ball tonight; I know I would. 15 min Vardy plays a good through pass towards Alli, who doesn’t quite have the pace to get there before Hummels. Meanwhile, a superb stat from Clive Tyldesley: Jake Livermore is the first outfield player from West Brom to play for England since... Steve Hunt in 1984. 14 min Vardy looks really sharp. When he’s in this mood he must be such a pain in the arse to play against. I suppose he is also fresh after missing the first six months of the season. 12 min Germany have their first extended spell of possession. England are compact defensively, with nine behind the ball. Alli and Lallana appear to have the freedom to swap sides whenever the mood takes them. It’s not a bad system, this 3-4-2-1. The two behind the striker have a lot to do creatively, though. 10 min “Podolski and his friend Klose really are a bit of what England need aren’t they?” says David Hopkins. “Solid but unspectacular most of the time then world-beaters come tournament time.” 8 min Alli’s superb cross towards Vardy is put behind for a corner. Bertrand cracks a low outswinger that is dummied smartly by Vardy at the near post and thrashed just over the bar by Keane. He caught that very well and might have scored. This has been a really good start from England. 6 min Alli turns smartly and plays a good ball through to Vardy, who beats Ter Stegen to the ball and then dives pathetically. The daft thing is that it probably was a foul - Vardy got to the ball first and Ter Stegen dived across the line of his body - but the absurd dive distracted from that. 5 min Dele Alli swaggered all round Berlin when England beat Germany 3-2 a year ago. It’ll be interesting to see how he plays in this new England system, one that he knows well from Spurs. 4 min “Evening Rob, my duck,” says Phil Sawyer. “I’ve just got off the phone to my dad. Now, my dad was born during WW2 and has not been backward in coming forward about his Brexit tendencies (in that awkward family dinner kind of way that can only be solved by your mother interjecting chirpily ‘So, anyone for pudding?’). However, even he was more interested in chatting about my mum’s recent bout of chicken-pox than the prospect of an England match against Germany. That’s how low we’ve sunk. When even the Brexit generation can’t be bothered to get worked up about an England performance. I blame ... (consults list) ... Mac Millings.” If Southgate doesn’t work out, it’s surely time to go rogue and appoint Millings as England manager. 3 min Nothing to report so far. Keane has had a couple of good nerve-calming touches. 2 min “As you allude to, there’s been a surprising amount of success against Germany in Germany,” says Matt Dony. “Most notably, that magnificent ‘Germany 1 - 5 Liverpool’ scoreline from the halcyon days of 2001. I’m gonna listen to Amnesiac.” Is this it. 1 min Peep peep! The game kicks off seven minutes later than advertised. England, in their new midnight blue (sic) kit, are kicking from left to right. Germany are in white. “Seriously, can we start the game now?” says Lee Dixon on ITV. The ceremony is over, so now it’s time for the national anthems. Now Podolski is giving a speech to the crowd. The England players, who have been standing in a line since this ceremony started a few hours ago, are starting to look a little restless. The players are out in the middle. There is a long tribute to Lukas Podolski, who is playing his 130th and last match for Germany. He played a huge part in reviving German football after the embarrassments of the early 2000s (when they also managed to reach a World Cup final). The last time England lost against Germany in Germany was 1987. Football was a bit different then, as is demonstrated by Peter Reid’s contribution to Gary Lineker’s goal. “I think Waddle had a spontaneous rant after England went out of one or other tournament some time back, saw that it became very popular, and now seems to look forward to any forthcoming tournament for the chance to ‘spontaneously’ react that way again,” says David Wall. “Of course, the criticisms he makes tend to contradict those he made the last time, but consistency doesn’t seem to be necessary for popularity.” I blame Twitter. Gareth Southgate’s pre-match interview “Our first thoughts are with the families of those who have lost their lives and been injured. It puts football into perspective. We’re conscious that part our of identity as a nation is that we carry on in moments like this, and it’s important we represent our country in the right way tonight.” An email “Interesting to see that Southgate is using the friendly to experiment with a different formation, and some players who don’t normally feature.,” says David Wall. “In particular, on the radio last night almost all of the pundits were saying he should try out using three centre halves, as he appears to be planning to do. Do you think those same pundits will cut the team some slack if they lose or don’t immediately look like world-beaters, or if it was just a ruse to allow them to draft their copy, and plan their criticism early (looking at you Chris Waddle)?” I don’t listen to the radio much but I always thought Waddle was great. He hasn’t been turned into a reactionary, has he? I say all those nice things about you, Gareth, and then you select Jamie Vardy ahead of Marcus Rashford. We need to talk. Germany (4-2-3-1) Ter Stegen; Kimmich, Rudiger, Hummels, Hector; Weigl, Kroos; Sane, Podolski (c), Brandt; Werner. England (3-4-2-1): Hart; Keane, Smalling, Cahill; Walker, Dier, Livermore, Bertrand; Lallana, Alli; Vardy. It’s been a desperate day in London, and the fatal terror attack in Westminster will overshadow this match. The full story is on our ongoing liveblog. If there are any newsflashes we’ll let you know here as well; otherwise we’ll try to stick to the football. Hello. Here we go again, again. This is England’s first game since Gareth Southgate was made permanent manager and although the optimism is a warier and wearier than has sometimes been the case, the old John Cleese line from Clockwise still sums up how the majority of England supporters feel about their team: “It’s not the despair, Laura. I can take the despair. It’s the hope.” Southgate has pointed out that, since his penalty miss against Germany in 1996, England have done little to warrant such hope. Most of the time they go into tournaments with a weird mixture of arrogance and insecurity, a confused kind of gallows hubris. Southgate’s standards are higher than that and, by his own admission, there is a bit of Roy Keane in him. In November 1998, when Aston Villa celebrated their best-ever start to a league season with a commemorative team photo after winning at the Dell, Southgate raged against their small-time mentality. He is not somebody who will get giddy about smooth qualification campaigns or wins in friendlies. England can win against top, top teams in less important matches: they beat all four of the Euro 2016 semi-finalists between November 2015 and June 2016, and have won their last three matches against Germany in Germany. Whatever happens tonight, Southgate won’t be getting carried away.

A high score on the test, which is based on 31 genetic markers, can translate to being diagnosed many years earlier than those with a low-risk genetic profile, the study found. Those ranked in the top 10% in terms of risk were more than three times as likely to develop Alzheimer’s during the course of the study, and did so more than a decade before those who ranked in the lowest 10%. Rahul Desikan, of the University of California – who led the international effort, said the test could be used to calculate any individual’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s that year. “That is, if you don’t already have dementia, what is your yearly risk for AD onset, based on your age and genetic information,” he said. The so-called polygenic hazard score test was developed using genetic data from more than 70,000 individuals, including patients with Alzheimer’s disease and healthy elderly people. It is already known that genetics plays a powerful role in Alzheimer’s. Around a quarter of patients have a strong family history of the disease, and scientists have shown this is partly explained by a gene called ApoE, which comes in three versions, and is known to have a powerful influence on the risk of getting the most common late-onset type of Alzheimer’s. One version of ApoE appears to reduce risk by up to 40%, while those with two copies (one from each parent) of the high-risk version can increase risk by 12 times. The latest study takes a new approach, showing that, aside from ApoE, there are thousands of background genetic variations that each have a tiny influence on Alzheimer’s risk, but whose cumulative influence is substantial. The researchers first identified nearly 2,000 single letter differences in the genetic code (known as SNPs) and, after ranking them for influence, developed a test based on 31 of the markers. The test was then used to accurately predict an individual’s risk of getting the disease in an independent patient cohort. In people with the high-risk version of ApoE, those ranked in the top 10% of risk on the new test got Alzheimer’s at an average age of 84 years, compared with 95 years for those ranked in the lowest 10%. James Pickett, head of research at Alzheimer’s Society, said: “Preventing the development of dementia symptoms is the holy grail of Alzheimer’s research but to succeed we first need accurate methods to predict who is most likely to develop the condition. This study’s approach was fairly successful at predicting the likelihood of someone developing dementia over the coming year, but needs to be tested further in mixed, non-US populations.” Pickett added that, while the score could help to identify people for trials, it was too early to apply it as a genetic testing tool for use in the clinic. Rosa Sancho, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said that while genetic makeup can influence the chances of developing dementia, a healthy diet, regular physical activity and remaining mentally active can also drive down the risk. “Genetics is only part of the story and we know that lifestyle factors also influence our risk of developing Alzheimer’s,” she said. “The best current evidence points to habits we can all adopt to help lower our risk and indicates that what’s good for your heart is also good for the brain.” The findings are published in the journal PLOS Medicine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/mar/21/dakota-access-pipeline-ing-sells-stake-loan-standing-rock","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T19:09:31Z","webTitle":"Dakota Access pipeline: ING sells stake in major victory for divestment push","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/21/dakota-access-pipeline-ing-sells-stake-loan-standing-rock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/mar/21/dakota-access-pipeline-ing-sells-stake-loan-standing-rock","fields":{"headline":"Dakota Access pipeline: ING sells stake in major victory for divestment push","bodyText":"The financial giant ING has sold its stake in the $2.5bn loan financing the Dakota Access pipeline, the latest victory for the anti-pipeline divestment campaign that comes as the project is set to begin transporting oil. The Dutch banking and financial services company is the first of a group of 17 banks to divest from the loan that financed the project. ING’s share in the loan was $120m. The buyer of the loan was not disclosed. Under the terms of the sale, ING will retain some of the risk in the event of default. ING’s decision followed a 10 February meeting with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which argued that the pipeline’s route – crossing under the Missouri river just north of the tribe’s reservation – threatened its water source and violated its treaty rights. “We are heartened that ING has made the conscience decision to remove itself from a project that tramples on the rights of sovereign nations,” the Standing Rock Sioux tribal chairman, Dave Archambault, said in a statement. ING’s divestment from the loan follows a series of efforts to influence the pipeline company, the bank said in a statement. ING had previously sold about $220m of shares in the pipeline’s parent companies and decided not to do any future business with the companies. “We are not able to halt the project, and we never were,” ING said in a statement. “Being a lender to the project, we first tried to engage and use any influence we may have to encourage a satisfactory outcome for all parties involved. However, there was even less room for lenders to positively influence the project after construction had been resumed by the client once the permits had been granted.” Opposition to the pipeline, which is slated to carry crude oil from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to a refinery in Illinois, has become a global rallying cry for indigenous and environmental groups. Thousands of activists, who called themselves water protectors, travelled to the site of the disputed river crossing in 2016, establishing spiritual encampments and violently clashing at times with pipeline security and law enforcement during attempts to slow or halt construction. But a major victory for the tribe during the final weeks of the Obama administration – the denial of a key permit to drill under the river – was reversed soon after Donald Trump’s inauguration. Construction recommenced on 7 February and the pipeline company said in heavily redacted court documents on Monday that it “believes that oil may flow sometime this week”. Pipeline opponents also targeted the project’s banks and investors, organizing global actions under the banner #DefundDAPL. The divestment campaign has racked up a series of victories even as the tribe’s legal efforts to halt the pipeline have been stymied. Last week, Norwegian pension fund KLP announced its sale of $58m worth of shares in the pipeline companies, following the lobbying of the Sami, an indigenous people living in the far north of Norway. Other Norwegian financial institutions, including private investor Storebrand, bank DNB, and mutual fund Odin Fund Management, have also sold their shares in the pipeline’s parent companies. In February, the city of Seattle voted to divest from Wells Fargo, another of the banks involved in financing the project. With oil set to begin flowing under the Missouri river within days – the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia denied a request for an emergency reprieve on Saturday – the divestments are unlikely to have a concrete impact on the Dakota Access pipeline itself. But campaigners hope that their continued pressure on the financial sector will pay dividends when future pipeline projects, such as the revived Keystone XL pipeline, seek funding from banks and investors. “We are working to make these kinds of infrastructure projects as toxic as they really are,” said Jason Schwartz, a spokesman for Greenpeace. “We have to make these projects toxic to the finance sector.” “Keystone XL is going to be looking for a project loan,” he added. “So that’s going to be a primary target for us – pre-empting that project loan.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/mar/21/bha-dope-tests-horses-racecourse","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T18:11:31Z","webTitle":"BHA to double number of dope tests on horses away from racecourse  \r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/21/bha-dope-tests-horses-racecourse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/mar/21/bha-dope-tests-horses-racecourse","fields":{"headline":"BHA to double number of dope tests on horses away from racecourse","bodyText":"Racing’s ruling body is to double the amount of dope-testing it conducts away from the racecourse as part of its effort to combat the sophistication of modern doping methods. The British Horseracing Authority also plans to take more raceday samples this year than in the past, under the guidance of Brant Dunshea, who became the director of integrity and raceday operations in October. Speaking exclusively to the Guardian during last week’s Cheltenham Festival, Dunshea said around 700 samples had been taken from British-based horses out of competition in 2015. This year that number is estimated to be somewhere between 1,200 and 1,400, with much of the focus on the buildup to the sport’s major events. BHA testers dropped in unannounced on eight racing stables in the 10 days before the latest Festival, taking samples from horses expected to run there. “Much of the strategy is about testing the right horse at the right time for the right substance,” Dunshea said. “We intend to do similar [testing] around our big festivals and at other random times throughout the year. That’s all part of developing a strategic approach that is robust, that is unpredictable but also puts a lot of focus on the key events, so that those participants who are doing the right thing, and the public, can be sure that we’re not just turning up on raceday and taking samples.” Dunshea envisages that out-of-competition testing will continue to grow as a proportion of all testing carried out by the BHA in future years. “Particularly over the last decade the sort of substances that are prohibited at all times are substances that would be administered as part of a treatment regime, out of competition. And that’s been evident in other sports, such as cycling and so forth. On raceday you may not necessarily detect it but the benefit which they give to the animal or athlete remains.” Asked for his assessment of the threat posed to the sport by doping, Dunshea said: “The vast majority of individuals are doing the right thing and seeking to do the right thing. Our energy and focus are on protecting [them] and deterring those that are seeking to do the wrong thing.” Immediate post-race testing is also to be increased this year, to around 8,700 samples from 7,182 in 2012. The BHA expects to take 600 samples pre-race, compared with 195 in 2015, pre-race testing being primarily focused on alkalising agents that could delay the production of lactic acid during exercise, a kind of doping known as milkshaking. Raceday testing of jockeys has also increased, 2,000 breath samples being taken last year, double the 2015 total, while 436 urine samples were taken compared with 295 the previous year. The plan is to maintain or increase those numbers this year. The BHA’s anti-doping programme also takes in horses coming to race here from other countries. If they come from a country recognised as maintaining similar standards, those horses may be tested; if not, they certainly will be tested, Dunshea said. Young horses purchased overseas for racing in Britain are also tested, with the result, for example, that a batch of horses were tested by the BHA at Keeneland sales in Kentucky last year. The BHA is prepared to discuss possible changes to the declaration system for Cheltenham Festival races, following repeated suggestions in the past week that the present system is outmoded. While final entries for a handful of the best Festival races are made 48 hours in advance, declarations for most races are made the day before, provoking annual resentment among the media, punters and bookmakers. A spokesman for the BHA said: “We would be happy to look at the declaration system for the Festival in conjunction with Cheltenham and other parties that would be affected.” The BHA worked hard for years to persuade trainers and owners to accept the 48-hour system now used in Flat racing. Minella Rocco, who had been favourite for the Grand National after running second in Friday’s Gold Cup, is to skip the Aintree race. His trainer, Jonjo O’Neill, said the seven-year-old had a hard race last week and would now be targeted at next year’s Gold Cup rather than being rushed back to the track a fortnight on Saturday. O’Neill expects More Of That to represent him in the National, while Shutthefrontdoor will go for the Irish equivalent. David Pipe’s Vieux Lion Rouge is the new National favourite at 11-1.

When staff at Sheffield University read responses to their student communications survey, they identified a problem: students felt they needed more information on how to stay safe. After researching similar campaigns that had been produced nationally, the university found a tendency to rely on scare tactics to provoke a response. But instead of portraying students as the victims of crime, staff decided to instead focus on the perpetrators, creating a comedic and entertaining video that would convey the key messages. Thieves Inc. is a video with a strong narrative and memorable characters at its core. It tells the story of Thieves Inc., a company that specialises in obtaining property from student “suppliers” and reselling it for profit. It revolves around a series of films that explore the themes of sneak theft, burglary, cycle theft and the ways in which students could protect their property. The films are backed by a far-reaching web, social and print media campaign. The project not only strengthened ties with other teams across the university, it improved relationships with South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield Hallam University, creating a partnership that benefited students city-wide. September to December is a particular high-point for burglaries and thefts targeting students, so the university decided to run the campaign during this period of 2016. There was a significant drop in crime across the campus and in university student residences throughout the duration of the campaign. Between 1 September and 31 December 2016, burglaries were down 60%, while sneak theft fell 49% and bike theft dropped 9% compared to the same period the previous year. Collectively the Thieves Inc. films have been viewed online more than 31,560 times since they were released in October 2016 and have reached an audience of over 67,170 people. In total the project cost £2,567.10 Runner up: University of Leicester Project: Vardyquake In 2016, global attention focused on the city of Leicester as Leicester City FC edged ever closer to an unprecedented, odds-defying Premier League title. At the University of Leicester, an opportunity arose within the university’s news centre to combine pride in this local success with promotion of the university’s research. Students from the department of geology had placed monitoring equipment in a local primary school to help pupils detect and record seismic signals from earthquakes around the world. Seeking to explain anomalous spikes on Saturday afternoons, the students realised that because the school was only 500m from the King Power Stadium they were detecting the effects caused by excited fans jumping for joy when the Foxes scored during home games. These were dubbed Vardyquakes after the team’s lead goal scorer Jamie Vardy. What started as a way of promoting scientific ideas in one local school became part of a worldwide phenomenon. As the season drew to a close and the team’s success became ever more likely, international press and media descended on Leicester, looking for new angles on the story. The Vardyquake project was ideal, being quirky enough to transfer from sports pages to mainstream news, but with a serious basis in both science and student experience that did not trivialise the university. An in-house video was produced by the press and creative teams which was repurposed throughout the season and continues to be used as a marketing and student recruitment tool. A media opportunity was organised on 9 March at Hazel Community primary school during one of the students’ outreach sessions which saw several national and local television crews, print and radio journalists in attendance. The Vardyquake project gained worldwide media coverage between March and May 2016. National broadcast coverage included The One Show, BBC World Service, BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, Sky Sports News, CNN, BBC 5 Live and Premier League TV. The Vardyquake video has had 14,921 views on YouTube and Facebook combined, while the @Vardyquake twitter account gained 1,223 followers, 1,015 retweets and 1,102 likes. Runner up: Nottingham Trent University Project: A new approach to student recruitment in India When post-study work visas were scrapped in 2011, applications from Indian students dropped dramatically. But research indicated that the number of students deterred by the removal of the visa was far greater than the number of students who ever made use of the opportunity. This suggested that the choice to study in the UK was hugely influenced by emotion. Indian students had rejected the UK because they saw the UK’s visa policy as an indication that they wouldn’t be welcome. Nottingham Trent University embarked on a project to change this perception. The university developed a range of events and opportunities in the UK and India for Indian students. These included day trips with the international team, work experience in the international office, opportunities to join the international team on volunteering days and to work in the university’s three award winning Global Lounges. The university also arranged “welcome home” events in India for returning student. In 2016 the university recruited 196 Indian students, an increase of 56%. Applications for 2017 are up by a further 45%. The total cost of this activity was under £8,000.

For present-day scientists, the fascination with the power of cold continues, with everything from a blast of icy water during a morning shower to walking topless in winter being studied as a possible quick-and-simple path to a healthier life. A new report from the Leiden University Medical Centre in the Netherlands has linked global warming with a rise in type 2 diabetes, and numerous studies in the past few years have lent credence to the idea that artificial heat may be a contributing factor to obesity, as it has caused our metabolisms to slow down. The theory goes that of the two types of fat in the body (white and brown) brown fat burns calories, and there’s evidence to suggest that when you’re cold, brown fat is either produced, or activated. In our world of central heating and controlled environments, we simply aren’t cold often enough. So which of all the practical cooling tips may actually improve our health? The theory: open a window at night. Does it work? Possibly. It’s easier to nod off in a cold environment than it is in a warm one, as a drop in core temperature signals that it’s time to go to sleep. It may also aid weight loss by increasing brown fat activity. The former Nasa scientist Ray Cronise, whose area of interest is cold exposure, has said he sleeps without a blanket, even during winter. The theory: turn the central heating down. Does it work? Again, if being colder stimulates brown fat, then it’s worth a try. There are also numerous arguments that our reliance on being warm is creating a “seasonless” existence, which we have not yet evolved into coping with, which is having a detrimental effect on our immune systems. Experts recommend keeping inside temperatures at between 12C and 18C, which has the added benefit of reducing our energy consumption. The theory: have a cold shower in the morning. Does it work? The myth that rinsing your hair with cold water makes it shinier is enduring, even though it may not have much basis in fact. However, various studies have shown the health benefits of a cold shower in the morning. These include reduced stress, weight loss, and even increased productivity, as doing it is hard, and doing hard things first thing may make you procrastinate less. The theory: go swimming outdoors. Does it work? Outdoor swimming has exploded in popularity in the last few years, thanks to reports of its magical properties. The cold shock can boost the immune system, improve mental health by stimulating endorphins, dopamine and serotonin, and reduce uric acid, which means it’s easier to cope with stress."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"stage/2017/mar/21/desiree-burch-review","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-21T12:58:37Z","webTitle":"Desiree Burch review – stellar standup set about racism, sex and self-esteem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/21/desiree-burch-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/mar/21/desiree-burch-review","fields":{"headline":"Desiree Burch review – stellar standup set about racism, sex and self-esteem","bodyText":"American comedian and theatre-maker Desiree Burch won the Funny Women award two years ago, then bagged a Poster award at the Edinburgh fringe by representing her own face as a collage of penises.

It feels like a lifetime of material crammed into one show, enough of which is insightful and heartfelt to make This Is Evolution a compelling 75 minutes. It helps that Burch has ample charisma and a pleasingly bull-in-a-china-shop approach to social anthropology. She starts by reclaiming the word “fat”, joking about her size, and our discomfort at her doing so. That doesn’t feel confrontational: Burch is our friend, not our aggressor. She is eager to share, her easy amusement puncturing anxiety around routines about the “remedial racism” of the Brits, say, or women trying to outdo one another’s low self-esteem. The need to transcend self-consciousness becomes the theme, albeit retroactively.

In a speech at Threadneedle Street, Mark Carney said he had spoken to the top bosses of the major banks last week to tell them they should not feel under pressure to fire staff for making similar errors. Hogg, his number two, quit last week in the face of a damning report by the Treasury select committee into her failure to disclose that her brother worked at Barclays, which is regulated by the Bank of England. Hogg, promoted from chief operating officer only on 1 March, had told MPs that she had disclosed Quintin Hogg’s role in line with the code of conduct she had herself drawn up. She later conceded she had not made the disclosure. Carney said the Bank’s response had been tougher than would have been expected from the banks it regulates. Her salary rise had been blocked, she had been reprimanded and her assignments as chief operating officer – a role she still holds – had been reassigned. “For those who have questioned whether we get it, we do. We know this honest mistake was also a serious mistake, one that was compounded by the fact that Charlotte Hogg had overseen the development of our new code. We were clear upfront that there must be consequences for both her and the Bank,” Carney told an audience assembled to discuss ethics in banks. “She was formally warned in the strongest, and most public, of terms. There were consequences for her compensation. While she couldn’t forfeit a bonus, as Bank of England governors cannot receive one, she waived her salary increase this year,” said Carney. He said the verdict of the MPs, who concluded her “professional competence falls short of the very high standards” required, had “triggered Charlotte Hogg’s decision to resign”. He said he wanted “to dispel the urban myth that has developed around these events”. “We do not run for our regulated entities a disproportionate ‘one strike and you’re out’ regime for an honest mistake. Neither explicitly nor implicitly,” said Carney. “Proportionate means taking into account the severity of the incident, the track record of the individual and their firm, as well as the firm’s wider response. An honest mistake that is freely admitted for which a firm takes prompt remedial action is not a firing offence,” said Carney. “And here’s my point: we must not let recent events inadvertently tighten perceived standards for the industry because that could have senior managers running scared, drive compliance underground and undermine our collective objectives,” said Carney. “Another risk, flagged by some, is that it will also become harder to find candidates of sufficient calibre willing to take on senior roles. This is why last week I spoke with the CEOs or chairs of all of the major banks to reiterate our expectations as regulator. I’m glad I did because they were all concerned about precisely such unintended consequences,” he said. The body that oversees the Bank of England, known as the court, is conducting a review to learn the lesson. “Its results will be made public. In other words, consistent with our higher standards, the Bank planned a tougher response than we would expect in the private sector, but one that, in our judgment, was still proportionate to an honest mistake that was freely and transparently admitted,” said Carney."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/mar/26/whats-so-great-eiffel-tower-70-questions-change-way-think-about-architecture-jonathan-glancey-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-26T08:00:25Z","webTitle":"What’s So Great About the Eiffel Tower? 70 Questions That Will Change the Way You Think About Architecture by Jonathan Glancey – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/26/whats-so-great-eiffel-tower-70-questions-change-way-think-about-architecture-jonathan-glancey-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/mar/26/whats-so-great-eiffel-tower-70-questions-change-way-think-about-architecture-jonathan-glancey-review","fields":{"headline":"What’s So Great About the Eiffel Tower? 70 Questions That Will Change the Way You Think About Architecture by Jonathan Glancey – review","bodyText":"All buildings are temporary, said the great architectural thinker Cedric Price, but some are more temporary than others. In other words, even something as enduring as the Parthenon and the pyramids will one day go. And even before they disappear, these seemingly fixed and eternal objects are in constant flux. Not only do they weather, decay and get altered, but they change in public perception. An eyesore can become a landmark, a pagan temple can become a church, a symbol of tyranny can become a popular icon. These paradoxical truths have allowed Jonathan Glancey, formerly architecture critic of the Guardian, to have a bit of fun. In What’s So Great About the Eiffel Tower? he finds 70 examples of buildings whose backstories are not as you might imagine. The title refers to Exhibit A in the case of the changeability of architectural perception, the fact that what is now one of the world’s most popular structures was originally opposed by 300 members of the French cultural elite. There are other famous examples – the controversies of cost and design that went into the Sydney Opera House or the fact that the Parthenon, celebrated in modern times for its chaste white marble, was originally painted in bright colours. He explores the way that history gets faked, in the 19th-century rebuilding of the medieval walls of Carcassonne, for example, or in the making of Chartres Cathedral, in a recent over-restoration, into a “venal playpen for passing coach parties”. The book tweaks the tails of a few sacred cows. It shows what an impure and sometimes mucky affair architecture can be, its aspirations to beauty emerging out of greed, conflict and politics. It reminds that Sinan, revered architect of many of Istanbul’s most conspicuous mosques, was essentially a government bureaucrat, and that some famous architects flirted opportunistically with Nazism and Stalinism. Or, in the case of the Austrian Adolf Loos, with paedophilia. This is a book of snacks. It doesn’t bear the marks of deep research and for those in the business many of its examples will be well worn. It’s more engaging when it takes the paths slightly less well trodden, when looking at a beautiful church by the Uruguayan engineer Eladio Dieste or at the extraordinarily prolific architect to both Henry Ford and the Soviet state, Albert Kahn. It’s not a bad introduction to a discipline that sometimes suffers from self-importance and it’s a useful reminder that things are not usually what they seem. • What’s So Great About the Eiffel Tower? 70 Questions That Will Change the Way You Think About Architecture by Jonathan Glancey is published by Laurence King (£12.99).

A leading solo artist at No 1, a great British group at No 2, Radio 2 favourites at three, three hot young acts, one veteran band propelled there by fanbase sales, one beloved pop institution, and one proper wildcard. Admittedly, that’s nine, and the 10th song is by the bloke who’s at No 1, but never mind, because it’s David Bowie rather than Ed Sheeran, and this is a chart that paints a picture of pop in the UK that those who grew up watching Top of the Pops would recognise. That chart – with Bowie joined by Depeche Mode, Take That, London Grammar, Rag’n’Bone Man, Deep Purple, Ed Sheeran, Blondie and Cigarettes After Sex (the wildcard) – is the physical chart, the one calculated by the old rules. The one where each of your sales was calculated by the fiendish method of counting the number of physical manifestations of an artist’s music that had been bought: the records, CDs, cassettes and anything else you can think of. No downloads, no complicated formula involving streams and their equivalence to sales. Even if you ignore physical sales, and look only at downloads, then the simple fact that music is being sold creates a markedly different list to the official singles chart. Yes, Ed Sheeran’s Shape of You and Galway Girl are Nos 1 and 2, and he’s at No 6 with Castle on the Hill. But there’s also room for Chainsmokers and Coldplay, Martin Jensen, Katy Perry, Steps, Rag’n’Bone Man, Anne Marie, and Zedd and Alessia Cara. It’s more like a Radio 1 playlist than the singles chart, but it has the virtue of variety. The vinyl singles chart is different again, with London Grammar at No 1, and top 10 placings for Slime (a reissue of a single by someone who was in punk also-rans Johnny Moped), Buzzcocks (their 1977 EP Spiral Scratch), hard rock supergroup Chickenfoot, as well as two singles that have been on the charts for just over and just under a year respectively, by Bon Iver and the 1975. The three charts I’ve just looked at and the official singles chart (where Ed Sheeran still has nine of the top 10) all paint different pictures of British musical taste. None are perfect; each are skewed in their different ways. The charts that tabulate physical purchases reflect the impulses of often older buyers, for whom ownership of any music remains important, and of loyal fanbases who feel the need to possess everything their favourites release (hence the 1975’s Medicine being on the vinyl chart for 41 weeks). It needs to be said, though, that for all the physical chart’s variety and apparent ill health, it’s a tiny segment of the market. A really tiny segment. In fact, physical sales account for just 0.03% of the UK singles market, according to the Official Charts Company, with streaming now much the dominant method of consumption. The way singles have changed is illustrated by figures from the BPI, which show that between 2013 and 2015, the average weekly streams for a No 1 single rose from 749,350 to 2,604,800. Maybe the problem lies not so much with the charts as with those of us who still cling to the notion that the charts somehow matter, that they are a snapshot of British music. We are past the days where there can be one single picture that encapsulates the national taste (and even when it seemed possible, that picture was prone to manipulation). If the internet, as has often been argued, has fractured consensus and created niches in which particular tastes could thrive, unseen by the outside world, then the modern charts in their varying forms also capture niches, albeit niches defined by their mode of consumption. And so the official singles chart no longer captures what people are most willing to part with money for, but what is being most listened to. The downloads chart now is the one for people who are willing to spend money. The physical chart the one for people who need to own, and the vinyl chart is the one for fetishists. Perhaps charts have become alienating to some because the web’s Balkanisation of music means people, more than ever, want and expect to see their own tastes, attitudes and behaviours reflected back to them. The official singles chart does not do that, therefore it is failing. But maybe, in the other charts, you can find something that reflects your own musical life more closely. When people mourn the passing of the charts as a part of our national cultural life, it is not really the charts they are mourning. Instead, I suspect, its the passing of the days when they felt on top of the culture, when they didn’t look down a list of names and admit to not having heard of most of them, or pronounce the ones they had heard of boring, tuneless, shallow and vapid. That’s just what their parents probably did as well, of course, but then their parents likely didn’t continue to obsess over pop music long into adulthood. The unhappiness about the Ed Sheeran charts, then, is about confronting one’s own sense of self, and its relationship to music. My advice? Spare yourself the grief. Ignore the official singles chart. Just look at the physical one instead – it’s much more fun. What’s that? Max Richter in at No 18? Jlin rising 56 places to No 37? And that great staple of the charts, a charity record, breaking the Top 40? That’s a chart I can get behind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2017/feb/19/winter-hall-black-death-video-game-wellcome-trust-developing-beyond-competition","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-19T00:05:15Z","webTitle":"Plague game up for health trust prize","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/19/winter-hall-black-death-video-game-wellcome-trust-developing-beyond-competition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/feb/19/winter-hall-black-death-video-game-wellcome-trust-developing-beyond-competition","fields":{"headline":"Plague game up for health trust prize","bodyText":"As an entertainment, Winter Hall should be an unusual diversion for video game fans more used to glamorised violence and action drama. Players will live as characters connected by one unpleasant feature – the black death. They will explore the suffering caused by the bubonic plague and watch as medieval society struggles to cope with the devastation triggered by one of the world’s worst disease epidemics. Mass graves, religious fanaticism, and the dead carted off at night: it is the stuff of a zombie apocalypse. Yet this is no cheap piece of horror exploitation. Winter Hall is one of six games under development that have been shortlisted for a $500,000 competition backed by Epic Games and the Wellcome Trust. Generally recognised as one of the world’s main backers of health research – and an employer of thousands of medical scientists – the trust is also a major supporter of the arts, particularly those that explore the human condition. It has funded a major gallery, the Wellcome Collection in London, to display such works and has also begun to back the design of video games. This interest will culminate with this week’s announcement of the six games shortlisted for its Developing Beyond competition in which entries were sought on the theme of transformations. Apart from Winter Hall, the shortlist includes Cure Me!, by Sluggerfly, in which players can control an entity that evolves into a different disease agent – a bacterium, parasite or fungus. Another choice of the competition’s judges – who were chaired by comedian Susan Calman – is Ecce Homo, by Holy Warp, which allows players to trace and change the evolution of human beings. Previous games supported by Wellcome have included Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, released later this year, which looks at the experience of people affected by mental illness. “We want to promote games that stimulate a sense of inquiry,” said Iain Dodgeon, who leads Wellcome’s broadcast, film and games work. The competition is also being supported by the manufacturer Epic Games. “There is always a shortage of good games,” said Mike Gamble, the company’s European territory manager. “Developers often have good ideas but do not have the resources to see them through to final production. This competition’s prize money will make sure several games, not just the winner, should succeed. A good scientific base is an added strength.” The other shortlisted games include Terramars, in which players need to manage a team of six charged with turning the alien landscape of Mars into a habitat suitable for humans. In Seed , players learn how to discover, grow and genetically engineer plants, while Singularity explores how artificial intelligence can adapt to changing circumstances."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2017/feb/20/images-of-new-bleaching-on-great-barrier-reef-heighten-fears-of-coral-death","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-19T19:00:16Z","webTitle":"Images of new bleaching on Great Barrier Reef heighten fears of coral death","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/20/images-of-new-bleaching-on-great-barrier-reef-heighten-fears-of-coral-death","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/feb/20/images-of-new-bleaching-on-great-barrier-reef-heighten-fears-of-coral-death","fields":{"headline":"Images of new bleaching on Great Barrier Reef heighten fears of coral death","bodyText":"The embattled Great Barrier Reef could face yet more severe coral bleaching in the coming month, with areas badly hit by last year’s event at risk of death. Images taken by local divers last week and shared exclusively with the Guardian by the Australian Marine Conservation Society show newly bleached corals discovered near Palm Island. Most of the Great Barrier Reef has been placed on red alert for coral bleaching for the coming month by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Its satellite thermal maps have projected unusually warm waters off eastern Australia after an extreme heatwave just over a week ago saw land temperatures reach above 47C in parts of the country. According to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, sea surface temperatures from Cape Tribulation to Townsville have been up to 2C higher than normal for the time of year for more than a month. The NOAA Coral Reef Watch’s forecast for the next four weeks has placed an even higher level alert on parts of the far northern, northern and central reef, indicating mortality is likely. Corals south of Cairns, in the Whitsundays and parts of the far northern reef that were badly hit by last year’s mass bleaching event are at fatal risk. Imogen Zethoven, the Great Barrier Reef’s campaign director for the AMCS, said the projections for the next four weeks, plus evidence of new coral bleaching, were “extremely concerning”. The bleaching that occurred over eight to nine months of last year was the worst-ever on record for the Great Barrier Reef, with as much as 85% of coral between Cape York and Lizard Island dying. Twenty-two per cent of corals over the entire reef are dead. Zethoven pointed to projections by NOAA that severe bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef would occur annually by 2043 if nothing was done to reduce emissions. “The reef will be gone before annual severe bleaching,” she said. “It won’t survive even biennial bleaching.” The $1bn reef fund announced by the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in June last year was a “cynical rebadging exercise” undercut by its support for fossil fuel initiatives such as Adani’s Carmicheal coalmine “that will spell catastrophe for the reef”, Zethoven said. “There’s no doubt about that anymore,” she said. “They know what they are doing and they should come clean with the Australian public that they have no interest in the long-term survival of the Great Barrier Reef. “To the average person on the street, that’s what it looks like. And if the government thinks that’s not the case, they’re out of touch.” In December last year the government’s Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund granted Adani “conditional approval” to $1bn loan for its Carmicheal coalmine and rail project in central Queensland, which could produce 60m tons of coal annually for 60 years. Warmer ocean temperatures brought about by climate change is a key factor in coral bleaching. Polling suggests that more than two-thirds of Australians believe the reef’s condition should be declared a national emergency. Zethoven said the government had made “a very deliberate decision to go down the coal road”, despite it jeopardising the reef’s future prospects as well as the 70,000 jobs in regional Queensland that depend on it. John Rumney, a diving operator based in Port Douglas, said the “commercial advantage” to saving the reef went beyond jobs. Much of coastal Queensland was “majorly invested” in reef tourism, he said. The federal government’s measures to save the reef were hypocrisy and lip service, he said, when it was simultaneously “actively supporting the cause of the cancer – the worst cause”. “It’s immoral that those of us who are making our living from a healthy environment are paying taxes to subsidise infrastructure that’s going to cause climate change in a major way for the next 50 years,” he said. “If this all goes ahead, we’re basically dooming our tourism industry.” Rumney said he had seen new and extensive bleaching of corals from Cairns to Townsville. “There are definite large areas of mortality. It’s just the next depressing moment. Before, the reef has bleached and recovered but now we’re talking about how often is it bleaching and what percentage is left.” Areas that suffered in last year’s event were now less resilient and there seemed to be less coral strong enough to spawn. Climate change-induced mass bleaching increasingly resembled a catastrophe the reef would be unable to recover from, he said. “It’s weaker, just like humans,” Rumney said. “If you’re already down and out with a cold or cancer, you’re less resilient – the next thing that comes along is going to knock you back more. “It’s the continual onslaught that will eventually kill the reef.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/feb/19/feud-bette-and-joan-tv-drama-hollywood-sexism-in-spotlight","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-19T00:05:15Z","webTitle":"‘I wouldn’t sit on her toilet …’  Screen revival of Davis and Crawford feud sparks sexism debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/19/feud-bette-and-joan-tv-drama-hollywood-sexism-in-spotlight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/19/feud-bette-and-joan-tv-drama-hollywood-sexism-in-spotlight","fields":{"headline":"‘I wouldn’t sit on her toilet …’  Screen revival of Davis and Crawford feud sparks sexism debate","bodyText":"Their rivalry was as intense as it was renowned, but it took until What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? in 1962 for the conflict between Hollywood stars Bette Davis and Joan Crawford to break out into the open. “Sure, she stole some of my big scenes, but the funny thing is, when I see the movie again, she stole them because she looks like a parody of herself and I still looked like something of a star,” Crawford famously said on the film’s release. The complexity of their relationship is now at the heart of Feud: Bette and Joan, a Fox TV series from Ryan Murphy, one of the makers of last year’s The People v OJ Simpson: American Crime Story. Starring Jessica Lange as Crawford and Susan Sarandon as Davis, it tells a story of sexism, ageism and survival – themes that still echo across the industry. Last week, as controversy about the paucity of film industry jobs for women on and off camera began to gain traction before the Academy Awards on 26 February, Lange and Sarandon reflected on the fact that the well-documented bias women face in film has barely lifted. “Not that much has changed,” Lange, star of The Postman Always Rings Twice and the recipient of dozens of awards, said last week. “We’re still living in a sexist, misogynist, ageist time – the last gasp of a patriarchy that they’re not going to give up easily. So women suffer; we see it in the landscape of the past year. It could not be more evident.” Crawford and Davis made What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? when they were barely in their 50s but were already considered by studio bosses to be at the end of their careers. But both women were keen to work. During an interview on US television, Davis told the story that Warner Bros boss Jack Warner had initially refused “to put up one nickel for us two old broads”. The next morning she received a telegram: “Dear Miss Davis, please do not continue to refer to me as an old broad. Sincerely, Joan Crawford.” Couple ageism with an innate bias (a recent study, published by USC’s Annenberg school for communication and journalism, found women only had 31.4% of the speaking roles in the 100 highest-grossing films of 2015 – a decline of 1.4% from 2008), and the gender imbalance is further exaggerated. According to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, only 20% of creators and 27% of writers for the 2015-16 season were women. At this year’s Oscars, outside the acting categories, only 20% of nominees across 19 categories are women. The proportions have barely changed in decades. “They still allow one woman for a film,” Sarandon offered caustically. “Sometimes it’s two – usually one older and one younger, and normally they hate each other. But having two women as equals is very rare, and that’s why Thelma and Louise was such a big deal.” While the feud between Crawford and Davis was exaggerated by the studios for publicity, it was none the less a product of male dominance, says Catherine Zeta-Jones, who in the series plays Olivia de Havilland, the actress who ultimately left Hollywood for Paris. “Feuds come down to pain and fear. There was a hierarchy. The bigwigs – the white guys – would pick and choose the lead roles. So it was a competition, and these women were grasping to hold on.” Or as another actress of the era, Joan Blondell, said at the time: “Women when cornered do what they always do: eat their own and then pick their teeth with the bones.” As a young reporter, director Ryan Murphy sought an audience with Davis that was not granted until the last month of her life. She greeted him in a pillbox hat, enveloped in a cloud of cigarette smoke. She asked him if he’d like to hold her Oscars. “I said, yes, I would,” recalled Murphy, and Davis talked freely for four hours. “She talked about her pain and her regret and what it was like to be a woman and be told you were done when you felt you were only just getting started.” For Lange, who like many believes Crawford was unfairly maligned by her adopted daughter Christina’s scathing memoir, Mommie Dearest, the main issue for female actors remains a lack of roles. She recalls that at the start of her career there seemed to be plenty to go around. “Then because of age, or whatever, there’s a steep drop-off and you think, fuck, I haven’t had an interesting part offered to me in a very long time. What happened? It’s a kind of a shattering experience to realise you’re no longer wanted.” With the approach of this year’s Academy Awards, it is not yet clear if the lack of women in film will gain the kind of traction that #OscarsSoWhite generated last year. The makers and stars of Feud seem to agree that any let-up in the industry’s evident sexism is more likely to come from television. For evidence, many point to HBO’s Insecure, Amazon’s Transparent and One Mississippi, Netflix’s Orange Is the New Black, ABC’s Scandal and the CW’s Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and Jane the Virgin. The huge disparity inspired Murphy to set up the Half Foundation, which aims to offer entertainment industry jobs, mentorships and scholarships to women, people of colour and members of the LGBT community. The foundation comes by way of a late apology, perhaps, for the way Crawford and Davis were treated by the business in their later years. “I wanted to explore what a tragedy the last 15 years of their lives were,” says Murphy. “If we could meet the real Joan and the real Bette, I would say to them, ‘I’m really sorry.’ These women had so much to offer and love to give, and they weren’t allowed to express it.” BEST OF ENEMIES BETTE DAVIS ON JOAN CRAWFORD “Joan and I have never been warm friends. We are not simpatico. I admire her, and yet I feel uncomfortable with her. To me, she is personification of the movie star. I have always felt her greatest performance is Crawford being Crawford.” “I wouldn’t piss on Joan Crawford if she were on fire.” “A feud? Oh, no. I couldn’t ever be bothered with anything like that. Let’s just say Joan’s not someone I would have any cause to see socially. Or ever did.” “Joan Crawford – I wouldn’t sit on her toilet!” “She has slept with every male star at MGM except Lassie.” JOAN CRAWFORD ON BETTE DAVIS On the famous Baby Jane beach scene: “Tomorrow we’re going to do that goddamn beach scene, my big scene, but just watch, she’ll find a way to steal it. She always does. When you play crazy ladies you always walk away with the honours.” “Bette will play anything, so long as she thinks someone is watching.” “Miss Davis was always partial to covering up her face in motion pictures. She called it art. Others might call it camouflage – a cover-up for the absence of real beauty.” “With all her little gestures with the cigarette, the clipped speech, the big eyes, the deadpan – I was just as much an actress as she was, even though I wasn’t trained for the stage.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/feb/18/arsene-wenger-the-arsenal-way-annual-angst","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-18T12:47:06Z","webTitle":"As Arsène Wenger struggles, does ‘the Arsenal way’ just mean annual angst? | Nick Ames","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/feb/18/arsene-wenger-the-arsenal-way-annual-angst","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/feb/18/arsene-wenger-the-arsenal-way-annual-angst","fields":{"headline":"As Arsène Wenger struggles, does ‘the Arsenal way’ just mean annual angst?","bodyText":"Arsenal’s identity However Arsenal proceed in the summer, one of their primary considerations will be the identity the club have cultivated under Arsène Wenger. That goes far beyond the football pitch: in common with most of their direct rivals at home and abroad, Arsenal have been voracious in their drive to enlist a global support base and everybody needs their unique selling point. In Arsenal’s case, the vision they have cultivated over the past decade is bound inextricably with the success and style that hallmarked happier times in the Wenger era – a certain footballing philosophy, a certain appetite for trusting young players. An explainer of “The Arsenal Way” makes up a prominent section of the club’s website; it would be a big risk to replace the Frenchman with somebody who does not fit that projection and a complete break would certainly create a challenge or two for the club’s commercial arm. Even if the club could attract a proven winner in Diego Simeone, say, the Argentinian’s style does not necessarily match the Arsenal brand. The ideal solution might have been for an old face steeped in Arsenal ways to be nurtured for the manager’s job; it was no surprise that Rémi Garde was spoken of admiringly in the Emirates Stadium corridors of power during his time at Lyon. But his star has waned and there is no obvious candidate among higher-profile old boys. Perhaps the failure to integrate one or more of Patrick Vieira, Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry and Jens Lehmann into the existing staff has made life more complicated. The public image needs to stay consistent and nobody should underestimate Wenger’s contribution to it. Ivan Gazidis had to work painstakingly at the start of the decade to persuade Wenger that pre-season tours of Asia, the United States and elsewhere were necessary for the club’s long-term health, but once the manager bought the argument he was fully committed. At these gospel-spreading events, no matter who or where the audience is and no matter what Wenger’s private feelings might be on disruptions to the team’s schedule, he always finds the right words and tone – warm, witty, informed, interested. As an ambassador for everything Arsenal sells itself as representing, Wenger is a dream come true; the big concern now is that when the club describes itself, it is describing him. The British core The photograph of a beaming Wenger poised behind Arsenal’s “British core”, pens at the ready to confirm new long-term contracts in December 2012, is too easily used against him now, but the fact remains that somebody will have to deal with the futures of a crop of players that threatens to symbolise years of stasis and unfulfilled promise. Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Kieran Gibbs and Carl Jenkinson can all point to portions of ill fortune – largely injury-related – since then but all bar Oxlade-Chamberlain are now firmly in their mid-20s and it is time to get the most out of their careers. All five have shown, in spells of varying length, their capabilities, but it is hard to make a case that any of them have not stagnated – and this is before we even approach the subject of Theo Walcott, 28 next month. Perhaps the lack of leaders and savoir faire around them has not helped their development; Wenger prefers to let his players problem-solve on the job but all of these players have been involved in their fair share of crushing setbacks, with no obvious longer-term benefit to the mental strength their manager champions. Developing these players together was an admirable policy and has brought its share of fun moments, but it has not worked and the most ambitious step for all parties might be to find something new. The caveat here is that a new manager might be able to create conditions that allow these players – particularly the midfielders – a platform from which to thrive and take responsibility, but the harder-nosed view would be that they are remnants of an approach that has pledged jam tomorrow for too long. Whichever way you see it, the British core’s future is one of the more significant elephants in the room and represents a bigger set of questions about the environment in which Arsenal’s players are nurtured. Özil and Sánchez Mesut Özil’s arrival for £42.4m in September 2013 was lauded as Arsenal’s return to the top level, a willingness and ability to compete among the super-rich after the enforced austerity of the post-Highbury years. Similar noises were made when Alexis Sánchez joined 10 months later and the Chilean, especially, has done everything in his power to raise the levels of those around him. Yet the backslapping has given way to deep uncertainty, with both players’ contracts expiring next year. Özil has stated explicitly that his future is tied to that of Wenger, while Sánchez, by far the more damaging potential loss on current form, has not been able to hide his annoyance at team-mates’ lack of application in recent weeks. Arsenal signed two stars but have failed to build the rest of the squad to a similar standard. Now they stand to lose them but all involved need to make their decisions quickly. If both can be persuaded to sign before the end of the season it would provide some evidence that the squad has a viable long-term base. Should both depart, however, it would at least clean the slate for the arrival of any new manager while boosting his transfer pot. The last thing anybody needs is a situation that drags into the summer but it is not hard to see why Arsenal might be treading carefully. If their only two world-class players – albeit a generous count given Özil’s recent form – jump ship then the impression given to supporters, not to mention potential recruits, would be difficult to explain away. Could Wenger stay on? Wenger has indicated that he could carry on in management for another four years; might there, in fact, be a way in which Arsenal could use that time wisely? That might not sit well with the sizeable “out” movement among Arsenal fans but with a degree of candour from the club it is not an outlandish thought that he could at least remain for the length of his next contract. The dependence of Arsenal’s structure – from the machinations in the boardroom to the smallest detail at the training ground – upon Wenger is well documented, and perhaps it would be no bad thing if somebody high up had the honesty to admit that, to move on successfully, a period of transition is needed. If the stated aim was a holding pattern of Champions League qualification rather than, necessarily, top honours while the ground was prepared for managerial change then the appetite for patience might be rather greater. Perhaps a junior coach could be nurtured alongside Wenger and Steve Bould, who, while hugely respected at Arsenal and beyond, is 54 and almost certain not to take a top job now. More importantly, the lines of command between manager and board need a careful refashioning and one answer could involve giving a former player with exceptional knowledge of the club’s workings some kind of executive role. Asking supporters to buckle up for a bit more of the same might seem a stretch – but this is where Arsenal are now, and if the steps needed to set up more dynamically for the future will take time then perhaps that just needs to be swallowed. Letting Wenger see out what would explicitly be his final deal could be a more effective policy than ripping everything apart."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/feb/18/trump-administration-chaos-white-house","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-18T15:56:13Z","webTitle":"Chaos in the White House: 'There's never been anything like this'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/18/trump-administration-chaos-white-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/feb/18/trump-administration-chaos-white-house","fields":{"headline":"Chaos in the White House: 'There's never been anything like this'","bodyText":"When press officers at the White House glance up from their desks, they are constantly reminded of their boss’s big day. On the wall, in thick dark frames, are photos: Donald Trump taking the oath of office, giving a thumbs up at his inaugural address, bidding farewell to Barack Obama, waving to the crowd during his inaugural parade, dancing with his wife at an inaugural ball. Walking by last Monday, Trump gestured towards an image of his inauguration crowd – a point that still irks him – and told reporters there would soon be an official statement about the future of his national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Trouble was, an hour earlier, his adviser Kellyanne Conway had appeared on television declaring that the president had “full confidence” in Flynn. Soon after, Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, read a statement that said “the president is evaluating the situation”. Six hours later, Flynn was gone. It was the fastest, most furious week yet for an administration that, like a runaway train, has Washington and America’s elder statesmen shaking their heads, declaring that they have never seen such turmoil or ineptitude. “Our government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil,” Gen Tony Thomas, head of the military’s special operations command, told a conference last week. “I hope they sort it out soon because we’re a nation at war.” Some of the malaise can be attributed to the growing pains that plague any new administration. Some is said to be down to the factional struggles, imported to the White House from Trump’s businesses. And much is believed to be on the shoulders of the capricious, egocentric, volatile president, the first in US history to have been elected with no political or military experience. Yet both Trump and his supporters deny the dysfunction, pointing to executive orders, a supreme court nomination and the scrapping of a Pacific trade deal at breakneck speed. “Don’t believe the main stream (fake news) media,” Trump tweeted Saturday morning. “The White House is running VERY WELL. I inherited a MESS and am in the process of fixing it.” Sleeping just four or five hours a night, Trump has operated at a manic pace that has made the world’s collective head spin. He had an angry phone call with the prime minister of Australia, had a Twitter spat that convinced the president of Mexico to cancel a meeting, and consulted the prime minister of Japan about a North Korean missile launch in full view of dinner guests at his Florida country club, Mar-a-Lago. He approved, over dinner, a commando raid in Yemen that resulted in the death of a navy Seal and an eight-year-old girl. At home, he was caught on live television making a false claim about his electoral victory, press releases have been littered with spelling mistakes, and the president has fought Twitter battles with everyone from senators to Arnold Schwarzenegger to a department store that dropped his daughter’s products. Then there were the White House contradictions around the abrupt departure of Flynn, who misled the vice-president over his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Then Trump’s pick for labour secretary, Andrew Puzder, withdrew his nomination after facing questions over his personal background and business record. Not even in his fourth week, there was the president’s ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, an order widely denounced and sowing disarray and demonstrations at airports. Trump sacked his acting attorney general for refusing to defend the ban, attacked the courts for pausing it to weigh its lawfulness, and insisted this week that it was “a very smooth rollout”. “This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine,” he said at a rambling, impromptu press conference. That characterisation has provoked scorn. “From what I can tell, it’s non-functional,” said Rick Tyler, a political analyst. “It’s not firing on all cylinders, and the timing is off, and the transmission won’t engage.” The executive order, Tyler noted, “created havoc and turmoil. The communications team are incoherent, inconsistent and contradictory to what the president says.” Bob Shrum, a Democratic consultant and strategist, called the president’s defenses “preposterous”. “It’s like a car where none of the gears work and you’ve no idea if you’re going at 90mph or 30mph and you’re just careening. It doesn’t remotely compare with anything I can think of. There’s never been anything like this.” One Republican with ties to the White House blamed growing pains, from Trump’s lean campaign to the staff of the federal bureaucracy. The Trump administration has also decided to vet potential members for any criticism of the president during the campaign. On Thursday, a political appointee at the Department of Housing and Urban Development was fired after it was noticed that he had written a critical opinion column about Trump in October. But operations have also been hampered by competing interests and seething mutual suspicion. Media reports describe paranoid staff using a secret chat app that erases messages as soon as they are read. Trump’s inner circle includes Conway; chief of staff Reince Priebus; senior advisers Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, 36, and Stephen Miller, 31; and chief strategist Stephen Bannon, the former Goldman Sachs executive who has likened himself to Thomas Cromwell in the court of Henry VIII. Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee for president in 2008, told reporters this week that the “whole environment is one of dysfunction in the Trump administration”. “Who’s making the decisions in the White House? Is it the 31-year-old? Is it Mr Bannon? Is it the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff? I don’t know.” The default answer could still be Priebus, who, as chief of staff, would traditionally act as gatekeeper to Trump. But his boss is anything but traditional, and Priebus’s establishment influence is countered by two ideologues, Bannon and Miller. Bannon, previously head of the rightwing Breitbart News, has been described by Democrats as a white nationalist and is seen by many as the true power behind the throne. Last week, Bannon and Priebus gave a joint media interview to deny rumours of a rift. But Tyler said: “There’s no clear chain of command. They can’t tell who’s in charge. Were the chief of staff in control, Tyler said, Priebus would have fired Flynn. “If Priebus and Bannon are doing PR to show how well they got on, that shows Priebus is losing. He is the chief of staff, so he shouldn’t need to say he’s meeting with Bannon, who ought to be a subordinate.” Bannon’s allies, meanwhile, continue to rise in prominence. Sebastian Gorka, a deputy assistant and former editor for Breitbart, has become a vocal surrogate in a series of TV and radio interviews, telling the BBC this week that Trump’s press conference performance was “fabulous”. Miller, too, earned Trump’s praise and widespread scorn for his zealous defense of the president and for peddling a baseless claim about phantom illegal voting. “He says things that would make movie villains blush,” Tyler said. “You could not script this stuff.” The problems have been amplified by Senate Democrats doing their utmost to drag out the confirmation process on many of Trump cabinet choices, leaving many executive agencies with few senior staffers. Trump is not the first president to hit early turbulence, and Bill Galston, a former adviser to Bill Clinton, recalled that “hardly anyone” of the new president’s staff in 1993 had been in the White House before. “That created all sorts of problems. The simple fact of not knowing how the machinery operates is already a huge problem.” Before too long, he said, Clinton recruited the Hill veteran Leon Panetta and David Gergen, who had worked with the administrations of Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. “You need people there who know how overwhelming it is to be in the White House with ‘incoming’ coming at you from all directions,” Galston said. “You need to have a sense of all pieces of the government. It’s not as harmonious as conducting an orchestra. It’s like juggling knives and swords.” But Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank, acknowledged that the Trump administration was not normal. “I’ve consulted many people in town about analogies and comparisons and nobody can come up with any. Our seismographs are broken. “We appear to have a president who cannot distinguish chaos from order,” he continued. “There are amateurs doing a job that only professionals can do, and even then often not successfully.” In contrast, Trump’s allies contend that, for a non-politician learning on the job, he is doing well and playing the media like a fiddle. “It’s like the beginning of any administration,” said Christopher Nixon Cox, who is well acquainted with Bannon and other members of Trump’s inner circle. He compared Trump’s first month to Clinton’s, observing that critics also called those weeks “a disaster”. “Every administration has its palace intrigues,” Nixon Cox said. “It’s hard to say he has any more or less. Given that we have social media and he’s a social media president, it could be we’re just more aware of what used to be kept behind closed doors. There will be good days and bad days but it’s way too early to say it’s going to go off the rails.” Cox, a financial adviser and grandson of Richard Nixon, added: “Fundamentally, he’s going to be judged on the economy and whether he keeps peace around the world. I think it’s going to be a big success. We have to give him time.” Tom Stewart, a member of Trump’s national security advisory council during the campaign, said that the president was “cunningly” manipulating the media, so that “his strong cabinet will have a chance to make some meaningful reforms”. Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, said Republicans were making good progress on their conservative agenda. “The press and a lot of observers in Washington DC like to stop and look at a car accident and they miss that the traffic is continuing to drive past at 50mph,” he said. “Things are moving forward, largely on track.” Nevertheless, as Trump enters his second month, there will be many praying for a steadier hand and fewer tweets ending with exclamation marks. “This can’t just stand,” said Rich Galen, former press secretary to the 44th vice-president, Dan Quayle. “It was kind of fun in the beginning watching the kids run around and bump into each other. Now they’ve got the keys to the car and it’s dangerous. Someone has to go in and get their arms around this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/feb/20/emil-ferris-my-favorite-thing-is-monsters-graphic-novel","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-20T20:51:46Z","webTitle":"Emil Ferris: 'I didn’t want to be a woman – being a monster was the best solution'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/20/emil-ferris-my-favorite-thing-is-monsters-graphic-novel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/feb/20/emil-ferris-my-favorite-thing-is-monsters-graphic-novel","fields":{"headline":"Emil Ferris: 'I didn’t want to be a woman – being a monster was the best solution'","bodyText":"There has never been a debut graphic novel quite like Emil Ferris’s My Favorite Thing Is Monsters. The 55-year-old artist’s first published work, which came out last week, is a sweeping 60s-era murder mystery set in the cartoonist’s native Chicago. It’s composed of ballpoint pen drawings on wide-ruled notebook paper and is the first half of the story with the second volume out in October. Before she began work on Monsters, Ferris paid the bills with freelance work as an illustrator and a toy designer, making figurines for McDonald’s – she sculpted the Mulan line of Happy Meal prizes for one of the fast food behemoth’s subcontractors – and for Tokyo toymaker Tomy, for whom she worked making the Tea Bunnies line of dolls. But in 2001, Ferris contracted West Nile virus. At the time a 40-year-old single mother, Ferris’s work was all freelance, she said – with the effects of west Nile hindering the use of three of her limbs, her work dried up, and she looked for another outlet, in part for her creative output, and in part to exercise a dominant hand damaged by the effects of the disease. She went back to school and produced My Favorite Thing Is Monsters, which draws on her own childhood and on the experiences of family and friends who survived the Holocaust. But when her book was finished the Chinese company shipping the copies from the printer in South Korea to the United States went bankrupt and the whole print run was held hostage at the Panama Canal by the shipping company’s creditors along with the rest of the cargo on the ship carrying it. Now, it is finally here. When did you start drawing? Probably when I was an infant, because my parents were both artists, and it was necessary to draw. My parents met at the Art Institute of Chicago as students, and somewhere in there they procreated off to the side and created me. My mother’s line was always, “I met him, and I said, ‘If you’ll stretch my canvases I’ll clean your brushes.’” Did you spend much time at the institute? Going to the Art Institute was like [the way] most families go to church. You went there for your religious education. We sort of memorized paintings the way other kids memorized Bible verses. We had to know what was in the right quadrant. Your parents were both artists? While [my father] was in high school he began making eight-pagers of Minnie and Mickey – he was an enterprising young man – and he was copying them out on the school’s mimeograph machine, and he got caught. And they were in the process of expelling him because these were highly pornographic, and the art teacher happened to see it and said, “Well, you could expel him, but I think he has talent, so let me have him.” He was a great man. He was one of the great people. He taught me stealth drawing, which was where a lot of the information for the faces [in my book] comes from. So we would get on the L train and he would take out his sketchbook, I would take out mine and we would find a person to draw unbeknownst to the person. When did you contract West Nile virus? I was a single parent at the time and I was trying to support my daughter so I was working at night and taking care of her during the day. It was pretty rough. Then when she was six or seven years old, I was bitten by a mosquito, and I contracted West Nile virus, and within three weeks I was completely paralyzed from the waist down and I lost the use of my right hand. So that’s what happened, and that’s why I ended up in school [for writing at the Art Institute], because I realized I didn’t have the ability to draw any more and I had to keep on going. I had to find something else. What was the biggest effect it had on your work? The hardest thing is in terms of the drawing, because, you know, I really have to work to keep my hand fluid and I’ve done a lot of recovery, but it’s not the same as it once was. There’s a lot of joy in drawing the book, because I started the book still with some difficulties from paralysis, and the book was part of what helped me recover. Have you always used storytelling in your life? When I was a child I had this severe disability, so I was the kid in the playground who wasn’t running. I had a spinal curvature, some amount of hunchback, two different lengths of leg, but I learned – and this is what’s so interesting about the world – I learned the my story-telling [of] horror and ghost stories would get a crowd of ten kids around me. So I was not alone. I learned how not to be alone in the playground. They would all show up for the next installment – of course I would always leave it hanging anywhere I could, so I could be assured that the next installment would be something they were looking forward to, because I didn’t want to be alone. Why draw the protagonist Karen as a werewolf? I drew her the way I saw myself, the way I felt I was. I drew her the way I wanted to be. My mother was very, very beautiful, and I saw that the beautiful women around me were often constrained not only by their beauty but by the way that being an object of male desire frequently caused violence in their lives. And it caused them to be constrained in these terribly sad ways – their brilliance was not valued. They weren’t socially valued at the time, either. So, and the second book really does deal with this, I didn’t ever want to be a woman. I mean, it just did not look like a good thing, nor did being a man, because it felt like they were being victimized by the same system. It didn’t give them much more latitude than they gave women, in many ways. They were being constrained to behave in these ways that weren’t authentic and didn’t allow them to realize their full personhood, either. Being a monster seemed like the absolute best solution. Who would you say influenced you? [As a child] I had been seeing an awful lot of Goya, and Daumier, and then when I was about eight years old my grandmother in New Mexico, who was a very literate person, began sending me the Collier’s Illustrated Dickens, and if I read one she would send me another one. They were big and fat and thick and had these beautiful illustrations, beautiful engravings. I just wanted that experience: to write stories where the drawings were that articulated and atmospheric. Any contemporary cartoonists? Well, the whole circle comes around: at [The Miami Book Fair] I got to meet Art Spiegelman. So I sat down at a bench and I’m looking at this guy who’s sitting across from me. He introduces himself and says his name is Dean Haspiel and I said, “Oh, okay,” and shook his hand. I felt like people were looking at me and thinking, “Oh, a little old lady, what did she write?” I’m sure that’s what people thought. And I have crumbs on my face from the empanadas and am totally a train wreck and he says, “What did you write?” And I said, “I wrote this book,” and he looks at me, with this blinking face, like he was trying to put me together with this book. And then he turns to this guy next to him – he doesn’t even say anything to me – and he whispers to this guy, and that guy turns around and looks at me with the same expression, mouth open, blink blink, and that guy puts his hand out and says, “I’m Charlie, I work at Adams, I think you want to meet somebody.” So he turns over to this other guy, this guy looks like some kind of very distinguished member of the intelligentsia of Weimar Berlin. He’s vaping in this very elegant way. The smoke is trailing out of his mouth. He’s got this look like he’s weighing the difference between Freud and Jung right there in front of him. And Charlie says something to him, and then this weird thing happens: He just reaches across the table and grabs my hand and says, “I’m Art Spiegelman and I loved your book,” and then I started crying like a big dumb baby. It was absolutely the craziest thing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/feb/19/wolfgang-tillmans-2017-review-tate-modern-eduardo-paolozzi-whitechapel-gallery","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-19T08:00:03Z","webTitle":"Wolfgang Tillmans: 2017; Eduardo Paolozzi review – from the chaos of time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/19/wolfgang-tillmans-2017-review-tate-modern-eduardo-paolozzi-whitechapel-gallery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/19/wolfgang-tillmans-2017-review-tate-modern-eduardo-paolozzi-whitechapel-gallery","fields":{"headline":"Wolfgang Tillmans: 2017; Eduardo Paolozzi review – from the chaos of time","bodyText":"Neil MacGregor has the face of a saint – ascetic, wise, pressured by inner visions. Framed in a long dark window, he appears almost medieval. Next to him, the architect Oscar Niemeyer looks into the lens, vigilant at 102. And between them hangs a photograph of the musician Frank Ocean in all his tensely sullen beauty, the diamond dull in his ear. These photographs stand out. They stand out, as perhaps they should not, in the great tide of studiedly casual images at Tate Modern – pedestrians, partygoers, rampant weeds, cars simmering in the rush-hour haze. Partly this is because they are self-evidently portraits, and even public commissions in the case of MacGregor. But it is also because Wolfgang Tillmans is not just doing what he always does – skimming an image from the chaos of time, of moments happening and fading, of life pulsing along everywhere all around the world at once. There is clearly an equal tension between photographer and sitter: a mutual, even formal encounter. Tillmans turns 50 next year. The studiedly casual, not to say low-key look has been his metier for so long now that some of his most apparently ephemeral images – Anders pulling splinter from his foot, for instance – have become classics. To begin with, Tillmans seemed to have no style but every style, no theme but whatever he noticed. At Tate Modern, 1990s spreads from the Face, Arena and i-D show his friends half-naked, sitting in trees, reamed out on happiness or exhaustion. The images were as pale and etiolated as their subjects, or as dark and confusing as the nightclubs they showed. In galleries, they were displayed unpredictably from floor to ceiling so that nothing had more (or less) importance. This conceptual method – which won Tillmans the Turner prize in 2000 – has never varied. There are several hundred images in this enormous survey, framed and unframed, magnified and minuscule, taped, tacked or glued to the wall. Size is no index – Patti Smith is tiny, an anonymous Indian man lounging against a car the size of life; and neither is position. Two lovers kissing may hang next to a gourd or a photograph of television static. Tillmans’s eye is empathetic, pensive and patient, but always determinedly indeterminate. He is as far from Cartier-Bresson’s decisive moment as can be. He doesn’t go in for metaphor or simile; he doesn’t try to sum anything up, nail it down or catch it by the tail. He wonders at the beauty of a pear glowing in late afternoon sun as much as viscosity of the plastic bag from which it came. He homes in on the inner seams of discarded jeans. Even when photographing a momentous starry night he can’t help noticing the camera’s own distortions. Not every star in that sky is natural. Loitering around airports, Tillmans observes the odd signs: “Rest of the World”, “Reserved For Your Personal Space”. He watches cars driving towards vast posters, and digital screens blazing on Hollywood boulevards. All the world is a photograph. Images of terrorism and chocolate coexist in the blink of an eye, in art as in life. People and objects appear haphazardly framed, partially visible or crammed into the shot like the hundreds of pill packets chucked into a cardboard box. Get up close and you see that these are Tillmans’s own antiretrovirals; 17 years’ supply. In the past, everything appeared equal and interconnected in his work. But in this particular selection – avowedly not a retrospective – the artist’s eye is drawn to certain beauties: a boy’s neck, fresh grapes, the spume of a wave, even that commonest of miraculous visions: the cloudscape seen from the plane. But a sense of urgency is beginning to enter in; partly political – Tillmans ran a strong Remain campaign – and partly personal, as some of his subjects approach old age. There is still a pervasive meditation on the curious ways that photographs come into being, from the quirks of light to the microscopic filth that gets into the developing process (and translates, here, into a sequence of beautiful abstractions that carry blemishes like the veins in marble.) Light-sensitive paper is variously exposed, invoking rosy dawns and midnight skies. Sheets of photographic paper curl back on themselves in the shape of teardrops, revealing the glossy reflections within. The inconsequential is made tangible, permanent. One of these teardrops appears on the cover of a copy of Krishnamurti’s Freedom from the Known, and there is something liberating about Tillmans’s show. He asks you to pay attention to the world simply by presenting it so attentively. You walk slowly through the galleries, absorbing these images of the macro and the micro – oceans roiled by wind, the dewdrop on a pot plant – looking directly into the ever-changing lives of others. Pretty soon you find yourself caught in a feedback loop, wondering why it is all so enticing, no matter how humdrum, why you want to keep on looking and looking. One answer is plenitude: there is always more. But another is the analogy with life itself. In its shifting, mutating, circling inconstancy – and in its dynamic liveliness – this art reflects the condition of life itself. Until it ends, Tillmans’s enterprise must always be a work in progress, more seen and more shown by the day. That is the illusion, at any rate, with the artist just snapping away. But of course this casualness is hard-won, and this show as subtle and considered as the superb (and superbly insightful) portrait of MacGregor. Tillmans’s sensibility comes through in the end; photographs are taken by people, after all, and not cameras. At the Whitechapel, they do their best to present Eduardo Paolozzi (1924-2005) as an infinitely various artist. Certainly he worked in carved concrete, screenprint, textiles, aluminium, bronze, wood and film, but no matter the medium, he had one modus operandi. It was collage and he stuck to it. You see it in the machine-man hybrid that greets you at the door, in the cut-and-paste 1950s magazines, in the tapestries that juxtapose extracts of Mondrian and Disney, and in the muckle public sculptures where agglomerations of junk are cast in bronze to become further iterations of the machine-man hybrid. At first, this show is all continental modernism only marginally adapted – Picasso bulls, Giacometti sculptures, hints of Dubuffet conflated with Dalí. And when he gets to them, the American magazine covers are barely altered, some simply overlaid with mildly incongruous details to no piquant end (dolly bird and tyre). Paolozzi is no Richard Hamilton. Machines are disassembled, then neatly rearranged – all the pistons together, all the bolts, etc – so they’re never really disordered. This compact circuit-board aesthetic can be reprised in any medium, though it generally looks best in print. Paolozzi has real zip and register as a graphic artist. But his flaw is running repetition to exhaustion. He takes a head, splits it in two and realigns the halves slightly out of kilter. The effect is rudimentary sci-fi, but he does it to death. The bendy tubes in the prints reappear as steel sculptures (Terence Conran installed one outside the first Habitat), the machine parts as high-chrome mosaics, and then he does it all again, in different sizes. Though this show is bursting at the seams, it lacks Paolozzi’s most astute pieces and exposes the meaninglessness of so much recycling. If the whole point of collage is disruption, distortion and ingenious juxtaposition, the non sequitur and the wild surprise, then he misses the mark. On this showing at least, Paolozzi turns collage into a mannerism.

A Falcon 9 rocket took off at about 9.40am eastern from the Kennedy Space Center, off the coast of central Florida, from a launchpad that has seen off some of Nasa’s most famous missions but has gone unused since the agency retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011. After twin sonic booms of re-entry through skies mottled with clouds, the rocket booster’s landing legs deployed, its thruster engines fired and it landed, almost delicately, at a landing pad at Cape Canaveral. A few minutes later, the Dragon capsule reached orbit and its solar arrays deployed. The rocket booster’s successful landing came nine minutes after takeoff. The return to earth of the booster is part of SpaceX’s strategy of reusing rather than jettisoning hardware. The launch was delayed on Saturday for almost 24 hours, after engineers found “the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd”, CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter. “If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn’t symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause. “That 1% chance isn’t worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day,” he added. The Dragon capsule lifted by the rocket carries nearly 5,500lb of supplies, experiments and research equipment for the six astronauts – two Americans, three Russians and one Frenchman – onboard the station. The capsule is due to dock at the station two days after launch, when astronauts will use a 57ft robotic arm to secure it. The capsule’s cargo includes an experimental spacecraft self-navigation system; a medical experiment on immune system diseases; an instrument to measure ozone, aerosols and other gases in the atmosphere; and the Lightning imaging sensor, a device to measure lightning strikes and their intensities around the world. The astronauts will later load up the capsule with experiments to be returned to Earth and recovered by scientists after landing. For most of its decades in service, the Kennedy Space Center has served the US as one of the federal government’s most important spaceports. Astronauts flew from Kennedy on missions to the moon in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and in the 1980s the center was home to Nasa’s reusable space shuttles. Sunday’s launch was the first since that fleet retired, and part of the center’s transition to a spaceport open to public and private missions. Over its years of competing with Boeing and Lockheed Martin for deals, SpaceX has secured $1.6bn in contracts with the US government for resupply missions, and hundreds of millions more in contracts with private companies seeking to deliver satellites into orbit. The private spaceflight company was dealt a major setback in September 2016 when one of its rockets exploded on a Cape Canaveral launchpad, according to Musk, because its supercooled oxygen fuel became too cold – and solid – and ignited in reaction with other chemicals. The subsequent blast destroyed not only the hugely expensive rocket but also its cargo, which included a satellite project funded in part by Facebook. The company successfully launched and landed a reusable Falcon 9 rocket in January, delivering 10 satellites for the telecoms and technology giant Iridium. Musk has repeatedly said he hopes to launch manned missions, and last year announced an ambitious plan to reach Mars with the first ever private, unmanned mission. But on Friday, the SpaceX president, Gwynne Shotwell, told reporters that the company had delayed the project for a scheduled 2020 launch. “We were focused on 2018, but we felt like we needed to put more resources and focus more heavily on our crew program and our Falcon Heavy program,” Shotwell she said. Nasa currently relies on Russian spaceports to deliver astronauts to the ISS, and SpaceX has plans to modify its rockets and capsules for crewed flights by 2018, though a report by the Government Accountability Office suggested the schedule was overly optimistic.

The family of Jean Charles de Menezes said Cressida Dick’s part in the 2005 disaster meant she could not “command public confidence” as commissioner of the Metropolitan police. In a letter seen by the Guardian, the family said Dick could not be trusted to ensure “that no police officer acts with impunity”. De Menezes, a 27-year-old Brazilian national, was repeatedly shot in the head at Stockwell tube station in a south London in July 2005 by police officers who mistook him for a suicide bomber. Dick, 56, has been seen as the frontrunner to be the next Met commissioner, taking over from Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, 59. The decision will be made by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, who will consider the views of London’s Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan, a former human rights lawyer. Final interviews with candidates take place on Wednesday. In the letter to Khan, sent on Friday, Patricia Armani da Silva, wrote on behalf of her family: “At the helm of the police on that fateful day, when the life of Jean was taken, included Cressida Dick. “The IPCC [Independent Police Complaints Commission] investigation made strong criticisms of the command structure and the decision-making that took place that day. “As a family, we have always felt that those at the highest level, the commissioner and those in operational command, should be held responsible for the mistakes and for the misinformation and lies that were told by the police. “We cannot be expected to accept that the most senior police officer in the country, a post that is expected to uphold the highest standards of professionalism, to command public confidence and ultimately be responsible for ensuring that no police officer acts with impunity, be filled by someone that is clearly tainted by her failure to live up to any of those requirements.” Dick is regarded by her peers as one of the most talented operational police chiefs of her generation. She works at the Foreign Office after leaving the Met having reached the rank of assistant commissioner and served as head of counter-terrorism before she was controversially moved to another role by Hogan-Howe. At a criminal trial in 2007, a jury found the Met guilty of failings in the case, but went out of its way to exonerate Dick from any personal blame. She spent three days giving evidence and told the jury she was told five times that surveillance officers thought a man they were following was Hussain Osman, one of the terrorism suspects wanted for the London bombings. As the man was trailed through the streets of south London, Dick said she was told the confidence in the identification grew stronger. That day Dick was the designated senior officer in the control room with responsibility for deciding if a special shoot-to-kill policy was needed to stop a terrorist suspect. But police were following De Menezes, a wholly innocent electrician who was on his way to work. They mistook innocent actions for those of a terrorist trained in counter-surveillance techniques. At one stage, he went to a tube station then doubled back. This action was seen by police as suspicious but was in fact due to that station being closed. Dick said in 2007: “From the behaviours described to me – nervousness, agitation, sending text messages, [using] the telephone, getting on and off the bus – it all added to the picture of someone potentially intent on causing an explosion.” She gave an order for the man to be prevented from entering Stockwell station, with Dick insisting she never ordered officers to shoot him. At one point she ordered surveillance officers to detain the suspect but countermanded her own order moments later, having been told a specialist firearms team were close enough to make the stop. But they were not, and inquires found errors in communication and command in the Met contributed to one of the worst stains on the force’s reputation. At a 2008 inquest, Dick said: “If you ask me whether I think anybody did anything wrong or unreasonable on the operation, I don’t think they did.” The inquest jury returned an open verdict, seen as demonstrating its members were unconvinced by the police account of events. Inquiries by the IPCC found no blame could be attached to Dick or any individual officer. The intervention by the De Menezes family poses a dilemma for those choosing the next commissioner. One of the key requirements for the role is the ability to command and grow the confidence of London’s communities. In the letter, the family say: “We have serious concerns about such an appointment and the signal it sends to the people of London. “The job of leading London’s police is a hugely complex one and one that has to be able to address many challenges including possible terrorist incidents, the use of armed police and of course issues of police accountability and ensuring that police officers don’t act with impunity.” It adds: “We strongly urge you to ensure that the death of Jean Charles de Menezes is not so easily forgotten in this recruitment process. “We urge you to not be party to sending to our family and to the people of London a message that those in power can set aside such a dark stain on the record of the Metropolitan police force.” If chosen, Dick would become the first female commissioner in the Met’s 188-year history, as would another candidate, Sara Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council. Also in the running are Mark Rowley, a Met assistant commissioner and head of counter-terrorism, and Stephen Kavanagh, chief constable of Essex police, who previously served in the Met. The Foreign Office did not respond to a request for comment on Dick’s behalf."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/feb/19/australia-new-normal-47c-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-19T00:04:15Z","webTitle":"Australia’s new normal … as city temperatures hit 47C people shelter from the deadly heat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/19/australia-new-normal-47c-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/feb/19/australia-new-normal-47c-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s new normal … as city temperatures hit 47C people shelter from the deadly heat","bodyText":"Nahid is resting on a bench outside a Target clothing store, her groceries beside her. A cheery, middle-aged woman with a soft Egyptian accent, she is eating a cone of bubblegum ice-cream as though it contains the secret of life. When I ask her if she’s enjoying her ice-cream, it takes her 30 seconds to stop laughing. “On the weekend I was sick! Sick from the heat! It was like a virus,” she exclaims. “My nephew, he was throwing up from the heat! He couldn’t even take water, he was so sick. “They say it’s going to be this bad in March too! Normally it is a little cooler in March, but this year…” Nahid shakes her head sorrowfully. Australians are no strangers to hot weather. But for the past week large parts of the continent have suffered a heatwave of unusual length and intensity. Temperature records were beaten in cities and rural towns around the country. Shops across Sydney ran out of fans, and New South Wales energy minister Don Harwin urged people to beat the heat by going to the movies. More than 40,000 homes in South Australia experienced blackouts as electricity networks struggled to cope with the increased demand placed on the grid by air conditioners. For those lucky enough to live near the coast, there’s an easy solution: go for a swim. Sydney’s beaches have been packed, as they are every summer, with city dwellers and tourists desperate to cool off. But in the far-western Sydney suburb of Penrith – 60km from the coast – options for getting out of the heat are few. Penrith has the dubious honour of being Sydney’s hottest suburb, with summer daytime temperatures four or five degrees higher than in the inner city. During last week’s heatwave, the suburb sweltered through an unheard-of 46.9°C – a record for the city. “Penrith has had about 12 days above 40 degrees this summer, which is clearly unusual,” says Karl Braganza, climate monitoring manager at the Bureau of Meteorology. When it gets that hot, Penrith mayor John Thain recommends that people don’t even venture outside. “The burn factor here’s so quick: it’s really important for people to stay safe,” Thain says. “Last weekend people were just hunkered down at home.” For locals who want or need to leave the house in such heat, there’s one overriding option: Westfield Penrith Plaza, a sprawling shopping complex just off High Street. Crucially, it has air conditioning – a feature that has attracted Nahid and swarms of other Penrith locals on yet another boiling Sydney day. Children hang around after school is let out; mothers with young children are anxious to prevent heat-related tantrums; and pensioners kill time until the sun goes down and the heat begins to dissipate. Step through Westfield’s sliding glass doors into the outside world, and the heat hits you like a car door. Strolling a few hundred metres up High Street is like wading through pea soup. You sweat from places you never knew sweat could come from – the backs of your knees, the small of your back, your feet. Middle-aged women sport sun umbrellas, a criminally overdue fashion accessory in Australia; pedestrians huddle in what little patches of shade they can find while they wait at crosswalks. In the Australian Arms Hotel, where the only women present are those working behind the bar, dozens of men are cooling off after a day’s work. Brian, a big, taciturn Englishman with a beer belly and a long bushranger beard, is a fan of the Australian climate, but the heatwave has forced him to revise his position somewhat. “They said it was 47 degrees last week, but in your backyard, with the sun coming off the concrete and everything, it’s more like bloody 51,” he says. The heatwave is officially over, but the reality of Australian summers getting hotter is much more serious and far-reaching than a few more hot days each year. Almost every Australian capital city experienced higher-than-average temperatures in January; in Sydney and Brisbane, it was the hottest month on record. That scorching January came after 2016 was the country’s fourth-hottest year on record – a year that, in turn, followed on from 2013, the hottest year the country has ever recorded. That increasing heat has made an already dry continent even more prone to devastating bushfires. NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons describes fire conditions during the heatwave as “the worst possible... they are catastrophic. We haven’t seen this in NSW to this extent, ever.” Fire conditions were even worse than on “black Saturday”, Australia’s worst-ever bushfire disaster, in 2009, in which 173 people died. Less dramatic, but just as worrying, is the rising number of deaths from heat stress, which already kills more Australians than all other natural disasters combined. A shockingly high number of Australians died of heat stress on 27 January – the day after Australia Day, a national holiday where outdoor activities like swimming, barbecues and going to sporting matches are commonplace. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that the Australian government’s response to this steadily unfolding public health and safety crisis would include some acknowledgement of the elephant in the room – climate change. That’s certainly the opinion of the Bureau of Meteorology, which warned in its state of the climate report, published in late 2016, that “the duration, frequency and intensity of extreme heat events have increased across large parts of Australia”, and that “Australian temperatures are projected to continue increasing”. “There’s a clear trend where those extreme hot days across the continent are increasing, and quite dramatically over the past 20 years,” Braganza says. “Regarding fire weather – which includes things like wind speed, humidity, the drought factor – we’ve seen a shift in most of Australia’s fire-prone regions towards a longer fire season and an increase in the frequency and extremity of fire events, as well as fire danger days.” But the country’s current administration, headed by the conservative Liberal Party and the rural-based National Party, is deeply hostile to any substantive action on climate change, and the recent heat has seemingly done little to change their minds. Conservative governments in Britain, Germany and elsewhere have taken steps to reduce their nations’ carbon emissions, often suffering politically as a result. But no such political courage seems to exist in Australia. Instead, absurdity reigns. At the height of the heatwave last week, treasurer Scott Morrison, one of the most powerful politicians in the country, brandished a lump of coal at parliamentary question time, declaring coal to be the future of Australian energy. “This is coal. Don’t be afraid! Don’t be scared!” Morrison proclaimed to the laughter of his government colleagues. They passed the lump of coal around among themselves as Morrison claimed the opposition Labor party, which has proposed ambitious renewable energy targets, are suffering from “coalphobia”. It was reminiscent of the stunt pulled in 2015 by US Republican senator James Inhofe, who infamously threw a snowball on the floor of Congress as “evidence” that global warming is a myth. Morrison’s actions typify the government’s attitude to climate change – not just indifference, but an active hostility towards anything that threatens the country’s large coal industry. Last year prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and a number of his ministers blamed another South Australian blackout on the state’s renewable energy supply, despite advice from the public service stating that the real cause was a large storm that knocked over several major transmission lines. Turnbull’s predecessor, Tony Abbott, made Australia the first nation on earth to roll back climate change legislation when he abolished the carbon trading scheme introduced by his Labor predecessor. Turnbull himself, once a keen advocate of renewable energy, has performed an abrupt about-face since assuming office in 2015; he now sings the praises of so-called “clean coal”, a hypothetical technology with dubious environmental and financial returns. If Australian summers grow ever hotter in the years ahead, the public’s patience for such inaction is likely to wear thin. Perhaps moving parliament to Penrith – or somewhere without air conditioning – might help Australia’s politicians move things along."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/feb/17/manchester-united-champions-league-wes-brown-jose-mourinho","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-17T22:30:22Z","webTitle":"Manchester United can qualify for Champions League, says Wes Brown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/feb/17/manchester-united-champions-league-wes-brown-jose-mourinho","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/feb/17/manchester-united-champions-league-wes-brown-jose-mourinho","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United can qualify for Champions League, says Wes Brown","bodyText":"Wes Brown is backing his former club Manchester United to finish in the top four and says the fear factor is returning under José Mourinho. The 37-year-old defender could face United in Sunday’s FA Cup tie at Ewood Park, though he expects to start on the Blackburn Rovers bench. Of United, he said: “Any team they put out will be a strong one and if they make changes all the players out there will be wanting to show what they can do. I don’t think they will take their foot off the gas but that means there is less pressure on us. We can go out and enjoy it.” Brown secured two FA Cup winners’ medals with United, though he did not take part in the final in 1999, the year of the treble. “That was my first full season,” he said. “It was a good starting point but looking back I suppose I was able to take the club’s high standards for granted. Winning is everything when you are at a club like that, and most seasons we were coming first or second. That was what the gaffer [Sir Alex Ferguson] set up – he gave us mental strength and a winning mentality. If you keep winning and everyone’s playing well and there’s a good team spirit it just carries on and on. “I always thought it would be difficult when Sir Alex left, because he’d been there so long and you couldn’t imagine the place without him. It was always going to be hard for people to come in and change stuff.” David Moyes and Louis van Gaal found that to be true, even though they may have started with the intention of changing as little as possible, but Brown believes Mourinho was right to make a fresh start. “His big signings have been brilliant and I am sure he would like to bring in a few more but what they set out for at the start of the season was to make the Champions League and they have a great chance of finishing in the top four now,” he said. “You can see everyone is starting to fit in, to feel what everybody else is doing. It has taken a while but now they are on a good run opponents are starting to fear them again. They are not an easy team to beat whereas before they were getting pushed over a little bit.” Despite United going 16 matches unbeaten in the Premier League they remain stuck in sixth place, albeit only two points behind Arsenal in fourth, which indicates the strength of the top six this season. “It’s going to be tight,” Brown said. “At this stage it’s about who has the bottle. United have shown they are willing to fight because after the points they dropped at the start of the season I didn’t think they could get to where they are now. It’s hard for anyone when you keep changing managers – I know that from Sunderland – but the foundations are still there at United and I think Mourinho knows what the club is all about. I definitely think they can go higher.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/live/2017/feb/17/trump-immigration-plan-national-guard-leaked-memo","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-17T22:51:33Z","webTitle":"Trump plan had national guard chasing immigrants | The minute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/feb/17/trump-immigration-plan-national-guard-leaked-memo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2017/feb/17/trump-immigration-plan-national-guard-leaked-memo","fields":{"headline":"Trump plan had national guard chasing immigrants","bodyText":"The Trump administration considered a proposal to mobilize as many as 100,000 national guard troops to round up unauthorized immigrants, including millions living nowhere near the Mexico border, according to a draft memo obtained by the Associated Press.

Now, after those monsters of the 20th century, comes a portrayal of one of its heroes. Brian Cox is taking on the role of Winston Churchill in a new film, for which he put on 10 kilos, shaved his head and practised Churchill’s distinctive jutting lower lip. But beyond making “certain physical concessions”, Cox says he was determined not to do the obvious thing and caricature the cigar-smoking statesman by adopting the stereotypical “Churchillian voice”. Cox, a Royal Shakespeare Company associate artist, is the latest in a long line of actors who have played Britain’s most celebrated leader, including Richard Burton, Robert Hardy and Albert Finney. He likened Churchill to great Shakespearean characters such as King Lear, a role he played to acclaim at the National Theatre. “The problem with Churchill is that you always fall into this trap of ‘the Churchillian voice’,” he said. After listening to rare private recordings, Cox realised that Churchill’s natural voice was quite different from that of the rousing speeches with which he rallied the British people during the second world war. He said: “I kind of discovered that the Churchillian voice was very much part of his oratory style – something he created. So there’s a bit where I do ‘my Churchill’ … but for most of the film, I really don’t talk like that because he was very quick and much more mercurial in his language.” As an orator, Churchill would, for example, place a drawn-out emphasis on the “a” in a word like “France”. It was Cox said, “a clever technique”. The film, Churchill, shot in Scotland, focuses on the run-up to D-day in summer 1944, portraying the prime minister as a man fearful of history repeating itself. Operation Overlord, the cross-Channel assault, brought back memories of his disastrous Dardanelles campaign in 1915, when thousands of young men were killed and wounded. Cox said: “The vision of the beaches is the vision of the destruction in Gallipoli.” The film will also bring out the role played by his wife Clementine in saving him from physical and mental collapse and inspiring him to greatness. “Clemmie” is played by Miranda Richardson, whose previous films include Tom &amp; Viv, about the poet TS Eliot. Cox said Churchill, exhausted by the war and illness, was plagued by depression: “Clemmie was his rock. She keeps him on the straight and narrow, but is also quite exhausted by him and by his mood swings. I think he’s full of flaws and someone who lives with his mistakes, and that was a great source of his depression.” He added: “There was an element of loneliness. He was alone for so much of the time because he was always against the flow. When Neville Chamberlain came back from Munich with his little piece of paper – peace in our time – Churchill didn’t buy it for a minute. People didn’t like him because he stated what he believed. That’s what made it very hard for him. Eventually that amount of rejection has to get to you. But he was proved right on so many elements of the second world war.” As an actor, portraying both strength and frailty is hard, Cox said. “It’s frailty of spirit as much as physical frailty.” Playing Churchill was humbling and inspiring: “How lucky I am to give persona to this amazing man.” He is now having difficulty losing the weight, but prosthetics and padding would not have worked: “You have to have the weight. He was not a tall man, but he was big. You can’t be walking around in padding. His walk is very easy: there’s a sort of shuffle about him.” Other recent portrayals include those of Michael Gambon in Churchill’s Secret and John Lithgow in The Crown, both for TV. Later this year, Gary Oldman will be seen in the role in Darkest Hour, by Joe Wright, director of Pride and Prejudice. Does Britain need a Churchill more than ever today? Definitely, Cox believes. Referring to Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and author of a Churchill biography, he said: “[Churchill] wasn’t like the bunch of chancers we’ve got now, who are not a patch on him. Boris Johnson can bleat all he likes, but he ain’t no Winston Churchill.” Churchill always put the country before himself, he added: “He had a vision, a great heart and a great sense of caring.” Churchill will be released in June to coincide with the 73rd anniversary of D-Day PAST LIVES Richard Burton The Gathering Storm (1974) Writing in The New York Times before the drama was aired in the US, Burton said that while preparing to play Churchill, “I realised afresh that I hate Churchill and all his kind.” The BBC banned him from future productions. Robert Hardy The Wilderness Years (1981) Robert Hardy, who has played Churchill nine times, first took on the role for this ITV mini-series. He later described the role as the greatest challenge of his acting career. He spent nine months “listening – morning, afternoon and evening – to 24 double-sided LPs of all the speeches he’d made.” Albert Finney The Gathering Storm (2002) Finney, who stars with Vanessa Redgrave as Clementine, won both a Bafta for best actor and an Emmy for outstanding lead actor.

If you are very unlucky, you will take an autistic child to a doctor and learn that “autism” is a vague and flabby label. There isn’t even agreement on what causes it, let alone on what, if anything, might alleviate or cure it. Into the gap, between inexplicable suffering and the inability to relieve it, pour the conmen. Last week, Andrew Wakefield, the most contemptible of the charlatans, arrived in Britain to exploit the false hopes and fill the nightmares of his native land. That he is a fraud has been established beyond reasonable doubt. The General Medical Council struck him off in 2010 after, in a superb example of journalism at its best, Brian Deer showed how Wakefield had manipulated research to make a non-existent link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and autism. Not content with lying, Wakefield exploited his voodoo science for financial gain. The money was not the worst of it. The MMR conspiracy theory sent vaccination rates below the level of herd immunity. As unvaccinated children become teenagers, we are yet to see whether they will pay a price in blood for Wakefield’s fraudulence. Given the threat to public health, the personal enrichment and the neglected fact that Wakefield’s malign fantasy has led parents who vaccinated autistic children needlessly blaming themselves, in my eyes he appears to be a criminal. If you want to know what is wrong with a country, look at the criminals its courts cannot punish. Just as it was impossible to prosecute bankers after the crash of 2008, so it is impossible now to arrest Wakefield. Rob an old lady of her savings and you go to prison. Rob millions of children of protection against preventable illness and you are endorsed by the Trump administration, which has, inevitably, made its support for the MMR con explicit. The one good thing Andrew Wakefield has done in his worthless life is show that sick societies are like sick people. They, too, face suffering without relief or prospect of a cure. They, too, are open to exploitation by every variety of crank and fanatic. Nowhere more so than in Trump’s America. At a personal level, Trump’s wife, Melania, promises to sue anyone who says their son, Barron, may be autistic. Her threat suggests the couple have feared, however fleetingly, that they might learn of the pain of the parents of autistic children and of autistic people themselves. Whatever twinge of sympathy I felt, vanished, however, when I saw that at the political level Trump had said that “doctors lied” about vaccination and has given every indication of pursuing the Wakefield conspiracy theory in office. If he does, it will be a disaster for autistic people. In America, as in the UK, they fall over a cliff edge when they move from child to adulthood. So bad are the services, the US does not know how many autistic adults live in its borders. Hillary Clinton, who actually talked to autistic people, something vaccination conspirators neglect to do, promised a census. She lost. And now, as Steve Silberman, the author of the magnificent Neurotribes tells me, the Trump administration can indulge in junk science, safe in the knowledge that its billionaire friends will never need public assistance to provide for their autistic children. The “doctors lied” is the first link between MMR and so many other modern manias. Climate change deniers have to maintain that 97% or more of the world’s scientists are lying. It is easier to believe an unbelievable fiction than contemplate the vast and wrenching changes manmade climate change must bring to our lives. Rather than face them, say Trump and the Anglo-Saxon right, we can retreat into a surprisingly comfortable state of paranoid delusion. Second, and this point needs emphasising when elements on the right claims to be the champions of the working class (and let us see how long that lasts) and elements on the left blame it for Trump’s victory: conspiracy theories always begin with pseudo-intellectuals. Anyone who has looked at the work of Holocaust, 9/11 or climate change deniers, will see that it is stuffed with footnotes. It was not a tabloid catering for the “left behind” that began the MMR lie, but the learned medical journal, the Lancet. Its editors did not know they were victims of a fraud. But they ought to have seen that Wakefield’s original 1998 paper was “badly written and had no clear statement of its hypothesis or indeed of its conclusions”, as Ben Goldacre, the debunker of scientific fraud, put it. Last week, Wakefield did not speak at a working men’s club, but at the supposedly reputable Regent’s University in London. To top that, he was invited to the European parliament, not by a neofascist know-nothing, but by an MEP from a Green party, which readers who have not been paying attention may think is filled with decent people. Third, the MMR scandal rebuts the myth that we are living in a uniquely mendacious era of web-driven “fake news”. Mainstream national newspaper journalists, including here at the Observer, I am afraid and at the BBC, amplified Wakefield’s message in the last decade without making the most basic checks. There can be no “post-truth age” for the autistic, for they never had an age of truth to begin with. To put the disgrace of my trade as mildly as I can, if Wakefield were put on trial, there would be hundreds of journalists alongside him in the dock. Finally, ask yourself why Andrew Wakefield does not recant, when every study of autism and vaccination has shown his original claim to be false. Asking that is like asking why Donald Trump does not cut his links with climate change deniers or Jeremy Corbyn cut his links with the Socialist Workers party. Wakefield would lose his support base. More to the point, as I suspect he, Trump and Corbyn know, the very fools he has encouraged would throw the accusations of corruption he has thrown at others back at him. Whether you are dealing with climate change or MMR, the final lesson is this: you cannot rely on charlatans to expose themselves. You have tune up your bullshit detector and do the exposing yourself.

Sue Smith’s grey ran a fine race to the third-last in the Peter Marsh last month, his first foray into handicap company, and there are several reasons to hope for a better showing this time. The two horses he was chasing that day were Bristol De Mai, a Gold Cup contender, and Otago Trail, a subsequent winner. The odds are good that the opposition will be less fearsome here and the jockeys on a few of his rivals will be interested in saving something for the National in April, a race in which Vintage Clouds (3.15) is not entered. Dry weather is expected to produce a less taxing surface this time, so Vintage Clouds may be able to sustain his effort to the line, even over this extra half-mile. He runs from a 6lb lower mark, having been out of the handicap last time, and 9-1 has a lot of appeal. Vicente is my long-range tip for the National, so it would be encouraging to see an improved showing from him. Equally, it must be remembered that, for him and others in the race, peak form is supposed to be six weeks away. Saturday’s TV racing tips 1.50 Ascot It looked very much as though Fletchers Flyer needed his first outing of the season, when he lost four places over the last three fences here last month. If back to the form of his Punchestown success in April, he has the beating of these. 2.05 Haydock Aux Ptits Soins could be dangerous on this return to hurdles but he will be a short price for a horse with questions to answer. The splendidly game Agrapart looks a better option after his Cheltenham success on New Year’s Day. 2.25 Ascot After a slow start to the year, Jonjo O’Neill seems to be faring better this month and this might be the right time to catch his Go Conquer. Narrowly beaten here in November, he bounced back from an early fall to chase home a useful sort at Kempton’s Christmas meeting. Several bits of form suggest he is better than his rating, though he will certainly need to be. O’Faolains Boy is on a great mark if anywhere near his best but we’ve seen his best just once in the past three years. 2.45 Wincanton This ought to be within Yanworth’s compass, especially now he has cheekpieces to help his focus. It is worth respecting his stablemate, Sceau Royal, who was off colour when beaten on his most recent run in November. 3.00 Ascot Having learned to settle, Air Horse One is a horse to follow and could be well treated for this return to handicap company. 3.35 Ascot It’s a fair question whether Cue Card still has the pace for this trip, it being four years since he won this prize. But the ground is expected to be testing and that may help him home in front. Shantou Flyer has plenty to offer, while Taquin Du Seuil can be dangerous.

His new landlord turns out to be wholly supportive, measures put in place to prevent viral infection are working and he has a live Champion Hurdle contender in Yanworth, who will warm up in Wincanton’s Kingwell Hurdle on Saturday. On Thursday he was watching the chestnut complete his preparation with a couple of canters. Yanworth missed a recent race at Sandown because of “a little hiccup” that sidelined him for five days but all now seems fine again. Last seen winning the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton, Yanworth ought to be even better suited by Cheltenham next month since that track puts more emphasis on stamina. His only defeat over obstacles came there at the last Festival but King is now disposed to see positives in that second-place effort behind Yorkhill. “Look, it was a time we couldn’t really win an argument. The one month the horses weren’t right was last March. I think we had two placed horses [at the Festival], him and Dusky Legend, and the rest ran appallingly. It shows you what a good horse he probably is.” Yanworth was expected to step up in trip this year with the Stayers’ Hurdle as his aim. Plans were revised when Unowhatimeanharry, who also carries the green and gold of JP McManus, began to look unbeatable at three miles. Then, after Yanworth turned himself into a convincing two-miler at Christmas, McManus found another fast horse in Buveur D’Air, who hacked up at Sandown a fortnight ago. Might there be time for Yanworth’s target to change again? He still holds an entry in the Stayers’. But King is clear that that option does not tempt him. “You can’t fire him into a three-mile Stayers’ Hurdle when he’s never gone beyond two and a half, really. I wouldn’t have thought so. I think it’ll be the Champion Hurdle or nothing. Let’s hope it’s the Champion Hurdle.” In the long run chasing is bound to be an option for a horse of his scope. King concedes there is already something of the chaser about his hurdling, which is why Yanworth will be fitted with cheekpieces on Saturday, “to sharpen his jumping”. King has a second Kingwell runner in Sceau Royal and hopes to see something better than the weak finishing effort which caused him to flop in November’s Fighting Fifth. A subsequent trachea wash suggested the horse was suffering from something, so perhaps he can now restate his Champion Hurdle claims. “I didn’t particularly want to run them in the same race but it looks as if we’re going to have to.” The trainer’s team for next month’s Festival will include classy types like Uxizandre, Messire Des Obeaux and Coeur De Lion, while the zippy grey Ziga Boy will have his backers in the Grand National three weeks later. King hopes for a strong end to a season which, with two months to go, has already yielded more winners than any of the previous seven. His strike-rate of 25% would be a career high if he sustains it to April. Getting back to this kind of form must be satisfying after the yard’s trouble with infection four or five years ago. Boxes are now disinfected more often and King has emphasised air circulation in his barns, raising roofs and installing vents. Racehorses as a breed are not so robust as they were, he feels, making such measures a benefit to any trainer. There were months of insecurity when the Barbury Castle estate, of which his stable is part, went on the market in autumn but a sale has now been completed to Chris Woodhouse, who has held senior positions at RAC and Agent Provocateur, and the message from the new owner is: “Carry on the good work.” “It’s a great relief,” King admits, driving back to the house, past gallops graced 80 years ago by the mighty Brown Jack. “It was useful in a way. I did look at two or three other places, before I knew what was going to happen, and it just reminds you what a great place this is.” Saturday tips, by Chris Cook Ascot 1.15 Topofthegame 1.50 Fletchers Flyer 2.25 Go Conquer 3.00 Air Horse One 3.35 Cue Card 4.10 Joe Farrell 4.45 Fortunello Haydock 1.30 Don Bersy 2.05 Agrapart 2.40 Mydor (nb) 3.15 Vintage Clouds (nap) 3.50 No Hassle Hoff 4.20 Tanit River 4.55 Wonderful Charm Kempton 5.45 Boychick 6.15 Spare Parts 6.45 Dream Farr 7.15 Every Chance 7.45 Summer Icon 8.15 Cosmic Ray 8.45 Freddy With A Y 9.15 Jet Setter Lingfield 1.10 Flight Of Fantasy 1.45 Jeanie’s Place 2.20 Zipedeedodah 2.55 Final 3.30 Dougan 4.05 Midnightly 4.40 Smiley Bagel Wincanton 1.40 Black Narcissus 2.15 Bishops Court 2.45 Yanworth 3.20 Dadsintrouble 3.55 Pain Au Chocolat 4.30 Denny Kerrell 5.05 Molineaux O’Faolains Boy is on a great mark if anywhere near his best but we’ve seen his best just once in the past three years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/feb/17/logan-review-hugh-jackmans-wolverine-enters-a-winter-of-x-men-discontent","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-17T21:30:21Z","webTitle":"Logan review – Hugh Jackman's Wolverine enters a winter of X-Men discontent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/17/logan-review-hugh-jackmans-wolverine-enters-a-winter-of-x-men-discontent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/feb/17/logan-review-hugh-jackmans-wolverine-enters-a-winter-of-x-men-discontent","fields":{"headline":"Logan review – Hugh Jackman's Wolverine enters a winter of X-Men discontent","bodyText":"Superpowers are one thing, but no-one said they were immortal. What happens when superheroes get old? Actually, what happens when, like many non-superheroes, they arrive at late middle-age without a partner, in ill health, and with an ageing parent to look after? Or parent-figure anyway. You find yourself asking these questions watching this surprisingly engaging, but downbeat – and also violent – X-Men movie from the Marvel stable. It is more like a survivalist thriller than a superhero film, and signals its wintry quality with the title itself. It’s like seeing a film entitled Banner or Parker or Kent. With the approach of death, maybe super identity is cast off. Superpowers start to fade along with ordinary powers. We’re about a decade into the future, and the American landscape looks grim if not decidedly post-apocalyptic: mutants are illegal, though a sinister corporation has been tasked with controlling any new examples and putting them to work in the service of the state. Logan (Hugh Jackman) is working incognito as a limo driver near the Tex-Mex border which does seem to have become a wall. He is ferrying prom night kids and bachelorette parties around town. But he is a semi-functioning alcoholic, with muscle pains, fading eyesight, and a very ageing patriarch beard. When those Wolverine blade-claws of his are unsheathed, as they sometimes are, it causes arthritic pain. He’s actually living in Mexico, in a wrecked water tower with Professor Xavier, played of course with terrific aplomb Patrick Stewart. Xavier is in his 90s and resents people calling him an “octogenarian”; he needs black-market meds to prevent brain seizures which cause telekinetic earthquakes all around him. And Logan has to take Xavier and put him on the lavatory when the need arises. Xavier and Logan are living with a factotum called Caliban, a droll character-part for Stephen Merchant. A number of people are on Logan’s case: there is the smug, menacing Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) and his employer, chilling technocrat Zander Rice (Richard E Grant). But then Logan comes into contact with a desperate woman, Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez) from whom he learns of the existence of Laura, played by newcomer Dafne Keen, a kid who appears to have sensational and familiar abilities. Could it be that there is in fact a new generation of mutants out there, and that Logan, in time-honoured fashion, is going to have overcome his grumpiness and be a mentor to this kid? Amusingly, these people have made contact with Logan through an X-Men comic book, and the movie finesses the existence of these in the superhero world as rumourmongering pulp fiction. They infuriate Logan, who says that the world’s bad stuff can’t be tackled by an “asshole in a leotard” and says that comic books are “ice cream for bedwetters”. Harsh. As far as other mythologies go, Laura, Xavier and Logan find themselves holed up in a hotel-room watching the old western classic Shane on TV, which Professor Xavier says he remembers watching as a kid at the Essoldo. Did Stewart improvise that line? Or do screenwriters James Mangold, Michael Green and Scott Frank have a connoisseur knowledge of defunct Brit cinema chains? But the heart of the movie is the unexpectedly poignant relationship between Xavier and Logan: I’d be tempted to call them the Steptoe and Son of the mutant world, although in fact Logan goes into Basil Fawlty mode at one stage with his own pickup truck, attempting to trash it – perhaps to teach it a lesson. Logan is a forthright, muscular movie which preserves the X-Men’s strange, exotic idealism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/feb/17/gloucester-saracens-premiership-rugby-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-17T21:57:04Z","webTitle":"Gloucester edge out Saracens as Mako Vunipola makes return from injury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/17/gloucester-saracens-premiership-rugby-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/feb/17/gloucester-saracens-premiership-rugby-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Gloucester edge out Saracens as Mako Vunipola makes return from injury","bodyText":"Mako Vunipola proved his fitness for England’s Six Nations encounter with Italy next week by lasting for 70 minutes in his first match since Christmas but he could not stop Saracens suffering their second defeat in six days to a team in the lower half of the table and failing to pick up a bonus point for the first time this season. The England head coach, Eddie Jones, watched from a hospitality box as the loose-head prop, returning two months after damaging knee ligaments, comfortably held up to the pace of a match which revealed the fickle nature of Gloucester: lost without trace at Leicester the week before, they fronted up to the champions and finished the gameboth teams had the opportunity to win the stronger. Vunipola was heavily involved in the opening try of the night, scored by Schalk Brits after nine minutes following a multi-phase move; and he forced two turnovers and carried the ball 13 times. He was also in possession of the ball on the hour when the Gloucester outside-half Billy Burns hurt his head and neck tackling the front-row and was treated on the pitch for 10 minutes before beingtaken off on a stretcher. Gloucester were leading 23-16 at the time but within a minute Saracens had drawn level. The prop Paul Doran Jones was sent to the sin-bin for collapsing a maul and, when the penalty resulted in another lineout, Will Fraser was driven over the line. Instead of providing the cue for a familiar collapse, the home side showed the resolve and indefatigability their supporters yearn for on a regular basis. They hustled Saracens into errors, making first-time tackles count and getting back to their feet quickly. There were times in the match when Gloucester looked like Saracens, seized by desire, and the champions resembled Gloucester careless and sloppy. Gloucester’s three tries were the result of Saracens mistakes. Tom Marshall’s on 17 minutes came after Schalk Burger had failed to deal with Willi Heinz’s clearance kick. Jeremy Thrush extended their 16-13 interval lead nine minutes after the restart after a double dose of sloppiness, with Marcelo Bosch’s casual chip being followed by Will Fraser being caught in possession. And Richard Hibbard’s try, five minutes from the end, came after Saracens had lost the ball near the home 22. “We went off script, chanced our arm and lacked our normal composure,” said the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall. “I thought Mako did well considering he had been out for so long and I am assuming he is going to play against Italy in some form.” McCall said the club’s England No8 Billy Vunipola, who has not played since the end of November after knee ligament damage, was ahead of schedule and would have his comeback date set next week. It was the first time Saracens, whose full-back Sean Maitland went off with a rib problem that compounded Scotland’s injury worries before next weekend’s match against Wales, had suffered back-to-back defeats for nearly two years and the first time they had failed to secure at least one point in a match for 11 months. They conceded three tries for the first time this season and could be caught on points by Exeter on Saturday this afternoon. After Burns had given Gloucester the lead with a penalty, Brits’s try and Bosch’s long-range penalty put Saracens ahead. Marshall’s try flicked a switch and, although the 23-13 lead the home side established through Thrush’s try was wiped out when Fraser scored, it was the champions who collapsed at the end of a night of role reversal.

Questions on the survey range from what seem to be straightforward inquiries into the perceived trustworthiness of certain news organizations that Trump has accused of promoting “fake news”, asking, “Do you trust CNN to report fairly on Trump’s presidency?” to what appear to be barely veiled and barely comprehensible attacks on the press, such as, “Do you believe that contrary to what the media says, raising taxes does not create jobs?” Other questions, such as “Do you believe that if Republicans were obstructing Obama like Democrats are doing to President Trump, the mainstream media would attack Republicans?” serve as the polling equivalent of encountering a Lovecraftian cosmic monster whose otherworldly construction and implications cannot be fully understood by the human intellect without resulting in total madness. Exclusive to the Guardian, discovered behind the settee in an opulent suite at Mar-a-Lago, are the following 10 questions trimmed from the survey before its release: 26. Isn’t it very brave of President Trump to speak out about how unfair the media is being towards his administration? ___ YES, it is brave and in no way seems like he’s anxiously searching for a scapegoat to blame for his inadequacy as a leader. ___ NO, I would say he’s being more “valiant” than brave. 27. Do you believe that the mainstream media has been unfair to President Trump? __ As a true American patriot I say yes, they have been unfair. ___ I have been paid by Democratic operatives to go against what I know in my heart to be true and answer that I do not believe the media has been unfair in their reporting. 28. Do you agree that the media unfairly reported on President Trump’s executive order restricting entry against people from countries compromised by Islamic terrorism? __ YES. __ NO, but my answer is biased due to the fact that I am a member of a terrorist group who this brilliant restriction has foiled. 29. Don’t you think it would be cool if the mainstream media looked the other way every once in a while, at least while the Trump administration is still getting set up? __That would show a lot of class. __ It doesn’t matter since the Trump administration is infallible. 30. Do you agree that President Trump could easily beat Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, at arm wrestling? __ YES. __ NO, Trump could not beat the not-all-that-handsome-in-person Trudeau at arm wrestling because Trudeau would be too scared to even try arm wrestling a man as masculine as the president. 31. Jake Tapper seems like he’s hiding something, doesn’t he? __ YES. __ NO, Jake Tapper doesn’t seem smart enough to hide anything. If you have any information regarding crimes or scandalous behavior Jake Tapper has engaged in, please explain in the space provided: _______________________ 32. Out of sheer curiosity and for no other reason, if evidence that President Trump is a Russian puppet came to light, would you find that he allowed himself to be recruited by the Russians in order to undermine their intelligence apparatus from within a plausible explanation? __ YES, I would immediately accept that explanation and applaud the President’s cunning. __ NO, I would demand that the President be removed from office should any such evidence come to light. If you checked NO, please provide your social security number and access codes to any security systems installed in your residence: _________________ 33. Do you agree that there’s nothing desperate about presenting Americans with a confusingly worded polemic against the mainstream media disguised as a survey? ___ YES, this gives me a lot of faith in the administration. ___ NO, I am a hater and a total loser. 34. Were you aware that members of the exclusive Mar-a-Lago club receive access to world-class pools, spas, entertainment and fine dining? __ Wow, please send me more information about this fantastic membership opportunity. __ NO, I am not interested in the ultimate luxury experience. 35.

He had the ear of everyone who mattered in the Labour party, and on matters of race and equality he was the go-to guy. But then he began to have doubts about many of the political positions he held and started confronting what he saw as right-on shibboleths. Pretty soon he was being denounced as a turncoat in the same terms that he had once denounced others. In recent years, he has made several documentaries, with attention-grabbing titles such as Things We Won’t Say About Race That Are True, that have aimed to challenge received wisdoms. The latest, which sounds like a homage to a Daily Telegraph letters page correspondent, is entitled Has Political Correctness Gone Mad? I meet Phillips at his production office in Kentish Town, north London. Now 63, with greying hair and a slight stoop, he’s no longer the youthfully strutting figure who seemed to be everywhere in the 1990s. But as soon as he gets talking, the eyes light up and the old passion comes pouring out. Political correctness is one of those terms that mean different things to different people. What does it mean to him? “The title is not mine,” he says, a little defensively. “It’s a Channel 4 title. I do not normally ever use the term political correctness, except with a heavy dose of doubt about its usefulness, because basically it has become a stick with which the right beats everyone else.” In fact Phillips has used the term before. Two years ago he wrote in the Daily Mail and Sunday Times of “po-faced political correctness that cramps all conventional parties”. Still, his thesis in the film is that by trying to corral political debate into a tightly policed acceptability, the political establishment has created the conditions for insurgent figures such as Nigel Farage, Jeremy Corbyn and Donald Trump. It’s a perfectly reasonable argument but the programme is a little too wide-ranging in its targets to make its case. It jumps from the anti-Islamic group Pegida to censorious transgender activists to social media trolls to students banning sombreros. Although worthy subjects for investigation, they don’t quite gel as an explanation for the rise of Corbyn, let alone Trump. But what they do point to is Phillips’s increasing frustration with the conviction that if we can only control the expression of ideas, we will all be able to live together in peace and harmony. October 2000 saw the publication of a report commissioned by Phillips, then chair of the Runnymede Trust, called The Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain. It marked perhaps the high-water mark of multicultural thinking, and suggested that Britain should become a “community of communities” in which each community would respect the other by avoiding causing offence. “Well I think it would be fair to say that I made a big mistake,” he says now. “It was a clear statement that some groups can play by their own rules. That to me runs counter to my own political beliefs. Why I am still a supporter of the Labour party is because I believe fundamentally in solidarity and reciprocity, and I think most on the left have forgotten both of those things.” Four years after that report, Phillips wrote an article in which he compared a critique by David Goodhart of multiculturalism to the “jottings from the BNP leader’s weblog”. Two months later, he suddenly announced the end of multiculturalism and called for “a core of Britishness” to be asserted. Not long afterwards, Ken Livingstone suggested that Phillips had swung so far to the right that he would soon be joining the BNP. Goodhart and Phillips are now good friends. “I think Trevor has been intellectually and morally brave,” says Goodhart. “He took a lot of flak for looking past the cliches of the anti-racist left. He is regarded as a curious Uncle Tom figure by a lot of the black and ethnic minority establishment. Trevor still thinks of himself as a somewhat sceptical member of the left family and at times has, I think, felt quite wounded by the attacks.” I ask Phillips if the threat of expulsion from his political tribe does act as a disincentive to speak out about what he really thinks. “Depends how much of your life you want to spend lying to yourself,” he says. “I think it’s pretty wearying to get up each day and tell yourself to go advocate for something that you know not to be true. And what is even worse is if you’re in public office or politics and everyone you’re telling this to also knows it isn’t true. Not only are you a liar, you’re also an idiot.” If, as Goodhart says, he has been wounded by his ostracising, he doesn’t appear to nurture any regrets. “I have lost lots and lots of friends. My view is if you can’t tolerate that I want to have this discussion, then we can’t really be friends. What you’re asking me to do is collude in a lie with you rather than argue it out. A big part of it is that on the left, if you look like me, you’re supposed to think in a particular way. And they just hate it if a black person isn’t the person they want him to be.” He believes that we all have to get used to and get over being offended. “I don’t care about offending people,” he says. “And I don’t really care about being offended. There are quite a lot of people I actually want to offend. And I want to offend them all the time. But if somebody stands on the other side of the street and shouts nigger at me – I’m not going to be thrilled, but I’m not going to argue for him to get locked up.” Then why was he “appalled” at what he saw as antisemitic bigotry in the Labour party? Surely by his own reckoning, he shouldn’t much care. “Oh the problem with that,” he says, “is not that people were using the word Zio, but that people were making it impossible for Jewish students to have meetings. There is an important distinction between words and actions.” But his complaints were not just about actions, I suggest. Was he not also concerned that the Labour party had played down antisemitic attitudes by some of its members? “Yes,” he agrees. “There are people who believe there is no real distinction between Jews, Zionists and Israelis. And the party doesn’t want to get into that at all because, let’s be frank, it’s increasingly dependent on a demographic group – Muslims – within which a sizable minority subscribes to that view.” Phillips studied chemistry at Imperial College, London, and, he says, it’s his science training that made him change his mind about how race was discussed in this country. By the turn of the millennium, he says, it was obvious that it made little sense to classify people as black, brown and white. He has little time for designations such as BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic). “If you look at Indians and Pakistanis, they have completely different life chances. It’s the same with Afro-Caribbeans and West Africans. I’m not clever enough to have a Damascene conversion. I just look at the numbers and if they clash with how I think the world should be working, I’ve got to change the picture.” Fair enough, but his critics will say that Phillips is making straw man arguments. After all, who is stopping him from saying what he wants? He’s got a TV documentary and coverage in national newspapers. Where is this politically correct establishment that’s trying to stifle him? “A ruling elite maintains an idea of what’s good and reasonable by a whole series of methods,” he counters. “Who gets advancement, rewards and status? If you don’t hold to the orthodoxy, you stop being invited to meetings. There’s a phrase that people in centre-left politics use: oh he’s very good. What they actually mean is: I agree with him.” Phillips has grown used to people not agreeing with him. Perhaps a little too used to it. As one old comrade says: “He can’t resist tweaking the nose of the bien pensant.” But in these disagreeable times, dissenting voices will make themselves heard. The liberal consensus has broken down, and rehashing the old pieties won’t put it back together again. Whether or not he receives an invitation, Phillips is determined to have his say.

But since Moonlight is probably one of the most emotionally revealing films about a man ever to have been made, it wins. It isn’t fair to set the two in competition. They’re doing similarly important things in their different ways – exploring negative aspects of masculinity. In Manchester By the Sea a single, unlucky catastrophe turns a warm, fun-loving young man into an angry, aggressive, emotionally shut-down loner. In Moonlight, a whole childhood conspires to drive a man to become a numb synecdoche of all that has blighted his own upbringing. It’s undoubtedly because I’ve recently been diagnosed with a trauma-induced anxiety disorder myself. But I immediately saw the symptoms of chronic or complex post-traumatic stress disorder in both leading characters. In Manchester By the Sea, Lee Chandler, played wonderfully by Casey Affleck, displays symptoms of chronic PTSD, in which a single trauma comes to dominate the brain’s neural pathways in an extremely unhealthy way. You can also see these symptoms simply as emotional reactions that any person in Lee’s situation might develop. But the point is this: we are so used to these destructive and damaging responses to life’s vicissitudes that they seem natural rather than horribly dysfunctional. In Moonlight, Chiron, played by three actors as a child, a teenager and an adult, already has complex PTSD, to my eyes, as a little kid. Complex PTSD is brought on when a person is subjected to a series of traumas, most often by a caregiver they ought to be able to trust unconditionally, but from whom there is little chance of escape. Abused or neglected children are very susceptible to C-PTSD. By the time Chiron is an adult, from my reading of the film, C-PTSD is rampant. There’s a lot of controversy at the moment about whether armchair diagnosis of mental health problems should be indulged. I think it’s totally valid when the character being examined is fictional. I’d say it’s more than valid. It’s necessary if humans are going to get to a point where we can understand ourselves and the messes that we make. In Manchester By the Sea, Lee is a man who really, really needs therapy, though this isn’t mentioned as an option in the film. The culture he’s in is far too blue-collar for that. Lee fights his miserable losing battle with his trauma, guilt and shame alone. As with Chiron in Moonlight, his symptoms are classic too. It’s so plain in the film that what a psychiatrist would call symptoms are also self-protecting emotional responses, recognisable to anyone who cared to view them in that way. Having mentioned the controversy around amateur diagnosis, I’m now going to tread carefully. After the screening of Moonlight I attended, there was a Q&amp;A session with Tarell Alvin McCraney. He wrote the play on which Moonlight is based, In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue. McCraney makes no secret of the fact that the early part of the story, of a boy growing up in Miami with a crack-addicted mother, a flawed father-figure who loses his life very young, and the experience of being bullied as a “faggot” by his peers, is based on his own life. McCraney’s life clearly has not followed the trajectory of Chiron’s because, you’ll be glad to know, the film doesn’t end with our hero sitting down to write an amazing play that becomes a film. You’ve seen that movie already, more than once. McCraney – intelligent, gloriously articulate, handsome, elegant, funny, charming, polished, self-deprecating – is also frank. On the platform he acknowledged that he knows how people see him, which is pretty much the way I saw him, as listed above. It wasn’t just me. The room was full of love for him. However, he says, this is not at all how he sees himself. Instead, he is “terrified”, has “intimacy issues”, sometimes can’t bear crowds and has to be alone, and sometimes finds himself drifting away from feeling present in the world. He has survived his upbringing and thrived fantastically well. But the psychological scars are there and he is aware of them. McCraney says that he doesn’t find writing about his past cathartic. Instead, it depletes him. It costs him a lot. I think that while some men, men like Lee, fight with their fists, McCraney fights with his creativity. It’s a much healthier way to do battle with trauma. But that’s still what it is – a battle with trauma. I find myself thinking that while both Lee and Chiron are extreme examples, a lot of the cliches about the transformation of boyhood into manhood centre on the suppression of trauma. Boys are told not to cry, told to fight back, told to toughen up, in a way that girls less frequently are. (Although girls do toughen up. I did.) Sure, this can result in creativity like McCraney’s. But our experience of the world and its history suggests that very often it results in bombast and aggression, anger and violence. We are used to hearing about theories of gender as a performance. I wonder if that’s too glib. Maybe gender is more of a neurological response, with hyper-masculinity a pathological response to trauma, and hyper-femininity a defence against an aggressive masculine pathology. Or maybe I’m barking up the wrong tree. Who knows? The crucial thing is that these films are urging people to look hard at these profound issues around human behaviour, and really think about what makes people who they are. I’m thankful for both of them, and for the pain and struggle sometimes involved in “being a man” that they so sensitively portray. Especially Moonlight. I don’t think there’s ever been another film quite like it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/feb/19/i-was-wrong-to-defend-corbyn-he-has-betrayed-us-over-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-19T00:05:15Z","webTitle":"I was wrong to defend Jeremy Corbyn.

He has betrayed us over Brexit","bodyText":"The privilege to air one’s views carries with it a duty to admit when you get it wrong. Weirdly, the most read article I wrote for this newspaper of late was a retort it generously allowed to what I saw as churlish coverage of the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader. I don’t vote for political parties, but felt whatever groundswell installed Corbyn was worthy of interest. I did vote to remain in Europe, expecting the result, but was surprised by Corbyn’s reticence between xenophobia and internationalism. I’ve lived on the continent, felt deracinated all my life, get by in three European languages and enjoy encounters that arise from practising them in Britain. I hoped the Labour party would choose internationalism over xenophobia. Wrong, especially regarding the leader for whom the “fight starts now”, having already surrendered without striking a blow, even in vain. What fight? Certainly not for internationalism or the 48%, or 1.4 million British across the Channel, or 3 million Europeans, Corbyn suddenly discovers, who came here within their legal rights but now fear repulsive communication from the Home Office or Capita – and face de facto deportation. No need to recount Corbyn’s conjoining the race to the bottom of the xenophobic sewer. What matters is what his Labour party, apart from its few rebels, has done by supporting Brexit. A tangent: I worked much of last year in Colombia, on a peace deal to end the world’s longest war, an initiative of President Juan Manuel Santos, who said: “My advisers asked me, ‘Are you willing to expend your political capital to do this?’ I said, ‘Yes. It would be worse to get to the end of my life and think I had the opportunity and didn’t take it.’” Imagine the Labour (or Tory) leadership thinking like that. You can’t, because they couldn’t. Santos narrowly lost a plebiscite, but believed the matter too important to accept it as conclusive. Millions filled the squares, defying the result; Santos reworked the accord and passed it through Congress. The peace perseveres. David Cameron lacked that resolve and Theresa May mutated her views to ride the repugnant mood. That left Corbyn’s Labour in an interesting position: he could have “done a Santos”; fought Brexit tooth and nail on principle, focal point for the 48% that is now a majority, champion of open minds, of the economy, swaths of the working and middle classes who voted Remain; of business, academe, science, the NHS, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the Bank of England – with a fair wind from the supreme court. But no. Corbyn had to toe the awful line: “will of the people!”, a tic of politicians with nothing interesting to say. Why did he buckle? Maybe he’s been in committee rooms so long that he cannot think beyond paragraph 6, clause 8, subsection 4. Maybe his vision is so myopically British that he cannot see beyond the white cliffs, although his wife is Mexican. Maybe he always hated the EU. Probably, Corbyn and his MPs want to appease xenophobia in Labour heartlands, at whatever price of principle, to keep their seats warm at Westminster. The urgency is that 3 million people legitimately here are scared (or have no idea what’s about to hit them): serving spaghetti, brewing coffee, plastering walls and pulling pints; doctors, nurses, students, scientists, builders, brokers, the vast majority hard working and agreeable to have around. What’s the problem? Corbyn’s – and most of his party’s – abrogation has contributed to a national culture whereby Brexit is less democratic decision than monolith. “Will of the people!”: we hear it from Labour too (though not its former leader, in his latest estimable effort), less democratic than fascistic, cudgel for anyone who dares suggest we betray not just Britain – never mind Ireland – but Europe and internationalism. Thus, the crucial contrast to how the half of America that voted against Donald Trump reacts to the “will of the people”. “Resist!” reads Greenpeace’s banner over the White House. Where are our equivalents to those American public and popular dissidents trying to make a difference by making some noise? Answer, citing Edmund Burke: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” This is a very British suicide. Dmitri Shostakovich said of his opera The Nose that it was about “the appalling tyranny of the majority”. Among that majority, count the man who could have defied it and thereby defiles the term “leader of the opposition”, because that’s exactly what he’s not. If I defended Corbyn on these pages, I stand humbly corrected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/feb/22/economy-slowing-brexit-watch-data","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-22T10:42:36Z","webTitle":"'The economy looks set to be slowing again' – experts debate Brexit watch data","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/22/economy-slowing-brexit-watch-data","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/feb/22/economy-slowing-brexit-watch-data","fields":{"headline":"'The economy looks set to be slowing again' – experts debate Brexit watch data","bodyText":"David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and former member of the Bank’s MPC from June 2006 to May 2009 The big economic stories this month were about prices, wages and spending and a decline in the number of workers in the UK from the EU. Inflation continued to rise in January, with the consumer prices index hitting 1.8%, the highest since June 2014 as fuel prices surged and the food price deflation enjoyed by shoppers in recent years continued to disappear. The weak pound continued to raise manufacturers’ fuel and material costs which rose at the fastest pace for more than eight years. But more importantly the retail prices index measure of inflation, which is used in wage settlements, rose by 2.6%. This matters when the latest data on wage growth of total earnings showed a dramatic slowing from 2.9% in November to 1.9% in December. So prices are rising faster than wages. As a consequence, this month real earnings, measured in constant 2000 prices, fell from £343 to £341 a week. The buying power of a pay packet is down more than 4% from its pre-recession peak of £356 a week in April 2008. Hurt is returning for workers who inevitably will have to cut their spending. It surprised me, as it did the monetary policy committee, how much people were using up their savings to buy stuff, but this seems now to be coming to an end. It was not surprising then to see the worst bit of economic news this month, the fall in retail sales. Sales volumes fell for the third month running in January, dropping by 0.3%. Taking the latest three months together it was the weakest underlying sales performance for three years. This was the biggest story and may well be the start of something big. Prices rising, real wages and retail sales falling is not a good start to 2017. Of note also this month is the decline in the most recent quarter compared with the previous one of about 50,000 workers from the EU, who are apparently beginning to be frightened away by Brexit. The big question is whether this trend will continue. The UK is a less attractive place to work with the decline in the pound. The economy looks set to be slowing again. Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the PwC consultancy and former member of the Bank’s MPC from October 2006 to May 2011 The pattern of economic data for the last two quarters of last year was quite clear – stronger than expected growth driven by consumer spending and a resilient global economy. The relatively good figures for public finances reflect that picture as tax receipts are generally a lagging economic indicator. But the evidence from the data for the first month of this year is more uncertain. Retail sales growth is now clearly being squeezed by rising inflation. So far, a general rise in global inflation is the main reason for this. At 1.8%, UK headline inflation is in line with the eurozone and lower than in the US. But as we move thorough this year we should expect to see more imported inflation following the decline in sterling since late 2015. This is already showing up in the fact that manufacturing input costs are up more than 20% on a year ago. So UK inflation could quite soon move up towards 3% and possibly higher as these price rises come through to retailers and consumers. Meanwhile, the labour market data continues to point to slowing employment growth, even though unemployment remains historically very low. Manufacturing industry continues to record respectable growth, according to business surveys, but it is the services sector that dominates the pattern of employment growth in the UK. All this suggests the consumer will be much less supportive of growth this year than last, and this will add to the impact of increased uncertainty on investment spending. We could well see the first clear signs of this slowdown in the GDP figures for the first quarter of this year when they are available in a few months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/feb/17/white-house-national-guard-immigration-memo-not-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-17T22:26:08Z","webTitle":"White House on leaked memo: national guard swoop on migrants is not policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/17/white-house-national-guard-immigration-memo-not-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/feb/17/white-house-national-guard-immigration-memo-not-policy","fields":{"headline":"White House on leaked memo: national guard swoop on migrants is not policy","bodyText":"The White House has been forced to deny that a draft memo suggesting it considered mobilising 100,000 national guard troops to round up and deport unauthorised immigrants, including millions living nowhere near the Mexico border, is current administration policy. An 11-page draft memo obtained by the Associated Press calls for the unprecedented militarisation of immigration enforcement as far north as Portland, Oregon, and as far east as New Orleans, Louisiana. Governors in the 11 states named would have a choice regarding whether to have their guard troops participate, according to the memo, which was written by the US homeland security secretary, John Kelly, a retired four-star marine general. As Democrats condemned the proposal, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told journalists: “That is 100% not true. It is false. It is irresponsible to be saying this.” Using the present tense, he added: “There is no effort at all to round up, to utilise the national guard to round up illegal immigrants.” The Department for Homeland Security echoed this language. “The Department is not considering mobilising the national guard,” said the department’s acting press secretary, Gillian Christensen, in an email. But Spicer would not categorically state that such a roundup was never a subject of discussion at some level in the Trump administration. “I don’t know what could potentially be out there, but I know that there is no effort to do what is potentially suggested,” he said. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, as Trump headed to a Boeing plant in South Carolina, Spicer added: “It is not a White House document.” The AP’s document states that it is from Kelly and so would have originated from the Department of Homeland Security, not the White House. Later, the deputy press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, insisted that Kelly did not personally write the memo. “I don’t specifically know who put pen to paper but I know that it was not Secretary Kelly and it wasn’t at his direction,” she told reporters. Asked if the memo was written during the transition, Sanders added: “I’m not aware on the exact timeline on when it happened but what I do know is that this White House and this president has had no plans in any capacity to use the national guard to round up.” During last year’s presidential election campaign, Trump pledged to create a “deportation force” to deport the more than 11 million people living in the US illegally. While national guard personnel have been used to assist with immigration-related missions on the US-Mexico border before, they have never been used as broadly or as far north. The four states that border Mexico are included in the proposal – California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas – but it also encompasses seven states contiguous to those four: Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. Chuck Schumer, the leading Democrat in the Senate, called the possibility of the roundups “despicable”. “That would be one of the most un-American things that would happen in the last century and I just hope that it’s not true,” Schumer told reporters. “The fact that it might even be considered is appalling.” Democratic senator Kamala Harris of California added that the prospect of national guard members going door to door to check people’s documents was “deeply disturbing”, noting that the guard’s main responsibility was to help people in distress after natural disasters. “Deploying them for any other purpose is a severe mismanagement of resources, an abuse of executive power, and conjures images of Japanese internment camps and mass deportations of Mexican immigrants under President Eisenhower. I challenge Republicans and Democrats, whether they are members of Congress or governors, to condemn this plan and ensure it never sees the light of day.” The memo is addressed to the then acting heads of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and US Customs and Border Protection. It would have served as guidance to implement the wide-ranging executive order on immigration and border security that Trump signed on 25 January. Such memos are routinely issued to supplement executive orders. The draft document has circulated among DHS staff over the last two weeks. As recently as last Friday, staffers in several offices reported discussions were under way. If implemented, the impact could be significant. Nearly half of the 11.1 million people residing in the US without authorisation live in the 11 states, according to Pew Research Center estimates based on 2014 census data. Also on Friday Trump toured a Boeing facility in Charleston, South Carolina, where the company unveiled its new Dreamliner aircraft. “What an amazing piece of art, what an amazing piece of work,” said the president, who has previously clashed with Boeing over the costs of a new Air Force One. He was accompanied on the tour by his daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president. Trump slipped back into campaign mode as he told workers he had come to “celebrate jobs” and the return of manufacturing plants, a core message that was seen as crucial to his election victory. “All of a sudden they’re coming back, and they’re going to be very happy about it, believe me. As your president I’m going to do everything I can to unleash the power of the American spirit and put our great people back to work. This is our mantra: buy American and hire American.” Trump repeated his threat that any company that lays off American workers to move to abroad will face a “substantial penalty” when trying to sell their products in the US. “We are going to fight for every last American job,” he added. Companies were bringing jobs back “because the business climate has already changed”, he argued. “When there is a level playing field, American workers will always, always win. But we don’t have a level playing field. Very shortly you will have a level playing field again. Because when Americans workers win, America as a country wins big league.” He added: “From now on, it’s going to be America first.” The tour came a day after Trump’s first solo press conference as president, a wild 77 minutes littered with grievances and falsehoods and caused jaws to drop around the world. But not for the first time, while mainstream media were critical, some conservative outlets hailed it as a bravura performance. “Thank you for all of the nice statements on the Press Conference yesterday,” Trump tweeted on Friday. “Rush Limbaugh said one of greatest ever. Fake media not happy!” Limbaugh is a rightwing talkshow host fond of conspiracy theories who questioned whether Barack Obama was born in the US and eligible to be president. He said after the press conference: “Just what the doctor ordered. This is Donald Trump going over the head of the media right now to the American people. Advancing his domestic agenda and being totally transparent with these people.” Trump also tweeted about his search for a national security adviser to replace retired general Michael Flynn, forced to quit after 24 days because he misled officials over his discussion of sanctions with Russia’s ambassador to the US. In yet another setback, it emerged that Trump’s next choice, retired vice-admiral Robert Harward, had turned down the offer. Harward, a senior executive at Lockheed Martin, cited family and financial reasons for not taking the job, Reuters reported. Trump made no reference to this as he tweeted: “General Keith Kellogg, who I have known for a long time, is very much in play for NSA – as are three others.” Meanwhile it was reported on Friday that Trump has appointed Mike Dubke, founder of Crossroads Media, a conservative firm that specialises in political advertising, as White House communications director. Spicer had previously been doing the job in addition to being press secretary. Many see the post as unenviable in light of Trump’s freewheeling style and rapid-fire tweets.

Walker’s tardy response – “We kept these so long because we liked them so much … I wanted to buy them as a set” – could not disguise the polite rejection that followed. For three decades the stories kept the company of woodlice in a trunk where Collins’s forgotten manuscripts lay yellowing and undisturbed. Now, through happenstance and the determination of her daughter, readers may be as surprised as I was by the rich range of the seasoned literary voice – modern, confident, emotionally intelligent and humorous – that emerges from the pages of the posthumously published Whatever Happened to Interracial Love? The title of this collection poses a pertinent question: actually, whatever did become of the heady promise of interracial love amid the racial conflagrations of 1960s USA? The reality never lived up to the Hollywood fantasy of Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, in which Sidney Poitier’s “negro” doctor – with perfect manners, starched collar and ultra-clean fingernails – falls in love with a young white liberal woman. The suggestion that love might soften if not conquer differences between the races is echoed in the radical fervour of Collins’s characters. They include dilettantes (“everyone who is anyone will find at least one ‘negro’ to bring home to dinner”) and the committed – black and white people putting their bodies on the line, idealists who march, ride the freedom buses, and sometimes, in deliciously illicit affairs, lie down together. Many of the stories are inversions of Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, with young black female protagonists. These sexual and racial adventurers contravene social mores and upset their class-conscious relatives, whose aspirations for family members’ courtships and unions with the lighter-skinned do not extend to dangerous liaisons with white folk. Collins adopts an unflinching prose style, as bold as the character with “a cold longing weighted” between her legs who yearns for “a little light fucking” with a man who is not cursed “with a penis about the size of a pea”. But she also deftly complicates the perceived limits of free love in her description of a heroine tormented by memories of her partner unbuttoning himself in front of other women. The stories were written in the late 1960s and 70s, when black power exploded, and have a persistently delightful quality of spring awakening, with sassy flower-bedecked students in bell-bottomed trousers and rollneck sweaters. Their free spirits are contrasted with their anxious, middle-class fathers, for whom the revolution has come too soon, and who fret that by cutting off their carefully groomed hair, their expensively educated daughters are also severing opportunities for advancement – that they will become “just like any other coloured girl”. The pathos in these often thinly veiled biographical tales is reserved for this older generation. An energetic widowed undertaker, who “won’t sit still long enough to die”, shares the upbringing of his only child with a disapproving mother-in-law. An uncle is forever “broke but still so handsome and beautiful, lazy and generous”, his light skin a noble lie of possibilities that are never realised; his life, a long lament, closes as he “cried himself to death”. Collins taught film at the City College of New York, and some stories, cutting between scenes and characters, are rendered almost as film scripts, with the reader in place of the camera panning back and forth, adding subtle layers of inference and meaning. The stories speak to each other, eliding time, allowing characters who are versions of each other to reveal and deepen aspects hinted at previously. In defying convention with their interracial love, Collins’s headstrong black protagonists are far more vulnerable when love fails: they can’t go on, and yet there’s no going back. Exposed and humiliated, they find solace in the anonymity of the uncaring metropolis. “I relieved the outer edges of my sadness,” says a forsaken lover in one of the most poignant stories, “Interiors”, “letting it blend with the surf-like monotony of the cars splashing below the faint, luminescent splendour of the New York skyline.” Paul Valéry wrote that a work of art is never completed but abandoned. Collins’s health betrayed her art; she died from breast cancer aged 46 in 1988. But 30 years on, her abandoned stories seem fresh and distinctive and, in a new age of anxiety and crisis of identity, startlingly prescient. • Colin Grant’s Bageye at the Wheel is published by Vintage.

Mourinho takes Manchester United to Blackburn Rovers for Sunday’s fifth-round match. He is intent on fielding a strong XI and not “throwing it away” as he admits doing when Chelsea’s manager in a tie against Newcastle United. Mourinho selected a weakened side for that match in February 2005 as he was focusing on playing Barcelona in the Champions League and Liverpool in the League Cup final in the next two matches. Chelsea beat Barcelona over two legs and Liverpool but lost 1-0 to Newcastle. United have a similar schedule. After the trip to Ewood Park they are at St-Étienne for Wednesday’s Europa League last-32 second leg, then face Southampton in Sunday week’s EFL Cup final. Of the Newcastle game Mourinho said: “Yes, I threw it away. In the same week was the Champions League against Barcelona and the cup final against Liverpool and in the middle of it we had an FA Cup match against Newcastle and I threw it away. I gambled too much. “I focused too much on Barcelona and Liverpool. It was good because we beat Barcelona and won the final against Liverpool. So it was good. But the feeling that I threw it away was not good. So I don’t throw it away. If I lose, I lose because the opponent was better or because we didn’t play well but I am not going to throw it away. “We go to Blackburn with that respect. We already played Reading and Wigan from the Championship so the level is not new for us. Plus, it’s one thing at Old Trafford but another thing when you go away. So I go serious. I’m going to change a few players obviously. But I’m going with a good team and I respect the competition a lot. Man United demands that you go serious to every game.” Klopp fielded a particularly weak side that was beaten by Wolverhampton Wanderers at Anfield in the previous round. Although Mourinho did not speak directly about Klopp, regarding Cup upsets he said: “Maybe we don’t have as many English managers with that culture as we should. Maybe we foreign managers, not everybody studies and understands the culture of this country. “In my case, I had immediately, in my first time, that situation with the match at Newcastle. So for me it was a lesson. With Chelsea I lost against a League One or League Two team [later under his management] but I never threw it away. We lost because we lost. So I try always to go serious. I like Wembley. I like the FA Cup. So I have to try to get the second one. Normally upsets happen because of attitude. Because you think it’s easy and it’s not easy. Also, the lower leagues’ teams are getting better and better. “Sometimes we have to give some rest to some players. There are times when we have to give some players football. And sometimes the players who are not playing a lot, they are punished by that lack of minutes. It’s a combination of factors. We have to be alert because it’s never easy.” Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney missed Thursday’s 3-0 defeat of St-Étienne in the first leg at Old Trafford because of muscular issues. Mourinho said: “I want them to be fit for Blackburn, I want them to be ready. I am not sure they will be ready. Henrikh Mkhitaryan is ill. He stayed at home [for Thursday’s match]. Wednesday, he was feeling a little bit. The doctors were on it and hoping he would be ready but he was not ready. Let’s see.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/feb/26/lenin-the-dictator-victor-sebestyen-review-biography-russian-revolution-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-26T13:00:30Z","webTitle":"Lenin the Dictator by Victor Sebestyen review – the godfather of post-truth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/26/lenin-the-dictator-victor-sebestyen-review-biography-russian-revolution-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/feb/26/lenin-the-dictator-victor-sebestyen-review-biography-russian-revolution-politics","fields":{"headline":"Lenin the Dictator by Victor Sebestyen review – the godfather of post-truth","bodyText":"In the introduction to his new biography of Lenin, Victor Sebestyen describes the Russian leader as “the godfather of what commentators a century after his time describe as ‘post-truth politics’”.

There is a welcome emphasis on Lenin’s personal life, including his ménage à trois with his wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, and his mistress, Inessa Armand, and Sebestyen’s attention to historical detail is flawless.

Two of the tests are believed to concern a member of the club’s under-21 squad who had been called up to train with the first team, who are based at a different site. The other is understood to relate to an unnamed player who failed to provide details of his new home address, which resulted in a tester turning up to his former home.

Such are the fascinations of alternative history, a genre to which, in the world that we know, BBC1 remains free to contribute a five-part series, SS-GB, which, from 9pm on Sunday, visualises a Nazi-run London in 1941. The series is based on Len Deighton’s 1978 novel, which is one of a trio of the highest-profile fictionalisations of German victory, alongside Robert Harris’s Fatherland (1992) and Philip K Dick’s The Man in the High Castle (1962). The latter, coincidentally, is being dramatised by Amazon Prime, with a second season released last December and third commissioned. As Fatherland also became a TV show (in 1994), the Hitler-Alt-Hist shelf of the DVD store is becoming a little crowded. But, conveniently, while SS-GB, Fatherland and The Man in the High Castle make similar leaps of imagination, each lands in distinct geographical territory. Deighton imagines a conquered Britain, Harris a Berlin in which the Third Reich has survived into the 1960s, and Dick a 60s America ruled by the victorious Nazis and Japanese. Common to all these what-ifs is the visual shock of seeing swastika-clad red banners hanging from familiar buildings in London, Los Angeles or Berlin. In the TV SS-GB, another stunning double-take comes when a bureaucrat sticks on a letter a stamp that bears the head of Hitler rather than the King, a detail that echoes the nightmare-philatelic detail on Ray Hawkey’s design for the cover of Deighton’s book. Any fiction set in Britain after a Hitler victory raises a number of immediate questions. Was there a Holocaust of UK Jews? What happened to Churchill and the royal family? Who is the prime minister of the puppet government? And to what extent have German language and culture been imposed on the new subject population? One of the most shocking details in Deighton’s novel is that Churchill has been executed by the Germans, but, though this fact is verbally reported in the opening episode, it seems surprising that the drama did not opt to show the moment. The scrutiny of Britons for Jewish blood is chillingly shown, but other telling details in the book – the King imprisoned in the Tower of London and Princess Elizabeth exiled to New Zealand – are neither told nor shown in the first hour, during which we also learn nothing about the British government. Perhaps with an eye on audiences outside the UK, dramatists Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (regulars on recent Bond films) and director Philipp Kadelbach – as a German, an intriguing choice – have made what is largely a 1940s police procedural, in which Sam Riley, as Superintendent Douglas Archer of Scotland Yard, tries to investigate a murder while maintaining the Metropolitan police’s supposed neutrality from the SS. Hitler’s Britain of 1941 is, in many respects, surprisingly similar to George VI’s. The Gestapo may burst into pubs demanding that the punters show their papers, but we never find out if, on the hostelry menu, bratwurst have replaced bangers, or steins of lager have superseded pints of bitter. When Superintendent Archer listens to a record of an American blues singer, we are not told if the Nazi regime has attempted to racially censor music, as it did in Germany. Daily life is in the detail, but the drama paints broadly. There is some evidence that alternative history thrives at times of high political instability. Deighton’s novel was published at a time of fears in the UK of extremism on the right and left. (A few years later, Frederick Forsyth’s The Fourth Protocol envisaged the UK as a Soviet puppet state.) Now, the TV versions of SS-GB and The Man in the High Castle go out at a time when democracy is so unpredictable that the latest season of Homeland has inadvertently wandered into the Alt-Hist genre by featuring a female US president who seems to have been created in expectation of a Hillary Clinton victory. A particular power of television, though, is to make the alternative present or past look as real as film or memories of the actual history. And it is in this area that SS-GB needs to deliver more in future episodes. The series may leave viewers with their own what-ifs, imagining an alternative production with the budget to show fully the architecture and culture of a Nazi-run London, and the editorial audacity to picture Churchill shot and George VI imprisoned. • This article was amended on 21 February 2017.

I was present and, as part of the often unheard middle ground, was one of the house of laity who voted against taking note of the report. Though there has been a lot of interpretation and claims that this particular debate was about whether the church should endorse same-sex marriage, it was not. There is no realistic prospect of such a debate for some time. There is just too much work yet to be done, even in the Church in England, let alone in the wider Anglican Communion. Make no mistake, it weighs especially heavily with the bishops that if there had been such a vote then there would have been a cataclysmic falling in of the roof. But I, and other members of synod who are not signed-up members of anything other than God’s church, felt that the tone of the report showed a desire to kick the matter into the long grass, probably well into the next synod quinquennium. The matter is just too much in the here and now for that to be good enough. Even knowing that it will still take time and much debate, we really do need to make clear that we are determined to move forward in our understanding of marriage, sexuality and several other matters of similar sensitivity with some expedition. I doubt if anyone reacted to the archbishop’s final speech with anything other than a continued admiration for his love and determination, not least to ensure that all people – regardless of colour, class, wealth, social status or, yes, sexuality – are respected fully on a genuine, not mere token, equal basis. I may have voted against but this has done absolutely nothing for my growing admiration for Justin’s leadership and his clear authority both in the House of Bishops, in synod, in the wider church and not least in the community as a whole. Mike Todd General Synod of the Church of England • The decision to refuse to take note of the bishops’ report on marriage and same-sex relationships presents an opportunity for courage, something that is in short supply in the Church of England. I have been lucky in knowing Una Kroll, one of the pioneers of women priests and much else. She was part of the team in my parish in south London. Then at St James Piccadilly, where I was rector, Archbishop Trevor Huddleston lived in the rectory. Both could be difficult. Both had courage in bucketfuls. So it’s time for those bishops who are personally dismayed by the report to find that sort of courage, and be ready to break ranks and marry and ordain LGBT men and women. Why not?

The work, Return to Love Canal, is about a couple who move back to the site of a devastating environmental disaster. Pollack’s reply is the very essence of short shrift. “Nobody wants to produce a play about a couple that moved back to Love Canal! Nobody wants to pay 20 dollars to see people living next to chemical waste! They can see that in New Jersey.” Oof. Argue with that and stay fashionable. I keep being reminded of it every time another media outlet leads its Trump coverage with Donald Trump’s attacks on media outlets. Guys! Nobody cares how mean he was to journalists! Well, some people do – but not in the way you want. In the wrestling match they’re enjoying, the media is definitely the heel. Yet on the self-dramatisation goes, in a news market hardly short of alternative stories. I keep reading that Trump has “turned on the media”, to which the only reasonably response is: really? Which way was he facing before? Before we continue, I should say that I am aware of the irony of using a column in the media to implore the media to stop focusing so much on the media. Still, if it falls to me to look like a silly billy, it’d hardly be the first time. In the humble service of home truths, I simply question the wisdom of headlines like: “Journalists, battered and groggy, find a renewed sense of mission” – an effort possibly crafted to put the experience of going down a rust-belt mine into some sort of perspective. Even so, I haven’t felt this naggingly uneasy since I read Tom Cruise’s attorney claim his movie shoots were akin to being deployed to Afghanistan. We are now four weeks into the Trump administration, to say nothing of his earlier election campaign, and you may find yourself just about on the point of divining how the president feels about the media. Indeed, many averagely bright children of eight are across this one. There are uncontacted Amazon tribes among whom the putdown “fake news!” is already regarded as hackneyed. Perhaps it’s time to ease off on news of Trump’s latest “unprecedented attack on the media”, on the basis that it is not only increasingly precedented, but is rapidly becoming so familiar that it is barely even news. Whatever the frisson of being insulted by the president may feel like to the reporters it’s happening to, it’s not the most important thing to anyone else. Just because the troll moved into the White House, it doesn’t mean the advice about handling him became suddenly invalid. Don’t feed him. On the most basic tactical level, getting everyone to talk about the media is a war of attrition in which Trump is the sole beneficiary. He aims to exhaust – and divert. What aren’t we talking about when we talk about the media? Take your pick: Russia, China, staggering conflicts of interest, corruption allegations, the security protocols in the terrace restaurant at Mar-a-Lago – just don’t call it “the Winter White House” – the two-state solution, the Republicans’ chilling decision (virtually buried after the press conference pyrotechnics) to bar members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus from a meeting with immigration and customs enforcement to discuss the raids and round-ups of undocumented immigrants. And more – so much more! In a staggeringly crowded field of things that are under attack, the media needs to downgrade itself – not least because doing so will make it stronger. For my money, the most successful passage in Trump’s malarial press conference on Thursday came when NBC’s Peter Alexander pressed and pressed him on the detail of his lie that he won the biggest electoral margin since Ronald Reagan. The blow was landed. The lies are important; Trump’s endless media duck hunt is the distraction. The Soviet-born writer Peter Pomerantsev finds the new White House’s tactics with the media eerily familiar, having watched them deployed by Putin’s Kremlin for years. Back in December, he had a stark message based on experience. “A lot of liberal America is inspired right now, and I can just see it falling into the same trap that the Russian liberals fell into. Russian liberals are in an echo chamber. They’re not reaching the people they’re supposed to reach. So the Kremlin gets to define them. Remember – your echo chamber is a trap. You need to be going out of your comfort zone to at least reach the people who are sitting on the fence.” Journalists, he added, needed to “reinvent journalism so it doesn’t just involve us talking to ourselves”. Or, worse, about ourselves. It is often said that a spin doctor becoming the story is a wake-up call – journalists becoming the story is surely an even more cautionary one. Of course, it’s tempting to get sucked in when the White House puts its top guys on the media beat. I see in the Washington Post that Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been complaining about CNN coverage to its chief executive for the second time, with particular reference to two pundits. One of them, the majestic Ana Navarro, duly responded at the perfect length: “Really, Little Jared complaining about me cuz I get under President Daddy-in-Law’s skin? Oh, baby boy, I’m so sorry. Little boy Kushner, tough guy who’s supposed to achieve Middle East peace, is complaining about me to CNN. Boo-hoo!” Well quite. A few lines communicating her deep sense of personal shame and anguish about the criticism, and immediately back to the real issue: what are you doing about the Middle East peace process, Jared? Because we’d rather not be sidetracked by your eminently discountable TV criticism. It would be nice to think that a version of this approach be adopted industry-wide. However self-deprecating and counterintuitive it may feel, media outlets could communicate just how little of a toss they give about Trump’s characterisation of them by mostly ignoring it. We know he applies the label “fake news” to everything he dislikes, everything he disagrees with, everything that gets to him, and everything that makes fun of him. So we don’t have to keep giving space to his every honk of the phrase."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/feb/17/dylan-hartley-england-rugby-steve-borthwick-jamie-george","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-17T22:00:22Z","webTitle":"Steve Borthwick defends under-pressure Dylan Hartley’s England form","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/17/dylan-hartley-england-rugby-steve-borthwick-jamie-george","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/feb/17/dylan-hartley-england-rugby-steve-borthwick-jamie-george","fields":{"headline":"Steve Borthwick defends under-pressure Dylan Hartley’s England form","bodyText":"Dylan Hartley’s performances for England in the Six Nations so far have been staunchly defended by the forwards coach, Steve Borthwick, who has backed his “brilliant captain” despite a groundswell of support for Jamie George to replace him at hooker. Borthwick also confirmed James Haskell is fit to make his first England start since last June after impressive showings off the bench against France and Wales. Hartley trained with the first team at an open training session at Twickenham on Friday in an indication that he may keep his place against Italy a week on Sunday. Hartley missed three tackles and made six against Wales last weekend while George, who came on after 46 minutes, made twice that number. George’s form for Saracens and from the bench for Eddie Jones has put him in contention for a place on the British &amp; Irish Lions tour, despite him never having started for England. But asked how George’s expectations were being managed, Borthwick said: “Everybody is desperate to play for England. Jamie has done well. Dylan has been fantastic. The level of his performance has been excellent. I coach those players very, very closely. I think it is an enviable position that lots of people would look at. “We have two top quality players competing for that position and in Dylan we have a brilliant captain. I don’t just mean match day, I mean every minute of every day he has been a brilliant captain for us.” As well as his 12 tackles, George, who has 14 England caps, all from the bench, made eight carries to Hartley’s five in Cardiff but Borthwick pointed to other statistics as evidence of his captain’s performance levels. “If you look at the way that the England scrum has gone in the first part of the Six Nations I think that it has been excellent and Dylan has been a central factor in driving that,” said Borthwick. “I can talk to you about the accuracy of his lineout throwing which I measure and it’s been excellent. The diligence that he’s put into that aspect of his game to improve that. “You’ve got to look at the influence that you also have on the game and the influence that you have on the players around you. Dylan has been very impactful at that. Dylan’s impact upon this team is incredibly positive. “Some of the best players, the best players in this team, in any team that I’ve ever been involved in, they have a positive effect on others around them. So people play better because they are there. We have players like that and I have played with players like that in my career.” Haskell, meanwhile, has not been deemed ready to start against either France or Wales after coming into the tournament with less than an hour’s rugby under his belt this season but, according to Borthwick, is ready to retake the No7 jersey a week tomorrow. Asked if Haskell was ready to play 80 minutes, Borthwick said: “I’ve no doubt he can. I think he’s proven with everything he’s done that he’s pushing, as they all are, to get into this starting team.” Jones confirmed after the victory over Wales, in which his “finishers” played a crucial role from the bench for the second week running, that he would make changes in personnel against Italy. During the training session on Friday – attended by Prince Harry, the RFU’s patron, and watched by 12,000 spectators – the indications were that Ben Te’o is set for a first England start at inside-centre with Owen Farrell moving to fly-half. Jonny May and Jack Nowell are in the running for the wing positions with Mike Brown at full-back – Anthony Watson did not take part in the main training session, instead doing his own sprint work. “Anthony’s returning from injury and looked very good today,” said Borthwick. “I’ve not spoken to anybody in terms of what he did today but he looked to be running very well. He’s been training very hard throughout this week.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/17/jeremy-corbyn-simon-fletcher-campaigns-director-quits-to-pursue-other-projects","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-17T17:15:29Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn's campaigns director quits to pursue other projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/17/jeremy-corbyn-simon-fletcher-campaigns-director-quits-to-pursue-other-projects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/17/jeremy-corbyn-simon-fletcher-campaigns-director-quits-to-pursue-other-projects","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn's campaigns director quits to pursue other projects","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn’s campaigns director, Simon Fletcher, once one of his closest advisers and a key architect of his leadership victory, has left to pursue other projects. Fletcher, a former aide to Ed Miliband, led Corbyn’s campaign to become Labour leader in 2015. He was a senior adviser to Ken Livingstone as London mayor and one of the most powerful people in City Hall. Sources suggested Fletcher had been feeling restless in his position as campaigns chief, after being moved from his previous job as Corbyn’s chief of staff last June and replaced by Karie Murphy. Fletcher’s role was to provide “direction, advice, planning and delivery of campaigns, and our message on Jeremy’s behalf throughout the organisation, including preparations for the general election”. In a statement confirming his departure, Fletcher said: “Working for Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership campaign and in the leader of the opposition’s office in parliament has been a huge privilege. “I have worked with Jeremy for well over two decades and I will continue to support him and his leadership of the Labour party, and look forward to working together for many years to come.” Corbyn released a statement thanking Fletcher. “Simon has played a vital role in shaping the new politics and building Labour’s campaign to rebuild and transform Britain,” he said. “I’ve known Simon for many years and we will continue to work together on the cause of social justice in Britain, and I wish him well in the future.” Fletcher is the second former Livingstone aide to depart from Corbyn’s office in just over a year. The veteran Labour campaigner Neale Coleman quit as head of policy and rebuttal in January 2016, amid reports of Labour infighting. Coleman was later hired by the Labour leadership challenger Owen Smith to be his chief policy adviser during last summer’s election. Corbyn’s head of media, Kevin Slocombe, among those hired by Fletcher, also stepped down last year to oversee communications for the Bristol mayor, Marvin Rees. Unite’s political director, Anneliese Midgley, Fletcher’s former deputy, was among those mourning his departure on Friday afternoon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/feb/17/trump-media-press-relationship-history","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-17T18:32:34Z","webTitle":"Shooting the messenger: how Trump's media vitriol could ultimately backfire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/17/trump-media-press-relationship-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/feb/17/trump-media-press-relationship-history","fields":{"headline":"Shooting the messenger: how Trump's media vitriol could ultimately backfire","bodyText":"Though it was ostensibly called to announce his new nominee for the Department of Labor, Donald Trump’s 77-minute freewheeling press conference on Thursday spent little time on the matter. Instead, speaking to a room of reporters who repeatedly sought to clarify when and if Trump staffers had had contact with Russians, he recast the event as a referendum on reporters everywhere. The president claimed that the media served not the people but “special interests”, reaping profits from a rigged system, and he sought to tar the press as universally untrustworthy. “The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. The press are out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control,” he said. He launched aggressive broadsides at individual journalists, as when Trump asked black journalist April Ryan if she would schedule a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus for him. “Are they friends of yours?” he said. And Trump referred to the media as an entrenched “power structure” and vowed to go around it entirely. “We’re not going to let it happen. I’m here again to take my message straight to the people,” he said. Every president fights with the press at some point. But the hostile dynamic Trump has established with his own press corps is without historical precedent, say political science scholars and journalists. “This level of public vitriol directed at the news media by the president is unprecedented in American history,” said Mark Feldstein, a former CNN correspondent and professor of journalism at the University of Maryland. “No president has ever declared war and given such loud voice to that unhappiness in his very first week. Actually, his very first day,” said George Condon, a former president of the White House Correspondents Association who spent a career covering presidents. Trump’s White House has been off to a rocky start. Less than a month into his tenure, during what is traditionally a honeymoon period, Trump has the lowest approval ratings of any recent president at this point. His former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is the shortest-serving in history after being forced out following an inappropriate discussion with the Russian ambassador. And Trump’s cabinet is one of the slowest to be filled in history. Trump is blaming the media for these failings as the bearer of bad news, not its creator, said Frank Sesno, a veteran former journalist who runs the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. “It is not the media that made the call to the Russians. It is not the media that apparently lied to the vice-president. It is not the media that prompted six Republicans to tank the labor secretary nominee. It’s not the media that ruled against the immigration ban,” Sesno said. “Instead, he’s isolating, accusing, distracting, demonizing and blaming others.” “The media is the messenger and what we saw … is he’s willing to try to discredit them by any means necessary,” said the Dartmouth political science professor Brendan Nyhan, who studies the interaction of politics and the media. The American fourth estate has endured through difficult moments. Sedition acts passed under presidents John Adams in the late 18th century and Woodrow Wilson in the early 20th made it a criminal offense to criticize the government. But these situations – the instability of the nascent American government and world war, respectively – are without parallel in modern times. And neither president ever stooped to publicly attacking the press the way Trump does, Feldstein said. “They did not seem obsessed with the issue. They viewed these as emergency measures that were necessary to protect national security.” Feldstein, who wrote the book on Richard Nixon’s toxic relationship with the press, said Trump should see a warning in Nixon, who similarly treated the press with contempt. “That gained him some mileage when running for office and appealed to the Republican party at the time,” said Feldstein. “But ultimately he was impaled on that kind of paranoid bunker mentality and I think Trump risks the same happening to him.” Trump’s hostility toward the press did not start with his inauguration. As a candidate, he held the media in pens during his rallies, urged supporters to boo reporters, threatened to “open up” libel laws to make it easier to sue journalists, and regularly banned entire outlets from his events on a whim. But the “pivot” pundits predicted when Trump became president has yet to materialize , even after he took the oath of office last month. Trump’s media obsession is often dismissed as a sign of his poor temperament. But it’s also a political strategy that allows him to change the subject of debate from one of substance to matters of tribal allegiance, according to Nyhan. “This is the conversation Trump wants to have,” said Nyhan. “There is a method to his madness.” Trump’s re-election campaign even fundraised using the press conference, telling supporters in an email that they were the “last line of defense” against the media. People tell pollsters that they hate Congress but keep re-electing their individual representatives, and the same can be said of journalism. People hate “the media ”, but are loyal to individual outlets and reporters. By taking on the media as a whole, Nyhan noted, Trump has a built-in advantage – an individual versus a unpopular institution. “It’s a massive problem that I don’t think we’re really grasping with as an institution,” said a White House reporter who declined to be named out of fear of retribution from Trump officials. So how can journalists respond? According to Sesno, the former CNN anchor turned academic, journalists need to do a better job of explaining their value and process. For instance, Trump has painted leakers as vile and unpatriotic. But the press should also defend them as whistleblowers who help hold government accountable. “How do we explain that leaks are part of the process of both journalism and democracy?” he said. It also means stepping back and admitting some of journalism’s problems, Sesno said, such as elitism and a lack of connection with, for instance, rural white working-class voters. Feldstein thought there was reason for Trump to reconsider his strategy, too. To explain, he cited the old adage : “Never pick a fight with people who buy ink by the barrel.” “Ultimately the media does have the last word,” Feldstein said, “including literally writing his obituary when he dies. So there are long-term costs he will face for his approach.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/feb/24/english-animals-by-laura-kaye-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-24T15:00:35Z","webTitle":"English Animals by Laura Kaye review – romantic tensions and taxidermy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/24/english-animals-by-laura-kaye-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/feb/24/english-animals-by-laura-kaye-review","fields":{"headline":"English Animals by Laura Kaye review – romantic tensions and taxidermy","bodyText":"Given the extent of the economic migration from eastern Europe to Britain since the opening of labour markets in 2004, and the debates about freedom of movement across Europe that have continued to dominate the political agenda since the Brexit referendum, it is perhaps surprising that the experiences of these new arrivals have not been more thoroughly explored in fiction, at least in English. There are some notable exceptions – Rose Tremain’s The Road Home and the slyly comic novels of Marina Lewycka, herself the daughter of Ukrainian refugees – but for the most part their stories have remained untold, surfacing in print only as news bulletins and statistics. I had high hopes, therefore, for Laura Kaye’s debut novel. Mirka is a 19-year-old from Slovakia who has broken with her family and come to England to make a new life. After a stint at a fast food restaurant in London she accepts an agency job as an “assistant” to Richard and Sophie Parker at Fairmont Hall, a decaying country house in the middle of nowhere. The only stipulation made by her future employers is that she is not squeamish about touching dead animals. Mirka assumes she will be a cook or perhaps an au pair, but when she arrives she discovers that the couple have no children. She has been hired to help in Richard’s latest money-making scheme: a taxidermy business. Initially as unnerved by the dead bodies of the animals as she is by the Parkers’ drunkenness and dubious hygiene, Mirka is gradually drawn deeper into Richard and Sophie’s lives. The pair have a stormy relationship and it clearly suits them to have Mirka there to defuse the tension and give them each someone else to talk to. Mirka is a hard worker, cooperative and uncomplaining. She helps with the weddings that Sophie organises at the house. She even turns out to be something of a whizz at taxidermy. Soon she is pursuing her own projects, creating elaborate tableaux of animals dressed in human clothing which find an enthusiastic market in London. Everything seems to be going swimmingly until Mirka falls in love with Sophie and discovers, to her shock, that her feelings might just be reciprocated. The novel is a strange hybrid, both determinedly contemporary and oddly old-fashioned. Sophie and Richard are chaotic, good-hearted Sloanes in the Jilly Cooper tradition: they drink vast amounts, organise pheasant shoots, adore their dogs, live in borderline squalor, and enjoy nothing more than a party where they and their friends can dress up in hilarious costumes (used Tampax, anyone?). They are also, despite some of their more preposterous excesses, very real. Kaye has an ear for convincing dialogue, and Sophie, in particular, is vividly imagined. Lonely and bored in the depths of the countryside, she is restless in her marriage and hungry for excitement and attention. Where Kaye falls frustratingly short is in her characterisation of Mirka. The book’s blurb draws comparisons between English Animals and such classic novels as I Capture the Castle and Cold Comfort Farm, but, although all three books share a young female protagonist, Mirka Komárova has little in common with intelligent, spirited Cassandra Mortmain or the indomitable Flora Poste. Unlike her fellow chroniclers of anarchic country life, she is a shadowy, indistinct character. Early in the novel we learn that she is gay, that she left Slovakia at least partly because of her mother’s refusal to accept her sexuality, and that she has already had a relationship with a much older woman. Through the next 300 pages we discover almost nothing more. When life with the Parkers startles her, which it frequently does, Mirka offers us no comparisons with her old life, no insight into the tensions and complications of leaving one’s country and beginning again somewhere else. She appears to have come to England with nothing, not even herself. This problem is compounded by her shortcomings as a narrator. While Cassandra is not unreasonably condemned by an adversary as a “nasty noticing child”, Mirka’s observations tend towards the surface of things. Her descriptions of the England she encounters are precise rather than perspicacious, full of details that never quite become truths. Perhaps if the book were driven by a page turner of a plot this sketchiness would have mattered less. As it is, the absence of a living, breathing protagonist robs it of its heart. English Animals resembles too much the taxidermy “scenes’ Mirka takes so much time and trouble creating, a painstakingly assembled facsimile of life rather than life itself. • Clare Clark’s latest novel is We That Are Left (Vintage).

The Stop Trump coalition has hired a permanent staff member to coordinate protest efforts, with £16,000 raised via crowdfunding and £10,000 donated by the trade union Unison. The demonstration on Monday is expected to draw more than 10,000 people. It will coincide with a parliamentary debate on a petition signed by 1.8 million people calling for the state visit to be cancelled in order to avoid embarrassment for the Queen. In an official response rejecting the petition, the government said Trump should still be extended the “full courtesy” of a state visit. Organisers said the protests, which they hope will last several days and follow Trump throughout his UK visit, would also “hold up a mirror to our own society” over the post-Brexit rise in hate crime and anti-immigrant rhetoric. “Our hope is that this mass movement can swing public opinion on a range of issues in a way that progressives have never managed before, and on issues on which we have been losing for decades,” the group’s spokesman said. Several of the UK’s largest unions have given their backing to the march, including Unison, GMB and the National Union of Students. Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green party politicians will attend the protest on Monday and have leant their support to future demonstrations, organisers said. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: “The planned state visit should clearly be cancelled and the invitation binned. It’s no wonder that almost 2 million people have signed a petition against the visit, and I’m proud that so many of my constituents have joined that call. “On Monday evening I will be joining thousands of others in calling out Trump’s Islamophobia and racism and making clear that we expect our government to stand up to bigotry, not meekly back away from confronting it.” Several organisers involved in the leftwing Labour movement Momentum are key organisers of the demonstration, as is the Guardian columnist and activist Owen Jones. Charities who have given official backing include Friends of the Earth and Global Justice Now, as well as smaller UK groups such as Sisters Uncut and Bridges Not Walls, which organised anti-Trump banner drops on dozens of UK bridges including Westminster bridge on the day of the US president’s inauguration. Organisers say the coalition is not controlled by one dominant organisation. “This is a new kind of coalition, not run by any group or controlled by a central leadership, and committed to a real diversity of tactics,” the group’s spokesman said. Monday’s rally in Parliament Square will hear from speakers including Lucas, Labour’s Rushanara Ali and the comedian Shappi Khorsandi, who came to Britain as a child refugee from Iran. Other more explicitly leftwing speakers include the former Respect leader Salma Yaqoob and the NUS president, Malia Bouattia, who attracted some controversy after her election for comments about the influence of “Zionist-led media outlets”. Monday’s protest is a joint effort with the movement One Day Without Us, promoting the rights of migrants and refugees, which organisers said had been brought into sharp focus by several measures in the first month of Trump’s presidency – the Mexican border wall, a travel ban from seven Muslim-majority countries and a halt to funding for NGOs that provide family planning services. Kate Allen, UK director of Amnesty International, which is another NGO backing the coalition protests, said: “Some of our worst fears over what a Donald Trump presidency might lead to have already been realised. “In the end the point isn’t whether Donald Trump gets the full-blown UK state visit treatment, it’s whether we raise our voice against this disastrous rollback of rights. It’s a major human rights fight, and one we can’t afford to lose.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/feb/13/john-waters-on-multiple-maniacs-reissue","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-13T09:00:09Z","webTitle":"John Waters: ‘A new kind of anarchy is going to happen next’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/13/john-waters-on-multiple-maniacs-reissue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/feb/13/john-waters-on-multiple-maniacs-reissue","fields":{"headline":"John Waters: ‘A new kind of anarchy is going to happen next’","bodyText":"John Waters, the iconic director famously known as the Pope of Trash or the Prince of Puke, has never been one to shy away from a spectacle. When we meet in London’s West End, where he’s recovering from seeing both parts of the Harry Potter play (he’s not a fan himself, he says, but he went with a friend), he’s in a bright purple suit, that famous pencil-thin moustache still present, as it has been since he was a teenager. “I dressed just for you,” he purrs. He’s 70 now and has been in the business for six decades. Among the many outrageous moments in his movies, his legacy will always be the infamous ending of his 1972 classic Pink Flamingos, which sees Divine – his friend and, until his death in 1988, his regular star – devouring a dog turd on camera. Waters remains as cheerfully provocative as ever but, in the aftermath of the US election, even he is wrestling with how to tell new jokes. “I’m struggling to think of something funny to say, as all comedians are,” he admits. “I hate liberals who say: ‘I’m leaving the country.’ Oh, like it’s going to matter. You’re not that important, go ahead. But the only thing I can think that’s positive is that a new kind of anarchy is going to happen next.” Waters has long been associated with a countercultural spirit. His early films in particular usually focused on gangs of outlaws marauding around his home town of Baltimore causing merry criminal chaos. But the re-release of one of his earliest feature films, 1970’s Multiple Maniacs, feels particularly prescient today, offering a snapshot of a time in which the US was in the midst of a wave of domestic terrorist attacks, student uprisings and protests. “You forget, there were skyjackings every day,” he recalls. Multiple Maniacs was made on a $5,000 budget, a loan from Waters’s father, and it was the only one of his movies that his mother never saw. You can see why: its wild, sprawling plot, if you can call it that, involves the lawless adventures of an acting troupe of hippies and culminates in Divine being raped by a giant lobster. At 100% approval, it is Waters’s highest-rating film on Rotten Tomatoes. “When I look at it today, it’s like: ‘What were you thinking?’” he laughs. “I will be the first to say that it is ridiculous.” Ridiculous it may be – by his own admission “the camerawork looks terrible”, and when people forgot their lines, he just kept rolling – but, for all of its chaos, it’s a surprisingly familiar and timely picture of growing activism, anti-establishment sentiment and youth rebellion. The film was shot towards the end of 1969, the most radical year in the 20th century, Waters reckons. “It was right before everything ended. Woodstock, Altamont, the Manson murders. It was a movie to comically go against the hippy values.” In Multiple Maniacs, the hippies are part of a travelling roadshow called Lady Divine’s Cavalcade of Perversion. Human exhibits include a gerontophile, a woman with hairy armpits, and “two actual queers, kissing each other”. Early in the story, the gang kidnap the Cavalcade’s “straight” audience, tie them up and forcibly inject them with drugs. Waters recalls one screening where this went down particularly well. “The first time we had the premiere of the restored version was at the Provincetown film festival and this guy came over and said: ‘Acid must have been pretty good back then.’ And it was! People I know did shoot up acid. Even I never did that. Shooting up acid is really radical.” I didn’t know you could. “Oh yeah. You pull it right out of you at the height of the trip. Talk about a rush. My mother always said: ‘Don’t tell young people that stuff.’ And now I’m telling the Guardian!” He looks delighted. Waters says he has watched Multiple Maniacs with young people after its recent restoration and it still resonates. “I’m not saying it hasn’t dated; it’s dated in way that it might be more appalling today than it was then. It was a punk rock movie. I look back on it now and think: ‘Oh my God, all this stuff about killing cops – not even the most radical group would say anything like that today.’ And you forget, in the 60s, ‘Off The Pig’ was a common slogan on a march, which is shocking today to look back on.” However, he feels that the humour of radical groups from that era, such as the Weathermen, is the key to finding a new radicalism today. “These are political activists who use humour as terrorism to mortify your opponent. We need that again, and with Trump we’ll probably get it. He’d be an easy person to do it to because he has a short fuse.” Waters says you could still have a Cavalcade of Perversion. What would be in it? “See transgenders in the bathroom! Or see the President of America! I hate reality television. I don’t think I’ve ever watched a reality show, ever, and now we have one.” He never watched The Apprentice? “Never. No! I hated him before. I hate a hopper. A hair-hopper is someone who pretends they’re rich, who really wasn’t brought up very wealthy but now tries to brag that they’re rich, and they spend too much time on their hair.” He doesn’t watch television himself (he reads instead, though says: “I know I’m missing something good”) and yet Waters has had a number of TV development deals in the works. Sadly for fans, none have yet come to fruition and he hasn’t made a feature film since 2004’s A Dirty Shame because it didn’t make enough money. “That’s fair, that’s what Hollywood’s about,” he shrugs. Has he thought about crowdfunding? He looks mortified. “I own three homes. Am I gonna go out and say: ‘Send me $10?’” Well, rich people often do. “I’m against that. I have too much money to panhandle. They all want you to make a movie for under a million dollars, which I don’t want to. I don’t want to be a faux radical film-maker at 70. I did that. I don’t need to do it again. I can make a movie for $5m, which used to be a routinely low, independent movie, but there’s no such thing as that any more.” But, he says, “I’d make a movie again if they said yes.” In 1988, Waters had a bona fide hit with Hairspray; it has since spawned so many offshoots that it’s practically an industry of its own. “They change it each time, and that’s why it works each time, hopefully,” he says. “As long as they don’t make a new version exactly like what came before, and don’t change it. That’s when it will stop.” There was the John Travolta-starring 2007 Hollywood remake; a hugely successful stage musical; and a recent live television adaptation in the US, on NBC. But a more surprising part of his legacy has come in the form of an inspirational quote, which has found its way on to posters, memes, T-shirts, mugs and even tapestries: “If you go home with somebody and they don’t have books, don’t fuck them.” “It did catch on!” he laughs. He says he’s seen it everywhere. “At the Strand bookshop in New York, there’s an entire display of it! I don’t mind that they did it. Sort of I did. They censored it! They don’t say fuck!” The key letters are starred out. “That’s what infuriated me!” He mentions that a friend of his, the drag queen Lady Bunny, called him out on its veracity. “She said: ‘I thought he [Waters] liked criminals?’ I believe in my own words, but maybe I don’t always practise what I preach.” He laughs again, and offers up a sequel. “Basically, if they’re cute enough, who’s looking at the library?” Multiple Maniacs is in UK cinemas from Friday 17 February and available to buy on Blu-ray from Monday 20 March"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/feb/08/irish-border-checks-impossible-after-brexit-says-ambassador-daniel-mulhall","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-08T15:17:12Z","webTitle":"Irish border checks will be impossible after Brexit, says ambassador","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/08/irish-border-checks-impossible-after-brexit-says-ambassador-daniel-mulhall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/feb/08/irish-border-checks-impossible-after-brexit-says-ambassador-daniel-mulhall","fields":{"headline":"Irish border checks will be impossible after Brexit, says ambassador","bodyText":"Comprehensive customs and border checks between Ireland and Northern Ireland are not remotely possible, the Irish ambassador to the UK has said, predicting the EU will recognise the unique nature of the border when Brexit causes the UK to leave both the single market and customs union. Theresa May dealt a blow to Ireland in her Brexit white paper when she said she wanted in effect to leave the EU customs union, confirming Brexit poses a huge threat to frictionless cross-border trade on the island of Ireland, the mainstay of the Irish economy. But giving evidence to the Northern Ireland select committee, Daniel Mulhall said there were signs that Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, would recognise that the issue of UK-Irish cross-border trade had to be treated as a special local case. He welcomed Barnier’s suggestion that the Irish border issue be addressed upfront in the coming talks, rather than included in wider horse trading at the end. But he acknowledged the UK and Ireland would not be able legally to negotiate a bilateral customs deal. His admission that physical border checks are impossible puts the onus on the EU showing flexibility, or developing technology to check goods to see if duties are payable. The EU is caught in a bind of needing to protect the integrity of the single market and customs union, yet prevent a new regime of a hard border and heavy customs checks in Northern Ireland. Some legal experts have said such a special deal is legally inconceivable, and the Irish government is being over-optimistic that it can prevent a potentially damaging blow to its economy. Pointing to the scale of required border checks, Mulhall said that at present there were more than 200 crossing points on the borders, with 177,000 lorries crossing a month, 208,000 vans and 1.85m cars. He said: “I don’t think it is even remotely possible to think in terms of having a border that would really control every movement of goods and people across that border. This is a border that is invisible. It is different from most other borders that our European partners might be familiar with.” The UK’s decision to be outside the EU common external tariff is raising logistical nightmares since, in theory, the border could become a back door for smuggling and trading. The UK has been looking at solutions, such as joint border checks with Ireland or greater use of technology to undertake automatic border customs checks. Mulhall said many options were being studied. Mulhall argued the UK-Ireland border was unique in the EU since no product could subsequently enter the EU except through the Channel tunnel, by air or across the sea. Mulhall said there was a need to be creative and make allowances to accommodate the unique situation. But he insisted he had not got the impression his diplomatic colleagues were “trying to put a spanner in the works and make life difficult for Ireland”. He also insisted retaining a common travel area would not blow a hole in the border controls of the EU or the UK. He argued there would be no motive for EU citizens to try to infiltrate the UK labour market via Ireland, undermining UK border controls, since they would be unable to work legally in the UK. They would find it easier and cheaper to get into the UK directly via Stansted. It would be “complete anathema” and “a turning back of the clock” to have controls on the free movement of people across the border. He said: “I do not underestimate the difficulties because it has never been done before and it is extremely complex to reconcile 27 views. There is always potential for things to go awry.” But he wanted to scotch the idea that the EU sought to punish the UK for its aberrant behaviour. Both the taoiseach, Enda Kenny, and May have expressed confidence that the common travel area between Britain and Ireland will survive unchanged after Brexit but warned of “very negative consequences” if there was a return to a hard border with Northern Ireland. The prime minister has also promised the border will be as seamless and frictionless as possible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/feb/12/syria-and-the-film-maker-documentary-last-men-in-aleppo-white-helmets-city-of-ghosts","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-12T09:30:03Z","webTitle":"Shooting Syria: documentaries from the most dangerous place on earth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/12/syria-and-the-film-maker-documentary-last-men-in-aleppo-white-helmets-city-of-ghosts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/feb/12/syria-and-the-film-maker-documentary-last-men-in-aleppo-white-helmets-city-of-ghosts","fields":{"headline":"Shooting Syria: documentaries from the most dangerous place on earth","bodyText":"Wars are defined by the way they are covered. In the 1930s, it was the Leica that brought the Spanish civil war to readers, while the second world war was seen through black-and-white newsreels. After the colour TV footage of Vietnam, which introduced war to every living room, audiences experienced the illusion of real-time participation in the Balkans and the wars against Saddam Hussein via 24-hour news cycles and instant video. More recently the use of lightweight cameras has blurred the line between fighters and embedded film-makers, as Armadillo and Restrepo, two documentaries from 2010 about the war in Afghanistan, showed. But today’s Syrian wars have brought a new level of brutal intimacy to the coverage of conflict. Smartphones allow the most intimate images of death to be smuggled out. While Isis posts videos of beheadings, their opponents are making use of their own imagery, in the quest to secure global attention for their beleaguered cause. News stories are the brief chronicles of contemporary death and destruction. Documentaries, which require more engagement, allow us to comprehend why people are fighting each other. They also define the character of war, giving an insight into the chaos of combat. News is inadequate at showing the suffering of victims. It cannot linger on shattered lives. There has always been a dilemma for those seeking to make sense of war through the medium of documentary film. You can expose audiences to too much carnage, alienating them. It’s also never clear whether acquaintance with horror does much to change minds. Toning down the images of conflict, however, results in the banalisation of bloodshed, making it into an easily consumed spectacle. At the Sundance film festival last month, where three big films about Syria were shown, attitudes to the graphic images varied. I met many who were shocked by the films to the point of antagonism. I’ve come to identify with the minority who believe that as little as possible should be left out of the depiction of atrocity. In the low-level war between good taste and reality, we should side with the latter. It’s always better to know than not to know. The best documentaries tell us what we should really know, and why we should know it. Nonetheless, films are narratives, and these must be carved out of raw footage. Cries from Syria, which is the work of Evgeny Afineevsky, soon to be shown on HBO, shockingly assembles the worst images from Syria. A more nuanced approach is taken by Matthew Heineman in City of Ghosts. Heineman made the astonishing Oscar-nominated Cartel Land, depicting the Mexican drug wars, and in his new film focuses on the citizen journalists of Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS), who risked their lives to bring out images of their city stricken by the Isis occupation. Heineman’s skilfully unobtrusive style of narrative meshes with the anonymity of his subjects, allowing them prominence as they hide from their tormentors. City of Ghosts is a powerful reminder of how hard it is, literally, to report the truth, let alone convince people of how bad things are. Orlando von Einsiedel’s graceful 40-minute film The White Helmets, released on Netflix last year, tracks the efforts of a group of volunteer rescue workers trying to save lives in the wake of Russian and Syrian bombing raids. It has been justly nominated in this year’s Oscar short category. Last Men in Aleppo, which also debuted at Sundance, taking the grand jury award for world documentary, again focuses on the White Helmets, but is altogether a bigger film. Culled from hundreds of hours of locally shot footage, Feras Fayyad’s masterpiece tells the story of the four-year Aleppo siege through the volunteers who, raid after raid, pulled bodies from the wreckage. There are many appalling scenes, but these are adeptly shaped by Danish co-director and editor Steen Johannessen into aesthetic coherence. One can sit through these brutally long takes to have some idea of what it must feel like to be pounded into submission each day, and refuse to surrender. The sense of solidarity among its heroes, Khaled, Mahmoud and Subhi, is never sentimentalised as they pull out body parts, hiding from the survivors the cruel reality that their loved ones died in the rubble, trying to spare the rescued some anguish as they are taken to hospital. “All dignity is dead,” observes the young Mahmoud, crying out at the lack of support from Arab states and the west. Surely he’s right. “Some people prefer to die than to live in refugee camps,” Ahmed says, “but Aleppo is my city.” Shortly afterwards he, too, is buried under Aleppo rubble and dies. These momentous Syrian films are made more painful by the failure of the west to do much in Aleppo, or indeed in the war against Isis. One can watch them as audiences must have reacted to films of the stricken Spanish Republic in 1930s, or indeed American audiences witnessed wrenching depictions of the 1940 London blitz. “What do you want us to do?” asked a bemused and shocked member of the audience after the premiere of Last Men in Aleppo. I didn’t think this was a dumb question. What we choose to do won’t, it would seem, depend on our governments, for the most part inclined to do nothing in the face of conflict-averse public opinion. But there remain things that we can do, and ruthlessly, stubbornly brave films show us what these might be. Or, if that is too complicated, they can simply depict the ways in which human beings endure conflict, or are ennobled by it. Nick Fraser is founder and editor of documentary streaming site Yaddo and former BBC Storyville editor Feras Fayyad, Last Men in Aleppo: ‘Every sadness was like a turning point, for us to continue’ Now based in Copenhagen, Syrian-born Feras Fayyad is an award-winning filmmaker, journalist and radio producer. His latest documentary, Last Men in Aleppo, won the grand jury prize in the international competition at Sundance last month by a unanimous jury vote. Co-directed with Steen Johannessen and shot in high-risk conditions in the decimated Syrian capital between 2015 and 2016, it’s a study of the rescue work done by the White Helmet volunteers of the Syrian Civil Defence Force, focusing principally on Khaled Harrah, who has since been killed in action I studied art and film-making in Paris, but after three years of working in television drama, I hated the connection with a fake life – I needed to do something connected with reality, with real people. I started searching for stories and doing documentaries but it was very difficult in a country under a dictatorship; you have to tell your story in much more symbolic layers. Then came the revolutionary period in 2011, when citizen journalists started using their mobile phones to document everything around them, telling their stories in a simple, more direct way. At that time, I was arrested and forced to leave Syria for Jordan, then Turkey, where I started to work on a documentary about the White Helmets. The idea started in 2013, we shot in 2014 and 2015 but in the editing booth, we decided to [open] the film when the Russians entered Syria in 2015: that’s the point where there’s something to develop with the characters and we can keep the story close to the human situation. Working in Aleppo was super-impossible: every day, there were between 15 and 20 bombings, and you didn’t know how you would cope. But we had a goal – we wanted to shoot this story, to show this story, even if we got killed – because this story must be told. Sometimes anger is what keeps you going. One of the biggest challenges was how to stay hopeful and carry on filming with so much death around us – when you’re losing your friends and families. Every sadness was like a turning point for us to continue. Making the film was a drama itself. Many times the cinematographers – the main ones were Fadi al-Halabi, Thaher Mohamad and Hasan Kattan– came close to losing their lives. But they knew this was important, they believed in the power of this story and what it could tell about our country’s conflict. [Other films about this conflict have been made by non-Syrian directors but as a Syrian] I understand the language and I can tell what is reality and what is acting for the camera – some documentaries misunderstand this. But there’s a lot of good films made by talented people; it’s about searching for the small things that give us an understanding of who we are as human beings. One of the big hopes we had for the film was to have the director make a real connection with audiences, to let them know the stories behind the making of the film. But Donald Trump’s travel ban will effectively stop that; it will build a wall in front of this story. My message for Trump is that the ban will not help, it will just create a lot of hate, division and separation. At festivals, I meet so many people who see the film and want to know more, who want to help. It is a shame that the travel ban will prevent that kind of human connection happening between my country and the US. Interview by Guy Lodge Matthew Heineman, City of Ghosts: ‘These are real people, this is real blood’ Matthew Heineman is the director of Escape Fire: The Fight to Rescue American Healthcare (2012) and Cartel Land (2015), an Oscar- and Bafta-nominated documentary about drug cartels and vigilantes around the Mexican border. His latest film, City of Ghosts, which was acquired by Amazon after its Sundance premiere, tells the story of the citizen journalist group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS), who risk their lives to tell the truth of life in Syria under Isis. The film is about a group of friends who banded together after Isis took over their home town, Raqqa, to expose what was happening. A number of them were killed while doing their work. I spent a year, on and off, with a group of them who had left Syria for Turkey and ultimately Europe, cutting back and forth to the amazing footage they had brought out from Raqqa. I had no idea how the story would unfold. What started out as a film about a war of information with Isis ultimately became about much more: partly an immigrant’s story of maintaining one’s identity away from your homeland, and about the cumulative effects of trauma. And there were other surprises, like rising nationalism in Europe. Isis uses propaganda to disseminate fear across the world and to attract followers. I knew the basics of it going into the film, but I didn’t know the extent. The production values of a lot of Isis’s videos were shocking – they try to make them look like action films or video games. By nature they’re dehumanising, so for me it was really important to make them human: these are real people, this is real blood. We combed through hundreds of hours of Isis footage. On a scale of one to 10, what we showed is probably somewhere around the five. Every day in the edit room we were contemplating this balance, of trying to make sure that we showed the reality of what was happening, the brutality, but also minimising the chance of audiences just walking out. It was also about honouring the people who risked their lives to show this footage. Isis has blacked out the media in Raqqa, and anyone who remotely speaks out against them is immediately killed and put on display. Every person [in RBSS] is motivated by different things, but underlying them all is a desire to make sure their friends did not die in vain. It’s the love of homeland, of their city, of their people. And a desire to perhaps one day have a peaceful democratic country to go back to. Safety was paramount in making this film, a lot of which was shot in safe houses around Europe. But the people who are in extreme danger are the ones who are still in Raqqa, who risk literally everything every day to spread the truth. The response at Sundance was extraordinary: at every Q&amp;A there was a massive standing ovation for the guys. The last screening was the morning after the Muslim ban was announced and it was incredibly emotional. The people in my film are allies in this fight against terrorists. They have risked their lives, they’ve lost friends and family members – to say that they can’t come to the US is horrible. As well as thousands of refugees who are escaping persecution and death. Now that newspapers and other longform publications are having their budgets slashed, that’s one gap documentaries can fill: the ability to sit with the story for a year, to live with characters. I didn’t make the film to push one agenda or another, but hopefully it humanises the experience of people who have been forced to flee Syria. It couldn’t be more timely, for better or for worse, so I’m excited to disseminate it to the world. Interview by Kathryn Bromwich Orlando von Einsiedel, The White Helmets: ‘It was very intense working with them as they went through some of the worst experiences of their lives’ British director Orlando von Einsiedel was best known for the 2014 documentary Virunga, about the battle to save the oldest national park in Africa before turning his attention to Syria with his new film. The White Helmets follows a group of Syrian volunteer search and rescue workers, named after the colour of their hardhats, who have saved more than 60,000 of their fellow citizens lives since the conflict began. The 40-minute film, currently available on Netflix, is nominated for this year’s best documentary short Academy Award and is being used by George Clooney as the source material for a feature film about the White Helmets. The idea for this film came when some friends showed me and the producer Joanna Natasegara a video of a newborn baby in Syria being rescued from a collapsed three-storey building after a bomb. The footage, which is in our final film, is incredibly powerful, but what struck us most of all was the rescuers, this group of normal civilians who had banded together to save the lives of complete strangers. We knew then that we wanted to make a film with this group from eastern Aleppo who were responsible for saving the baby. It would have been suicidal to go inside Syria ourselves so we collaborated with the White Helmets. Shooting began last year, when we found ourselves in a border town in Turkey where 30 volunteers were undertaking training for five weeks. After training each day they’d come back to their phones and to calls about family members who had been killed. It was very intense working closely with them as they went through some of the worst experiences of their lives. We formed a real bond of friendship, and ultimately love. For the footage inside Syria, we ended up working with a 17-year-old White Helmet called Khaleed Khateeb, who had been photographing the war, putting little videos online and giving images to everyone from the New York Times to the Guardian. He joined us in Turkey and we helped him improve his documentary filming techniques, and when everyone returned to Syria he carried on shooting there, sharing the footage with us. At that time the story of what was happening to civilians in Syria had slipped down the news agenda – the Assad regime had done a good job of promoting this binary narrative between the government and the terrorists. What we hoped – and this is why documentary is such an important medium, because it allows you to create empathy – was that by bringing into people’s living rooms a film about real, ordinary Syrians, we would help break down some barriers and misunderstandings. We’ve had a lot of positive reaction on Twitter, such as: “I wish Trump would watch this film and have an understanding of what refugees are actually fleeing from.” But one very powerful response came just after we released the documentary at the Toronto film festival and we came across a film podcast made by two teenagers in Canada. It was clear they weren’t very up on global political affairs because they didn’t even know how to pronounce Syria, but they began discussing the film, about how it had made them see that Syrians cared about the same sort of things that a Canadian family might, how gentle they were, how they looked after their children. Obviously it’s nothing compared to what the White Helmets go through, but some of the most stressful moments of my career have been working on this film, every day dreading receiving news that one of the guys has been injured, or worse. However, as Abu Omar says in the film, “Without hope, what good is life? People will die without hope.” What’s happening in Syria is so tragic, it’s easy to lose faith in humanity. But the White Helmets remind me that humans can be incredible and that always makes me feel hopeful for the future.

Tautologies and pleonasms gobble up space. Sometimes a whole sentence can be killed because it simply goes without saying. “An investigation is currently under way to establish what happened,” is a fine example of a sentence deleted wholly from a recent story on a road accident. It was replaced by facts. 2 Inelegant variation Nicknamed popular orange vegetables, or Povs, in the Guardian after a ludicrous reference to carrots. Recent examples of gratuitous synonyms for Donald Trump include “the bombastic billionaire” and “the controversial president”. 3 Misleading phrases This sentence (edited out of a story recently) also carries a Pov: “May was challenged about the controversial businessman’s previous comments during her first TV interview of the year.” The “controversial businessman” in question was indeed President Trump. It was changed to: “In her first TV interview of the year, May was challenged about Trump’s previous comments.” 4 Hotly disputed hyphens With new concepts our style veers towards one word rather than hyphenation: chatroom, email etc. No hyphens are needed in most compound adjectives unless ambiguity would otherwise prevail: so fine-tooth comb is fine. Hotly debated decision but silly-hatted person (as the hyphen brings clarity). We take care with unfortunate word breaks at the end of a line of text; neglecting such matters leads to leg-ends and peo-ple. 5 Once bitten Dangling participles are dangerously misleading. This one nearly appeared in a news story: “They have the fastest bite in the animal kingdom, but scientists have now discovered that the trap jaw ants’ explosive mandibles also serve a less violent purpose.” 6 Which is which? Confusing words such as (not “like”) which/that, may/might, compared to/with, refute/deny, fulsome/full, like/as if, enormity/size are all problematic. We don’t spot every misuse; sometimes we even introduce them into headlines and captions. 7 Who said what? We try to locate the attribution as close to the start of a quotation as possible to inform the reader. Keeping the tenses uniform in reported speech is also crucial to distinguish between editorialising and revealing what someone has said. 8 All our yesterdays ... “I yesterday went to the shop to buy the Guardian.” Not many people would say this. Not because they don’t buy the Guardian, of course; just because it’s journalese and sounds odd when read aloud. The time element should be located in a sentence where it sounds best. That’s if it’s necessary at all. 9 Cliches/tabloidese We try to crack down on bids, boosts, storms, controversies, flagships and landmarks. Similarly, prime minister Theresa May syndrome is frowned upon. Lower case, yes (we love lower case on the Guardian), as it’s a job. But she is the only one – and therefore her role requires commas: the prime minister, Theresa May. When she was a lowly MP she would have been the Tory MP Theresa May because she was one of many. 10 Homophone corner No matter how much we pore over the copy, the reader complaints still seem to pour in.

Apologies, readers. But while it’s a parody of journalese, the above paragraph contains many of the tonal and verbal issues that consume subeditors’ precious time as we (hopefully) help transform the thousands of words crafted daily by reporters and writers into a vibrant newspaper. All while trying to shake off the well-earned “Grauniad” reputation, of course. On the news section of the newspaper, reporters write the articles, desk editors commission and finesse their copy, designers (or layout subeditors) liaise with picture editors and graphic designers to draw up pages, and, finally, subeditors check, correct, cut and coax the copy into the allocated space before getting to work on the all-important page “furniture”: headlines, subheadings, pullout quotations and picture captions. As production editor, my job is to act as a link between the duty editor, news desks, page designers and subeditors. Along with other revise subs, I check over the subs’ work. I’m also responsible for subbing the splash (front-page lead story) – all while ensuring the news pages are “off stone” by the first edition deadline. Each day, the subeditors on the Guardian news pages get through between 25,000 and 35,000 words. The finished product will never be perfect. Mistakes are made – and overlooked – all along the way. The corrections and clarifications column (now in its 20th year) bears testimony to this fact. The column often shines a spotlight on the peculiarities of the “editing process”. But, as the latest edition of the Guardian Style Guide points out, we’ve come a long way. A comment piece on US politics in the 1960s contained the following: “Mr Nion was looking towards Washington, but the committee was liiking at Mr Nixon. He would have to oick the candidate, and if he oicked another man, eho lost, the party would be loth to nominate for the Preidency a national leader whose influence could not carry his own state in a state election. Yet, if Mr Noxon ran himself and won, he would practically forsweat the presidency.” In the days of spell check, such a festival of typos is, thankfully, not likely to happen. However, subeditors have to be on their toes. We are, in footballing terms, the last line of defence; the nameless, faceless goalkeepers in the team. A howler in a front-page headline is there for all to see. An instant own goal. So, apart from avoiding a guest entry in the column, what are our priorities when subbing? Number one is you, the reader. We are, in many ways, the first readers. When a news story raises questions in our minds, we try to answer them. If we’re at all unsure about the facts of a story – the who, what, when, where, why and how – we seek clarity, with perhaps an added paragraph from the writer, a subtle rewording or the judicious insertion of an omitted background fact. In the age of Trumpian “alternative facts” the need for the Guardian to retain its integrity as a trusted source of news is more vital than ever. While the historian EH Carr rightly pointed out that not all facts were equal – “The facts speak only when the historian calls on them,” he wrote in his seminal text What is History? – the Guardian’s specific ethos, laid down by the long-serving editor CP Scott, decrees that facts for a journalist (chroniclers of the present) are “sacred”, whereas “comment is free”. With a nod to these two complementary philosophies, subeditors play a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy of the information in stories. As well as checking, corroborating and verifying – the Guardian’s code of conduct urges care to avoid publishing “inaccurate, misleading or distorted” information – we try to create space for more facts. A good place to start is redundant words, which are more an alternative to facts than they are “alternative facts”. Subeditors act as gatekeepers. Consistency, clarity and readability are the watchwords when it comes to grammar, syntax and house style. This may include rewriting botched sentences or inelegant variation, excising extraneous words and tautological phrases, converting figures (temperatures, currencies, distances etc), and amending the level of detail to fit what we see as the readers’ likely understanding. A grasp of basic media law (primarily defamation and contempt risks) is also vital; not expertise, as such – that’s what our highly skilled lawyers bring – but an awareness of the basic principles so that, for example, we can quickly hack back a 1,000-word court report to 500 words while maintaining balance and fairness. Reporters take great care in constructing lively, balanced stories. Subs must ensure the (sometimes heavily) edited version in the paper retains that poise, accuracy and fairness. It also pays to question presumptions of knowledge among readers. As a Liverpudlian who works in London, one of my pet peeves in copy, and particularly picture captions, is a confusing lack of detail on place names. An image identified as “in Kensington” is never enough. There is more than one Kensington – and we must not presume all our readers are aware there’s actually one in London too. Similar judgment calls extend to the favourite role of many subeditors: writing headlines. It’s our chance to shine. While trying to “hook” the readers into the story with a vibrant, active and grabby headline, we are at all times committed to clarity and accuracy. A headline must reflect the story. It must be full of impact, but not too weak and not too strong. The parody headline above is a good example of what we avoid. The legendary newspaper editor Harold Evans, in his book Newspaper Design, 1973, sums up the headline writer’s quest. “The whisper in the quiet room is as emphatic as the shout in the hubbub,” he wrote. “If every headline shouts, there is no emphasis.” This is where the carefully orchestrated rhythm of a Guardian news page comes in. The use of different design formats, fonts and headline sizes (standard Guardian Egyptian headlines on newspaper pages range from 22.25 point to 60.25 point) help create a hierarchy on a page. To fail in this mission, according to Evans, would be to “transform a humble enough newspaper into a Kafkaesque confusion”. But enough of the perils of headline writing. Writing headlines for the Guardian is a pleasure. One of my favourites for simplicity and impact is the classic (subject, active verb, object) metaphorical phrase used to sum up the huge implications of George Osborne’s first coalition spending review in 2010. “Axe falls on the poor,” it announced, in 94 point (over 3cm tall), above a picture of Nick Clegg and David Cameron congratulating the chancellor for a job well done. The other one that sticks out is an example of the sort of headline that, in a way, almost writes itself – but its effortless whimsy is all too often overlooked for something too clever by half or a weak and hackneyed pun. The story was the Conservative party’s desperate and futile attempt to rebrand itself – by objecting to the media’s use of the word “Tories” – at the height of Tony Blair’s New Labour dominance. “Don’t call us Tories, say Tories,” ran the Guardian headline. Clear, accurate, devoid of cliched hyperbole – and a beguiling invitation to the reader to read on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/feb/12/20th-century-women-review-annette-bening-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-12T08:00:01Z","webTitle":"20th Century Women review – parenthood, southern California-style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/12/20th-century-women-review-annette-bening-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/feb/12/20th-century-women-review-annette-bening-review","fields":{"headline":"20th Century Women review – parenthood, southern California-style","bodyText":"Director Mike Mills follows Beginners, his Oscar-winning study of the relationship between a son and his gay father, with another picture that takes as its jumping-off point the bond between parent and child. In the case of this late 70s-set cultural odyssey, the parent is gregarious, open-minded single mother Dorothea (the superb Annette Bening) and the child is Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann), the teenage son she isn’t quite sure she can guide on his path to becoming a man. To this end, she recruits the help of two other women to help raise him. Her lodger, Abbie (Greta Gerwig), is a photographer crowd surfing on the anger and energy of the new wave scene. And Julie (Elle Fanning) is Jamie’s best friend, a sullen beauty who is casually oblivious to the fact that he is in love with her. But the 20th century is almost as important a character as the women. Mills weaves together a tapestry of social, cultural and political strands. In part of the extensive voiceover, delivered predominantly by Dorothea and Jamie, the boy talks of his last memory of his absent father – a birthday in 1974 – which deftly links mid-70s fashion trends (mirrored sunglasses) with news events (President Gerald Ford’s historic tumble down the steps of Air Force One) and with vomit on a carpet. Mills makes reference to the experimental documentary Koyaanisqatsi with accelerated clips of teeming southern California life; he even includes a clip of Koyaanisqatsi itself to emphasise the parallel. Dorothea’s 1940s jazz rubs shoulders with Talking Heads and Black Flag; still photography mood boards give way to psyched-out, colour-saturated “film burn” effects, which nod to the California hippie hotbed that spawned the film’s other key character, William (Billy Crudup). There’s a certain arch self-awareness in the screenwriting that won’t appeal to everyone, but I loved the film for its scrapbook structure, its warmth and candour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/feb/08/the-fiver-leicester-city-claudio-ranieri-derby","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-08T16:00:07Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Where are the controversies?

Take US presidents, for example. Ronald Reagan was a star of the silver screen during Hollywood’s golden era. Barack Obama could deliver a well-timed joke on the nightly talk shows. And the main guy from that affectionate Richard Nixon tribute show that’s running right now seems to be getting some really good notices. It’s the same with the best Premier League figureheads. Entertainers all. Natural comic and ham Jürgen Klopp, for instance, has crowds rolling in the aisles week in, week out, simply by dint of not wearing his spectacles properly, turning to perform the Eric Morecambe-influenced bit when everyone else is getting on with necessary substitutions and desperately required tactical alterations. Then there’s the easy-on-the-ear whiny warble of professional Mancunian miserablist Steven Patrick Mourinho. And legendary French mime Arsène Wenger is into the third decade of a north London residency, regularly putting a smile on every paying punter’s face with his famous slapstick coat-and-zip routine. He probably needs to update his act at some point, if we’re being brutally honest, but until audiences stop lapping it up, it’ll do for now. By comparison, that Claudio Ranieri at Leicester City has absolutely nothing going on! All he does is stand there, all quiet and nice and modest and occasionally masterminding the kind of story so good you’ll never witness anything like it ever again in your entire natural-born life. Well, this is no good, no good at all. Where are the controversies? The zingers? The ostentatious attention-seeking shapes? So you can see why he’s under threat of the sack before Wednesday’s FA Cup fourth-round replay against local rivals Derby County. In an attempt to shake things up, the boring bugger’s promised to make a few changes to his currently out-of-form team. Wes Morgan’s run of 49 consecutive matches is likely to end, the old boy rested, bereft of puff. Yohan Benalouane may replace him, for his first run-out since being hauled off at half-time a couple of months ago against Nottingham Forest U-23s. Oh dear. “I have to protect some players who are not very good, who need more recovery, more rest,” shrugs Ranieri, who may also call on the likes of Marcin Wasilewski, Papy Mendy, Andy King and Daniel Amartey. Should this new-look side get battered by lower-league opposition, all that’ll be left for Leicester this season is a chance to win Big Cup. What thin gruel. Otherwise, it’s living with the shame and disgrace of not winning consecutive league titles at a club that won their first in 133 years of trying just eight months ago. No skew-whiff specs, refereeing conspiracies, or struggling-with-the-poppers-on-your-winter-coat routines to offer, Claudio? Then no trading on past glories for you!

Senator Nash, who was one of the ministers charged with tackling exploitation in the Irish fishing fleet after a Guardian investigation in 2015, said a new scheme introduced to give migrant fishermen legal status and protect their rights was not working. He called for the government to scrap and replace it urgently. His intervention comes as his old department admitted to the Guardian that one in four non-European Economic Area (EEA) migrant fishermen working on boats in the second half of last year was still employed without the legally required permits. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation also said inspections had found a “25% non-compliance rate” with the regulations in respect of pay, holiday, records and rest. Nash told the Irish senate that he had heard testimony from workers who were being paid the legal minimum wage for a 39-hour week when they said they were in fact working 100 hours or more a week. In other cases, migrant workers in dispute over wages with owners were effectively “on the run” he said because they had no protection from the state. The alarm over continuing illegality and exploitation of migrant fishermen in Ireland has also been raised by human rights organisations and the fishermen’s union. The Migrant Rights Centre Ireland conducted a series of interviews with migrants working in all ports around the country over the last four months. “We have found staggering abuses of employment rights,” said MRCI coordinator Gráinne O’Toole, who said more than 70 migrant fishermen had contacted her organisation for help in the last year. “Many earn well below minimum wage, work very long hours, do not receive rest breaks and the level of workplace accidents is very concerning.” The Cork-based migrant support centre, NASC, said it had seen a similar picture last year. In 2015, the Irish government announced a new work permit scheme to regularise undocumented fishermen from outside the EEA working on Irish-owned vessels. The initiative was launched after a Guardian investigation highlighted alleged abuses. Early last year, 500 one-year permits were made available to owners who were required to pay the statutory minimum wage to migrant workers and provide them with a solicitor-backed contract. Francis O’Donnell, chief executive of the Irish Fish Producers’ Organisation, said at the time that 1,000 work permits would be needed “to get everybody covered”. According to a spokesperson from Ireland’s Department of Justice and Equality, just 182 permits have been granted to date. O’Donnell said he was not aware of boats breaking the regulations but any that did so acted without the support of his organisation. MRCI’s O’Toole said: “The scheme is facilitating the use of cheap labour and we are extremely concerned about the lack of enforcement by Irish authorities.” On Monday, 68 migrant fishermen attended a meeting in Dublin organised by the International Transport Workers’ Federation. Only one person said he had a valid work permit and some of the workers, who were mainly from Egypt, alleged a range of employment abuses including low pay, threats of deportation and continuous “24-hour” working with only 30 minutes’ rest in that period. One undocumented Egyptian said that last year he worked 150 hours a week on a trawler but was not paid properly. “We are slaves working,” he said. The ITF’s co-ordinator for the UK and Ireland, Ken Fleming, called for all undocumented migrant workers in the Irish fishing industry to be “given leave to stay”, adding that if owners don’t comply with labour laws then their fishing licences should be withdrawn. Nash said that some boat owners “clearly don’t accept that the rules have changed”, creating unfair competition for boat owners who are treating migrant workers fairly and lawfully and want the permit scheme to operate properly. Last October, Irish authorities conducted a series of raids on trawlers in some of Ireland’s major fishing ports, including Howth in Dublin and Castletownbere in County Cork. They said they found no evidence of labour exploitation, slavery or human trafficking. O’Toole described the lack of detection as “very alarming” and called for better enforcement. Responding to the latest allegations, the Irish department of jobs said that in the second half of 2016 the enforcement agency, the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), carried out 136 inspections covering 63% of the vessels eligible for the permit scheme. It found 25% of non-EEA workers did not have valid permits. The WRC also found “a 25% non-compliance rate” during inspections in relation to the mandatory terms of the permit scheme on pay, records and holiday. The department added that the WRC is committed to continuing efficient and effective enforcement of employment permits and employment rights and will prosecute where vessel owners continued to employ those without legal status. Migrant fishermen who have been working on Irish-owned vessels talked to the Guardian earlier this month about current conditions. Undocumented fisherman Lorenz Santos* was working on a trawler when the new permit scheme was opened last year. He said he repeatedly asked his employer to get him a work permit. After months working on the boat, Santos said the owner began to deduct 200 euros a month from his wages, allegedly to pay for a new permit, but that this was after the scheme had closed and he never got his documents. Santos explained that his three children, who he hasn’t seen since 2015, depend on his income for their education. Like Santos, Ramon Mendoza* has been sending his earnings home to support his children, whom he last saw in 2011, when he arrived in Ireland to work in the industry as an undocumented fisherman. Last year he worked on a prawn trawler; he and said that the conditions were “very bad” and that he worked continuously, repeatedly going 24 hours without mandatory rests. “I was very, very tired,” he said. When the permit scheme opened, Mendoza asked the boat owner to apply for him. He said the owner deducted nearly 1,500 euros from his wages to pay for the permit and the solicitors’ fees. His permit was successfully processed but Mendoza said the owner refused to give it to him. Last autumn, Santos and Mendoza were working on vessels when the Irish authorities conducted a labour inspection. Because they were unable to produce work permits, they said they were issued with a warning that they could be deported and immigration officials confiscated their passports. They are not allowed to work and have to report regularly to the authorities. “It’s so bad what has happened to me,” said Santos. “I have no money. I am worried.” Although Mendoza officially has a permit, because the boat owner refused to give it to him he was unable to show it to the authorities and he now cannot work. “ “It’s very difficult, very bad,” he added Mendoza. “What can I do?”. Eddie Martinez*, a fisherman who has worked in the industry since last year, said he had a “good boss” who applied and paid for his work permit. Martinez is injured following a serious accident at sea but says he will return to the boat when he is better. His boat owner continues to pay him a weekly wage. * Names have been changed"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/feb/08/inquiry-over-met-police-intelligence-unit-claimed-to-have-destroyed-files","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-08T16:03:22Z","webTitle":"Inquiry over Met police intelligence unit claimed to have destroyed files","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/08/inquiry-over-met-police-intelligence-unit-claimed-to-have-destroyed-files","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/feb/08/inquiry-over-met-police-intelligence-unit-claimed-to-have-destroyed-files","fields":{"headline":"Inquiry over Met police intelligence unit claimed to have destroyed files","bodyText":"A police watchdog has launched an investigation into allegations that a Scotland Yard intelligence unit shredded a large number of files after a public inquiry into undercover policing was set up by Theresa May when she was home secretary. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) announced on Wednesday that it was investigating claims that the documents had been destroyed despite a specific instruction that files should be preserved. The documents, held by the national domestic extremism and disorder intelligence unit (NDEDIU), which tracks political activists, are alleged to have been shredded over a number of days in May 2014. May had ordered the public inquiry two months earlier. The inquiry, led by Lord Justice Pitchford, follows a string of revelations about the conduct of undercover officers who were deployed to spy on political groups. The Pitchford public inquiry is examining the undercover infiltration of hundreds of political groups since 1968, including how the police spies formed long-term relationships with women, gathered information about the grieving relatives of the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, and stole the identities of dead children. Sarah Green, deputy chair of the IPCC, said: “While the evidence indicates that a large number of documents were shredded over a period of days in May 2014, the difficult task ahead for our investigators is to determine what the documentation was, why it was destroyed, whether electronic copies were kept and who may have ordered its destruction. We are also examining what action the Metropolitan police took once it was alerted, by a member of staff, to the allegations in December 2014.” She added that the IPCC appreciated that people who were spied on by the police and were taking part in the inquiry would have “serious concern” about the allegations. The Met said it had referred the allegations about the alleged shredding to the IPCC in May 2016. “It would be inappropriate for the Metropolitan police service to provide further information whilst the independent investigation is ongoing. We remain committed to providing our fullest possible co-operation to the inquiry.” In a statement, the inquiry said that after it heard about the allegations it ensured that the Met had preserved backup copies of the information kept on the database concerned. On Wednesday the IPCC also announced that it was examining claims that the same intelligence unit had improperly destroyed files it held on the Green party peer, Jenny Jones. The claims had been made by a whistleblower who was employed at the Met police intelligence unit. The whistleblower, David Williams, a sergeant, alleged that the unit destroyed the files to prevent Lady Jones from establishing the scale of the police monitoring of her political movements. For more than 10 years, Jones, in her role as a London councillor, was a member of the official committee that scrutinised the Met. Details of what Williams called a “highly irregular” cover-up were revealed by the Guardian in January 2016. In its statement the IPCC said that a “complaint by Baroness Jenny Jones, that records held by the Metropolitan police relating to her were destroyed or deleted in or about June 2014, was referred to the IPCC on 27 January. That complaint is now also subject to independent investigation”. Jones said: “I am delighted that the IPCC is taking this seriously. I applaud the brave whistleblower who had come forward to tell me that this had happened. Without his courage we would never had known.” Williams had sent her a four-page letter in which he alleged that, in June 2014, he had witnessed three officers shredding more than 30 reports relating to her, and two other officers deleting records from a police database. Williams, who told her that he had not become a police officer to monitor politicians, had reported his concerns to an internal Met department, which later concluded that the officers had not acted wrongly. The Met maintains that there was evidence that documents had been destroyed on the day, as claimed by Williams. However, according to the Met, it could not determine if these documents related to Jones. The Met has said that the unit for which Williams worked had been told to regularly destroy records that were out-of-date or irrelevant. This instruction was issued after the unit had been criticised for holding too much information. The documents had been destroyed as part of this legitimate effort to improve record keeping, the Met has said. Williams had been working for a unit that, according to police, needed to monitor political campaigners to catch those who might use criminal methods to promote their cause. Campaigners have complained however that the police have been compiling files on protesters who had no criminal history and who used purely democratic means to further their aims. Last year it was revealed that the unit had been compiling files on senior members of the Green party, including its only MP, Caroline Lucas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/feb/10/delia-smiths-recipe-for-creme-caramel-what-could-go-wrong","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T12:00:00Z","webTitle":"Delia Smith’s recipe for creme caramel – what could go wrong?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/10/delia-smiths-recipe-for-creme-caramel-what-could-go-wrong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/10/delia-smiths-recipe-for-creme-caramel-what-could-go-wrong","fields":{"headline":"Delia Smith’s recipe for creme caramel – what could go wrong?","bodyText":"To give you an idea of how my attempt to make creme caramel went, here’s a list of my Google searches, before, during and after: “creme caramel recipe”, “cleaning burnt caramel” and “how is creme caramel supposed to taste?” What went wrong? Well, I blame the recipe. “First,” Delia writes, “make the caramel. Put golden caster sugar in the saucepan and place it over a medium heat and leave it just like that.” There is a crucial word missing here, and that word was “small”. If your saucepan is too large, the whole process will happen too quickly. There are two things that can go wrong. The first is that you can end up with burnt caramel. The second is that the caramel will go hard quicker than you expect, and the bigger the saucepan, the more of a risk that you will end up with a leftover chunk of solid caramel halfway up the pan. You should use your smallest saucepan on your smallest ring. “Now take the pan off the heat, and add two tablespoons of warm tap water,” says Delia. I’m not quite sure why it is that Delia decided to write this recipe without referring to a kettle at any point, but her preferred option is to use warm water, straight from the tap. As regular readers will know, my kitchen is getting on a bit, and one of the consequences is that to make sure the boiler gets the idea and actually starts producing hot water, you have to turn the hot tap all the way up. Fortunately, you can achieve the same effect by using water from the kettle. “Stand back as it may splutter a bit at this stage,” Delia advises. The word “may” in fact means “always”. Then “pour into your souffle dish – anything heatproof you can put in an oven will do – and coat the edges with your caramel”. At this point, if you are prone to fretting, you may worry that the sugar is burnt. What I can confirm, having done several run-throughs, is that while – if you have never made caramel before – you may worry that you have simply burnt sugar, once you actually burn some sugar you will never confuse the two again. The good news is that the next part is the easiest: you pour the milk and cream into another pan and leave it to heat gently while you whisk together the eggs, vanilla extract and remaining sugar in a large bowl. Then you add all that to your caramel-lined dish and put that dish in a roasting tin. I’m not sure who was to blame for what went wrong next. What you are actually supposed to do – and indeed, Delia’s website is very clear on this point – is to pour water (it can be hot or cold) into the roasting tin and let the dish gently float in there. But in my copy of How to Cook, at least, it is not entirely clear whether or not the water should be inside or outside the dish. I flip a coin and add the water into the dish, which turns out to be a catastrophic mistake. The finished product collapses on the plate and leaks. Inadvertently, I have invented a creme caramel-flavoured drink. Once I have decanted the liquid, the unhappy pudding is very rich but so flat as to be one-dimensional, although the flavour holds up surprisingly well. Sighing, I turn to Google once more, and type in the following: “Home delivery dessert”. The resulting pudding is much better. • Stephen Bush is cooking his way through Delia’s Complete How To Cook (BBC Books, £40) in a year; You can watch Delia Smith’s free Online Cookery School videos at deliaonline.com; @deliaonline"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2017/feb/12/mendelssohn-violin-concerto-string-octet-review-liza-ferschtman-het-gelders-orkest-bakels","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-12T07:15:00Z","webTitle":"Mendelssohn: Violin Concerto; String Octet CD review – thrilling intensity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/12/mendelssohn-violin-concerto-string-octet-review-liza-ferschtman-het-gelders-orkest-bakels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/feb/12/mendelssohn-violin-concerto-string-octet-review-liza-ferschtman-het-gelders-orkest-bakels","fields":{"headline":"Mendelssohn: Violin Concerto; String Octet CD review – thrilling intensity","bodyText":"Oh, not another Mendelssohn violin concerto recording, I hear you cry.

Others might call it a civil war. “Podemos needs to understand that politics is about institutions and government, but it’s also about a family that can’t make it to the end of the month, about a school’s parents’ association; it’s about students who can’t pay their tuition fees and pensioners whose pensions don’t go far enough or who have to pay a lot for their medicines,” Iglesias told the Guardian. And that, he argues, is why the party needs to think beyond parliament and remain an engaged popular movement attuned to the fears and desires of Spaniards. His position has put him and his followers – dubbed pablistas – at odds with his old friend Iñigo Errejón, who is number two in Podemos. This weekend will give the party faithful the chance to choose between – and vote on – Iglesias’s vision and that of Errejón. “There are two projects, two teams, two leadership alternatives and it’s good that our members can choose the option they find more convincing,” said Iglesias. Errejón and the errejonistas favour a more pragmatic and less fiery approach. They have pushed for closer ties with the Spanish socialist party (PSOE) and questioned the wisdom of Podemos’s decision, just before last June’s inconclusive general election, to run on a joint ticket with United Left (IU), a leftwing coalition that includes the Communist party of Spain. The June vote proved a turning point: despite polls suggesting that Unidos Podemos was on course to bring about a historic upset by leapfrogging the PSOE to finish second behind the conservative People’s party, it didn’t happen. The party came third. Worse still, the new coalition lost 1.2m of the votes its constituent parties had won separately at the previous general election in 2015. Iglesias defends the joint strategy, pointing to the success Podemos has enjoyed by entering into coalitions in Catalonia, Galicia and Valencia: “I think it all adds up to change; we’re capable of governing in Spain’s most important town halls because we were capable of allying ourselves with other forces.” He offers an alternative explanation for June’s disappointment. “I think the pressure got too much for us: all the polls said we could come second and some even said we’d be neck-and-neck with the People’s party. I think that pressure was too great and it made us soften our message too much. I think some people in the country felt we were losing the sincerity and credibility we’d had before.” Iglesias is, however, careful to stress that the party was then barely two-and-a-half years old, and that “going from non-existence to winning 5 million votes and becoming the primary political force in Catalonia and the Basque country, and the second in Madrid, is impressive going”. However, the election results quickly – and publicly – revealed the party’s tactical and ideological faultlines. Last September, Errejón tweeted: “We already scare the powerful; that’s not the challenge. It’s about seducing those among our people who are suffering but still don’t trust us.” Iglesias replied: “Yes … but in June, we stopped seducing a million people. We’ll seduce more by speaking clearly and being different.” Speaking clearly has not always been a problem for the 38-year-old former political science professor. A famous video clip from parliament shows Errejón’s discomfort as Iglesias reminds the socialists of their role in the dirty war against Basque sepratists group Eta in the 1980s, when government-funded death squads murdered suspected terrorists and disposed of their bodies. Iglesias told the chamber that the former PSOE leader, Felipe González, was a man with “a quicklime-stained past”. Not for nothing was Podemos once described by a Spanish sociologist as “a half-formed political animal, a coalition of pretty varied interests that’s kept together by electoral success and by the drive to occupy new space”. The public disagreements – not to mention online skirmishes between the two factions and a battle for control of Madrid, where the party was born – have tossed the party’s opponents ammunition by the magazineful. Iglesias concedes that those who claim Podemos is undisciplined and unprofessional have a point. “There are debates that we need to have in our own house and not in the media,” he said. “It’s fine to be transparent but we don’t need to be naive. We’re still a new political force that’s maturing and we need to come out of this new congress stronger and more united.” If Iglesias wins this weekend, he promises to stretch out his hand and try to bring unity to the party. If he loses, the play is clear: he will step down as leader but will never abandon the party. “I don’t want to be secretary general if my ideas are minority ones and if my team ends up in the minority. It seems to me to be a question of consistency: we can’t tie ourselves to our chairs; we have to assume that, politically, we’re just passing through.” The pressures of politics have put paid to the carefree days of academia when he and Errejón would hold “very lively and very intense” intellectual discussions that lasted for hours and ended with a beer. “Now the situation is different and I think it’s fundamental that we separate the personal and the private from the political,” he said. “[But] I think Iñigo Errejón brings a lot to Podemos.” But wouldn’t the project be easier without his old friend in the party? “Not at all. It’s the absolute opposite: I want to have the best people close to me even if they don’t think like me.” Iglesias feels he has grown up a lot over the past three years, learned to cope with the pressure and is far better prepared to be prime minister. All he needs to do now is survive the weekend. “Being in politics broadens the shoulders,” he said. “There’s that cruel saying: ‘What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.’ And I think the punches we’ve taken have made us stronger.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/feb/24/what-wore-this-week-kitten-heels-jess-cartner-morley","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-24T14:00:34Z","webTitle":"What I wore this week: kitten heels | Jess Cartner-Morley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/feb/24/what-wore-this-week-kitten-heels-jess-cartner-morley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/feb/24/what-wore-this-week-kitten-heels-jess-cartner-morley","fields":{"headline":"What I wore this week: kitten heels","bodyText":"Oh, the bliss of a kitten heel. Enough of a lift to add two inches of leg, which, not to tar the rest of you with my short brush, makes a significant difference. Enough “polish” (dreadful word, sorry) that you look “done” (again, yuck, but you know what I mean). And yet comfortable enough to wear all day, safe to cross the road at a clip when the lights are about to change without putting yourself in mortal peril, low-key enough that you don’t stimulate midlife crisis gossip in the office. What’s not to love? Well, that’s exactly the problem. The kitten heel is a bit too nice. Too polite. It is easy and amenable, helpful and practical – the trophy shoe of duty, not dancefloors. (Not for nothing is it beloved of the royal family.) It lacks edge, which is exactly why the kitten heel fell from fashion favour a decade ago. And why its comeback, as declared by Vogue at the beginning of this year, is A Good Thing, but not quite as straightforward as you’d think. The danger of the kitten heel’s comeback is that if you let it, it will unwittingly rewind your wardrobe clock to the early noughties. Let us be clear: the kitten heel is no excuse to pull out those trusty knee-length A-line skirts, the ones you wore for your Devil-Wears-Prada-lite big meeting look. And neither is it going to resuscitate those flattering draped-at-the-waist jersey dresses you used to wear at weekends. Nope. Sorry. To make the kitten heel work this time around you need to think of it in a new way. So, you don’t wear it with knee-length skirts, ever. You can wear it with a midi-length skirt, but only if you wear, say, a sweatshirt or a statement-sleeved knit on the top half rather than a cute fitted cardigan. If you wear it with trousers, they should be cropped, so that the proportions are slightly gawky. Bonus points if the trousers appear to have been cropped with a pair of blunt scissors. In other words, the new-wave kitten is not nearly so easy to wear. But get it right and it still punches above its weight (or rather, height) in its ability to elevate. • Jess wears jumper, £28, next.co.uk.

The stop-motion animation may have been made in Poland, but its wonky soundtrack was composed and recorded by a couple of post-punk theatre performers from Leeds. Accordingly, a maverick DIY feel pervades. Graeme Miller and Steve Shill’s synths sound as primitive as the most rudimentary 8-bit computer games, while Partytime shares a bass guitar break with Nick Lowe’s 1978 new wave gem I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass. Like Jansson’s stories, the music can also be eerie. Midwinter Rites’ percussion is unsettling, and Comet Shadow could have graced one of Brian Eno’s ambient albums of the era. The leitmotifs of The Moomins Theme and Woodland Band will give anyone who saw the series as a child a Proustian rush, but amazingly, it’s the first time this remarkable soundtrack has been issued."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/mar/05/naked-boys-reading-book-group-nude","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-05T15:00:03Z","webTitle":"And now for a nude lifeguard reciting Jane Eyre … my night with Naked Boys Reading","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/05/naked-boys-reading-book-group-nude","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/mar/05/naked-boys-reading-book-group-nude","fields":{"headline":"And now for a nude lifeguard reciting Jane Eyre … my night with Naked Boys Reading","bodyText":"The Naked Boys Reading collective is what it says on the tin: a literary salon in which naked men read. They are based at the Ace Hotel in London where they have a bimonthly residency; I saw them read in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. Fittingly for Brontë country, the event was themed around sisters, with three naked men plodding on stage with a work by Charlotte, Anne and Emily. The atmosphere was both spirited and academic; themed cocktails were clutched in the hands of the female dominated audience, with a fair bit of jovial heckling in between readings. Watching Naked Boys Reading is an experience akin to a hen do hijacked by a spoken word event: a unexpectedly cerebral night of nude performance art. “This is a male voice reading a female text written under a male name,” says collective co-founder and self-styled “drag know-it-all” Dr Sharon Husbands, after his reading of the closing passages of Wuthering Heights. “It’s problematic.” Husbands has a PhD in gender and sexuality, and speaking with him before he gets on stage it becomes clear very quickly that Naked Boys Reading is an intellectually considered affair; not least when Husbands solemnly says things like: “The nudity provides two things: a new lens and modality for the texts, and the care-giving experience of being read to.” The collective formed in 2012, having been inspired by Chicago’s all-female Naked Girls Reading, which was started by two women in the city’s burlesque scene. Unlike the drawn-out disrobing found in burlesque, the men just walk on stage; there is no teasing titillation, they are just naked. Speaking to a few people in the crowd, there was a definite sense that there would be a very different atmosphere if it were women naked on stage. But that is part of what the collective is telegraphing; very deliberately naming the night Naked Boys Reading, as opposed to Naked Men Reading. “We want to infantilise men in the same way women are infantilised,” Husbands tells me. “We have to critique these structures.” Ash Young, a lifeguard, is reading naked tonight; it is his first time. He has wanted to do it for ages, he tells me. “There is a shock value, speaking as a male nude and promoting the objectification of the male body, and it allows a different interpretation of the text,” he says. He’s settled on the second chapter of Jane Eyre; poignant, he believes, as it is a first person text: a character baring all. Taking to the stage with a detectable wobble in his voice, Young’s delivery and posture eventually relax. A few audience members have told me how quickly the nudity becomes normalised; I wonder if the readers feel that too. Is there a relationship between the nudity and reading? Why is this Naked Boys Reading, as opposed to, say, Naked Boys Do Literally Anything Else? “There is something sexy about it and something nerdy,” Husband explains. “And when you put seeming opposites together, something interesting happens.” Back in 2013, the poet Mark Grist released a viral video of himself reading his poem, Girls Who Read: “Some prefer arses / some prefer tits / and I am not saying I don’t like those bits. / But what’s more important? / What supercedes / is a girl with passion, wit and dreams.” Condemned for positing women reading as a eroticised rarity, the poem was panned. But there is ample evidence to suggest male readers are similarly fetishised; Hot Dudes Reading is yet another no-nonsense-named venture, an Instagram account featuring hot dudes, reading. It is so popular that it has spawned a coffee table book and a calendar. One of the founders – all ask to be anonymous – told me it came from her and her friends “talking about, sending pictures of and salivating over hot dudes of all kinds”. “One day we realised a common thread between all our very different tastes was that guys are always more attractive when they’re reading,” she says. “We decided how the rest of the world might react to our silly exchanges and created the [Instagram] account that now rules our life.” What is it about the male reader that is prompting this new wave of objectification? “We’re firm believers that smart is sexy,” she says, of the six heterosexual women and seven homosexual men that run the Hot Dudes Reading account. “A book makes us think he’s got a lot more to offer than his appearance.” Husbands believes both experiments offer voyeurism, though he is keen to distinguish on the line of consent; the Instagram Hot Dudes Reading relies on stealth photographs of men reading on the train or waiting in line at Starbucks, whereas the men of Naked Boys Reading are keenly aware of what they’re taking part in. But fetishising men for reading is somehow radical and exciting: an avenue for women to unashamedly voice their attraction to men, while deflecting accusations of crass objectification with their appreciation for the bookish soul underneath the muscles. “There is still a crisis about seeing the male body,” Husbands believes. “It is mostly neutered, contemplative or warlike.” But sitting in the audience of Naked Boys Reading, gazing at the naked male body still leaves me tentative. Are the books just a conduit for staring at a bloke’s nethers? Does literature permit this gaze somehow? Either way, I couldn’t help but wonder what the Brontës might have thought."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/feb/09/the-tiny-town-that-builds-show-stopping-sets-for-beyonce-kanye-and-madonna","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T17:58:00Z","webTitle":"The tiny town that builds show-stopping sets for Beyoncé, Kanye and Madonna","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/09/the-tiny-town-that-builds-show-stopping-sets-for-beyonce-kanye-and-madonna","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/feb/09/the-tiny-town-that-builds-show-stopping-sets-for-beyonce-kanye-and-madonna","fields":{"headline":"The tiny town that builds show-stopping sets for Beyoncé, Kanye and Madonna","bodyText":"Every night during Taylor Swift’s 2015 world tour, the runway sticking out from the stage would take off and rotate like a propeller, carrying Swift and her dancers over the fans’ heads. At the 2016 Oscars, five glittering towers of statuettes loomed behind the host, like skittles made of crystals, then turned into video screens. On Broadway and around the world, Aladdin continues to fly on his magic carpet with no strings attached. At the Omnia club in Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, the punters are greeted by what is believed to be the world’s largest chandelier, made up of moving parts that double as LED displays. On U2’s Innocence + Experience world tour (also in 2015), the video screen was a giant translucent billboard, slicing through the auditorium and incorporating a walkway that allowed Bono to stroll into an animated re-enactment of his teenage bedroom. In 2015, the Pope celebrated mass at Madison Square Garden, New York, beneath a 12-ft sculpture of Christ on the cross. He liked it so much, the Vatican asked if it could be shipped to Rome. All these creations spring from one place: Lititz, a small town in Pennsylvania’s Amish country, with a population of 9,400. Turning off the freeway on a bright day shortly before the US presidential election, I pass dozens of neat timber houses with posters for Trump, and only one for Clinton. This is a reactionary corner of the US, yet it is also the global hub of a relentlessly innovative industry, one so young that it has no name. In Los Angeles, they make movies; in Nashville, they make country music; in Lititz, they make the things that make the people who go to stadium shows go: “Wow!” Where New York has the garment district, or the meatpacking district, Lilitz has the stadium-show district; or, rather, it is the stadium-show district. There are 12 companies here in the live-event business, and soon, when a new business campus opens, there will be 35. The biggest of the firms is Tait Towers, responsible for Bono’s billboard, Taylor’s runway, Aladdin’s carpet and sets for Beyoncé, Madonna, Kanye, Cirque du Soleil and the London Olympics. Name any big concert tour of modern times and the chances are that Tait made it happen. When Michael Jackson did his first moonwalk in 1983, the floor was built here. As the company puts it: “We are the brand that you have seen a thousand times, but you have no idea about.” Tait Towers occupies a long, low, brick building, half office and half factory. Inside the door stands a battalion of industry awards. Spread out behind are 30 or 40 engineers and designers, nearly all male, clicking away at double-screen Macs. One man, 60ish, distinguished-looking and trained as an architect, is drawing a giant flower for a casino. Another, the archetypal friendly young geek, is converting mock-ups for the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ tour into virtual reality (“here, have a headset”). In a meeting room, Nick Starr, Nicholas Hytner’s partner in drama, is discussing their new project, the London Theatre Company, over lunch. In a corner room, sits one of Tait’s joint CEOs, Adam Davis, a 45-year-old bundle of quiet enthusiasm who worked his way up after starting as a stagehand on Broadway. Theatre, he says, was “the epicentre” of staging then, with the mega-musicals; now the cutting edge is in concert tours. Davis is so used to greeting British guests that he has several three-prong sockets built into the table in his office – the ultimate in contemporary hospitality. This says something about the UK’s enduring status as pop’s second superpower. It also says something about Tait, where the staff seem unable to come across a problem, large or small, without wanting to solve it. It’s as if American can-do has been bottled and put in the vending machine. The firm’s other boss, a little older and louder, is James Fairorth, known as Winky; he worked his way up, too, after going to college nearby. He has now left Lititz to live in LA, and I find him at Desert Trip, California’s brand new festival for very old rockers. The headliners are Roger Waters, for whom Tait has put many a brick in The Wall; Paul McCartney, whom it regularly places on a moving platform; and the Rolling Stones, Tait clients since the 80s, the godfathers of the stadium spectacular. In the list of the 10 highest-grossing tours, the Stones have three entries. Tait has all 10. Fairorth sees the rise of the gig in terms of the state of the industry. “The tipping point,” he says, “was when Napster changed the music business [in 1999-2001]. The demise of the record label enabled artists to earn much more money touring than they ever earned before. And so a set is now a real extension of the artist, if they are involved in the stage design, which they normally are. It becomes a bit of a competition between [different artists], and a marketing tool. We just happened to be standing there at the right place at the right time.” For Davis, it’s more about what the fans want. “Repeatedly, there’s this feeling that the future is not going to have public assembly, but every piece of data we have is the opposite. The more digital life gets, the more people need to get together in a public space.” If it’s the music that makes us choose a particular gig, it’s often the visuals that make us remember it. A star who cares about pleasing the crowd will play the hits, so the music is mostly predictable, and the staging is where the creativity surfaces. It may be just a bright idea, such as when Adele resumed touring after a long gap and her set designer, Es Devlin, found an elegant way to express that sense of returning, putting a black-and-white closeup of Adele’s sleeping face on the big screen as the crowd shuffled in, then having her wake up as the lights went down. Even for a simple stage design, Devlin prefers to work with Tait to put together her designs. “Production managers won’t leave home without them,” she says. At the other extreme, touring turns into competitive hydraulics. On Justin Timberlake’s 2014 tour, the front of the stage took off vertically and rolled over the stalls to become a moving bridge. Timberlake skipped along it, giving his fans an extra thrill and an unexpected photo opportunity. Musically, his show was mundane, but the engineering made it memorable. And it wasn’t just engineering: the playfulness brought out the small boy inside the slick entertainer. Looking around Lititz, you are continually struck by the collision of art and science. As Devlin, who lives there when she’s designing a tour, says: “You can’t separate the steel and the mechanics from the poetry.” In the beginning was the sound. In 1966, when hardly any pop stars had a travelling sound man, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons played Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster, PA. The sound was provided by Roy and Gene Clair, two brothers from Lititz who used to build speakers in their dad’s garage. They did it so well that Valli took them on the road. One of their firms, Clair Global, is still in Lititz, still making speakers, and still at the top: it supplied the sound at Desert Trip, which was strikingly crystalline – as it needed to be, given that half the punters, and all the performers, were of an age to be hard of hearing. The other formative moment occurred in London in 1968. A young Australian, travelling in Europe “as you do”, found a job as a barman at the Speakeasy, a musicians’ hang-out in Soho. One night the manager of a new band called Yes was there, saying they needed a driver for their new Transit van. The barman drove Yes to their next gig, at Leeds University. “I don’t think they got through one song without something breaking,” he remembers. “The guitarist would stomp on his volume pedal and break the cable. And I realised that I could make all this stuff work.” He became Yes’s tour manager, sound engineer and lighting designer. “That one gig lasted 15 years.” The barman was Michael Tait, now 70, silver-haired and an occasional visitor to the building that bears his name. During my visit, he arrives in a yellow jacket and a silver Rolls-Royce. “He’s an icon,” says Tait’s head of marketing, Mia Tinari. “Doesn’t matter how young the artist is, they still know who Michael Tait is.” Growing up in Melbourne, Tait had played “with batteries and lightbulbs” from the age of four. With Yes, he made common-sense breakthroughs, starting with the stomping guitarist. “He had three pedals, a volume, a wah-wah and a fuzz. I thought, well, if I fix ’em to a board, and put an edge on it, then he can’t stomp on ’em. So I made what was probably the first pedal-board.” His next idea made his name. He went to pick up a music film – “we didn’t call them videos in those days” – in a 16-mm can, which he put on the passenger seat of his car. “I’m driving along, looking at it, and bam! The way Yes were set up in the studio was with Jon Anderson in the centre, and in each corner of a squarish room was one of the other musicians. I thought: the square could be a circle.” He had invented the rock gig in the round. “They said, ‘This can’t possibly work.’ And I said, ‘Look at you now, this is how you’re set up.’ They said, ‘We’ll have our back to the audience.’ And I said, ‘No you won’t, you’ll have your back to these people here, but you’ll be facing all those people over there.’” It sounds like Spinal Tap – a story in which some of the best gags involve the set going wrong. But Tait’s wheezes worked, and even paid their way. “The rotating stage was a huge money-maker. You double the front row from 60ft to 120ft and everyone in the audience is twice as close, so you scale up the tickets and it pays for itself in, like, four gigs. Once people saw that, Barry Manilow called, Neil Diamond called, and before I knew it I was in the set business.” Although still based in London then, Tait was storing equipment in Lititz, to be near the Clair brothers. “I built that first rotating stage with a farmer up the road. Then I was having immigration problems in England, so I had to move to America.” He set up in Lititz with a staff of one; now there are 600. In league with Clair Global and others, Tait has recently opened Rock Lititz, a purpose-built rehearsal hall. The size of an arena stage, it has already welcomed Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, possibly the two best-rehearsed acts in pop. If the live-event industry started here because of the Clairs, it stayed because of the local culture. “The supply chain allows us to build anything,” Davis says. “When farmers have a problem, they fix it themselves, and eventually it turns into an invention.” “We still use a company that makes cattle grids,” Fairorth says. “Literally, a Mennonite company that can cut pieces of metal for a rock show.” As they left the National Theatre in March 2015, Nick Hytner and Nick Starr wanted to build a new company, and new theatres. When they found a space earmarked for culture beneath a new block of flats by Tower Bridge, it was just 12m high. “That meant we could only build in steel,” Starr says, “because you need a material that is strong enough and thin enough to stack the audience on top of each other.” He sees this not as a problem, but as serendipity, since it led them to Tait. By December 2016, Starr was watching the first of 57 truckloads arrive from Haverhill in Suffolk, where Tait has forged a 900-seat theatre. Starr points delightedly at the back door: “We’ve got 9mm clearance there.” The Bridge will be central London’s first purpose-built commercial theatre in a century. The laws of building state that the client soon falls out of love with the builder, but Starr is still smitten with Tait. “They’re pretty remarkable, aren’t they? They put this huge focus on quality and design. They reckon the money will look after itself if you get that right.” Not that they’re cheap: budgets range from $100,000 (£80,000) to $20m. “It’s got to be the best shit,” Tait says. “Because we’re a trifle more expensive.” “The biggest ingredient,” Devlin says, “is time more than money. You’ve got four hours to erect an entire set in an arena and four to five hours to take it down. It’s just the best form of Lego – everything clicks together.” Back in Lititz, Davis is peering into the future of live entertainment. “We’ve gone from the performance to the event to the entire experience. We’re working on virtual reality, where you don’t really need a star.” One day, fans will go to a gig and find the air full of drones. “There are four major obstacles to bringing drones inside – safety, swarm algorithms, indoor positioning and indoor communication. We’ve cracked the first three.” He pauses to let some light in on Aladdin’s magic carpet. “There are strings, but they’re spinning at 1,100rpm. If it moves fast enough, you don’t see it.” But the creation he seems most proud of is something very modest. “You see that purple wheel?” he says on the shopfloor. “That’s our set-cart wheel. It’s fifth-generation, it’s our plastic, our rig, our bearing. It’s not that we set out to make the best wheel. It’s $75, everybody else’s are $35, but it means that two people can push a set cart around rather than four, and it can go over cobblestones.” These artful physicists haven’t just cornered the market: they’ve reinvented the wheel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2017/feb/14/bill-and-melinda-gates-trumps-global-gag-rule-endangers-millions-women-girls-us-funding","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-14T14:21:59Z","webTitle":"Trump's 'global gag rule' could endanger millions of women and children, ​Bill and Melinda Gates​ warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/feb/14/bill-and-melinda-gates-trumps-global-gag-rule-endangers-millions-women-girls-us-funding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/feb/14/bill-and-melinda-gates-trumps-global-gag-rule-endangers-millions-women-girls-us-funding","fields":{"headline":"Trump's 'global gag rule' could endanger millions of women and children, ​Bill and Melinda Gates​ warn","bodyText":"The “global gag rule” imposed by Donald Trump, blocking US funds to any organisation involved in abortion advice and care overseas, could impact millions of women and girls, endangering their lives and those of their babies, Bill and Melinda Gates have warned. The changes are expected to result in funding from the world’s biggest donor to family planning and women’s health programmes in the developing world being slashed. It could, Bill Gates told the Guardian, “create a void that even a foundation like ours can’t fill”. Gates and his wife spoke out as they published a progress letter to Warren Buffett, the businessman who 10 years ago invested a large part of his fortune in the couple’s foundation, which has at its centre the mission to save children’s lives. Empowering women and girls, the couple said, was central to that aim. Trump signed an executive order reimposing the Mexico City policy, also known as the global gag rule, on his first full day in office. Republican presidents since Ronald Reagan in 1984 have imposed the policy, while their Democrat counterparts have lifted it. The rule strips funds from any organisation that “performs or actively promotes abortion as a method of family planning” overseas. But Trump’s order goes further and applies to any organisation that receives funding from US Aid , not just those involved in family planning. That expansion, said Melinda Gates, was a surprise. “We’re concerned that this shift could impact millions of women and girls around the world,” she said. “It’s likely to have a negative effect on a broad range of health programs that provide lifesaving treatment and prevention options to those most in need. “This includes programmes that prevent and treat HIV, TB and malaria, and provide healthcare to women and children around the world. Enabling women to time and space their pregnancies and providing access to treatment and prevention of infectious diseases is lifesaving work. It saves moms’ lives and it saves babies’ lives, and that has long had wide support in the United States.” Bill Gates said their foundation would not be able to bridge the potential funding gap. “The US is the No 1 donor in the work that we do. Government aid can’t be replaced by philanthropy. When government leaves an area like that, it can’t be offset, there isn’t a real alternative. This expansion of this policy, depending on how it’s implemented, could create a void that even a foundation like ours can’t fill.” He had an early phone call with Trump in November and then a meeting in December with the president-elect in New York, he told the Guardian. They talked about the eradication of polio, which Gates hopes could come as early as this year, and the research his foundation is supporting towards an Aids vaccine and ways to protect people from pandemics such as Ebola in west Africa. “So that was a good discussion – the fact that he was interested in having me talk about the Foundation’s work – I was pleased,” said Gates. But the philanthropist did not anticipate the scope of the executive order affecting family planning, an issue at the centre of the foundation’s work, that Trump was to sign. The letter to Buffett is an assessment of the progress the Gates Foundation has made since 2006, when he pledged 10m shares in his company Berkshire Hathaway in annual instalments worth a total of $31bn at the time. The couple write of the progress that has been made in saving children’s lives, particularly through immunisation and vaccine development, and the work that lies ahead in making childbirth safer and tackling malnutrition. Their letter makes clear what is at stake with Trump’s move to reimpose the global gag rule, arguing that women and maternal health are key to so many global health issues. Empowering women is a key theme of the letter in which the couple argue that enabling women to access contraceptives control over the number of pregnancies they have is crucial. When women have a gap of at least three years between births, their children are more likely to survive and be healthy and well educated, the couple say. “Like vaccines, contraceptives are one of the greatest lifesaving innovations in history,” writes Bill Gates in the letter. Since they set up their foundation its focus has shift from the hunt for technological solutions towards social change. The attention to women’s empowerment came from the evidence, the couple say. “You cannot go out and be in the developing world and then come back and look at the data and turn away from the importance of women in the developing world,” said Melinda Gates. Whether they breastfeed and take their children to be vaccinated makes a profound difference to how the child grows and his or her life chances, and men are not always there, she added. “So you have to look at the woman’s role and when you look at it you realise it can be an accelerator to every single thing you want to have happen in the world for global health and global development and social change.” In their letter, Bill Gates says that poverty is sexist, a phrase he first heard from the U2 frontman Bono. “The poorer the society, the less power women have. Men decide if a woman is allowed to go outside, talk to other women, earn income. Men decide if it’s acceptable to strike a woman. The male dominance in the poorest societies is mind-blowing.” In the letter, Melinda Gates adds: “It’s also crippling. Limiting women’s power keeps everyone poor.” She and her husband tell of their visits to sex workers in India whom the couple say they encouraged to form self-help groups, thinking the women would help each other insisting their clients wore condoms to protect themselves from HIV. That vision, said Bill Gates, “was way too narrow”. The sex workers began to support each other in every aspect of their lives. “Warren, if Melinda and I could take you anywhere in the world so you could see your investment at work, we probably would take you to meet sex workers. I met with a group in Bangalore, and when they talked about their lives, they had me in tears,” writes Bill Gates. “One woman told us she turned to sex work after her husband left her – it was the only way to feed her children. When people in the community found out, they forced her daughter out of school, which made the girl turn against her mother and threaten to commit suicide. “That mother faced the scorn of society, the resentment of her daughter, the risks of sex work, and the humiliation of going to the hospital for an HIV test and finding that no one would look at her, touch her, or talk to her. Yet there she was, telling me her story with dignity.” There have been setbacks, such as the failure yet to end polio, but the couple emphasise the enormous progress that has been made in the last couple of decades in global health and speak in the letter of their optimism for the future. “Polio will soon be history. In our lifetimes, malaria will end. No one will die from AIDS. Few people will get TB. Children everywhere will be well nourished. And the death of a child in the developing world will be just as rare as the death of a child in the rich world. “We can’t put a date on these events, and we don’t know the sequence, but we’re confident of one thing: The future will surprise the pessimists.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/feb/08/universal-credit-issues-driving-tenants-into-debt-ex-minister-admits","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-08T14:52:27Z","webTitle":"Universal credit issues driving tenants into debt, ex-minister admits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/08/universal-credit-issues-driving-tenants-into-debt-ex-minister-admits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/feb/08/universal-credit-issues-driving-tenants-into-debt-ex-minister-admits","fields":{"headline":"Universal credit issues driving tenants into debt, ex-minister admits","bodyText":"The former welfare minister Lord Freud has admitted to MPs that administrative problems and design issues with universal credit are causing around one in four low-income tenants to run up rent arrears, putting them at risk of eviction. Freud, who has overseen the development of universal credit over the past six years, also suggested that the long formal waiting times faced by claimants before they receive a first payment when they move on to the new benefit should be shortened. However, Freud, who stepped down from the government in December, said the arrears problem was not as severe as claimed by councils and housing associations, who have reported that typically 85% of tenants on universal credit are behind with the rent. “When I left ... I was looking at figures that said there was a problem. There was a proportion of people – probably around a quarter – where universal credit was having an effect on arrears,” he told MPs on the work and pensions select committee. He added: “There is an arrears issue, I’m not going to deny that, and things need to be done but it is not the dramatic story you are hearing from people.” The Guardian reported on Tuesday that thousands of council tenants on universal credit were at risk of eviction because of outstanding rent arrears caused or exacerbated by formal 42-day waits for a first benefit payment. Additional processing delays meant some claimants were waiting for up to 60 days. One housing association said 80% of its low income tenants who moved onto universal credit reported that they did not have the financial resources to manage a 42-period without income, and many were routinely referred to food banks as a result. The committee chairman, Frank Field, said he had seen capable people “reduced to tears” by the complexities of universal credit. “There are people who have never been in this situation of turmoil before who have found that universal credit was wrecking their lives.” Asked what he would change about universal credit, Freud said some thought a 42-day wait was too long and suggested that a component of that wait, a seven-day benefit waiting period introduced by the Treasury in 2013, should be dropped. “Waiting days do not help in the introduction of universal credit.” Freud told MPs that most of the tenants cited by housing associations were in arrears before they moved on to universal credit. He said Department of Work and Pensions’ (DWP) own research suggested that the prevalence of rent arrears among universal credit tenants declined after three months on the new system. The DWP research he referred to was published over a year ago and referred to a phone survey of 1,800 benefit claimants conducted between November 2014 and March 2015. It shows that the percentage of the 900 universal credit claimants surveyed who said they were in rent arrears fell from 48% to 33% after three months. Freud defended the delays that mean it is now six years behind its original schedule, and will not be fully rolled out until 2022. It was better to get things right than rush things to keep to an artificial programme, he said. But Labour MP Neil Coyle said: “If you were in the private sector and you said you would do this at this cost and you come back two years later and say I’ve spent more than that and I cannot deliver it, you’d probably get the sack.” Asked about the sometimes fractious relationship between the DWP and the Treasury over universal credit in recent years, Freud said: “There were times when one’s views about the Treasury were totally unprintable.” However, he said the Treasury had at other times been supportive and praised the former Lib Dem MP Danny Alexander, who was chief secretary to the Treasury in the coalition government, for effectively saving universal credit when it’s future was in doubt in 2013. Universal credit was introduced by the former work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, in 2013 as a way of ensuring claimants would be better off in work than on benefits. However, Treasury cuts to work allowances within universal credit have reduced the incentive for some claimants to get a job and will leave 1.2 million working families worse off."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/feb/09/readers-write-parents-thank-you-letters","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T09:30:18Z","webTitle":"Dear Dad, I'll never know why you chose to leave – readers write to their parents","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/09/readers-write-parents-thank-you-letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/09/readers-write-parents-thank-you-letters","fields":{"headline":"Dear Dad, I'll never know why you chose to leave – readers write to their parents","bodyText":"What would you most like to thank your parents for? Maybe it’s something seemingly trivial, like a present they once gave you. Or something more significant, like the sense of justice they instilled in you. Chelsea Cameron, an 18-year-old from Dundee, shared a heart-felt thank-you letter that she had sent to her parents. In it she said that the fact her drug-addict parents were never around taught her how to make a success of her life. Inspired by this, our writers penned thank-you letters to their parents. We also asked readers to do the same. Here’s a selection of their responses. Natalie, 32, from Berkshire: People feel I should be angry at you, but I refuse to be Dear Dad, I’m 32 now, and you’ve been dead for 18 years. I’ll still never know why you decided to take your own life when I was 14. Some people feel I should be angry at you for the chasm left behind. For the confusion and abandonment and unique loneliness that suicide brings. For the unanswerable questions. I can’t bring myself to imagine how you felt, the immeasurable pain you must have been feeling. But I refuse to be angry. The person who walked into our garage on that sunny July morning wasn’t my dad. But I’m grateful to you, Dad, and I always will be. Thank you for sneaking into my netball matches and watching me play. I’d only realise you’d been there when you’d leave me a note before you left for your night shift congratulating me on scoring three goals. You knew I’d be distracted if I saw you. Thank you for taking me to the local swimming pool every Saturday and rewarding me afterwards with a cone of vinegary chips. I’m sorry for kicking you in the face with my eager, flapping legs on more occasions than I care to remember. You never complained. Thank you for holding my hand for 14 years. Thank you for your ready laugh and ability to lift me out of even the most dramatic teenage doldrums. Thank you for dancing along to Wannabe as it played on Top of the Pops in 1996 while we stripped the living-room wallpaper together. I’m so sorry you couldn’t go on. There’s so much I wish you could have seen. I carry you with me, every day, wrapped in my heart. I’ll never know why you chose to leave, but I’ll never let you go. Kayleigh, 29, from the East Midlands: You taught that my best is the best Dear Mum, Thank you for showing me that I am enough. From as early as I can remember you have never tried to shape me into being what you think is right. You have taught me that my best is the best, and have supported me with every choice I have made. I still remember leaving university and worrying about what to do next. You told me that I could work in the local shop if it made me happy. That quiet support made me pick a career that I love (and it uses my degree). Thank you for the love you show us all, including my siblings and your grandchildren. My daughter has a wonderful relationship with you. A relationship that has blossomed through the childcare you always offer, and the money you refuse to take. The offended look on your face the first time I offered to pay you for babysitting her meant I never did again. I hope that I show my thanks in other ways. Finally, thank you for the memories. Giggling in bingo halls, running to catch snowflakes on our tongues in the falling snow, our in-jokes that nobody else gets. You have raised us all to be good, kind people. As you say, being kind is the best trait to have, but it is sometimes the most underrated one. Lesley, 51, from Shropshire: You were falling to pieces but you pulled it all together for our sake Dear Mum, Thank you for being both parents to me after dad died when I was three and Anne was one. You were falling to pieces but you pulled it all together for our sake. You taught me the value of hard work and love. We all made it through some hard times with very little money, but loads of love. You taught me the safety that is to be found in a pair of loving arms. You will have been gone for two years on 9 March and I miss you still. Charlie, 28, from London: I wish I’d been able to bring a smile to your face more often Dear Mum and Papa, Thank you for being people first and parents second. You did the best you could. Mum, I should be telling you these things in person, since it’s just been you and I these last few months since Dad died. I will, I hope. I learned a great deal from you both. Mum, I learned not to expect fairness but to fight for what I wanted. This has come in pretty handy. You care about people, but you also think about yourself. Thank you for showing me it’s OK to be imperfect, and that love is possible regardless. Papa, as my step-dad I thank you for choosing to be my father, to raise me as your own. I’m grateful that you did, and I wish I had found the words to say so. We laughed as you spent hours teaching me to ride a bike. The first time I managed to balance, without the training wheels, I was by myself. I ran into the house because all I wanted to do was show you I could do it. The helium balloon that I had tied to my handlebars had floated away by the time we got back. I was pretty distraught, all thoughts of the bicycle overwritten with the loss of the balloon. You were able to teach me how to lose things you love, accept it, and get back in the saddle, literally in this case. I can picture the smile on your face as I pedalled towards you. You smiled less and less over the years, and I wonder whether there was anything I could have done to make you happy, or feel less alone. I know you were from a different generation but I wish you’d been more open. I am not sure you always knew how to do that. I wish I’d been able to bring a smile to your face more often, and that we’d been able to help each other when we needed it. It is one of my only regrets in life that we never talked more about what we meant to each other. It would have been the most valuable conversation you and I ever had. But Alzheimer’s took you away before I was ready to talk to you more openly about what you meant to me. Your interactions taught me that people can love doggedly, that love can be cruel and ugly, but that it’s worth it. I saw how quickly two people can go from apathy to cahoots with one glance. That’s love. It’s that connection that makes people stay, helps them endure. Thank you for teaching me, for loving me, for being there."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2017/feb/11/stephen-collins-on-how-to-relax-cartoon","type":"interactive","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-11T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Stephen Collins on how to relax – cartoon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2017/feb/11/stephen-collins-on-how-to-relax-cartoon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2017/feb/11/stephen-collins-on-how-to-relax-cartoon","fields":{"headline":"Stephen Collins on how to relax – cartoon","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2017/feb/12/americas-eviction-epidemic-matthew-desmond-housing-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-12T10:00:03Z","webTitle":"No place like home: America’s eviction epidemic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/12/americas-eviction-epidemic-matthew-desmond-housing-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/feb/12/americas-eviction-epidemic-matthew-desmond-housing-crisis","fields":{"headline":"No place like home: America’s eviction epidemic","bodyText":"Even in the most desolate areas of American cities, evictions used to be rare enough to draw crowds. Eviction riots erupted during the Depression, even though the number of poor families who faced eviction each year was a fraction of what it is today. A New York Times account of community resistance to the eviction of three Bronx families in February 1932 observed: “Probably because of the cold, the crowd numbered only 1,000.” Sometimes neighbours confronted the marshals directly, sitting on the evicted family’s furniture to prevent its removal or moving the family back in despite the judge’s orders. The marshals themselves were ambivalent about carrying out evictions. It wasn’t why they carried a badge and a gun. These days, there are sheriff squads whose full-time job is to carry out eviction and foreclosure orders. There are moving companies specialising in evictions, their crews working all day, every weekday. There are hundreds of data-mining companies that sell landlords tenant-screening reports listing past evictions and court filings. These days, housing courts swell, forcing commissioners to settle cases in hallways or makeshift offices crammed with old desks and broken file cabinets – and most tenants don’t even show up. Low-income families have grown used to the rumble of moving trucks, the early morning knocks at the door, the belongings lining the kerb. In America, families have watched their incomes stagnate, or even fall, while their housing costs have soared. Median rent has increased by more than 70% since 1995. Meanwhile, only one in four families who qualify for housing assistance receive it, and in the nation’s biggest cities the waiting list for public housing is not counted in years but decades. The typical poor American family does not live in public housing but receives no government assistance whatsoever. The result? Today, the majority of poor renting families in America spend more than half of their income on housing, and at least one in four dedicates more than 70% to paying the rent and keeping the lights on. It is estimated that millions of Americans are evicted every year because they can’t make rent. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a city of fewer than 105,000 renter households, landlords evict roughly 16,000 adults and children each year. That’s 16 families evicted through the court system daily. New York City sees 60 marshal evictions a day. The most recent version of the American Housing Survey asked people: “Do you think you’ll be evicted soon?” Renters in more than 2.8m homes said yes. A landlord can evict tenants through a formal, court process. But there are other ways, cheaper and quicker ways, to remove a family. Some landlords pay tenants a couple of hundred dollars to leave by the end of the week. Some take off the front door. Nearly half of all forced moves experienced by renting families in Milwaukee are “informal evictions” that take place in the shadow of the law. If you count all forms of involuntary displacement – formal and informal evictions, landlord foreclosures, building condemnations – you discover that between 2009 and 2011 more than one in eight Milwaukee renters experienced a forced move. That is a shockingly high amount of residential insecurity. The face of America’s eviction epidemic belongs to mothers with children. Until recently, the housing court in New York City’s South Bronx had a daycare facility inside it because there were so many children coming through its doors. Eviction’s fallout is severe. Losing a home sends families to shelters, abandoned houses, and the street. It invites depression and illness, compels families to move into degrading housing in dangerous neighbourhoods, uproots communities, and harms children. Eviction is not merely a condition of poverty; it is a cause of it too. Since the publication of Evicted, I have had countless conversations with concerned families across America. Teachers in under-served communities have told me about high classroom turnover rates, which hinder students’ ability to reach their full potential. Public-sector union organisers have told me about how firefighters, police officers, and nurses can no longer afford to live in the cities they serve and protect. Healthcare providers have helped me see that decent, safe housing can promote physical and mental wellness; and engaged citizens have shown me the civic potential of stable, vibrant blocks where neighbours know one another by name. But eviction can erase all that, destabilising families, schools and entire communities. The lack of access to affordable, decent housing sits at the root of so many of America’s social ills. Without stable shelter, everything else falls apart. This means it is impossible to address poverty in America without fixing housing. This is also not only America’s problem. In the United Kingdom, the cost of an average house requires 10 years of the average British salary; the average London house requires double that. Rents in Delhi’s business district now rival those in midtown Manhattan. Between 2008 and 2014, housing prices in São Paulo increased by more than 200%. Over the past several decades, millions of people have migrated to cities from rural villages and towns. In 1960, roughly a third of the planet lived in urban areas; today, more than half does. Cities have experienced real income gains that have brought about global poverty reductions. But therein lies the rub, as the growth of cities has also been accompanied by an astonishing surge in land values and housing costs, especially in “superstar cities” whose real-estate markets have experienced an influx of global capital. Roughly 330m urban households worldwide live in substandard or unaffordable housing demanding more than 30% of their income. By 2025, based on migration trends and global income projections, that number is expected to climb to 440m households, representing 1.6 billion people. The world is becoming urbanised, and cities are becoming unaffordable to millions everywhere. The two great global threats of our time are climate change and unlivable cities. Let’s get to work. ***** Larraine’s trailer was spotless and uncluttered. When a visitor commented on its cleanliness, she would smile and credit her handheld steamer or share tips, like slipping in an aspirin when washing whites. She had lived in her trailer for about a year and had come to like it, especially in the morning, before the gossips began congregating outside. She now had everything just-so. She had found white serving utensils to match the white cupboards in the kitchen and a small desk for her old computer. None of this made paying Tobin [owner of the trailer park] 77% of her income any easier. Larraine studied her phone, dialling a number by heart. “Yes. I was wondering. I was told that you help people with their rent?… Oh. Oh, no?… OK.” She hung up. Larraine dialled the Social Development Commission, an anti-poverty organisation. They couldn’t help. Someone had told her that the YMCA on 27th made emergency loans. She called them. “Yes. I was instructed to call you because I was told you could help me with my rent… My rent… Rent. R-E-N-T.” By mid-morning, Larraine had dialled all the nonprofit, city, and state agencies she could think of. None came through. ***** The movers started the trucks early in the morning, diesel engines grumbling as the men gathered with cigarettes and mugs of black coffee. The city was soggy from the previous night’s rain. Some of the men were young and athletic with pierced ears. Others were barrel-chested and middle-aged, slapping their leather gloves on their jeans. The oldest among them was Tim, lean and sour-faced with reddish-brown skin, stubble, and a fresh pack of Salems in his front pocket. Almost all of the men were black and wore boots and work jackets with the name of their company – Eagle Moving and Storage – and various clever slogans: “Moving’s for the birds”, “Service with a grunt”, “Order some carryout”. The Brittain brothers – Tom, Dave and Jim – had taken over the company from their father. When he had started it back in 1958, there were only one or two eviction moves a week. He ran a two-truck operation out of his home and would pick up men from the rescue mission when he needed an extra hand. Fifty years later, the company employed 35 people, most of them full-time movers, owned a fleet of vans and 18ft trucks, and operated out of a three-storey building that had originally held a furniture factory. In total, 40% of their business came from eviction moves. Eagle’s moving crew worked with two sheriff deputies. The deputies would knock on the door to announce the eviction; the movers would follow, clearing out the home. Landlords footed the bill. A formal eviction that involved sheriffs and movers could run to about $600 (£482), when you included the court filing charge and process-server fee. Landlords could add these costs to a judgment but often never got them back. Dave Brittain, a white man with greying hair and a long stride, gave the men the signal, and they climbed into the trucks. The sheriffs met the moving crew outside an apartment complex on Silver Spring Drive. John, the older of the two deputies and the one who most looked the part – broad shoulders, thick jowls, sunglasses, cop moustache, gum – gave the door a knock. A small black woman answered, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes. When John looked around and saw a tidy house with dishes drying in the rack and not a box packed, he turned to his partner and asked, “Are we in the right house?” He placed a call back to the office. When Sheriff John walked into a house and saw mattresses on the floor, grease on the ceiling, cockroaches on the walls, and clothes, hair extensions, and toys scattered about, he didn’t double-check. Sometimes tenants had already abandoned the place, leaving behind dead animals and rotting food. Sometimes the movers puked. “The first rule of evictions,” Sheriff John liked to say, “is never open the fridge.” When things were especially bad, when an apartment was covered in trash or dog shit, or when one of the guys found a needle, Dave would nod and say, “Junk in”, leaving the mess for the landlord. John hung up the phone and waved the movers in. At that moment, the house no longer belonged to the occupants, and the movers took it over. Grabbing dollies, hump straps, and boxes, the men began clearing every room. They worked quickly and without hesitation. There were no children in the house that morning, but there were toys and diapers. The woman who answered the door moved slowly, looking overcome. A sob broke through her blank face when she opened the refrigerator and saw that the movers had cleaned it out, even packing the ice trays. She found her things piled in the back alley. Sheriff John looked to the sky as it began to rain and then looked back at Tim. “Snowstorm. Rainstorm. We don’t give a shit,” Tim said, lighting a Salem. ***** Larraine had grown up with two brothers and two sisters in a squat, yellow-brick public housing complex across the street from a baseball field in south Milwaukee. Her mother was an invalid, her body swollen on account of her thyroid. Her father was a window washer. Larraine remembered him bringing home bags of Ziegler Giant Bars when he washed the windows of the candy factory, or armloads of fresh bread when the day’s schedule took him to certain local restaurants. Larraine loved her childhood, especially her doting father. “We didn’t know we were poor,” she said. Larraine had struggled in school. In 10th grade, she decided she’d had enough. “Everyone around me was making it but me.” She dropped out and began working as a seamstress for $1.50 an hour. She went to work at Everbrite, which manufactured corporate signs. During a strike, she left and found work as a machinist at R-W Enterprises on Sherman Avenue. Her father constantly worried about his young daughter working with sheet metal and operating punch press machines. Maybe that’s why, when a metal disc came down on her hand one day and pinched off the top half of her two middle fingers, all she remembered doing was crying out for her daddy. At 22, Larraine married a man named Jerry Lee. They had a daughter three years later, and another two years after that. But soon the marriage began to unwind. It got to the point where Jerry Lee began bringing women back to their home. They divorced after eight years, and Larraine began life as a single mother. Those years were filled with poverty and double shifts and freedom and laughter. If you asked Larraine, she would tell you they were some of the best years of her life. She would bring the girls to her day job cleaning houses. They’d pitch in, and Larraine would split her pay cheque. ***** The Eagle Moving trucks stopped outside a north-side duplex with cream siding. An older child answered the door: a girl, maybe 17, with shorn hair, dark-brown skin and unflinching grey eyes. Dave and the crew hung back, waiting for John to give the OK. The deputies always went first and absorbed tenants’ blowback if there was any. Things often got loud; they rarely got violent. Sheriffs used different diffusion strategies. John preferred meeting aggression with aggression. Once, he called the sheriff’s office in front of a woman in a bathrobe and headwrap, saying into the phone, “If she doesn’t shut her mouth and start talking like an adult, I’m going to throw her shit in the street!” The conversation with Grey Eyes was taking longer than usual. Dave watched a white man in a flannel shirt park his truck and approach the door. Landlord, he figured. After a few more minutes, John nodded at Dave, and the crew sprang up. Inside the house, the movers found five children. Tim recognised one child as the daughter of a man who used to work on the crew. It wasn’t uncommon to evict someone you knew. Most of the movers lived on the north side and had at some point experienced the awkward moment of packing up someone from their church or block. Tim had evicted his own daughter. But this house felt strange. Dave asked what was going on, and John explained that the name on the eviction order belonged to the mother of several of the children. She had died two months earlier, and the children had simply gone on living in the house, by themselves. As the movers swept through the rooms, Grey Eyes took charge, giving orders to the other children; the youngest was a boy of about eight or nine. Upstairs, the movers found ratty mattresses on the floor and empty liquor bottles displayed like trophies. In the damp basement, clothes were flung everywhere. The house and the yard were littered with trash. “Disgusting,” Tim said of the roaches scaling the kitchen wall. As the landlord changed the locks with a power drill and the movers pushed the contents of the house on to the wet kerb, the children began to run around and laugh. When the move was done, the crew gathered by the trucks, instinctively stomping the ground to shake loose any stowaway roaches. Those who smoked reached for their packs. They didn’t know where the children would go, and they didn’t ask. With this job, you saw things. The guy with 10,000 audio cassette tapes of UFO activity who kept yelling, “Everything is in order! Everything is in order!” The woman with jars full of urine. The guy who lived in the basement while his pack of chihuahuas overran the house. Just a week earlier, a man had told Sheriff John to give him a minute. Then he shut the door and shot himself in the head. But the squalor was what got under your skin; its smells and sights were what you tried to drink away after your shift. Grey Eyes leaned against the porch rail and took long drags of her own cigarette. ***** Larraine considered asking her brothers and sisters for help. There was her eldest sister, Odessa, who lived a few miles away and spent her days in a nightgown on a corduroy recliner, watching talk shows next to a lampstand crowded with prescription medication containers. She was on supplemental security income, and wouldn’t be able to help even if she were willing, which she wasn’t. Beaker was in worse shape than Odessa. A towering man with loose skin, Beaker was 65 and a heavy smoker who relied on a walker. The family, in the midwestern way, liked to poke fun at his failing health. “We’ve got the funeral home on speed dial!” Even if he wasn’t in the hospital, Beaker’s social security stipend was even less than Larraine’s. He could afford the rent but little else, living hard in a filthy trailer covered in clothes, cigarette boxes and butts, food-encrusted plates, and stray dog shit. Then there was Ruben, the blessed child. He was the only one who hadn’t inherited their father’s Croatian nose. And he didn’t live in the trailer park, or even a trailer park, or even in Cudahy, like Odessa. He lived in Oak Creek, in his own home, which was big enough to host everyone for Thanksgiving dinner every year. Larraine could ask Ruben for the rent money, but she wasn’t close with her baby brother. Plus, asking for help from better-off kin was complicated. Those ties were banked, saved for emergency situations or opportunities to get ahead. People were careful not to overdraw their account because when family members with money grew exhausted by repeated requests, they sometimes withheld support for long periods of time, pegging their relatives’ misfortunes to individual failings. This was one reason why family members in the best position to help were often not asked to do so. Larraine thought her best bet was to approach her younger daughter, Jayme. Larraine found a ride to Arby’s [restaurant], where Jayme worked. Jayme looked up from a pile of dirty dishes, rolled her eyes at her mother, and came walking to the front, her thick auburn curls tucked beneath an Arby’s hat. She was not much taller than Larraine and wore wire glasses and a nun’s expression: warm but distant. Jayme whispered, “Mom, you’re not supposed to be here.” “I know,” Larraine said, dropping her smile to look deeply sad. “I know, honey. But I just got a 24-hour eviction notice. They are going to throw me out if I don’t pay the rent. And, um, I was wondering if there was any way you could help me?” “I can’t.” “OK.” “I can’t.” Larraine gathered herself in the Arby’s parking lot. Office Susie had told her to ask her family for rent. She often heard a similar line at the crisis centres. When the social workers behind the glass asked her, “Well, don’t you have family that can help?” Larraine sometimes would reply, “Yes, I have family, and, no, they can’t help.” ***** At the next house, a Hispanic woman in her early 40s answered the door holding a wooden spoon. “Can I have until Wednesday?” she asked. The deputies shook their heads: no. She nodded with forced resolve or submission. Dave stepped on to the porch. “Ma’am,” he said, “we can place your things in our truck or on the kerb. Which would you prefer?” She opted for the kerb. “Kerbside service, baby!” Dave hollered back to the crew. Dave stepped into the house and tripped over a Dora the Explorer chair. He reached over an older man sitting at the table and flipped on more lights. The house was warm and smelled of garlic and spices. One of the deputies pointed to the built-in cabinets in the kitchen. “This is the kind of shit I like,” he told his partner. “They don’t make this stuff any more. Tight.” The woman walked in circles, trying to think where to begin. She told one of the deputies that she knew she was being foreclosed but that she didn’t know when they were coming. Her attorney had told her that it could be a day, five days, a week, three weeks; she decided to ride it out. She and her three children had been in the house for five years. The year before, she had been talked into refinancing with a sub-prime loan. Her payments kept going up, jumping from $920 to $1,250 a month, and her hours at Potawatomi casino were cut back after her maternity leave. Hispanic and African American neighbourhoods had been targeted by the sub-prime lending industry: renters were lured into buying bad mortgages, and homeowners were encouraged to refinance under riskier terms. Then it all came crashing down. Between 2007 and 2010, the average white family experienced an 11% reduction in wealth, but the average black family lost 31% of its wealth. The average Hispanic family lost 44.7%. A mover started in on a girl’s bedroom, painted pink with a sign on the door announcing: “The princess sleeps here.” Another took on the dishevelled office, packing Resumés for Dummies into a box with a chalkboard counting down the remaining days of school. The eldest child, a seventh-grade boy, tried to help by taking out the trash. His younger sister, the princess, held her two-year-old sister’s hand on the porch. Upstairs, the movers were trying not to step on the toddler’s toys, which when kicked would protest with beeping sounds and flashing lights. As the move went on, the woman slowed down. At first, she had borne down on the emergency with focus and energy, almost running through the house with one hand grabbing something and the other holding up the phone. Now she was wandering through the halls aimlessly, almost drunkenly. Her face had that look. The movers and the deputies knew it well. It was the look of someone realising that her family would be homeless in a matter of hours. It was something like denial giving way to the surrealism of the scene: the speed and violence of it all; sheriffs leaning against your wall, hands resting on holsters; all these strangers, these sweating men, piling your things outside, drinking water from your sink poured into your cups, using your bathroom. It was the look of being undone by a wave of questions. What do I need for tonight, for this week? Who should I call? Where is the medication? Where will we go? It was the face of a mother who climbs out of the cellar to find the tornado has levelled the house. ***** Larraine answered a knock at her door and found two sheriff deputies standing on her small porch. Behind them, the Eagle Moving trucks were pulling into the trailer park. It was a tight pinch for the drivers, manoeuvring through the narrow entrance, minding the unleashed dogs and children, and backing up to the designated spot; but Eagle had been in Tobin’s park plenty of times. It was the last move of the day, and the crew was sore and eager to get home. The movers were hoping for a “junk in”, but Larraine asked that her things be taken to storage. The movers began filling boxes with Larraine’s things: the white utensils in the kitchen, a Christmas gift for her grandson. Larraine stood outside, silently looking on. The movers carried out her chair, her washing machine, her refrigerator, stove, dining table. Next came the boxes with who knows what inside: perhaps winter jackets or shoes or shampoo. The neighbours began to gather. Some grabbed beers and positioned lawn chairs as if watching a Nascar race. It didn’t take long. Larraine was cleaned out in less than an hour. She watched the truck lurch away. Her things were headed to Eagle’s storage warehouse, a dimly lit expanse with clear lightbulbs strung from a ceiling supported by large wooden pillars. Inside, there were hundreds upon hundreds of piles, each representing an eviction or foreclosure. The piles were stacked to eye level and individually encircled in shrink-wrap like so many silken-wound insects on a spider’s web. Up close, the contents were visible through the taut clear wrapping: scratched-up furniture, lamps, bathroom scales, and everywhere children’s things – rocking horses, strollers, baby swings, bouncy seats. The Brittain brothers thought of the warehouse as a “giant stomach”, digesting the city. They charged $25 per pallet per month. The average evicted family’s possessions took up four pallets, or 400 cubic feet. Larraine would have to find a way to pay her storage bill. If she fell 90 days behind, Eagle would get rid of her pile to make room for a new one. This was the fate of roughly 70% of lots confiscated in evictions or foreclosures. Most of the stuff ended up in the dump. Larraine dragged herself to her brother’s trailer. She swallowed pain pills, including 200mg of Lyrica. In silence, she let the painkillers work. Once they had, she looked around, let out a muffled scream, and began punching the couch over and over and over again. • Evicted by Matthew Desmond is published in paperback by Penguin on 2 March (£10.99).

This week, Melania Trump refiled a $150m (£120m) lawsuit against the corporation that publishes the Daily Mail’s website for reporting rumours that she worked as a high-end escort in the 1990s. The filing argued that the article had hurt her chances of establishing “multimillion-dollar business relationships” during the years in which she would be “one of the most photographed women in the world”. Ethics watchdogs are concerned that Melania Trump appears to be trying to profit from a high-profile position that is usually centred on public service. Norman Eisen, Obama’s chief ethics counsellor, told Associated Press: “The Trumps are using the White House like the Kardashians used reality TV, to build and vastly expand their overall business enterprises.” On Wednesday, Trump hit out at Nordstrom, the department store, for dropping his daughter Ivanka’s clothing and accessory line. “My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person – always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!” the president tweeted. His comments came after Nordstrom announced last week that it would stop carrying Ivanka’s label due to poor sales. “We’ve said all along we make buying decisions based on performance,” a statement issued at the time said. “We’ve got thousands of brands – more than 2,000 offered on the site alone. Reviewing their merit and making edits is part of the regular rhythm of our business.” But the move followed a weeks-long boycott campaign organised by an anti-Trump activist group called “Grab Your Wallet”, who demanded Nordstrom sever its business ties with the Trump family. Three days prior to dropping Ivanka’s brand, Nordstrom also issued an internal statement in support of immigrants following the president’s executive order temporarily banning immigrants and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries. It has maintained that the two were not connected. After Trump’s tweet, the department store chain’s shares dropped but later bounced back. Trump’s tweets have in the past also affected shares in US automakers, Boeing and Carrier. Asked about that tweet later, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said: “He has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success ... For someone to take out their concern with his policies on a family member of his is just – is not acceptable, and the president has every right as a father to stand up for them.” An AP review of business filings has found that Melania Trump has not stepped away from companies that manage royalties from her name-branded products. As of Tuesday, she was listed in New York filings as the CEO of Melania Marks Accessories Member Corp, the holding company of Melania Marks Accessories LLC, both of which remain active. Those companies managed between $15,000 and $50,000 in royalties from her accessories lines, the Trumps’ May 2016 financial disclosure filing shows. Scott Amey, general counsel of the Washington watchdog Project on Government Oversight, said the first lady’s ongoing enterprises are “another example of the first family blurring the line between public service and private business interests”. Richard Painter, who advised former President George W Bush on ethics, said the Daily Mail lawsuit’s language suggests the first lady is engaging “in an unprecedented, clear breach of rules about using her government position for private gain”. Melania Trump has maintained a relatively low profile since her husband’s inauguration and continues to live in New York, where her son Barron attends school. The lawsuit was filed by her California attorney Charles Harder, who was hired in September to take on Mail Media Inc and Maryland blogger Webster Tarpley in the original suit. The original suit, which was filed in Maryland, attacked rumours it described as “100% false” that Trump had worked for an escort service. Both Tarpley and the Daily Mail had issued retractions before the suit was filed. The lawsuit against Tarpley was settled for “a substantial sum”. Last week a judge dismissed the filing against the Mail, on the grounds that Mail Media Inc is not based in the state of Maryland. The lawsuit submitted on Monday was filed in New York, where Mail Media Inc has offices. The updated filing said the article published in August caused Trump’s brand to lose significant value as well as major business opportunities that were otherwise available to her. It stated: “[The] plaintiff had the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity … to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multimillion-dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world.” Asked for comment about reporting of the lawsuit, Harder told the Guardian the filing was being “misinterpreted”. “The first lady has no intention of using her position for profit and will not do so. It is not a possibility. Any statements to the contrary are being misinterpreted,” he said. The New York suit did not specifically refer to any plan to market products in Melania’s name during her tenure as first lady. It did state, however, that the Mail article “impugned her fitness to perform her duties as first lady of the United States” as well as “her duties in business”. It added that the article caused her “significant humiliation in the community and emotional distress”. The lawsuit has raised further questions about the ethical implications of the Trump family’s business ventures. In a break from past practice, Donald Trump continues to financially benefit from his global business empire. Previous presidents and their families have divested from business interests and placed their holdings in a blind trust, although there is no legal requirement to do so. Trump handed daily management of the real estate, property management and licensing business to his adult sons and a longtime Trump Organisation employee. Melania Trump’s marketing has also previously drawn scrutiny. In January, alongside a biography and list of her charitable work and interests, the new White House website took the unusual step of providing details of the Slovenian-born first lady’s magazine cover appearances and her jewellery line. The website originally listed the brand names of Trump’s jewellery lines sold on QVC, but was shortly updated to remove any mention of QVC over concerns it could be seen as an endorsement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/feb/09/jack-harris-the-wide-afternoon-review-rootbeat","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T18:00:29Z","webTitle":"Jack Harris: The Wide Afternoon review – poetic and powerful folk melodies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/09/jack-harris-the-wide-afternoon-review-rootbeat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/feb/09/jack-harris-the-wide-afternoon-review-rootbeat","fields":{"headline":"Jack Harris: The Wide Afternoon review – poetic and powerful folk melodies","bodyText":"This is the first album in five years from a highly original singer-songwriter.

Her expansive, red-blooded approach to these arias and duets – 10 by Handel, one by Purcell – won’t suit all tastes, but her singing is genuinely distinctive, thoughtful and never less than convincing. The selection leans towards weighty laments – Agrippina’s Pensieri is a highlight – but in lighter numbers, including Alcina’s Tornami a vagheggiar, she sounds as fresh and agile as one could want. The Academia Montis Regalis offer vigour if not always the last word in poise or refinement; Lascia ch’io pianga could be the soundtrack to a state procession. Karine Deshayes’s fruity mezzo-soprano is well matched with Yoncheva in duets from Rodelinda and Theodora. The latter, like Dido’s Lament, is in English – but best to listen without thinking too hard about that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/feb/09/holst-the-planetsstrauss-also-sprach-zarathustra-cd-review-large-scale-intensity","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T15:15:26Z","webTitle":"Holst: The Planets/Strauss: Also Sprach Zarathustra CD review – large-scale intensity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/09/holst-the-planetsstrauss-also-sprach-zarathustra-cd-review-large-scale-intensity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/feb/09/holst-the-planetsstrauss-also-sprach-zarathustra-cd-review-large-scale-intensity","fields":{"headline":"Holst: The Planets/Strauss: Also Sprach Zarathustra CD review – large-scale intensity","bodyText":"The National Youth Orchestra’s first recording for Chandos is of the kind of repertoire it is uniquely placed to make its own: size matters if an orchestra is to capture the juggernaut roar of Holst’s Mars or the gruff, belly-shaking jollity of his Jupiter, and at 164-strong “the world’s greatest orchestra of teenagers”, as it not unjustifiably styles itself, is as big as they come. The two works here – Holst’s Planets and Strauss’s Also Sprach Zarathustra – were recorded in Birmingham immediately after the orchestra’s Prom last summer, and the impact of Strauss’s iconic opening is reinforced by the heft of the Symphony Hall organ. Occasionally one misses the refinement of a professional outfit, but rarely: more often one is struck by the warmth and intensity of the string sound and the quality of the wind solos.

His new discs are increasingly rare events – the previous one, containing three of Bach’s English Suites, appeared in 2014, and the Mozart works here date back to 2005, the two by Schumann to 2013. All the performances, though, show the lucidity and objectivity that have always been such outstanding qualities of Anderszewski’s playing. He treats Mozart’s C minor Fantasy K475 as a substantial introduction to the sonata K457 in the same key, moving from one to the other without a break and never over-emphasising the tragic implications of the home key in either work. There’s a brisk efficiency about it all that leaves no room for indulgence, and Anderszewski’s treatment of the great Schumann Fantasy is equally matter-of-fact, almost classically restrained. Even the technical challenges of the final pages of the central march are met without any fuss. It’s almost too straightforward at times, but he brings the same qualities to a touching performance of Schumann’s last piano work, the so-called Ghost Variations, based on the chorale-like theme already used in the Fantasiestücke Op 111 and the Violin Concerto."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/feb/08/kagel-the-compass-rose-ensemble-aleph-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-08T17:38:04Z","webTitle":"Kagel: The 8 Pieces of the Wind Rose CD review – a musical journey to be savoured","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/08/kagel-the-compass-rose-ensemble-aleph-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/feb/08/kagel-the-compass-rose-ensemble-aleph-review","fields":{"headline":"Kagel: The 8 Pieces of the Wind Rose CD review – a musical journey to be savoured","bodyText":"More than eight years after Mauricio Kagel’s death, it’s still not easy to fit him into the landscape of European music in the second half of the 20th century. Born in Argentina, Kagel moved to Europe in 1957, and as a late arrival on the post-1945 avant garde scene, he always seemed happy to cultivate his position as an outsider. His works were often wry and perceptive critiques of what his contemporaries were doing and and at their best they questioned the whole purpose of music and the assumptions on which it was based. Towards the end of Kagel’s life, the teasing, confrontational world of his earlier pieces, with their theatricality and regular attacks on the conventions of performance, was often abandoned in favour of pieces that brought together bundles of cultural and historical references. The eight pieces for this “salon orchestra”, The Compass Rose, define that world better than any of his other works. Composed between 1988 and 1994, they were named after the directions on a compass, with the pieces increasing in length as Kagel became more fascinated by the allusive possibilities they suggested. As someone who grew up in southern Argentina, Kagel’s associations of geographical directions were very different from those of a European. For him the idea of north-west conjured thoughts of the Andes and the music of its indigenous peoples, while north-east suggested Amazonia. In The Compass Rose, that perspective shifts from piece to piece. South West depicts a musical journey beginning in Mexico and crossing the Pacific to New Zealand; in South East the music looks from Cuba towards Colombia, Venezuela and the Guyanas and the popular musics to be found there; North depicts the elemental sounds of a journey around the Arctic Circle. That rich fund of references is woven into pieces that are both alluring and disconcerting. They create a musical world that constantly changes, with rhythmic and harmonic discontinuities and non sequiturs, and melodies that never quite end where you expect. The eight pieces can be performed individually or in any combination, and Reinbert de Leeuw and the Schönberg Ensemble recorded the last three, South West, West and North, more than a decade ago. But this is the first recording of all eight, done with wonderful suppleness and wit by Ensemble Aleph. It’s perhaps not a set to play all in one go – more something to savour piece by piece, with regular amazement to be found in the sheer range of Kagel’s imagination."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/feb/12/the-refugees-viet-thanh-nguyen-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-12T10:00:03Z","webTitle":"The Refugees by Viet Thanh Nguyen – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/12/the-refugees-viet-thanh-nguyen-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/feb/12/the-refugees-viet-thanh-nguyen-review","fields":{"headline":"The Refugees by Viet Thanh Nguyen – review","bodyText":"Viet Thanh Nguyen arrived in the US in 1975, living in a camp for Vietnamese refugees.

His quirkily intimate work has always needed a certain level of indulgence and in the past I’ve been happy to give it. But 20th Century Women tests this tolerance to breaking point. Annette Bening is well cast, and gives a well judged performance, a variation on her uptight and self-questioning mom from American Beauty. However, the film is exasperatingly supercilious and smug – unfocused, self-consciously cute, nostalgic and empathetic, but never properly funny. It feels like someone else’s long therapy session. The setting is Santa Monica, 1979, and Dorothea (Bening) is a fiftysomething single mother with bold progressive instincts. She is bringing up her teenage son Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann) in a big house without her husband on the scene and so asks her female tenants to help “raise” him to be a good man. This is trendy photographer Abbie (Greta Gerwig) and also Julie (Elle Fanning), who to Jamie’s dismay wants to be his platonic confidante: friends without benefits. There is also a male tenant on the scene: hot odd-job guy William (Billy Crudup), who does his bit to complicate the group sexual dynamic. After some resistance, the women do help Jamie to approach manhood, and with a mixture of pain and pleasure Bening realises that her plan is taking Jamie away from her and that part of her own development lies in letting go. Bening, Gerwig, Zumann and Fanning give honest performances. But the film is so smoothly pleased with itself, with a sub-Andersonian habit of putting up quirky stills, intertitles and stock thematic archive footage against narrative voiceover and coyly zoning out into ambient moods and epiphanies, with speeded-up shots indebted to Reggio’s Koyaanisqatsi. The action leans heavily on musical cues and makes an unearned claim on the rigour and brilliance of Talking Heads. It’s unbearably affected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/08/somalia-goes-to-polls-president-mohamud","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-08T12:02:34Z","webTitle":"'It's pretty brave': Mogadishu on lockdown as Somali MPs elect president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/08/somalia-goes-to-polls-president-mohamud","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/08/somalia-goes-to-polls-president-mohamud","fields":{"headline":"'It's pretty brave': Mogadishu on lockdown as Somali MPs elect president","bodyText":"Politicians are voting in a high-security compound at an airport in the Somali capital Mogadishu to elect a president for the unstable east African state. Growing evidence of the systematic purchase of votes risks undermining Wednesday’s long-awaited poll, which has been described as a “way station” to political stability and full democracy. Critics say the election – the most extensive democratic exercise for decades – has entrenched divides between the country’s many traditional clans and encouraged graft, some fuelled by Middle Eastern and regional powers seeking to secure the election of candidates seen as favourable to their interests. Somalia, which faces a tenacious insurgency by Islamic militants and a looming famine, was among seven Muslim-majority states named in Donald Trump’s contentious executive order suspending immigration last week. It is a big recipient of international humanitarian aid. Some involved in the vote remain confident, calling it an important step for the nation. “We are well-prepared to elect a new president. It’s a test for a maturing democracy,” said Ahmed Ali, a Somali parliamentarian. Michael Keating, the UN special representative for Somalia, described the poll as a “political process with electoral features” that was “pretty brave to do”. The complex process of selecting a president began months ago with 14,000 elders and prominent regional figures choosing 275 MPs and 54 senators. These will now choose whether to back President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud for a second five-year term or one of 21 rivals. It is likely to take several rounds before a winner is declared. “Though it doesn’t solve Somalia’s many challenges, it’s an expression of some political progress … and does highlight a vibrant electoral and political engagement,” said Ahmed Soliman, an east Africa expert at Chatham House. “What we are seeing is the selection of a president to take the country forward … If you look at the region, and countries such as Sudan, Ethiopia, Djibouti or Eritrea, there is a clear contrast. The election is impressive in the context.” In Mogadishu, the capital, streets were deserted with many residents following the voting on television. Ali Abdi Haji, a 23-year-old student, said he had never experienced an election. “Today is great day for me and for people in Somalia. All I can do today is just watch TV and pray for the country so we can have a good leader who is committed to make this country peaceful and democratic,” said Haji, watching the broadcast with his family in their home in the Hodan district of Mogadishu. Waris Nur, 34, a businesswoman, said she wanted a leader who “can make the country peaceful and without terrorism”. Al-Shabaab, the Islamic militant movement that has fought for power in Somalia since 2009 and is affiliated with al-Qaida, has been slowly driven out of its key strongholds in a campaign by regional and Somali troops but still launches frequent attacks in Mogadishu and elsewhere. An attack on a military base 10 miles (15km) south of Mogadishu on Tuesday was repulsed while several mortar bombs in Mogadishu on the same day caused no casualties. On Wednesday morning, the group stormed a hotel in the semi-autonomous Puntland region, further north up the coast, killing four guards. The threat from al-Shabaab forced the government and its western backers to scrap a plan to give each adult a vote. Officials decided that the challenge of securing polling stations across the country of 10 million people was insurmountable. Keating, the UN official, said reports that al-Shabaab had allowed the poll to go ahead were wrong. “They are not shrugging their shoulders and ignoring the election. That is rubbish,” he said. “Al-Shabaab have tried repeatedly to disrupt it. They have targeted MPs and electoral sites. They do not like this. It goes against everything they stand for.” However, the biggest problem for the polls may be allegations of systematic corruption. Rival presidential candidates have accused each other of buying the loyalty of lawmakers, and local anti-corruption campaigners say tens of thousands of dollars have been handed to individuals to secure support in the vote. “This is probably the most expensive election, per vote, in history,” the Mogadishu-based anti-corruption group Marqaati said in a report released on Tuesday. Hasan Abdurahman Mohamed, 56, a university lecturer in Mogadishu, described being shown a cheque for $10,000 (£8,000) by one new MP who asked him to lobby other MPs in favour of a particular candidate. Hashi Siad, 67, a clan elder, said presidential candidates were “in a hurry to pay bribes to MPs and elders and even lobbyists who can have some kind of influence”. Some of the candidates will pay as much as $50,000, he said. Hours before voting was due to start, the chairman of the presidential election committee, Abdirahman Beyle, told MPs they would not be allowed to enter the voting hall with their mobile phones. Beyle said the measure was to prevent politicians taking pictures of their ballot papers to prove to those who had given them money that they had voted as instructed. Mohamed Omar, an MP, said, as a devout Muslim he had rejected a series of bribes but knew of other new parliamentarians “who were paid big money”. Western donors, who have often criticised Mohamud’s government for corruption, say the vote is far from perfect but marks a modest step forward from 2012 when just 135 elders picked the lawmakers, who chose the president. They also point to the levels of female participation: almost a quarter of elected MPs are women. Waris, the businesswoman, said she also hoped for “a leader who can protect our women rights because women are the largest population in our country and they are not given equal rights”. Fadumo Dayib, a Somali politician who briefly campaigned as a presidential candidate last year, said female MPs would “not stand a chance” if they tried to assert themselves. “They could have had women associations as voters. Instead the vote was given to clan elders who just selected the women to represent their interests. If [the women] do not do what they are told they will be ostracised … The international community could have asked for much, much more. It has lost a great opportunity,” Dayib said. Mohamud, who has led the country since 2012 in the effort to rebuild Somalia after more than two decades of war and chaos, has the support of about a third of lawmakers, analysts say, giving him an edge but not a guarantee of victory. A win for the incumbent would not please western powers. British parliamentarians reported last year that “there is a tangible sense amongst western donors that President Mohamud’s government has not been the fresh start that Somalia needed”. A key rival is Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, a conservative who was a leader of the Union of Islamic Courts, a hardline grassroots clerical movement that took control of much of Somalia 10 years ago. The election, which has been largely paid for by the US and EU states, has provoked fierce interest from rival Middle Eastern powers keen to extend their influence in a strategically important part of the world. The United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Turkey and Saudi Arabia have all been accused of funding the campaigns of specific candidates and thus indirectly fuelling corruption. The US and other international powers have pressed Somalia to move ahead with elections as an important symbol of recovery. In the past decade, the US has given $1.5bn in humanitarian aid and another $240m to support Somalia’s political and economic recovery, and $196m in overall funding is planned for 2017. “There are a lot of problems [in Somalia] of course, but it is not a place falling apart, it is a place coming together,” said Keating."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/feb/08/hans-rosling-tributes-melinda-gates-big-hearted-optimist","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-08T12:27:58Z","webTitle":"'A big-hearted optimist': Hans Rosling tributes pour in on social media","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/feb/08/hans-rosling-tributes-melinda-gates-big-hearted-optimist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/feb/08/hans-rosling-tributes-melinda-gates-big-hearted-optimist","fields":{"headline":"'A big-hearted optimist': Hans Rosling tributes pour in on social media","bodyText":"Tributes have flowed in on social media for Hans Rosling, who died aged 68 on Tuesday. Rosling, a visionary statistician and educator, had a gift for analysing complex development data on issues such as global health, population and climate change, and presenting it in a compelling, accessible way. His aim was to present a “fact-based worldview”, challenging assumptions on development with his forensic examination of figures. Ulrika Modéer, the Swedish secretary of state for development cooperation, paid her respects to Rosling on Twitter. The World Economic Forum shared a video of a talk he gave in Davos in 2015: “Farewell @HansRosling, who passed away on Tuesday morning. Here he shares his genius to help us understand the world”. Melinda Gates remembered him as “a personal hero, a gifted teacher, and a big-hearted, evidence-based optimist”. Others to pay tribute to the Swede on Twitter included Rob J Hyndman, professor of statistics at Australia’s Monash University: “Very sad to hear Hans Rosling has died. His @gapminder foundation continues his work to fight ignorance with data.” Historian Greg Jenner praised Rosling’s “ingenious and impactful” insight into data. David Nabarro, formerly the UN’s special envoy for Ebola and now among the final three contenders to lead the World Health Organisation, liaised with Rosling in Monrovia when the statistician was working with the Liberian government on its emergency response to the disease in 2014. He recalled that Rosling “changed the way we all conceive of people’s health”. Unicef paid tribute to Rosling’s work in encouraging financial support for young people: “RIP @HansRosling. No one used data more persuasively to make the case for investing in children. We will miss him.” Many students and teachers spoke of the huge impact of his educational work. PhD student Spoke Wintersparv commented: “In times when alt-facts and erroneous myths need a clear counterforce, the passing of Hans Rosling is a great loss to all of us.” How will you remember Hans Rosling?

My shortlist was Bill Murray, Jack Nicholson, Alec Baldwin and Ben Kingsley. (Since then, in conversation, I’ve also speculated about the possibility of luring Gene Hackman out of retirement.) Alexander Payne’s father-daughter comedy About Schmidt seemed an obvious comparison to me and probably to others, and now Variety has announced that Jack Nicholson is to come out of semi-retirement to play the lead in the remake; Kristen Wiig (who stars in Payne’s new film, Downsizing) is to play his long-suffering daughter, the role in which Sandra Hüller was so brilliant. And who is to play the creepy young executive who Ines forces to masturbate on the cakes in front of her? My money is on Will Arnett. Kristen Wiig is a good choice for Ines, perhaps the only choice, although Kate McKinnon would have been interesting, or maybe even Hope Davis, Nicholson’s co-star from About Schmidt. Is the Toni Erdmann remake a bad idea … or a really bad idea? Is there an awful possibility that the remake will not “get” that tonally ambiguous and elusive part of the film, and Nicholson will be muggingly over-the-top, in precisely that unfunny and misjudged way that Ade’s original movie was anatomising? Obviously, there is an unhappy tradition of bad and wrong English-language remakes, the most recent being Secret in Their Eyes, a lame Hollywood version of Juan José Campanella’s Oscar-winning Argentinian noir thriller El Secreto De Sus Ojos, which managed to mislay almost all of the original’s tone, texture, thrills and heartbreak. And of course everyone knows about George Sluizer’s misfiring English-language remake of his own classic chiller The Vanishing. Michael Haneke created his own shot-for-shot replica-remake of his ordeal thriller Funny Games, the way Gus Van Sant did with Psycho, both cases laying the directors open to charges of pointlessness. But perhaps complaining about remakes has become too much of a badge of fanboy purity. Steven Soderbergh was thought to be guilty of incredible hubris and sacrilege in remaking Andrei Tarkovsky’s Solaris with George Clooney and Natascha McElhone in the leads. And the result was – whisper it – not too bad at all: an intelligent, creative homage from a real film-maker. And Nicholson himself had taken the lead in a prominent and decent remake: Martin Scorsese’s Oscar-winning The Departed, a translation of Andrew Lau and Alan Mak’s crime thriller Infernal Affairs, shifting the action from Hong Kong to Boston. Nicholson played the gang boss Frank Costello – originally played by Eric Tsang. Nicholson needed no excuse there to crank up the performance. What he will do with Toni Erdmann is anyone’s guess; he may play opposite Wiig with all the subtlety he had opposite Adam Sandler in Anger Management. But Alexander Payne was strict with Nicholson on About Schmidt, and got one of his very best performances out of him. So what will the producers of the Americanised “Tony Erdmann” do? I predict they will: 1. Hire Barry Levinson as director, after Alexander Payne has turned them down. 2. Hire Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Adam McKay, Judd Apatow and Simon Rich to write and tinker with the English-language script. McKay is already credited as executive producer, as is Ade. 3. Cut at least half an hour from the running time, partly by losing the extended sequences in the Romanian oil fields, where Toni appears to want to intervene in the layoffs. This, sadly, will be key to losing the original flavour. 4. Create a crucial “backstory” scene for Nicholson/Wiig, a specific moment of emotional betrayal or trauma in their shared past, avoided and not discussed until it is revealed in a climactic confrontation. 5. Change the wonderful scene in which Ines hugs her dad who is dressed in the great furry monster costume. In the original, the head was not removed. In the remake, it will be removed to reveal Jack’s shaggy, tearful face. 6. Give Nicholson a big final speech in the monster costume. 7. Allow Kristen Wiig not to be fully nude in the party scene. As for Nicholson himself, it is difficult to tell. He may be brilliant and I hope that he is. But his sheer star wattage is working against him: Peter Simonischek was an unknown quantity to most, and so his performance was a revelation. A director has to be tough with Nicholson, and keep him within bounds. Wiig is a great performer, but she too will have to keep her natural comic instincts under control – although she certainly managed this for Sebastián Silva’s movie Nasty Baby. Maybe it won’t be too bad. This article was amended on 8 February. The original stated that Ines’s colleague masturbates on the carpet in front of her. It is actually some cakes. This has been corrected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2017/feb/08/last-chance-saloon-for-elephants-british-mps-warn-government","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-08T14:29:40Z","webTitle":"Elephants in crisis: MPs accuse government and Europe of dragging their feet over ivory ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/08/last-chance-saloon-for-elephants-british-mps-warn-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/feb/08/last-chance-saloon-for-elephants-british-mps-warn-government","fields":{"headline":"Elephants in crisis: MPs accuse government and Europe of dragging their feet over ivory ban","bodyText":"The UK and EU, the world’s largest exporters of legal ivory, have been accused of not doing enough to save Africa’s fast disappearing elephant populations. “This is the last chance saloon to save elephants,” said UK Labour MP Justin Madders at a meeting at Westminster Hall on Monday where more than 30 MPs on both sides of the chamber debated a public petition of 107,000 signatories calling for government to close its domestic ivory markets. He added that even though the UK government announced some proposals to restrict the sale of ivory, “there is a general concern that the proposals do not go far enough in protecting elephants”. Africa, China and the US are leading efforts to reverse the critical situation for elephants – whose numbers in Africa are believed to have declined by a third in the last seven years – while the UK and Europe are lagging behind. Last year countries reached a historic international agreement to shut down domestic ivory markets that contribute to poaching or illegal trade. The recommendation applies to parties to the convention on the international trade in endangered species (Cites), which includes the UK, the EU, China, the US and 29 African countries, calling themselves the African Elephant Coalition (AEC), along with Botswana, formerly a major ivory trading nation. “But,” warns Patrick Ormondi, chair of the AEC, “it will be meaningless if countries ignore it.” Outside Africa only China, India, the US and France – the lone standout European country – have responded by implementing measures to close their domestic markets. On the 30 December China’s announcement that it will stop its ivory trade by 2017 effectively closed down the world’s largest domestic market. “It’s amazing that we might be learning lessons from China,” said Owen Paterson, Conservative MP during Monday’s meeting. “It is simply not possible to maintain the high moral ground and tell other countries what they should be doing if we have not set an example. It is absolutely incredible that we have fallen behind.” But others argue that ivory older than 70 years is “part of all our cultural history”. Conservative MP Victoria Borwick, who is also president of the British Antique Dealers’ Association and advised by the British Art Market Federation and the Antiquities Dealers’ Association, said that “we must stop the current trading in raw and poached ivory, but that is not the same as trading in antique cultural artefacts”. She pointed out that the current threats to whales does not prevent the sale of scrimshaw and corset bones in the costume collections in our museums, and argued that modern poaching and the antique ivory trade are in no way linked. “Buyers [in China] have no interest in most historical objects on sale in the UK; they desire ivory in any form and prefer it shiny and modern.” The UK and Europe’s domestic ivory markets are thriving and the bloc is the world’s largest exporter of antique ivory. International trade in ivory is permitted under Cites regulations, but may only involve ivory acquired before the convention came into being in 1975, and only as long as a certificate proving each item’s age is provided. In the case of the UK, antique ivory is classified as ivory acquired before 1947, which some have said goes further than internationally agreed regulations. However, the antique trade is said to contribute directly to illegal trade, providing the opportunity for illegal ivory to be laundered. According to Conservative Party MP, Luke Hall, who introduced the debate: “It is difficult for our law enforcement officers to tell the difference between pre and post-1947 ivory, especially as newer ivory is frequently and deliberately disguised as antique.” An EU document issued in February 2016 states that: “Between 2011 and 2014, EU member states reported seizures of around 4,500 ivory items reported as specimens and an additional 780kg as reported by weight.” Most was destined for Asia, particularly China, Hong Kong and Vietnam. The report notes that: “it is often difficult to distinguish pre-convention specimens”, and points out there are many cases of buyers purchasing ivory using forged pre-convention certificates with the intention of exporting them illegally to Asia. The UK is by far the largest exporter of ivory items by number among EU member states with declared exports of 25,351 ivory items, 54% of the EU total, between 2006-2015. Last year Christie’s was fined more than £3,000 for selling a piece of ivory without the relevant documentation, while Hall cited the example of an individual based in the UK who was prosecuted November 2016 for selling 78 ivory items valued at almost £6,500. Meanwhile the European commission[pdf] is set to issue new guidance on ivory trade within and exports from the European Union. But observers warn that the results may be disappointing. Daniela Freyer of German-based conservation group Pro-Wildlife said she expected “likely just an EU-export ban for raw ivory, nothing on worked products”. She added: “Germany wants to go a bit further but they claim they are not getting support for their position. The commission and most EU countries don’t want to do anything to restrict their internal market in the near future.” The UK seems to be doing little too. This is the second time that the domestic ivory has been debated in the house in the past two months, following a debate on 8 December, when minister of environment Therese Coffey minister promised a consultation, something that has yet to occur. Labour MP, John Mann, summed up the public mood: “If I were a minister, I would ban the lot and stop any trade in or movement of ivory. The survival of the elephant is far more important than a museum. It is about time we were bold and said that there should be no half-measures, mixed messages, little promises or small steps forwards. A total ban is what I want.” Sadly, in spite of overwhelming cross-party support from MPs and strong public support for action on this issue, Coffey’s response was simply that consultation on whether or not to close down the domestic ivory trade would begin “shortly” and that she “really hope[s] it will be as soon as possible” – a claim that had already been made in December.
