Faleena Hopkins, whose oeuvre includes Cocky Cowboy, Cocky Biker, and Cocky Soldier, wrote to rivals demanding that they retitle their own novels containing the word “cocky”. The genre guild, Romance Writers of America, is consulting its lawyers. Meanwhile, is such use of “cocky” just a silly double entendre? A cock, of course, is a male hen, as well as a night watchman, part of a gun, the gnomon of a sundial, or “a spout or short pipe serving as a channel for passing liquids through”, according to the OED, which gently suggests that last sense as giving rise to the word’s common use for the male member. “Oh man what art thou? when thy cock is up?” asks a character in Nathan Field’s 1618 comedy Amends for Ladies. But the adjective “cocky” had already been first used to mean “lecherous” 69 years previously; it only began to mean vain or conceited (strutting like a cock) in the late 18th century. “Cocky”, then, does originally have sexual implications, and so is a perfectly respectable description of Hopkins’s cast of cock-toting Casanovas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2018/may/08/we-dont-need-another-inquiry-into-the-press-after-leveson","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T17:01:06Z","webTitle":"We don’t need another inquiry into the press after Leveson | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/08/we-dont-need-another-inquiry-into-the-press-after-leveson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/08/we-dont-need-another-inquiry-into-the-press-after-leveson","fields":{"headline":"We don’t need another inquiry into the press after Leveson","bodyText":"Ed Miliband’s piece (The victims of the press need Leveson to be completed, 8 May) only serves to illustrate the flaws in the argument that a further inquiry into the press is justified. The Leveson inquiry and resulting police investigations into the press cost taxpayers nearly £50m. The true cost was probably much more. A major public consultation firmly rejected reopening the inquiry. The Miliband/Clarke amendment to the data protection bill calls for an inquiry that goes much further than Leveson 2. It is broader, less defined in its scope and would catch all media organisations and their journalists – broadcast, print and online. It would take years to inquire and report, and cost the state millions of pounds. The amendment was inserted into the bill last Friday and there has been insufficient time to properly debate its implications, scope and cost. As the Guardian said in its editorial on Leveson (2 March), it is now time to look forward, not behind. The criminal and civil wrongdoing in the press from the 1990s to 2011 has been thoroughly investigated. Most of those that alleged abuses by the press were called to give evidence at the inquiry and it made for difficult listening. Clearly things had gone wrong. But it is hard to see what further testimony can be given. In the meantime, civil claims were made and many have been settled with significant compensation payments to victims. The News of the World was closed down. One of the biggest police investigations in British history led to the arrests of many journalists, extensive trials and convictions. Mr Miliband talks of this as “a narrow and unpublished police investigation”. One eight-month criminal trial and a number of other trials of journalists, fully reported and live tweeted for anyone interested, gave an open, public and full review of the evidence. The DPP and DoJ also reviewed all the evidence. To go over all this ground again because a few people did not like the results is unjustifiable. The noisy advocates of a new inquiry are a small number of an anti-press lobby. It is clearly not supported by the wider public, and the enormous resource that would go to paying lawyers, a new judge and others will not lead to any new recommendations or information. Leveson’s report ran to 1,987 pages and over a million words. We don’t need another one. The General Data Protection Regulation is coming into force. The role of the Information Commissioner’s Office in protecting data is strengthened by positive amendments in the bill. The ICO will issue guidance on seeking redress from the press, and a statutory review of media compliance with data law over the next four years is to be set up. These are the provisions that will provide proper protections in the future, not a pointless review of the past.

The clash represents a huge test of the durability of the surprisingly concerted alliance that Germany, France and the UK have managed to maintain in their humiliatingly fruitless bid to prevent Donald Tump from explicitly withdrawing from the deal signed by his predecessor Barack Obama. The risk is that the unity forged by the European trio over the need to preserve the deal now falters as disagreements surface on how far they are prepared to antagonise a determined US president, not to mention Israel and Saudi Arabia, to keep the deal alive. The tone in which figures such as the French president Emmanuel Macron challenge Trump’s judgment call, and bellicose rhetoric, will also be critical to future transatlantic relations. In making his announcement Trump did not hold back, or make any concessions to European sentiment, effectively accusing his European allies of being duped by “a giant fiction perpetrated by a murderous regime”. Still worse, from the EU perspective, he said he was imposing “the highest level of sanctions”, adding explicitly that other nations could be sanctioned if they assisted Iran. In the face of this rhetoric, Europe’s room for manoeuvre and apparent traction with Washington is limited. Tony Blinken, a former Obama deputy secretary of state involved in the negotiation of the original deal known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA), said Europe’s ability to keep the deal alive would largely depend on whether Iran continues to reap economic benefits, even without the US. “That will be a judgment over time,” he said. “It depends on how companies react to the new environment and it depends on whether the US tries to sanction companies that trade with Iran.” But the viability of Europe’s plans to keep Iran committed to the deal will depend on how aggressively the US Treasury ensures that any economic sanctions it now imposes on US firms that continue to trade with the central bank of Iran also impact on European firms. The first sanction that is being reimposed by Trump, as a result of ending the waiver, is a requirement for firms to show they are significantly reducing the number of oil deals they are striking with Iran via the country’s central bank. That will take as long as 180 days to measure. But in an uncompromising mood, Trump implied other much wider sanctions will also be reimposed, even though he gave no timeframe for doing so. One difficulty is that many existing US sanctions on Iran, some linked to Tehran’s human rights abuses and its ballistic missile programme, have already had a chilling effect on risk-averse European banks with commercial links to the US. Previous efforts in 2016 and 2017 to find a way to disentangle European firms trading with Iran from the threat of US sanctions largely failed, leading Tehran to complain for the past three years that the supposed chief upside– increased western investment in the Iranian economy – had not materialised in contravention of the nuclear deal. The question for Europe is whether it can find a more effective means of protecting European business trading with Iran from US sanctions. Blinken pointed out that in the past the EU has staged confrontations with the US when Washington has imposed secondary sanctions. The Libya and Iran sanctions act passed by Congress in 1996 provoked the EU to pass a blocking statute asserting US secondary sanctions on European firms trading with Iran or Libya had no legal effect. The EU also threatened to take the US to the World Trade Organisation. “Broadly the US backed down”, Blinken said. But Trump seems prepared to hit European firms trading with Iran. The tone of his White House address suggested he will not tolerate any threat to his political authority to settle the west’s relations with Iran. Nevertheless, over the past few weeks, the EU has been privately reviewing such past confrontations with the US over sanctions, but it has not spoken of its contingency plans in public preferring to focus on how to persuade the US to pull back. Maja Kocijančič, the EU spokeswoman for foreign affairs, simply said on Tuesday: “We are working on plans to protect the interests of European companies.” But in a bid to reassure the Iranians, and prevent an uncontrolled escalation, officials from the UK, France, Germany and the EU’s foreign policy service stressed their support for the Iran deal when they met Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi for talks in Brussels on Tuesday, hours before Trump’s statement. Europe would implement the JCPOA as long as Iran complies with its obligations, said a German foreign ministry source. At the same time, Europe instinctually will not want to find itself at odds with its natural allies Saudi Arabia, Israel and Washington on such a critical judgment call as the role of Iran in the Middle East. A public confrontation between the US and Europe at the United Nations security council over the future of the agreement is only likely to benefit Russia. Instead, the EU will have to decide whether to pursue its proposals, originally concocted to persuade Trump to stay in the deal, to negotiate a supplementary agreement with Iran covering its ballistic missile program, its foreign policy interventionism in the Middle East and the controversial sunset clauses in the deal. At the moment European leaders face only an invidious choice: succumb to Trump’s leadership even though they say it risks turmoil in the Middle East, or challenge their closest ally on probably the biggest foreign policy decision of his presidency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/09/taskmaster-review-panel-game-that-celebrates-the-bizarre-and-the-mediocre","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T21:00:54Z","webTitle":"Taskmaster review – panel game that celebrates the bizarre and the mediocre","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/09/taskmaster-review-panel-game-that-celebrates-the-bizarre-and-the-mediocre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/09/taskmaster-review-panel-game-that-celebrates-the-bizarre-and-the-mediocre","fields":{"headline":"Taskmaster review – panel game that celebrates the bizarre and the mediocre","bodyText":"Taskmaster is back for a sixth season. “We’re going to begin with the Prize Task, pause in case of a cheer … OK, so our new gang ...” begins Alex Horne. No cheer, but a laugh from the studio audience, at a gag that is self-aware and a little bit meta. It’s also quite good one, which is why they’re laughing. Alex Horne is not the Taskmaster, Greg Davies is, as you’ll know if you’re familiar with the show. Alex, sitting on the smaller of the gold thrones, is Greg’s assistant. But in a way he is kind of the master, because he invented and writes Taskmaster. It’s his baby. He pulls the strings from the side, Thomas Cromwell to Davies’s Henry VIII (so he should be careful, after what happened to Cromwell). The Prize Task: to bring in the best liquid. Which is a nice opportunity to meet the new gang of five contestants. Alice Levine has brought in some blood, her own she says, because her friend who is a teacher said that was the best liquid. Taskmaster Greg isn’t impressed; he used to be a teacher, so has some personal insight into the profession. “Let’s get this on record now,” he says. “They know fuck all.” Asim Chaudhry (ridiculous he has no Wikipedia entry, if someone could put that right, please) has brought his People Just Do Nothing character Chabuddy G’s peanut vape juice. Liza Tarbuck has some very pure, proper clean water from Chile. Russell Howard has Brut for men. And Tim Vine has chosen fizzy Benylin as the best liquid. Then the taskmaster ranks them or disqualifies them – arbitrarily and dictatorially – and it’s on to the first task proper. Which is to perform the best stunt – using a wheelbarrow – at the Taskmaster’s house. It’s possible you are not familiar with Taskmaster, even unaware of its existence, most probably because it appears on a TV channel named Dave. But you get the idea – a comedy panel game that, like its creator’s opening shot, is self-aware, a little bit meta and funny. Not in a smartarse way, it’s more about warm banter than mean put-downs. Taskmaster is an unashamed celebration of the bizarre and the mediocre: it’s imaginative and a bit crap, but it works. The contestants certainly seem to enjoy themselves. Oh, and they remain the same, throughout the series (10 episodes), so that they become like characters in a comedy drama. Well, a bit like that. It could even be one to see with the family, although Horne has a similar, but (even) more family-orientated show called The Button on BBC One, which uses members of the public instead of comedians. Taskmaster is better than The Button though, because people who are professionally funny are generally funnier than people who are just people. Anyway, this new lot look like a promising cast, they throw themselves into their tasks with unabashed if resigned abandon. Liza T’s best stunt performed using the wheelbarrow is to give it hands and a silver cape and then send her superhero barrow down a zipwire to deliver a box of Milk Tray. In the lab-based fruit fun round, in which they have to wield a knife a maximum of five times to make the highest possible tower of lemons, Russell uses one of his wields to slice one of his own fingers. Is he OK? “Yeah fine, blood and fucking acid!” he wails. In the round that involves a wardrobe, a walk and some hat restrictions, Liza hitches a ride with a lucky stranger in his Porsche, and has time for a cuppa before kissing (a portrait of) the Taskmaster. Chabuddy G is absolutely hopeless at everything, but hilariously and very likably so. He almost certainly won’t be crowned series winner at the end of 10 episodes, but already he’s my winner. And Tim, who never got the pun-is-dead memo, is on worldplay, although pun of the night goes to Alex. “Tarbuck, named after seven-ninths of the global coffee chain,” he says. Finally, back in the studio, they have to sort the objects under their tables in order of size, keeping their elbows on the table top, their heads in their hands and any fruit out of the final lineup. After which, Liza and Russell are joint leaders, so there has to be a tiebreaker: spin around as many times as possible before kicking the football at the caravan. Which Alice wins. And this time there is audience cheering. Well done."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/may/10/world-cup-2018-cheering-for-against-russia-fans","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T14:04:53Z","webTitle":"World Cup 2018: who are you cheering for (and against) in Russia?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/10/world-cup-2018-cheering-for-against-russia-fans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/10/world-cup-2018-cheering-for-against-russia-fans","fields":{"headline":"World Cup 2018: who are you cheering for (and against) in Russia?","bodyText":"Not everyone is lucky enough to have a team to support at the World Cup this summer.

Egypt, Senegal or Brazil may be a natural fit for Liverpool fans. Peru, one of the 13 countries who took part in the first World Cup in 1930, would welcome your support after 36 years of missing out on the finals. They have underdog status but you may be put off by their love of eating whole guinea pigs, head, claws and all. If you’re a glory hunter, you should go for bookies’ favourites Brazil, reigning champions Germany or 2010 champions Spain, who thrashed Argentina 6-1 earlier this year. If you’re a glutton for punishment, England will be there for you until the last-16 stage. We’d also like to know who you are cheering against.

Hundreds of young demonstrators are kettled in Parliament Square by the Met’s scary territorial support group, despairing of the abolition of the education maintenance allowance, which kept underprivileged young people in colleges and sixth forms, and seeking to influence the parliamentary vote then under way on raising university tuition fees. A makeshift PA system turns up, and the jack into the amplifier is passed around the demonstrators’ devices, all naturally loaded with MP3s. A rave erupts in the kettle, playing a huge variety of “music of black origin” – that unsatisfactory portmanteau word covering, at least that day, R&amp;B, dancehall, UK funky and dubstep. The place really goes nuts, though, when someone plays Pow! (Forward Riddim) by grime MC Lethal Bizzle. Long banned from clubs because of its ability to lay waste to a venue, this incendiary track has come to symbolise the frustration of young Londoners, many of them from council estates, and the suppression of their too fast, too threatening, too cold DIY music, snubbed by radio and effectively banned from live venues by police for years, until very recently. Dan Hancox – an Observer and Guardian journalist and grime aficionado who writes about politics and pop culture – was in the kettle, and his latest book charts the rise, fall, mutation and rise again of this quintessentially millennial London sound against a backdrop of public policy decisions specifically designed to suppress a genre, its makers, its radio stations and its fans. By and large, until the #grime4corbyn phenomenon of 2016, where a handful of prominent MCs came out to support Labour, this niche, granular form of disorienting high-speed music was not blatantly “political”, as a Billy Bragg fan would understand it. But while the story of grime, its key players and its evolution would have made a gripping book in itself, the genre is inextricably intertwined with the story of the capital, and its social and cultural politics over the past 20-odd years. Hancox is a tremendous guide to both. He can look back from the vantage point of 2018, where this most underdog of genres has, after a period of pop dilution, finally started racking up airtime and awards on its own terms: Skepta’s Mercury for Konnichiwa in 2016, a No 1 album for Stormzy’s Gang Signs &amp; Prayer (2017), and an MBE for grime’s “godfather”, Wiley (born Richard Kylea Cowie), whose role as mentor, mogul and den mother could easily fill two books (his autobiography is out in paperback next month). The journey to mainstream acceptance has been, not to put too fine a point on it, insane. It wasn’t just barriers such as Form 696, the Kafkaesque mechanism by which the Met made it impossible to stage live grime nights; Hancox dives deep into the riveting minutiae of how grime (realistic, dressed down) was frequently pitted against UK garage (aspirational, dressed up) and plots the arcs of individual players – such as Rinse FM’s Slimzee, who got an asbo and suffered a nervous breakdown when the pirate station was raided in 2004 (it is now legal). Ironically, Britain actually had the new punk rock on its hands. But while not averse to giving the heritage treatment to 1977, its (often white and middle-class) cultural gatekeepers could not, or would not, recognise it as such. And the powers that be did everything to conspire against it. The notion of “inner city pressure” was certainly operational when junglist Goldie released Inner City Life in 1995, but successive governments presided over more than two decades of social cleansing, gentrification and the closure of youth centres and defunding of offending prevention programmes. It wasn’t long, Hancox argues persuasively, before the student demonstrations of November and December 2010 turned into the riots of 2011. If all this sounds overly professorial, it isn’t: Hancox’s love for the music – for its socially unacceptable, alien sound, its hyper-local reference points, and its refusal to become Americanised rap – cuts through like a siren. • Inner City Pressure: The Story of Grime by Dan Hancox is published by William Collins (£20).

The municipality plans to formally unveil the roundabout in the presence of US officials on Monday, the Times of Israel reported. In a statement, the mayor added: “Naming this square in honour of the president is our way of showing our love and respect for the president and the American people, who always stand by the side of Israel.” Currently a consular building, the complex is in the process of being retrofitted to become an embassy and the presidential delegation due to attend the Monday opening includes Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. Street signs pointing the way to the new embassy were erected this week in the neighbourhood of Arnona while the embassy’s Twitter account changed its handle to “@usembassyjlm”. Trump’s declaration in December thrilled many in Israel who have long seen Jerusalem as their capital. Israel’s transport minister suggested naming a railway station after the US president, although that plan has not been finalised. However, the move infuriated many Palestinians, who claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, as well as countries who say the status of the holy city should be decided in peace negotiations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/08/nancy-pelosi-democrats-midterms-just-win-baby","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T16:23:10Z","webTitle":"'Just win, baby': Nancy Pelosi tells Democrats it's OK to run against her","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/08/nancy-pelosi-democrats-midterms-just-win-baby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/08/nancy-pelosi-democrats-midterms-just-win-baby","fields":{"headline":"'Just win, baby': Nancy Pelosi tells Democrats it's OK to run against her","bodyText":"Nancy Pelosi has a simple message for Democrats running for Congress this fall: “Just win, baby.” The House minority leader said Democrats running in conservative House districts across the country should do what they must to win – including running against her. “I think if they have to do that to win the election, I’m all for winning,” Pelosi said in an interview with Politico Playbook on Tuesday. “I think many of them are saying we need new leadership. I don’t take offense at that.” Pelosi, who served as the first female speaker of the House from 2007 to 2011, has increasingly become a target for Republicans as more visible party leaders such as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton receded from the public spotlight. Already this year Republicans have spent millions of dollars in attack ads and messaging focused on Pelosi. Republicans seized on her comments that corporate bonuses of $1,000 paid to workers from the $1.5tn GOP tax plan amounted to “crumbs” and have hammered Democratic candidates by accusing them of being Pelosi acolytes. “I have made some very powerful enemies,” Pelosi said, explaining how she became a liberal bogeyman for the Republican party.. Republicans “don’t say we’re against her because she passed healthcare reform, or because she took on Wall Street,” she said. “They say she’s [from] San Francisco. Yes. She’s liberal. Yes. She’s pro-LGBTQ. Yes. You will be, too. It’s just a matter of time.” A recent Washington Post-ABC poll found 32% of Americans had a favorable view of her while 44% had an unfavorable view. But the poll also found just 17% of voters say a candidate’s views on the Democratic leader will be “extremely important” in their vote. There are signs that an anti-Pelosi strategy is a gamble for Republicans. In a recent Pennsylvania special election, Republican organizations spent millions of dollars on TV advertising and campaign material tying Democrat Conor Lamb to the House minority leader, derisively attacking him as “Pelosi’s little Lamb”. Lamb, who vowed early that he would not support Pelosi to lead House Democrats, won the race in a stunning upset by less than 1,000 votes. Weeks later, Republican Debbie Lesko won the special election in a deeply conservative district of Arizona by only six points. Like in Pennsylvania, Republicans cast the Democrat, Hiral Tipirneni, as Pelosi-style liberal. Tipirneni, who is running again for the seat in November, would not commit to supporting Pelosi for speaker in an April interview with the Guardian. During the roughly 45-minute Politico interview at the Liaison Hotel in Washington, Pelosi dismissed calls for impeachment of Donald Trump as a “distraction” from Democrats’ economic message, which she admitted was already struggling to break through. “Impeachment, to me, is a divisive issue,” Pelosi said, “unless there’s something as conclusive as what we saw in Watergate. That was inevitable. That was bipartisan.” She continued: “You can talk about it in your districts. In my district, it’s a very popular issue. But it takes attention away from the connection we need to make to people about their economic security.” Pelosi said she had planned to step aside as leader after Hillary Clinton won the election. But when Clinton lost, Pelosi said she felt compelled to remain in the role so that there was a “woman at the table”. “That became very important to me, that there would be a woman at the table where these decisions are negotiated,” she said. Despite calls for Pelosi – and the whole bench of Democratic leaders – to step aside and allow a new generation to assume power, she has so far resisted. On Tuesday Pelosi defended herself as a prolific fundraiser and a “legislative virtuoso”. “I say this because I want women to take pride in what they are,” she said. When asked what she would do if Democrats did not regain control of the House, Pelosi demurred. “I can’t even think of not winning,” she said. “You have to believe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/08/mark-williams-snooker-world-title-john-higgins","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T15:39:01Z","webTitle":"Mark Williams shows youngsters naked truth about snooker’s veterans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/08/mark-williams-snooker-world-title-john-higgins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/08/mark-williams-snooker-world-title-john-higgins","fields":{"headline":"Mark Williams shows youngsters naked truth about snooker’s veterans","bodyText":"Tuesday morning and in the cafes of Sheffield’s Millennium Square talk was still of snooker. “I caught the end, quite exciting wasn’t it!” went one conversation starter, which was quite effusive for Yorkshire. The previous night, at about 9.50, Mark Williams had channelled calm in the most pressured of moments at the Crucible to win his 18th frame against John Higgins. In the process the Welshman won his third world championship, 15 years after his second, the longest gap in the tournament’s history. It was quite a final, an unexpectedly tense, competitive and thrilling match that put to bed any talk of an underwhelming championship. Barry Hearn would never hint at any such anxiety but the way the impresario stormed into the press area to announce Williams – “Cameras at the back! Naked world champion at the front!” – suggested he knew he had a story on his hands. Williams was an outside bet throughout the 17 days of the tournament, he was a champion so unlikely he jokingly promised early in the competition that he would turn up naked to the post-final press conference should he win – and then delivered on the pledge. When his semi-final against Barry Hawkins finished at midnight on Saturday it was expected the 43-year-old, suddenly bouncing back after so long in obscurity, would fade horribly against the perennial competitor Higgins. Instead Williams’s languid, almost sleepy demeanour proved to be an asset. He stayed calm throughout the final, riding his moments of good form, not dwelling on the bad. He also played some outstanding shots, especially in the closing frames, with the red that opened his final break likely to haunt Higgins for some time. From the other side the Scot was indefatigable, coming back from 4-0 down to 7-7, and from 14-7 to 15-15. So the story is the class of 92 rolled back the clock. Williams, who became the oldest world champion since Ray Reardon won in 1978 as a 45-year-old, certainly celebrated like a man two decades younger. Throughout the early hours his Twitter feed declared his determination to keep drinking (though he has also changed his biography to include three trophy emojis). But as his body will no doubt tell him on sobering up, this cannot go on for ever. With Mark Selby knocked out in the opening round and Ronnie O’Sullivan defenestrated in the second, the championship provided a chance for snooker’s 20-somethings to step up. They did not take it. Kyren Wilson made the semi-finals but was kept at arm’s length by the 42-year-old Higgins, who also took care of Judd Trump in the previous round. Hearn used the occasion of the final to criticise the younger generation, saying: “Kids today are soft and getting softer. If I was a player who hadn’t won the world title I’d be spending a long time looking in the mirror and saying: ‘Why?’” How long can a middle-aged resurgence hold off the millennials? “The younger players will look at this and think they have another 15 years of coming back here, trying to win it,” Higgins said. That may be true. Unfortunately, next year Williams and Higgins have promised they will still be there waiting for them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/may/09/avengers-infinity-war-well-on-way-to-be-marvels-biggest-ever-hit-at-uk-box-office","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T06:24:14Z","webTitle":"Avengers: Infinity War well on way to be Marvel's biggest-ever UK box office hit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/09/avengers-infinity-war-well-on-way-to-be-marvels-biggest-ever-hit-at-uk-box-office","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/09/avengers-infinity-war-well-on-way-to-be-marvels-biggest-ever-hit-at-uk-box-office","fields":{"headline":"Avengers: Infinity War well on way to be Marvel's biggest-ever UK box office hit","bodyText":"The winner: Avengers: Infinity War Sunny skies proved predictably detrimental to cinemagoing across the UK at the weekend, with the overall market crashing by 61% from the previous session. And chart topper Avengers: Infinity War fell a pretty hefty 57% in its second weekend of play. However, that decline was from such a giant opening number (£23.1m) that the Marvel movie nevertheless managed a very impressive £10.14m over the weekend. Total after 11 days is an epic £49.1m. Including bank holiday Monday, the tally rises to £51.8m in 12 days. Infinity War is now within spitting distance of the lifetime total of Marvel’s biggest-ever UK hit. Marvel Avengers Assemble maxed out at £51.9m in 2012. And Infinity War will clearly sail far past that number. It’s already ahead of every other Marvel title; the next best is Avengers: Age of Ultron, with £48.3m. Infinity War is a tiny bit behind the pace of December’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi, which grossed £10.16m in its second session, and stood at £50.7m after 11 days of play. Typically, Star Wars films enjoy more marketplace longevity than Marvel titles, so Infinity War will probably struggle to match The Last Jedi’s muscular UK total of £82.7m. The runner-up: I Feel Pretty Distributor STX might consider itself unlucky to have released its new comedy I Feel Pretty on the sunniest weekend of the year so far. And given that challenging weather situation, the film’s debut of £1.19m from 520 cinemas, and £1.27m including previews, seems an encouraging start. Amy Schumer has taken the starring role in only three films: Trainwreck, Snatched (opposite Goldie Hawn) and now I Feel Pretty. US hit Trainwreck arrived in the UK in mid-August 2015, with a rather soft £932,000 from 464 cinemas, including negligible previews, on its way to a £3.24m total. Snatched began last May with £842,000 from 465 cinemas, topping out at £2.14m. STX will be hoping that I Feel Pretty will give the actor her biggest UK hit. The indie alternatives: Tully, Lean on Pete and Mary and the Witch’s Flower A number of films targeting more niche audiences were released at the weekend, with mixed results. Tully is the latest from Juno and Young Adult writer-director pair Diablo Cody and Jason Reitman. Starring Charlize Theron in a change-of-pace role as a barely coping mother of three, the comedy-drama sits somewhere between the arthouse and mainstream, and struggled to define its audience. Tully’s UK debut of £139,000 is almost identical to the Young Adult opening number, but was achieved from a wider 200 cinemas, compared with 137 for Young Adult. Juno was a smash hit, reaching a UK total of £9.84m in 2008. Lean on Pete, from Weekend and 45 Years director Andrew Haigh, has begun with £53,400 from 46 venues, and £85,600 including previews. Adapted from the Willy Vlautin novel, the film is the first from the director set in the US. The numbers compare with a debut of £309,000 from 68 sites (and £331,000 including previews) for 45 Years back in August 2015. Weekend began with £32,500 from 10 cinemas in November 2011. Mary and the Witch’s Flower is the debut feature from Studio Ponoc, the Japanese animation house led by ex-Studio Ghibli producer Yoshiaki Nishimura. The fantasy adventure, based on The Little Broomstick by Mary Stewart, has opened with a rather soft £44,300 from 78 venues, and £119,000 including previews. When Marnie Was There, Ghibli’s last Japanese animation, began in June 2016 with a stronger £83,700 from 53 sites, and £99,400 including previews. The market Data gatherer comScore has released figures for April (6 April to 3 May), and they show box office down 10% on April 2017. For the year to date, box office is down 5% on 2017. Those numbers would have been worse were it not for the contribution of Avengers: Infinity War, which played for eight days in the measured period. The silver lining for cinema operators is that 2017 began strongly before hitting a few speed bumps in the summer, so nobody should be panicking that 2018 is currently 5% behind: there is strong potential to catch up. This month, Deadpool 2 (arriving in cinemas on 15 May) and Solo: A Star Wars Story (24 May), plus continued success for Infinity War, should deliver stellar numbers. Top 10 films 4-6 May 1.

The leading Tory backbenchers Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve, who have spearheaded the rebel drive to remain in the customs union, said their main priority was to ensure that frictionless trade was delivered in the final deal. It raises the prospect of them eventually withdrawing a customs union amendment to the trade bill, on which the government faces defeat, and so bolstering the prime minister’s chances of getting her Brexit deal through the Commons. The development comes before a cabinet showdown over Britain’s post-Brexit customs arrangements, and after the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, publicly criticised May’s proposed system as crazy and claimed it would not give Britain control of trade policy. Whitehall officials believe they can persuade Brussels that a redrafted version of May’s preferred plan is workable, despite EU negotiators previously describing it as “magical thinking”. The Brexit inner cabinet rejected the proposal by six to five at a crunch meeting last week, leaving Brexit cabinet sources insisting it was a “dead parrot” and No 10 conceding there were “unresolved issues” that required further work. Downing Street sources denied the prime minister was planning to take the issue to a full meeting of her cabinet, where the plan would get majority backing, suggesting she wanted to win over her Brexiter critics in the inner cabinet with redrafted proposals instead. May delivered a mild rebuke to Johnson after he told the Daily Mail that the customs partnership, one of two options considered by the inner cabinet, would be unacceptable. Her official spokesman pointed out that the customs partnership model had been in existence for months, along with an alternative plan for a hi-tech streamlined customs arrangement, and that the whole cabinet had already signed up to it. While Number 10 defended an intervention by the business secretary, Greg Clarke, at the weekend as “entirely in keeping” with government policy, May’s spokesman refused to be drawn on whether the same was true of Johnson’s comments. Downing Street was also rumoured to be trying to win over the home secretary, Sajid Javid, and the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, who both came out against May’s plans at the inner cabinet. However, sources close to Javid denied he was having his arm twisted. In the next few weeks May faces the return of the EU withdrawal bill to the Commons after a string of government defeats in the House of Lords on proposals such as staying in the customs union. Grieve warned that the Commons, where the prime minister has a wafer-thin majority propped up by the Democratic Unionist party, would be similarly robust. But support for May’s partnership plan from the leading remainers, while angering the Brexiters, could make it more likely that she will avoid a damaging defeat on staying in the customs union, which Labour has said it will support. Soubry said: “All that I care about is what any agreement delivers. If it delivers the huge benefit of our membership of the customs union and indeed the single market, which is what British business is desperate for, I don’t care what you call it.” Grieve told the BBC: “I think you will find that there is an overwhelming number of members of parliament who think that a continuing relationship with the EU facilitating frictionless trade is absolutely essential for our economic interests.” A third remainer MP said: “The louder the Brexiters shout, the more clear it is that they realise they aren’t going to win this one. May is shifting our way.” There was also pressure on the prime minister to more firmly rebuke Johnson for his remarks, with Grieve saying he could not understand why she had chosen not to sack him. One MP, who did not want to be named, said: “I cannot think of another occasion when a foreign secretary or any other senior minister has publicly denounced the prime minister’s policy in this way. It’s in utter disregard of any rule of collective responsibility. He’s completely out of control. There’s nothing May can do about him.” But the former Tory leader and senior Brexiter Iain Duncan Smith backed Johnson for speaking out. He said: “We were led to believe last week that that was it, and they were going with the maximum facilitation process, which was also the government’s plan. But it turns out over the weekend, somehow, it’s been raised from the dead.” Cabinet opponents of the customs partnership plan are backed by the influential European Research Group of Tory backbench MPs. Its chair, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has said the proposal amounts to membership of the customs union and the single market “by another name” and said Johnson’s criticism “hits the nail on the head”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2018/may/15/weekly-notes-queries-atmospheric-drinks","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T10:58:04Z","webTitle":"How does a certain drink conjure up a place, season or time of day?

Marjoram is absolutely my favourite herb. It works in so many different dishes and has a wonderful aroma. I use ricotta from Laverstoke Park Farm in Hampshire; it manages somehow to be light as air, but rich and creamy at the same time. I can’t get enough of it.

Blanch the fresh peas and broad beans in salted water for two minutes. Then, mix with half of the marjoram leaves and combine with half of the dressing. Divide evenly between four bowls, flattening the mound slightly in the middle. Place a large spoon of ricotta on top of each mound of peas and broad beans.

Forecasters are predicting that after another day of unseasonably warm weather on Tuesday, with temperatures reaching mid-to-high 20s in and around London, the south-east and east Anglia, they will return to levels more typical for May. Sophie Yeomans, a meteorologist at the Met Office said: “I’d expect the warmest place [on Wednesday] to be in south-east England, reaching 22C or maybe 23C. It will be more like 15 or 16 on Thursday and similar for Friday and Saturday.” If 22C does not sound too bad, Yeomans said the picture was bleaker in other areas, particularly in the west of the UK. She said a band of rain would be pushing into western parts with possible heavy bursts in Northern Ireland and Scotland on Thursday morning. It will be a far cry from the sweltering bank holiday weekend, when a high of 28.7C was reached in Northolt, west London, on Monday afternoon, making it the hottest early May bank holiday Monday, and weekend, since records began. Sun worshippers flocked to beaches and parks, while supermarkets said sales of ice-cream, rosé wine and barbecue staples soared. The long-term average UK temperature in May, based on figures from 1981 to 2010, is 10.4C, according to the Met Office, although last year the mean May temperature was 12.1C, making it the second warmest May (behind 2008) since 1910."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/may/08/phones-4u-founder-john-caudwell-ordered-to-pay-500000-damages","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T15:36:21Z","webTitle":"Phones 4u founder John Caudwell ordered to pay £500,000 damages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/08/phones-4u-founder-john-caudwell-ordered-to-pay-500000-damages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/may/08/phones-4u-founder-john-caudwell-ordered-to-pay-500000-damages","fields":{"headline":"Phones 4u founder John Caudwell ordered to pay £500,000 damages","bodyText":"A former financial adviser to the billionaire Phones 4u founder, John Caudwell, has been awarded nearly £500,000 in damages after a court found she was wrongly dismissed despite fiddling her expenses. But Caudwell claimed justice had been done, since the payment was significantly less than the £20m Nathalie Dauriac was seeking. In the conclusion of a high-profile case, Justice Marcus Smith awarded the damages after finding that Caudwell had breached his agreement with Dauriac after taking over for a nominal £2 fee her shares in the financial management company they co-founded. Despite Dauriac maintaining they were worth £20m, the court valued the shares at no more than £471,510. Smith also ruled that Dauriac, a former Coutts banker, had “deliberately made expense claims that she knew were not proper claims” and there was “quite simply, no explanation consistent with honesty” for changes she had made to the claim forms. Caudwell and Dauriac ended up in court after an investigation into her expenses began in late 2014. She was suspended in December that year and her employment ended in January 2015. Dauriac left the business and her 49% stake was bought out for a nominal £2 fee. Dauriac said: “I am very pleased that the judge has today upheld my claim of constructive dismissal and found that the shares that were taken away from me and valued at just £2 were in fact worth more than £500,000. “I was subjected to relentless pressure to accept a series of outrageous demands as the price for staying in my job. “The court heard that an attempt was made to pressure me into agreeing to take a lie detector test and see a psychiatrist, that I was asked not to have children while at the business, and that I was threatened with having my job downgraded.” But Caudwell also claimed victory in the case, saying it was an “immense relief” that the court had found Dauriac to be dishonest in relation to her claim for nearly £30,000 in expenses. He said he did not agree with the judge’s valuation of Dauriac’s shares in the business, but the damages awarded were only a “tiny fraction of the £20m she was seeking”. “Over the course of the last three years, I have been to hell and back as a consequence of a series of vindictive and completely baseless allegations made against me in the course of high-profile legal proceedings with my former business partner Nathalie Dauriac,” he said. “Throughout that period, she waged what felt like a campaign of terror in an effort to extort £20m from me in the clear expectation that I would ultimately surrender and settle out of court. She was totally wrong in that assumption. “It is an immense relief to share with you that the court has found Nathalie to have been dishonest, to have deliberately made expenses claims that, without question, she knew were improper.” Dauriac said the judge had taken “little or no account of my role as founder and co-owner of a multimillion-pound business, dedicating my personal and social life to generating business and maintaining relations with clients”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"law/2018/may/08/barristers-prepare-to-escalate-protest-of-legal-aid-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T16:35:28Z","webTitle":"Barristers prepare to escalate protests over legal aid row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/may/08/barristers-prepare-to-escalate-protest-of-legal-aid-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/may/08/barristers-prepare-to-escalate-protest-of-legal-aid-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Barristers prepare to escalate protests over legal aid row","bodyText":"Criminal barristers are preparing to step up their protests over cuts to fees as Labour calls on the government to abandon a payments scheme for publicly funded cases. More than 90% of surveyed members of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA) have come out in support of stoppages, the organisation has revealed, while about 100 barristers chambers in England and Wales are refusing to work on new legal aid instructions. The CBA represents more than 4,000 criminal barristers. Its executive has met to discuss “escalating the action” and the first days of action are expected later this month. Criminal barristers may also decline to handle cases returned by other lawyers who cannot get to court – cooperation that normally relieves strains in the criminal justice system. There are an increasing number of reports of defendants being left unrepresented at remand hearings across England and Wales because of the lack of counsel prepared to take on new legal aid crime cases. All MPs are to be given a free copy of the book The Secret Barrister: Stories of the Law and How it is Broken, and the Young Legal Aid Lawyers’ Social Mobility Report 2018, which highlight the funding shortages in the criminal justice system. They have been paid for through crowdfunding on the CrowdJustice website. Labour has secured a vote in parliament on the disputed advocates’ graduated fee scheme (AGFS), which barristers say will leave criminal defence lawyers underpaid for publicly funded work in the crown court. They would not be fairly rewarded for reading the material now being disclosed in even routine crime cases, they maintain. Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, has called on the government to withdraw controversial changes that have sparked industrial action by barristers. As a result of the new scheme about 100 barrister chambers have refused to take on new publicly funded cases since 1 April. Burgon said: “The government should withdraw these controversial changes, go back to the drawing board and come up with a scheme that attracts widespread support rather than provoking a backlash. “Our justice system depends on those accused of serious crimes having access to proper legal representation. Without that there is greater risk of miscarriages of justice. “This flawed scheme risks causing further damage to our justice system, which is already in a crisis driven by 40% budget cuts – the deepest cuts of any government department.” Angela Rafferty, chair of the CBA, said: “We remind the government that no barrister wants to take this action. Our repeated calls for a principled and practical solution stand. Justice should be placed in its rightful place. Investment across the system is required.” The Public Defenders Service, a small government agency that only appears at times of dispute, is understood to be ready to take on cases. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Any action to disrupt the courts is unacceptable and we are taking all necessary steps to ensure legal representation is available for defendants in criminal cases. “We greatly value the work of criminal advocates and will continue to engage with the bar over their concerns regarding the AGFS scheme. “Our reforms replace an archaic scheme under which barristers billed by pages of evidence. Murder is one of the many categories of cases which will see an uplift in fees under the new scheme.” The MoJ says that the new AGFS scheme will cost it £9m more than originally intended."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/08/woman-in-hospital-after-suspected-acid-attack-in-brixton","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T15:28:40Z","webTitle":"Woman in hospital after suspected acid attack in Brixton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/woman-in-hospital-after-suspected-acid-attack-in-brixton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/08/woman-in-hospital-after-suspected-acid-attack-in-brixton","fields":{"headline":"Woman in hospital after suspected acid attack in Brixton","bodyText":"Firefighters hosed down a woman in her 20s after she fell victim to a suspected acid attack outside a tube station in south London on Tuesday, according to a witness.

In the latest evidence of the slowdown in the economy since the turn of the year, the latest health check from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and KPMG found that sales were down by 3.1% in April, the biggest decline since the survey was launched in 1995. Spending on non-food items has been particularly hard hit over the last three months, and retailers are braced for tough trading conditions to continue for the rest of the year even though wages have now started to rise more quickly than prices. Retailers have been hit hard by a combination of problems on top of the squeeze on spending, including higher labour costs as a result of increases in the minimum wage, the shift to online shopping and rapidly changing spending patterns. Toys R Us and the electricals retailer Maplin collapsed in February and a number of retailers, including House of Fraser, New Look, Carpetright and Poundworld, are all pursuing agreements with their landlords to cut their rents and close stores. The industry had been expecting that year-on-year comparisons would look poor for April, but the BRC’s chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said the problem ran deeper. “With much of the spending in preparation for the bank holiday weekend falling in March this year, a record low in sales growth, in contrast to last year’s record high, does not come as a surprise. However, even once we take account of these seasonal distortions, the underlying trend in sales growth is heading downwards. “The first glimpse of summer may have temporarily lifted clothing and footwear, but non-food sales overall continue to be weak. Consumers’ discretionary spending power remains under pressure and the reality is, that with only a gradual return to solid growth in real incomes expected, the market environment is likely to remain extremely challenging for most retailers.” The BRC/KPMG survey showed an even bigger drop in monthly sales once the figures were adjusted for changes in the amount of shop-floor space over the past year. On a like-for-like basis spending fell by 4.2%. The latest official retail sales figures from the Office for National Statistics showed sales volumes were down 1.2% in March, when unusually harsh weather kept consumers away from the shops. Retailers are now hoping that the royal wedding later in May and the World Cup in June and July will boost spending. KPMG’s head of retail, Paul Martin, said: “Retailers have got their work cut out to overcome seemingly endless obstacles, whether it be unpredictable weather or the introduction of new regulation, like GDPR [the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation]. “The upcoming months will provide a number of opportunities for retailers to drive sales and navigate this assault course, including bank holidays, World Cup and of course the royal wedding, although it is clear that trading will remain challenging.” The data and analytics company GlobalData said after a flat year in 2017 clothing and footwear volumes would not start growing again until 2019. GlobalData’s senior retail analyst, Mamequa Boafo, said: “The prioritisation of leisure spending and preference for experiences over ‘stuff’ will see consumers shopping from their own wardrobes this year, utilising what they have already and only buying clothing items they can truly justify spending money on.” Retail vacancies fall Vacancies in the retail industry fell steeply in April as employers reacted to the fall in high street sales by cancelling plans to hire more workers. According to a recruitment industry survey, the retail sector tumbled from the third most-active recruiter to the 10th compared with April 2017 behind hotel and catering and nursing and medical care, which lay eighth and ninth in the rankings, respectively. Tom Hadley, director of policy at the Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation, said a string of high street shop closures fuelled the fall in demand for permanent retail staff last month. “With consumers increasingly shopping online, it’s a good time for retail workers to think about how their skills translate into other areas within the business – for example, recruiters say there’s huge demand for staff in IT, and there is also a shortage of order pickers and packers. “Helping people make career transitions will become increasingly important in this fast-changing business and employment landscape,” he said. Demand for staff is still on the rise in every other sector, he said, but the number of workers chasing each job has dropped steadily since last year. Engineering and IT and computing staff were the most in-demand, with accounting/financial and executive/professional in third and fourth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/may/14/poem-of-the-week-a-small-alba-by-harry-gilonis","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T09:19:06Z","webTitle":"Poem of the week: a small alba by Harry Gilonis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/may/14/poem-of-the-week-a-small-alba-by-harry-gilonis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/may/14/poem-of-the-week-a-small-alba-by-harry-gilonis","fields":{"headline":"Poem of the week: a small alba by Harry Gilonis","bodyText":"a small alba white the moon white the wine white the light white the leaf white the rock white the bark white the stone white the dawn * pond the pond old pond old-pond an old pond the old pond ancient pond an ancient pond the ancient pond ageing pond a lonely pond the quiet pond frog pond This not-so-small alba draws on a poetic genre that originated in Provence with the troubadours. The word “alba” in Occitan means “dawn”: the poetic alba is a dawn-song. Typically, it voices the regret of lovers who must untangle after the night’s pleasures and separate. Sunrise also initiates the dull or possibly dangerous business of the day, as in Romeo and Juliet, where Juliet coaxes Romeo to stay with her by a sweetly obvious subterfuge pretending: “Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day: / It was the nightingale and not the lark, / That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.” The traditional alba, too, sometimes takes the form of a dialogue, which may be shared between the lovers, or by the speaker and the watchman who has roused them. That dialogic element may be reflected in Harry Gilonis’s diptych. Crisp, lit, physical presence commands the first, eight-line poem. The second, 13 lines evoking Bashō’s most famous three, experiments with the frog pond from different grammatical, visual and potentially philosophical angles. The first poem is also a set of variations on a word etymologically connected with “alba”: albus, the Latin for “white”. This is a deft and beautifully unifying connection, verbal and visual. The images ride in on para-rhyming couplets that suggest parity beneath the white light of the moon and the peri-sunrise. We barely glimpse the lovers: if they are present, they’re surely, by implication, joined as equals to each other and as equals to the nature beyond human nature. The poem’s anaphoric structure creates emphasis on the adjective. Monosyllabic plainness, vowels and consonants chording distantly but harmoniously and a sentence-patterning of adjective/definite article/noun, are devices that convey the reader into an older, oral culture. There’s both a Celtic and an oriental quality to the writing. (Wine and the moon were favourite aids to inspiration among the classical Chinese poets.) Carnal associations – white wine but also white flesh – may faintly hover. This white wine is the one element which is made rather than found. It’s essential in evoking, very delicately, the disinhibition that may herald love-making, or perhaps simply the pleasure of drinking sociably with a friend who will be staying over in the spare room. The moon’s light reconciles the whole time frame, the passage from night to dawn, with the staples of the northern landscape: leaf, rock, bark, stone. You could imagine two speakers chanting the first poem, a line in turn. Such a duet could work for the second poem, too. But neither is quite convincing. The alternative would be to read the second poem as an answer to the first. If so, it’s an oblique sort of answer: the speaker at this juncture almost seems to turn away from his addressee. It’s as if a single voice were composing the second poem aloud, trying the pond of language from different angles before it dives. Enclosed in the meditation, the reader slows down, registering line by line the tiny, nuanced differences an adjective or an article can produce. It’s a technique that provokes many questions: how, for example, does “old pond” differ from “old-pond” and how does the latter differ from “an old pond”? Slowly, as the accumulation of self-correction intensifies, an understanding dawns. In Bashō’s original haiku, the isolation of the frog in springtime was significant. He seemed old like the pond: unmated, he plunged alone into its water, to enjoy a quiet swim in the dusk of his life-cycle. Gilonis adds the adjectives “ageing”, “lonely” and “quiet” to the pond rather than the frog, nonetheless developing themes of time and loss. The pond is already ancient, and it is in the process of becoming still more so. The final utterance, “frog pond”, brings everything to rest. What is left to be said or seen? Those two, hyphen-less words form the core image of the diptych, and recall the patterns of the first poem. Circularity reflects in the repeated “O” vowel, both its look and its sound. Wholeness beyond the self has been attained. The alba has been elegantly subverted and expanded by Gilonis’s dawn diptych. Nocturnal coupling ceases, not at the command of any watchman, but because of natural changes. Solitude, old age and death are merely hinted. No obvious lamentation is made. Reading the poem silently on the page, I thought the frog-pond meditation added a further note of robust but delicate humour. Then I spoke it aloud, very slowly, and, I confess, it had a completely unexpected effect on me: it made me cry. Gilonis’s Rough Breathing: Selected Poems covers three decades of his work – meticulous, beautifully poised among many traditions: essential poetry-reading, essential-poetry reading. Since this article was published, the author of a small alba, Harry Gilonis, has confirmed that the two poems are not a diptych, and are intended to be read as separate entities, although he agrees that there is some “conversation” between them. Apologies for misreading the asterisk as a signal of greater connection, and for missing the Contents listing, in which the second poem is given the title it lacks on the page where the two poems appear.

But reading about a new study that says global tourism now accounts for 8% of carbon emissions, three times more than was previously thought made me think– surely we can do better? Whenever I hear about the impact global tourism has on the environment I experience a pang of guilt. While it’s not just the greenhouse gases churned out by planes that are the problem – the study points out it’s also what tourists do when they get to their destination – they account for a big chunk. And yet it’s a pang of guilt I never act on. It’s just too easy to ignore when it’s often cheaper to get a short-hop flight to somewhere sunny than it is to buy an off-peak return on the train to many parts of the UK. Making consumers feel so guilty they change their behaviour – taking more holidays in the UK, forking out hundreds to get to European destinations by train – just isn’t going to work; I’m proof of that. We need firmer action. But increasing the government levies on air travel – forcing up prices to get people to fly less – isn’t the answer. This would have little impact on the most affluent travellers, while hitting the poorest in society. Instead we should look to carbon trading schemes for inspiration. In schemes running in the EU and some areas of the US, international organisations or governments sign up to a total limit on carbon emissions. They then issue companies with permits that allow them to emit a certain amount of carbon. It’s then up to the companies to trade the permits. Companies that want to emit more can buy permits from those that manage to reduce their carbon emissions. We could develop a similar system for flights. Everyone could be given an air mile allowance – say enough for one long-haul return flight a year, or three short-haul flights, so people with families on the other side of the world could see them once a year. If you don’t want to use your allowance, you could sell it off in a government-regulated online marketplace. If you’re keen to do a holiday a month, you’ll have to buy your allowance from someone else. This would be far preferable to increasing tax on airline tickets. It would be redistributive: everyone gets a certain number of air miles, but if you’d rather get the thousands of pounds you could command for them on the online marketplace, you’re free to sell them. Same if you’re just not that bothered about going abroad. But if you want to go over your allowance, it will be at a cost. Of course there would be lots of practical objections. Businesses would hate this – but they, like individuals, could be assigned a certain number of miles that they could supplement or sell, and it might encourage them to actually invest in the technology that can facilitate meetings between people continents apart. Perhaps the hardest aspect would be getting some sort of agreement on an international scale. But we’re only going to make a dent in climate change by doing something pretty radical. Cutting global air travel may be only part of the solution but an individual cap on air travel – that people can trade with each other as they wish – could help reduce the impact flying has on our environment. It’s certainly better than the alternatives – crossing our fingers and hoping people suddenly discover an environmental conscience even if it does mean missing out on that weekend in the sun, or whacking up green taxes in a way that adversely affects less affluent families. • Sonia Sodha is the Observer’s chief leader writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/may/08/ghosts-of-the-tsunami-wins-folio-prize-for-deeply-felt-reportage-of-2011-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T18:35:26Z","webTitle":"Ghosts of the Tsunami wins Rathbones Folio prize for deeply felt reportage of 2011 disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/08/ghosts-of-the-tsunami-wins-folio-prize-for-deeply-felt-reportage-of-2011-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/08/ghosts-of-the-tsunami-wins-folio-prize-for-deeply-felt-reportage-of-2011-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Ghosts of the Tsunami wins Rathbones Folio prize for deeply felt reportage of 2011 disaster","bodyText":"It knocked the Earth six-and-a-half inches off its axis and moved Japan four metres closer to the US: a “harrowing and inspiring” account of the 2011 tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people in Japan has won the Rathbones Folio prize. Richard Lloyd Parry’s Ghosts of the Tsunami took the £20,000 prize ahead of several high-profile fiction competitors, including Mohsin Hamid’s Exit West, Jon McGregor’s Reservoir 13 and Sally Rooney’s Conversations With Friends. Ghosts of the Tsunami was one of three non-fiction books up for the prize – alongside Richard Beard’s memoir The Day That Went Missing and Xiaolu Guo’s Once Upon a Time in the East. The award only began accepting non-fiction two years ago, as part of a widening of its remit to reward excellence in forms beyond fiction writing. As an award-winning foreign correspondent for the Independent and the Times, Lloyd Parry was living in Tokyo when the earthquake struck, resulting in a 120ft-high tsunami hitting north-east Japan and a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi reactors. He would spend the next six years documenting the disaster that killed more than 18,000 people, amassing hundreds of firsthand accounts to reveal the national trauma that lingered long after the sea retreated. Delving into Japan’s folklore around grief and death, Lloyd Parry discovers strange and harrowing stories of survivors attempting to make sense of their losses, including those who never recovered a body, who, in many cases, sought the help of mediums in the hope of locating their loved ones’ remains. Ghost stories began to take shape: Christian, Shinto and Buddhist priests are repeatedly summoned to quell unhappy spirits as reports of possessions rise; while a group of friends report being visited by the ghost of a dead woman in their temporary housing, leaving dampness on the cushion they believed she had been sitting on. Studying the hundreds of accounts, Lloyd Parry comes to understand that “everyone’s grief is different, and that it differs in small and subtle ways according to the circumstances of loss”. “You don’t expect a work of non-fiction to express itself with such literary beauty, but still hold a very unshaking mirror to real events in the real world,” said chair of judges, novelist Jim Crace, who was joined by authors Nikesh Shukla and Kate Summerscale. “It was that combination of reportage and high literature that was so impressive. When I finished reading this book, not only did it close the gap between me and Japan, it also closed the gap between my understanding of my culture and every other culture in the world. I know that is a grand claim to make, but it gave me a sense of the universality of humankind that would improve my understanding of any differences in any community in the world that I come across in the future. It was an improving experience. This is a book to close cultural gaps.” Lloyd Parry received his prize at a ceremony in London on Tuesday night."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/08/katie-ledecky-turning-professional-swimming","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T14:40:30Z","webTitle":"Olympic hero Katie Ledecky set to make professional debut in Indianapolis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/08/katie-ledecky-turning-professional-swimming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/08/katie-ledecky-turning-professional-swimming","fields":{"headline":"Olympic hero Katie Ledecky set to make professional debut in Indianapolis","bodyText":"Katie Ledecky will make her professional swimming debut at a Pro Series meet in Indianapolis next week. The five-time Olympic champion who’s been hailed as the world’s most dominant athlete had announced in March that she had opted to forgo her final two years of amateur eligibility at Stanford University to pursue professional opportunities during the run-up to the 2020 Tokyo Games. Now the 21-year-old from Maryland will enter at the TYR Pro Swim Series on 16-19 May in Indianapolis, headlining a loaded field that includes Olympic gold medalists Nathan Adrian, Matt Grevers, Lilly King, Allison Schmitt and Simone Manuel. Ledecky emerged as a global star at the 2016 Olympics, completing the first 200-400-800 freestyle treble in 48 years and anchoring the winning 4x200m free relay. Her four gold medals and one silver represented the most successful showing by an American woman in Olympic history, while her imperious victory in the 800m by a mind-numbing 11.38 seconds remains one of the most indelible images of the Rio Games. Afterward she enrolled at Stanford and, alongside Manuel, led the Cardinal to the program’s first national team title since 1998, setting a dozen NCAA records and becoming the first freshman in 35 years to receive the Honda Cup, which is awarded to the nation’s top female collegiate athlete. Ledecky was equally dominant as a sophomore, sealing a repeat national team title on her 21st birthday with a 28-second win in the 1,650-yard freestyle in March. One week later, the Maryland teenager announced her intent to turn pro at a National Press Club luncheon in Washington DC. “I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to train and swim collegiately for two years alongside some of the greatest women swimmers of this generation – swimmers who are not just great athletes, but great people as well,” Ledecky said in a statement. “I am equally excited about the opportunities and challenges ahead as I continue to compete internationally and further my education.” Ledecky is no newcomer to the Pro Swim Series after winning last year’s overall points title, but her amateur status precluded her from collecting prize money, or cashing in on endorsement opportunities, due to NCAA eligibility rules. Beyond next week’s pro debut, Ledecky will be eying the US Championships in Irvine, California, and the Pan Pacific Championships the following month in Tokyo, both of which are qualifying meets for next year’s world championships in Gwangju, South Korea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"cities/2018/jun/04/is-chongqing-china-horizontal-skyscraper-the-answer-to-overcrowded-cities-raffles","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T06:15:08Z","webTitle":"Is Chongqing's 'horizontal skyscraper' the answer to overcrowded cities?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jun/04/is-chongqing-china-horizontal-skyscraper-the-answer-to-overcrowded-cities-raffles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/jun/04/is-chongqing-china-horizontal-skyscraper-the-answer-to-overcrowded-cities-raffles","fields":{"headline":"Is Chongqing's 'horizontal skyscraper' the answer to overcrowded cities?","bodyText":"An army of 6,000 construction workers is hard at work at a large site overlooking the conflux of the Yangtze and Jialing rivers in the south-western Chinese megacity of Chongqing. Eight skyscrapers are rising from the river banks: two above 350m and six above 250m. Raffles City Chongqing, a project headed by the architect Moshe Safdie, will boast 134,000 sq m of homes, shops, offices, entertainment, transportation links and a public park. It also features a more unusual claim to fame: a “horizontal skyscraper” 300m in length, stretching across four of the main towers at the 42nd floor. With the building situated in an earthquake zone, it “floats” on top of the towers to accommodate the necessary sway. No landmark development in China is complete without a world record, and Raffles City Chongqing has the highest skybridge linking the most towers. With an adjacent pair of towers connected by smaller skybridges, workers and residents can move around the eight-tower development without needing to return to ground level. “It’s going to become like the heartbeat of the city,” says Safdie of what he describes as his most complex project to date. “In these dense cities like Chongqing there’s no room for big public parks [on the ground], so we have to lift them into the sky.” Chongqing is certainly dense. Outside the building site, the streets are crowded with markets and wholesalers, hawkers and food stalls. Construction workers huddle over bowls of spicy noodles, vendors carry heaving baskets of fruit on their shoulders and shoppers barter over prices. Safdie says the development reflects a growing trend in urban planning: having developed vertically, skyscraper cities are starting to spread horizontally. “I see a period in which zoning changes to being more three-dimensional,” he says. “Rather than just thinking of land as two-dimensional, zoning will start requiring people to connect between one property and another – first at ground level, then above ground.” The skybridge is going to house a public observatory, a residents’ clubhouse, hotel lobby and several restaurants, plus an outdoor viewing deck. Safdie and his team have already trialled connecting bridges between towers at their schemes Sky Habitat and Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. There have been other seeds of experimentation. Minneapolis is home to the world’s most extensive skyway system – and in Asian cities such as Hong Kong and Bangkok skywalks are publicly run facilities, connecting buildings, stations and walkways. These often run only a few floors above the ground – but as towers become taller, skywalks are ascending with them. Beijing’s Linked Hybrid complex is a series of towers connected by a series of skybridges between the 12th and 18th floors. Singapore’s Pinnacle@Duxton is a large public housing project with seven 51-storey apartment blocks connected by skybridges and skyparks, and the Velo Tower in Seoul has two skyscrapers joined by a 30-storey-high skybridge. “The idea of requiring connectivity could be extended – you could even zone off a public street at the 25th level, and anything that reaches 25 floors up would have to accommodate that,” adds Safdie. “You’d have all these opportunities to do things beyond a single parcel of land, and I think that’s where we’re going.” If sky-high connections between buildings are the future, then technology will hasten its arrival. Last year, the German engineering firm ThyssenKrupp unveiled its new horizontal-vertical elevator system. The Multi allows multiple lifts in one shaft, removes height limitations and allows for horizontal lifts to shuttle from one building to another. Buildings could reach higher, and reach across, creating an interconnected network that stretches across the city. “It gives us choices of how to understand the building in a different way,” says Michael Cesarz, CEO of Multi at ThyssenKrupp. “For me, being an architect and an engineer, I don’t have to think of lifts as the centre of the building anymore – I can put them anywhere I like. Moving horizontally creates some new sorts of freedoms. You can move people from one end to the other end of the same or connected buildings. You don’t even have to step out of the lift.” But what are the social implications of a life lived in the air? Could this trend for linked skyscrapers accelerate segregation, creating a two-tier city socially as well as physically: sky-high cities for the elite with everyone else stuck at ground level? Matthew Clifford, the head of energy and sustainability services at JLL Asia Pacific, believes connected tall buildings can have a positive impact – avoiding pollution and traffic at ground level, for example. But he warns: “You need to think very carefully about how people will use the building, and how skybridges could become exclusive, full of luxury restaurants and high-end amenities. The risk is that you can design this architectural feat that ends up only being relevant for a small number of people.” At Raffles City Chongqing, most of the skybridge amenities will be open to the public. The project includes a public park surrounding the towers, while the metro and a bus station connect directly. Safdie argues that the publicly accessible skybridge goes against conceptions about exclusivity. “The tendency is to have a couple of floors for the people, near the ground, and then reserve the upper floors for luxury use,” he explains. “We can’t totally overcome that, because it’s so much part of the culture and the market to make the top luxury. “But in Chongqing we bring people in on different levels: through the park, through the subway, from the bus station, from the parking lot underneath. And to really democratise the building [we have placed] something that’s truly public right at the top, in a way that draws people right through the project.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here • This article was amended on 15 June 2018 to clarify that “floating” section does not create sway, but rather accommodates it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/10/john-adams-violin-concerto-review-full-blooded-yet-refined-playing","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T14:00:14Z","webTitle":"John Adams: Violin Concerto review – full-blooded yet refined playing | Andrew Clements' classical album of the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/10/john-adams-violin-concerto-review-full-blooded-yet-refined-playing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/10/john-adams-violin-concerto-review-full-blooded-yet-refined-playing","fields":{"headline":"John Adams: Violin Concerto review – full-blooded and refined playing","bodyText":"Throughout his composing career, John Adams has generally avoided explicit genre titles such as symphony or concerto for his orchestral works. He has now composed a whole series of scores of genuine symphonic proportions and weight, from the epic Harmonielehre in 1985 to City Noir of 2009, while pieces such as Century Rolls, for piano and orchestra, and Gnarly Buttons, with solo clarinet, are concertos in all but name. But it’s never been a hard and fast rule, and as early as 1993, Adams produced a Violin Concerto that was called simply that, without any more fanciful title or explicit extra-musical connotations. In many ways it’s the nearest thing to “absolute music” that he has ever composed. The concerto was written for the then leader of the Minnesota Orchestra, Jorja Fleezanis, but it was Gidon Kremer who recorded it first (also for Nonesuch). Over the last 15 years or so, Leila Josefowicz has been most closely identified with it. Adams’ regard for Josefowicz’s passionately engaged playing has led him to compose another large-scale work for violin and orchestra for her, Scheherazade 2 (which, to confuse things further, he calls a “dramatic symphony”), and she has now performed the concerto more than 100 times. She has even recorded it before, on what’s now a rather obscure disc, with the composer himself conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra. This new version, though, with David Robertson conducting the St Louis Symphony, vividly demonstrates the quality of Josefowicz’s playing, which manages to be both full-blooded and immensely refined at the same time. It also demonstrates the way Adams has so successfully reinvented the traditional concerto form in his own eclectic image, whether asserting the expressive power of melody in the first two movements, or in the sheer physicality of the final, irresistible moto perpetuo. One of Adams’ essentially symphonic works that is not called a symphony, Naive and Sentimental Music from 1999, appears on the latest Chandos disc from Peter Oundjian and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. It’s a decent enough performance, if perhaps not quite so svelte and cogent as its only current rival, from Esa-Pekka Salonen and the LA Philharmonic, for whom the piece was written. The RSNO’s pairing, though, is Absolute Jest, for string quartet and orchestra, with the Doric Quartet as soloists, which seems to me one of Adams’ weakest recent works – a riff on Beethoven (the late quartets Opp 131 and 135 particularly) whose jokey borrowings wear very thin, very quickly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/12/saturdays-best-tv-eurovision-song-contest-the-private-life-of-the-royal-academy","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T05:00:24Z","webTitle":"Saturday’s best TV: Eurovision Song Contest; The Private Life of the Royal Academy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/12/saturdays-best-tv-eurovision-song-contest-the-private-life-of-the-royal-academy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/12/saturdays-best-tv-eurovision-song-contest-the-private-life-of-the-royal-academy","fields":{"headline":"Saturday’s best TV: Eurovision Song Contest; The Private Life of the Royal Academy","bodyText":"Eurovision Song Contest 2018 8pm, BBC One Touting his finely calibrated blend of enthusiasm and eye-rolling disbelief, Graham Norton is once again our guide to Eurovision’s endlessly bizarre cocktail of Euro-cheese and barely disguised geopolitical tetchiness.

With just over two weeks to go until the 25 May vote on liberalising Ireland’s strict abortion laws, Facebook announced it would restrict advertising to organisations and people based in the Republic. The move follows accusations that attempts have been made to swing votes across the world through foreign-funded campaigns and so-called astroturfing. “This is an issue we have been thinking about for some time,” Facebook said. “Today, as part of our efforts to help protect the integrity of elections and referendums from undue influence, we will begin rejecting ads related to the referendum if they are being run by advertisers based outside of Ireland.” As part of the process, Ireland has also became the first country outside the US to receive a set of advertiser-transparency tools Facebook promised in early in April. “Our view ads feature – which enables Irish Facebook users to see all of the ads any advertiser is running on Facebook in Ireland at the same time – has been fast tracked and is operational today,” the company said. Abortion has long been a divisive issue in Ireland. Voters will be asked whether they want to repeal article 40.3.3 – known as the eighth amendment – which enshrined a ban on abortion in the Irish constitution in 1983. Facebook said other features promised last month have also been fast-tracked in order to launch them in the run-up to the vote. “What we are now doing for the referendum on the eighth amendment will allow us to operate as though these tools, which are not yet fully available, were in place today with respect to foreign referendum-related advertising,” it said. The delay in launching the feature, and the short time left in the campaign, led to criticism of the company. “Facebook are always late to the party,” said Gavin Sheridan, an Irish social media expert who has been following the digital side of the referendum campaign. “They were late with Russian interference in the US election … All their announcements seem designed to stave off regulation, and for me it boils down to do we allow them to self-regulate, or do we regulate ourselves.” Facebook said it would be working directly with political parties and campaign groups on both sides of the vote, who are being asked to notify the company “if they have concerns about ad campaigns”. It added: “We will then assess and act on those reports. We will also be using machine learning to help us with this effort to identify ads that should no longer be running.” Irish law bars foreign money from going to political parties and registered campaigns. But the legislation does not cover money spent directly on digital advertising, a loophole that observers say has been exploited by groups overseas wishing to influence the vote. The Transparent Referendum Initiative has been tracking online advertising around the vote. Two weeks ago Liz Carolan, its founder, said her group “had picked up 144 different pages paying for ads at one point in time over the last few months”. As for who is paying for those ads, said Sheridan, “the only people who know that for certain are Facebook themselves”.He and Carolan welcomed Facebook’s move and pointed out that Google and its subsidiary YouTube had yet to make any similar commitment. “We are receiving large numbers of screengrabs indicating spend on advertising on these platforms happening under the radar,” Carolan said. “Yet we have even less information on these advertisements than we do on Facebook ads.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/12/doctors-note-dog-on-plane-emotional-support-animals","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T08:30:25Z","webTitle":"Prescription pets: 'I got a doctor’s note to fly with my dog'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/12/doctors-note-dog-on-plane-emotional-support-animals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/12/doctors-note-dog-on-plane-emotional-support-animals","fields":{"headline":"Prescription pets: 'I got a doctor’s note to fly with my dog'","bodyText":"Going through an airport with Joan gives everything a surreal quality. When we got to JFK in New York one morning a few months ago, the harried pace of checking in and security was slowed because everyone wanted to spend time with her. Sometimes she stopped for a drink of water or to make eye contact with a baby. When we boarded our plane to San Francisco, a fellow passenger was taking selfies with Joan and sending them to his wife before we even took off. At one point I fell asleep and woke up to find him cradling her like a baby and cooing into her ears. Turbulence, which usually makes me turn to the drinks trolley, was a breeze: I just held her. Not to mention that visiting my family in California was so much more tolerable with Joan as a buffer. At this point I should point out that Joan is a 40-something pound English bulldog. I adopted her from a Brooklyn animal shelter three years ago, when she was a year old, after she had been rescued from an abusive and neglectful home. Luckily, she immediately adapted to the life of love and luxury I was all too ready to lavish on her. She’s playful and surprisingly agile for a bulldog, but also enjoys sleeping for about 18 hours a day. She’s over the 25lb limit most airlines have for bringing pets on domestic flights. And even if animals are below the approved size limit, airlines charge more than $100 (£73) to carry them, though in any case they won’t allow snub-nose breeds such as bulldogs or pugs to be checked in as cargo due to breathing concerns. But I can bring Joan for free and let her sit at my feet. And if my pet were a 120lb great dane or a tiny chicken, I could bring it on, too. That’s because Joan has been prescribed to me as an emotional support animal (ESA) for the past two years. In the US, with a letter from a mental health professional, any pet can be named as such. That letter, which must state that the animal is medically essential for the owner, can override the rules: your pet can travel with you on a plane for free or it can live with you in a place that doesn’t usually allow pets. What’s more, no one can legally ask why you require it. It’s a loophole that, depending on whom you ask, is either helping people struggling with often unseen disabilities; making pet owners’ lives easier; or leaving the system open to abuse. It is, for now, an American phenomenon (ESAs are not recognised as certified assistant animals in the UK), and it’s on the rise. Delta Airlines says it carries more than 250,000 service and support animals annually, an increase of nearly 150% since 2015. The Air Carrier Access Act defines emotional support animals as “any animal that is individually trained or able to provide assistance to a person with a disability; or any animal that assists persons with disabilities by providing emotional support”. They’re animals that don’t have special training (unlike a service animal, such as a guide dog for the blind, that has been trained to perform a task or service for its owner), but are there for psychiatric comfort. They are often cats and dogs, but ducks, turkeys and pigs have been spotted on board. Unsurprisingly, it’s creating havoc on planes. For every dog like mine that snores at my feet during a flight, there are reports of far more unruly behaviour, from cats urinating on drinks trolleys to ducks blocking the aisles. In January, astonished airport passengers filmed a peacock awaiting the green light to board a flight in New Jersey; in February, a student told how she flushed her dwarf hamster down a toilet in panic after an airline refused permission for it to join her flight; in March, a French bulldog died after being put in an overhead locker; last year, a man was hospitalised and had 28 stitches in his face after he was mauled by a support dog in the seat next to him. Delta Airlines reports that incidents such as defecating have nearly doubled since 2016. *** I found it almost ludicrously easy to get a certificate for Joan a year after adopting her; I was keen to take her to California to visit my family, so looked for a website that offered online diagnosis. There are several; I obtained my letter from one called CertaPet. In its words, it is a “direct-to-consumer tele-health service” that connects clients to one of 40 therapists. The company was started in December 2014 by Erik Rivera, a US military veteran who had been a bomb technician in the Iraq war. “Consider the guys I know,” he says. “There was drug abuse and trauma issues. To me, mental health was not a taboo subject.” Rivera’s parents were psychiatrists, so, “growing up, I always had a doctor in my pocket, I always had access to people and didn’t deal with health care like most people”. He was looking for something “hyper-specific and very niche” that could connect doctors to patients in the privacy of their own homes. Something such as prescribing pain medicine would not lend itself well to such an arrangement, but dermatology might. He eventually landed on the idea of online mental health services that could, as his website states, “connect patients with licensed mental health professionals who can write them a recommendation for an emotional support animal”. The screening process begins with a free, multiple-choice questionnaire based on the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders that asks questions such as, “Over the past two weeks, how often have you had little interest or pleasure in doing things that you usually like to do?” and, “Over the past two weeks, how often have you felt sad or depressed?” If what you want is a letter saying you’re anxious or depressed enough to have a support animal, it’s easy to know which of the answers – Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Always – to pick. The disorders that can help get you a support animal letter can include anxiety, stress, insomnia, depression – things almost everyone can suffer from. You get an automatic notice of whether you’re a good candidate. If you want to continue, you pay either $149 (£110) for a housing or travel letter or $199 (£146) for both. The next step is a longer online assessment that asks about your history of abuse and depression. “It does help us screen people who are dealing with day-to-day stress, but just like their dogs,” says Prairie Conlon, CertaPet’s clinical manager. “They go through the assessment. These are intense questions from anxiety and depression into schizophrenic tendencies, though we are not diagnosing. As a clinician, we look it over and then there’s a phone call.” That’s how it worked for me: a quick pre-screening, payment, a test and a five- to 10-minute phone call with a clinician, describing my history of panic attacks and depression. Then I got a letter that they advertise you can get in less than 48 hours. “We are saying cats or dogs,” Conlon says. “We aren’t doing peacocks or anything like that. We also let them know if your animal is aggressive that voids the letter.” Does this leave them open to people faking or exaggerating symptoms? “Most of the therapists don’t feel people are abusing the system,” Rivera says. “At a company level, we don’t think there’s a lot of abuse happening. If you can figure out how to stop people from lying, I would like to hear that solution.” Emily Cline is a cheerful 22-year-old social media manager who recently moved to New York after graduating from university in Florida. She’s in possession of an ESA letter from CertaPet for her Italian greyhound puppy, Calvin Cline. “I’ve been flying by myself since I was about five – my parents divorced when I was really little, and it was easier for me to fly back and forth between Dallas and San Antonio, which is a 45-minute flight versus a four-hour drive. I would fly 20 times a year as a child.” When she was about 12 and flying, “something didn’t click in my brain and I started to think we were in a metal tube in the sky. What if the pilot passes out? I would go over all of these worst-case scenario ideas with panic attacks where I almost felt as if I would have to get off the plane. I have panic disorder. It’s not diagnosed, but I know what’s going on.” By the time she was in her second year of university, she was given a prescription for Xanax (alprazolam) for her anxiety. “I was surprised how easy it was. I couldn’t get an appointment for a school counsellor, but I could get a prescription for Xanax.” The next year, she researched how a dog could help her deal with anxiety. She calls Calvin a Velcro dog. “He’s like a third arm, an extension of me. He just sits on my lap, he sleeps with me, he sits on the couch with me, he likes to sit on my shoulder. He’s very clingy,” Cline says with a giggle. “And what sets them apart is they’re really there for you and they depend on you so much for taking care of them. Your brain is so focused on taking care of this tiny, cute dog. That’s why flying with them is so great.” She recently flew with him and her boyfriend from Florida to New York without an issue. People who may exaggerate their symptoms so they can live with or travel with their pets is the least of our problems, Cline says. “I don’t think that’s the worst possible thing that’s going on in the world.” *** Like many millennial pet owners, Kim Ring, who is 25 and works in public relations in Denver, Colorado, calls herself a “dog mom”. Finn is her two-year-old jack russell terrier mix. “I am one of those annoying people who got a doctor’s note so I could bring my dog on a plane. I know it’s terrible, but I just wanted to take him home to meet my parents, who have a big backyard and live in St Louis, and didn’t want to pay an arm and a leg to do it. I do have anxiety and see a therapist for it, and I asked her to write a note on letterhead designating him an ESA. But the thing is, my dog has so much energy and there’s no way he would actually calm me down. I have to heavily medicate him for flights with CBD [cannabidiol-based] dog treats. He was mellow and didn’t bark, but he did shake. I feel as if it was almost a selfish thing for me to take him, even though everyone who sat next to me took pictures of him and played with him the whole time.” Taylor Truitt, a veterinarian who owns the Vet Set, a clinic in the leafy Carroll Gardens neighbourhood of Brooklyn, is outspoken on the subject of ESA letters. “I see a potential problem that the people abusing the qualifications for support animals are actually putting people with legitimate working service animals at risk,” she said. “I think, for some people, ESAs have a legitimate purpose. My sister is a clinical psychologist who specialises in trauma, sexual abuse and veterans. For some of these people, their dog can save their lives, get them out of the house. It’s important to honour them with the respect of what a real ESA is.” Truitt has seen evidence of malpractice. “One of my clients brought in their new frenchie puppy this weekend,” she says. “The breeder flew her up from Florida, and in the packet of paperwork he inadvertently left his letter from his therapist stating this eight-week-old puppy was an ESA to help him with his stress and anxiety. It was one of those form letters you can purchase online. I can’t imagine what special training an eight-week-old puppy can have to help with stress except congenital cuteness. I’ve been on a flight where this is out of control, with a dog running down the aisles and another barking. Are they going to emergency land the plane if your dog is having, say, respiratory issues? Probably not, so another question is what are you subjecting your pet to. We could use some etiquette.” Delta Airlines responded to the recent increase in ESAs by changing its policy for service and support animals. Customers need not only a letter but clearance from a veterinarian or immunisation record and a confirmation of animal training. The US Department of Transportation says that unusual service animals (ie anything other than a dog or a cat) will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, but it’s at the discretion of the airline to exclude animals that are too large or perceived as a threat. Delta prohibits ferrets, snakes, goats, “farm poultry”, hedgehogs and beasts with tusks, for example. It was a particularly flamboyant animal that ruffled feathers this year. In January, Brooklyn-based performance artist Ventiko was not allowed to take a United Airlines flight with her support animal, a large peacock named Dexter, whose elaborate Instagram presence features photos of him cuddling with naked women and hanging out on thrones. She was photographed by an incredulous fellow passenger as she tried to board the plane with Dexter at Newark and the story immediately went viral on social media. I emailed Ventiko asking about her story and, after a delay, she replied: “My apologies for taking a few days to respond. The entire situation over the past few months has been a bit traumatic. Slow responses is one of the residual effects.” We then spoke for nearly an hour, during which I found her a fairly sympathetic character who is just trying to do right by her peacock companion animal, a bird she adopted after his mate and their chicks were eaten by a predator in Florida. He’s bonded to her, and she seems almost uncannily devoted to him. But she decided she didn’t want to get any further death threats, and no longer wanted to speak on the record. Last year, on a Delta flight to California, an Alabama man named Marlin Jackson was assigned a window seat. In a subsequent statement, his attorney J Ross Massey said, “He saw a large dog on the middle seat that he had to cross over to get to his seat. After he goes to buckle his seatbelt, the dog attacks him. The owner yanked the dog back, but it broke free and went into a second attack, which resulted in Mr Jackson needing 28 stitches. It was reportedly an ESA.” In the wake of the publicity the case received, Massey has received “dozens if not hundreds of people calling me about a badly behaving dog on a plane”, he tells me. People contacting him with stories of ESA pets touching them, crawling on them or defecating at their feet are unfortunate, possibly disturbing, events, but hardly warrant the law, he says. “It’s a nuanced situation. Ultimately, the airlines will have to police themselves. I’m not sure how quickly the government is going to act.” One group that would like to see a change is the service animal community – people such as Laura Falteisek, 64, a retired marketing manager who lives in northern California with five pedigree, elaborately groomed poodles that she has trained: Titan came first, then Jodie, his niece; the rest – Ava, Chin Chin and Sequin – are Jodie’s from litters with two different sires. Falteisek had a mutt as a child that she had wanted to be a service animal after reading about Helen Keller. “I think I only taught him ‘left’ and ‘right,’” she says with a laugh. She was drawn to poodles because “they’re tall, light on their feet, don’t shed and are smart”. Her dogs respond to the command “bring”, because she is unable to bend well and has general mobility issues due to past injuries following an equestrian accident. “They reach for me and pick up stuff,” Falteisek says. “They could pick up a coin off the floor. They’ll do it all day long.” Titan, for example, can brace her if she stumbles. “If I drop my cane, he gets it for me. He’s great at helping me with stairs.” He can bark on command, indicate steps and barriers, and understands the command “help me”. People want to interact with the poodles when they are essentially at work. “I was at a grocery store in so much pain looking down at yoghurt, and someone goes, ‘Oh, look, it’s a poodle!’ I didn’t want to respond and I didn’t want to talk to anybody right then. They have vests that say, this is a service dog, not a pet.” Her worry is that the bad reputation some support animals are getting will give all service animals a bad name. Someone told Falteisek she was considering getting an ESA letter for her dogs because, “I just can’t leave them in the car”. She explains that properly training a service dog is incredibly expensive and complicated, “and yet you’ll see people with these snarling, snapping dogs going everywhere with their owners.” Animals are commonly used in therapy roles. In the UK, therapy animals have been an established idea for decades – Pets As Therapy is a charity founded in 1983 – and therapy dogs are common visitors in hospitals, care homes and schools. The charity Support Dogs provides dogs to support people with autism, as well as seizure alert dogs. Although ESAs don’t exist in the UK, there are cases where pets have proved to be vitally therapeutic. Ellie Taylor, 20, who is from Rowley Regis in the West Midlands, found that her pet rabbits helped her through a difficult childhood. “When I was 13 in 2011, I lost my grandad suddenly and was also having problems at school with bullying. I wasn’t able to cope and became ill with anorexia.” Her mother got her professional help and she left school to concentrate on her recovery. “I still felt as if I was in hell and that nothing around me could possibly make me feel better. When my mum could see I was slowly improving, she agreed for me to have a rabbit, because she felt that if I had responsibilities, it would help me to get better.” Taylor felt excited for the first time in two years. She got two rabbits, Roary and Tiger, and because she still wasn’t back in school full-time, spent nearly all her time with them. “They comforted me when I felt like I had no one and gave me some normality back by looking after them. It was weird that an animal could make you feel like this and take the pain away, but the pain began to ease and I felt like myself again.” Tiger died, and she and Roary got through that loss together. Where she lives now has a no-pets policy, but she fought to keep Roary with her and won, something she wouldn’t have had to do if she could have him officially recognised as a support animal. In 2016, vet charity PDSA honoured Roary with a “commendation for devotion” for his support. *** It’s indisputable that animals provide comfort and support to their owners, but whether that means they should be certified in this manner is less clear: where there’s a system, there will always been people trying to exploit that system. Animals can be so much better at calming us down than humans. Take me, for example. Do I have anxiety? Sure. A history of depression? Yes. Insomnia? Almost nightly. And, like more than half my peers in New York, I have been in therapy. And the thing is, Joan does bring me endless comfort. After a terse email exchange with a colleague, taking her on a walk or just petting her on the sofa are effective balms for encroaching panic attacks. No one would look at me and think, “That woman needs a dog just to get through the day,” but, in a sense, I do. Are we American pet owners needy? Yes, and owners like me who bring their pets while travelling are certainly entitled, but the overall indignity of travel has brought us here, too. It already feels like a free-for-all in the sky. If there are screaming children on every flight, and tiny spaces with not much legroom that make everyone uncomfortable, and they’re going to charge you for bottles of water and checking in a bag, what harm is there in bringing a pet that soothes you? When my flight touched down in San Francisco, Joan woke from her slumber and soon ran into the arms of my waiting mother. When Mum asked about who I was dating, or when my dad wanted to complain about politics, I could tell them I was going to take Joan for a walk to the beach. For once, I wasn’t acting like a sullen teenager when interacting with my family. That respite, not to mention saving hundreds of dollars on boarding Joan while I was out of town, meant that loophole or not, it was totally worth it. • Commenting on this piece?

Ackamoor (born Bruce Baker in 1951) grew up in Chicago and was mentored by pianist Cecil Taylor before forming a group he led on a cross-Africa odyssey, presenting his music with theatrical panache – he still takes to the stage in pharaonic headdress. Ghanaian Afrobeat is one of the flavours in play, notably on the driving opener Tinoge, but his tenor sax often recalls the avant-gardism of Pharoah Sanders and he can be stately and lyrical when he chooses, as on Papyrus. He also plays keytar (a glorified synth), favours a violin and guitar in his six piece line-up and overlays his music with Sun Ra-style chants dedicated to ecological themes on tracks such as Warrior Dance. His Soliloquy for Michael Brown, the young black man gunned down by Missouri police in 2014, has no words, Ackamoor’s tenor moving from grief to rage over clattering congas. The production of Malcolm Catto, of London’s Heliocentrics, adds subtle, atmospheric touches, notably on the squelching dub of Land of Ra.

To plug the gap, oversubscribed institutions sought to rapidly expand when the government lifted the student numbers cap. There is startling confirmation of this in recent figures: between 2011 and 2016, Aston University grew by 80%, Coventry University by 53% and Surrey by 50%. But this is a short-sighted decision that risks growing tensions between the university and its local community and damaging student wellbeing. Universities have more to lose than they are perhaps prepared to accept. Bristol city council has recently begun conversations about curbing the growth of the city’s two primary universities. University expansion is problematic because councils lose out on tax revenue from student houses, since students don’t pay council tax. And residents resent the developers who buy up the housing stock, pushing out local tenants in favour of students. Students suffer from unchecked expansion, too, and campuses are struggling to respond to increasing demand for mental health support services. Studies show increasing loneliness and isolation among the UK’s undergraduate population. For me, the words loneliness and isolation capture my recent undergraduate experience more than any others in the English language. It is possible that my overcrowded degree course contributed to these feelings. On graduation day, I could recall the names of only a handful of people I’d shared seminars with, our relationships only as deep as a two-minute fortnightly conversation as the previous class filtered out of our room. At best I knew the first name of less than a sixth of our year group. And despite the 10 compulsory modules we’d shared, and the exam halls we’d populated together, I couldn’t recall seeing before the faces crossing the stage at graduation. In a swollen cohort it’s easy to feel anonymous. Relationships with my coursemates were at best cursory, and with my lecturers, distant. When I walked through the corridors of my department and smiled to passing lecturers or former tutors, their glazed expressions indicated that they too were faced by an endless sea of unrecognisable faces. I was ill during my three years at university, with recurrent bouts of severe depression and generalised anxiety disorder. My attendance dipped, and the anonymity of being one name in tens of thousands made it easy to fall under the radar. Despite missing over half of my seminars, it wasn’t until my final term that a tutor got in touch for the first time to check if things were OK. I do not blame the tutors who can’t spot struggling students in their classrooms. The increasing volume of students places greater pressure on academics and makes it impossible for them to build meaningful relationships. When my parent’s generation talks about university, many paint it as the days of their lives, and fondly recount trips to the pub with lecturers. Today’s students are more likely to wonder whether their professor could pick them out of a line-up. University is a challenging time for many students, a period of instability, change and stress in which it’s easy to feel unsupported. This is compounded for students on social sciences or humanities courses, which have few course hours. Students are left bereft of routine or structure, and feel disconnected from the institutions that stamp their degree certificates. University becomes a room you sit in for a couple of hours a week, the remaining hours probably spent cramming alone in a library if you can find a seat, and in your bedroom if you can’t. With the absence of anything to keep you connected, it is easier for depression to pull you under. You might think that after graduating I would have run a mile from my university, but I’ve gone on to carry out research on the student experience, focusing on mental health and wellbeing. The one thing I’ve learned is that if universities are going to take student mental health seriously, the place to start is by tackling their unchecked growth.

Mattarella is seeking a neutral government after rival parties failed to establish a working coalition during a last-ditch attempt on Monday to end the political deadlock that resulted from inconclusive elections on 4 March. The 76-year-old is expected to name a prime minister on Wednesday to deal with matters such as approving the 2019 budget before fresh elections are held at the end of the year. Names mentioned in the Italian media on Tuesday included Elisabetta Belloni, the foreign ministry’s secretary general, and Marta Cartabia, the deputy head of the constitutional court. There is also speculation that Lucrezia Reichlin, an economist, Anna Maria Tarantola, a former director of the Bank of Italy and former president of the national broadcaster Rai, and Fabiola Gianotti, the first female director of the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), are in the running. Carlo Cottarelli, a former executive director at the International Monetary Fund, is among the male candidates named. “[Nominating a woman] could really be a window of opportunity for [Mattarella] to try and change some traditions and conventions during a really extraordinary moment in Italian politics,” said Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at the Guido Carli Free International University for Social Studies in Rome. “It is a way to appeal to public opinion. The majority of the Italian population is female, but until now this hasn’t corresponded with representation in the political system. So I think there is an idea – not PR, as that would be too cheap – to enlarge representation while providing a sort of exit strategy from the crisis, and one that could change the discourse.” Italy’s two populist parties, the Five Star Movement (M5S) and Lega, which together secured over 50% of the vote in the March elections, have called for snap elections, which could scupper Mattarella’s plan. After his nominee is sworn into office he or she will face a parliamentary vote of confidence, which would be likely to take place next week. Only the centre-left Democratic party backs Mattarella’s plan for a technocratic government, and if the selected premier fails the confidence vote, then Mattarella would need to dissolve parliament with elections to follow. Luigi Di Maio, the leader of M5S, which emerged as the biggest single party in March with 33% of the vote, and Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right Lega which was the winner within a centre-right coalition that secured 37%, are calling for elections as early as 8 July. A summer vote would be unprecedented for Italy. “Proposing elections on 8 July would be a nightmare,” said Catia Polidori, an MP with Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia, a partner in the centre-right alliance. “People won’t vote, they’ll be at the beach. But Italians don’t want a technocratic government. We need to respect their vote. The centre-right alliance got the biggest share and so should be responsible for forming a government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/08/the-fiver-swansea-stoke-premier-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T15:37:35Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Perilously close to being involved in relegating two clubs in one season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/08/the-fiver-swansea-stoke-premier-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/08/the-fiver-swansea-stoke-premier-league","fields":{"headline":"Perilously close to being involved in relegating two clubs in one season","bodyText":"THAT SINKING FEELING If Southampton lose at Swansea, their players will be locked in a disused lighthouse and whipped for several weeks with dead seagulls before being fed to a harem of foul-tempered seals. Sorry, reader, The Fiver has just seen some previews and felt the need to test a theory, which turns out to be unsound: it clearly is possible to overstate the importance of Tuesday’s big relegation showdown. But it’s a doozy of a clash, all the same, and definitely not the sort that a manager would want to lose without an excuse. Happily, Ailsa from Home and Away has one to hand if required, thanks to the Marriott hotel in Swansea. Southampton turned up there on Monday and prepared to tuck Nathan Redmond into bed when staff informed the club their booking could not be fulfilled because of a sudden outbreak of a virus. Mysteriously, the hotel’s website suggested other guests could still be accommodated but Southampton were told to go elsewhere, and the only place that could meet their princess-and-the-pea like criteria is close to Cardiff. The switch could add at least an hour to Southampton’s pre-match drive. So that’s effectively a two-goal lead for Swansea already, right? Not that football’s most prolific conspiracy theorist since David Icke needs help finding external factors to blame for his team’s failures. Back in August, for instance, he attributed his Stoke side’s inability to beat West Brom to the grass at the Hawthorns, which, reckoned Ailsa, had been deliberately left long to sabotage the intricate passing of Ryan Shawcross and Peter Crouch. And there is scarcely a referee in England who hasn’t been accused of ineptitude by a manager who is perilously close to being involved in the relegation of two clubs in one season. That wouldn’t be a unique feat, in fairness. In fact, it could be the start of a hat-trick like the one English football enjoyed in the 1980s. Ron Saunders got the ball rolling in 1986 when, five years after winning the title with Aston Villa, he gilded his legendary status at Villa Park by leading Birmingham City and West Brom towards the drop. Villa fans didn’t get to laugh about that for long, though. Because the following season they went down under Billy McNeill, hired after leaving Manchester City, who went down with them. And the season after that Dave Bassett completed things in style, leaving Watford when they were falling out of the top flight only to take over Sheffield United, who were promptly relegated to the third tier. It would be some going to join that roll of honour, not least because it would entail failing to win against a Swansea side that have only scored two goals in their last seven matches and appear to be running exclusively on Carlos Carvalhal’s amusing metaphors. Hope also comes from knowing that, while Southampton face Manchester City on the final day of the season, Swansea’s last match is against Ailsa’s fallen former club, Stoke.

Their cranes are sprouting across the city, and it’s marvellous,” Boris Johnson said when he was mayor of London. The cranes were not just building the ubiquitous luxury apartment towers defining the city; they were also digging down, tunnelling underneath the most expensive streets to create multiple storey basements housing swimming pools, cinemas and even an artificial beach with a cascading waterfall. There is an argument that the concentration of billionaires in certain areas of the capital has had little impact on the housing crisis and is in fact positive, providing jobs and services and stimulating certain parts of the economy. But this is not the main impact: instead, the glut of foreign capital creates soaring inflation, distorting the housing market and raising property prices and rents throughout the city. This happens through a process of “trickle-down”. Wealth does indeed trickle down, but instead of benefiting the less well-off, as free marketeers claimed it would, it displaces them. This is true for the old English elites who can no longer afford to live in Kensington and Chelsea, and for the residents of social housing forced out of their homes as estates are demolished and luxury apartments go up in their place. Researchers at Savills, the property company, identified this trend as far back as 2011. In a report, The Champagne Tower Effect, Savills wrote positively: “As billionaires displace multimillionaires from the top addresses, so they in turn displace millionaires … equity migrates to more peripheral areas of the capital and, eventually, out of the capital to the rest of the UK.” As the English upper classes sell up in Kensington and Chelsea, they buy their children homes in once unfashionable places on the outreaches of the capital, which become property hotspots. In turn, middle-class families unable to afford their fast gentrifying areas are pushed out to cities like Bristol or south coast towns from Hastings to Margate, which are becoming a mix of priced-out London artists and creatives alongside a large homeless population in temporary accommodation. So the extreme wealth of the basement billionaires is directly linked to plummeting levels of home ownership, high rents and poor conditions. The study into luxury basements by Roger Burrows and researchers at Newcastle University’s Global Urban Research Unit, reported by the Guardian, found that more than 4,600 basements had been built in London in the last decade – and it is important because it becomes impossible to dismiss the trend as anecdotal evidence and the preserve of a statistically insignificant handful. One street in Chelsea boasts 22 approved basements, including 12 swimming pools and five cinemas. Six are described as “large”, which means at least three storeys deep. Many of the most opulent basements are to be found in the shadow of the charred hulk of Grenfell Tower, just a few minutes walk away. In Benjamin Disraeli’s novel Sybil, written in 1845, he described “Two nations; between whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy; who are as ignorant of each other’s habits, thoughts, and feelings, as if they were dwellers in different zones or inhabitants of different planets.” The stark inequalities found in British cities ensure that Disraeli’s words continue to have contemporary resonance. Today, at the other end of the income scale to the owners of the super basements, some people are enduring subterranean living conditions of a very different kind – paying a high proportion of their low pay for glorified cellars, in damp, poorly ventilated rooms with no natural light. In one instance in 2015 a landlord in north London was forced to pay back £70,000 in rent for letting out “unsatisfactory and substandard” accommodation, with seven people living in one cellar. The gulf between the lifestyles of the super-rich and the rest of us is vast. Grenfell wasn’t just a home for the poorest and most deprived living in ghettoised tower blocks. It was a mixed community of people in many occupations and from a variety of places, fighting poor housing conditions that they had repeatedly warned against, in the face of a lack of accountability that meant their voices went unheard. As well as safety standards, when the Grenfell disaster struck, local groups were also in the midst of campaigning against regeneration plans for the area which included the demolition of estates and the leasing of North Kensington library to a private school. These economic processes, which some refer to as gentrification and others call social cleansing, are taking place throughout London and other British cities. They are the consequence of very large injections of unregulated foreign investment, in tandem with local authority-led regeneration strategies. Because the UK offers one of the most lax regulatory environments in the world, super-rich property owners can safely hide behind anonymous shell companies of dubious if not corrupt provenance – and many never occupy their luxury apartments or their gargantuan subterranean mansions. It is difficult to argue that the presence of such large concentrations of extreme wealth is beneficial to any city, because wealth does not trickle down, it displaces. This is the collateral damage suffered; Grenfell Tower is one symbol of this social violence, the iceberg luxury basements are another. • Anna Minton is the author of Big Capital: Who is London For? and a reader in architecture at the University of East London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/08/salisbury-attack-police-continue-examine-home-sergei-skripal","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T13:29:21Z","webTitle":"Salisbury attack: police continue to examine home of Sergei Skripal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/08/salisbury-attack-police-continue-examine-home-sergei-skripal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/08/salisbury-attack-police-continue-examine-home-sergei-skripal","fields":{"headline":"Salisbury attack: police continue to examine home of Sergei Skripal","bodyText":"Detectives are continuing to carry out investigative work on the house of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal more than two months after the nerve agent attack on him and his daughter, Yulia. All other sites related to the attack in Salisbury have been released by the police for decontamination to take place, a cabinet meeting was told on Tuesday. Theresa May and senior ministers were informed that more than 400 police officers, including 250 counter-terrorism specialists, had been involved in the inquiry into the 4 March poisoning. But there was no indication from the meeting that the operation was any nearer to pinpointing who carried out the attack. Last week, the UK’s national security adviser, Sir Mark Sedwill, said no individual or group had yet been identified. The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “The police have now released all the sites for decontamination, except for the Skripal house. “Cleanup work is well under way and the priority is making the sites safe so they can be returned to use and Salisbury can get back to normal. “More than 250 officers from across the counter-terrorism policing network have been deployed, alongside more than 160 officers from Wiltshire police and a range of experts and partners. “Officers continue to trawl through more than 5,000 hours of CCTV and examine more than 1,350 exhibits that have been seized. About 500 witnesses have been identified and hundreds of statements have been taken.” The spokesman said a range of government support was being provided to help Salisbury get back to normal, including grant funding for businesses and support for tourism initiatives. “Cabinet praised the resilience of the residents of Salisbury in the face of widespread disruption caused by Russia’s reckless actions,” the spokesman added. “The city is safe and it is open for business.” At a public meeting in Salisbury last month, government scientists warned that the residue of the novichok nerve agent used in the attempted murder could still be as potent as when it was deployed. Sites that have been released for decontamination work include the pub and restaurant the Skripals visited before they collapsed, and a section of the park where they fell ill. Skripal, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who spied for MI6, is in hospital after being exposed to the nerve agent smeared on the doorknob of his home. Yulia Skripal, who was also exposed to the chemical, has been treated and released from hospital."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/may/25/polydactyl-cats-invisible-trousers-fashion-trends","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T11:00:45Z","webTitle":"From polydactyl cats to invisible trousers: this week’s fashion trends","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/25/polydactyl-cats-invisible-trousers-fashion-trends","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/may/25/polydactyl-cats-invisible-trousers-fashion-trends","fields":{"headline":"From polydactyl cats to invisible trousers: this week’s fashion trends","bodyText":"Going up ‘More is more’ Rihanna’s motto for summer.

You can bivouac overnight in the park but the outdoorsy town of Barcelonnette makes a great base, with a good range of campsites (€27 for two people with car, tent or caravan at rioclar.fr) and hotels, plus a brilliant market every Wednesday and Saturday. marthah Fun on the water, Vendée We spend our May half-terms in La Tranche-sur-Mer, a beach resort in the Vendée, an easy drive from the ferry ports. There are miles of sandy beaches, which are deserted in late May and June. They are shielded from the strong Atlantic currents by the Île de Ré, so are ideal for children and for water sports. We’ve hired sea kayaks from WaterFun before, and it’s easy to rent surf boards. There are cycle paths through the town and all along the coast so we cycle everywhere as a family. Fresh mussels and oysters are widely available in the local restaurants and markets. Our favourite places to eat are Michelin-listed Le Pousse Pied for a treat (€35 menu) and steak and pizza specialist La Cabane for a good family meal. And, as it’s a popular resort with the French, there’s also a plentiful supply of self-catering accommodation. We use Vendee Vacations. GregorL Île de Ré cycling Early summer brings briny Atlantic breezes to the Île de Ré to blow away the cobwebs as you cycle from one idyllic, low-slung village to another along tidy cycle paths scented with pine. Plot your route to include some of the simple pleasures this island does so well: rock pooling, pottering down green-shuttered lanes, basking on the sand or investigating the salt pans. Aim to be cycling past Cabanajam oyster shack (Chemin du Chaffaud, Saint Martin) when your belly is empty and the tide is out, so you can watch the tractors squelch out to harvest the oyster-beds while enjoying a dozen direct from the producteur on his rustic, sea-bleached benches. Matt Thurstan Hiking in the Vallée de la Loue, Jura mountains The dramatically beautiful valley of the River Loue lies in the largely tourist-free northern Jura and the lovely riverside town of Ornans is right at its heart. Birthplace of artist Gustave Courbet (1819-77), it is a quiet town (now through traffic is diverted away from the narrow main street) with rustic buildings, some backing directly on to the river, and a museum devoted to the artist. It’s a great base to spend a relaxing few days hiking to splendid waterfalls, caves and canyons (many hidden by lush forest). I spent a happy day in the Gorges de Nouailles exploring the sheer limestone cliffs and caves along the Loue and its short tributary, the Pontet. The next day we hiked the unspoilt Ravin du Puits Noir (Ravine of the Black Well) just outside Ornans, where a print of one of Courbet’s masterpieces has even been installed for comparison with the real thing. arby60 Cerbère, Pyrénées-Orientales In the foothills of the Pyrenees the last village before Spain, on the Mediterranean side, has a Jacques Tati atmosphere. People tend to miss this little gem in its sheltered creek overlooked by vineyards producing the well-known (in France) Banyuls natural sweet wine and the excellent Collioure table wines. The village has an amazing art-deco hotel, the Belvédère, with its own cinema. Opened on the eve of the Spanish civil war, it suffered a loss of demand as travel in the region declined. In 2002 it was given protected historic status and has now reopened with rooms (doubles from €95). There’s also the Dorade hotel (doubles from €55 B&amp;B) on the seafront, run by Anne and Yves, who speak excellent English. The town hall runs the Central Hotel (doubles from €59) as well, which is open all year. There’s a good diving club north of the village; offshore is one of France’s few maritime reserves so there are plenty of fish. There’s plenty of walking and mountain biking available and with the train services on both sides of the border it’s easy to do one-way trips in France or Spain. The nearest airports are Girona about 45 minutes south, or Perpignan about an hour to the north. The Spanish village across the border, Port Bou, has a great selection of places to eat and pick up cheap booze. • cerbere-tourisme.com Masmingou Toulouse This southern town could be France’s most underrated and doesn’t seem to have too much tourism. However, Toulouse’s excellent cuisine and pink brick buildings make it a gem for any Francophile. Be sure to try the macarons (pictured) at Au Poussin Bleu and the crêpes at Pastel et Sarrasin, while historians will be fascinated by the Basilica of Saint-Sernin, one of the largest remaining Romanesque buildings in Europe and a Unesco world heritage site. dhealy36 Bargemon, Provence A 75-minute drive from Nice takes you to Bargemon, a sleepy, medieval Var village with cobbled streets, beautiful views over the valley, a central square complete with restaurants, bakery and butchers … oh and a typewriter museum. Explore the backstreets and enjoy the leisurely pace of life with a crisp glass of the local rosé. Incidentally, Bargemon is where David and Victoria Beckham used to have a chateau. ID9068535 Lourdes, Hautes-Pyrénées An assortment of tourists and polyglot locals, a sprinkling of merry priests and nuns and the site where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared 18 times: Lourdes is surprising because of its many faces – the devout, the medieval, the kitsch, the mountains, even the modern. It’s breathtakingly beautiful yet run-down in parts. Snow-covered peaks in the distance, the fast-flowing Gave de Pau and ragged rock peeking out from under the houses. A destination for pilgrims and the gateway to the spectacle, nature and outdoor activities of the Pyrenees national park. A profusion of hotels means there are always affordable rooms. I suggest Appart’hôtel La Closeraie (doubles from about €50 B&amp;B), near the station and The Majestic (doubles from about €50 B&amp;B), in the centre. In Boulevard de la Grotte there are many good-value restaurants, notably Café Le Genève. I am the bearer of good news: you don’t need to be religious to love Lourdes. Maria Paul Beaches of Biarritz If you can get down to Biarritz in June, you will beat the crowds and have your pick of sandy beaches for surfing, hilltop bars to watch the sunsets and great places to fill yourselves with pintxos and seafood. The weather is usually great in May and June and you are 50 minutes away from San Sebastián if a foray into the culinary capital of Spain tempts you.

Typically, Jurd has opened another door for the follow-up rather than revisiting a winning formula. Wonder Trail is an invitation to her sure-footed and adaptable Dinosaur quartet to explore what a contemporary jazz take on 1980s synthpop might sound like. Jurd’s trumpet still takes centre stage, sometimes in cryptic Miles-like asides, sometimes in eerie tremors suggestive of Arve Henriksen or the microtonalism of north African music. But pianist Elliot Galvin plays old-school synthesisers throughout, there are a couple of quietly confiding vocals, and bassist Conor Chaplin and drummer Corrie Dick deal in floorshaking fuzz tones and earthquake rumblings, as well as attentive restraint. Renewal, Part 1 bursts open as an orchestral-electronic tidal wave before developing as an acoustic trumpet break of patiently spun trills and percussively prodding phrases. Quiet Thunder is a soft unison melody for keys and brass that anthemically swells in skidding synth sounds, while Shine Your Light is hymnally spacious (with Jurd, as she often does on slow music, recalling the Miles Davis of In a Silent Way). Old Times’ Sake is a perky folk dance, Swimming a quirkily resolved ballad that becomes a Ghostbusters-like gallop, and And Still We Wonder contains a softly-rapturous vocal. The tighter grooves of this music seem occasionally to cramp Jurd’s improv freedom by comparison with Together, As One, and the inventive Galvin is mostly a scenery changer for kaleidoscopic electronic backdrops. But Wonder Trail advances Jurd’s beguiling story, as a fitting present for the ambitious Edition label’s 10th birthday, and an invitation to new friends beyond the jazz loop. Other jazz picks this month Haunting new-minted harmonies, Mingus-like soul and headlong guitar power are fused on orchestral composer Mike Gibbs’ Symphony Hall, Birmingham 1991 live set, with the late UK originals John Taylor and Kenny Wheeler and American guitar star John Scofield in a world-class lineup. On Uncharted Territories, bass maestro Dave Holland joins saxophonist Evan Parker, pianist Craig Taborn and drummer/vibraphonist Ches Smith in a free-jazz/contemporary compositional supergroup – with the fierce Parker sometimes at his most gruffly lyrical. And Andy Sheppard’s vaporous sax sound gracefully enhances the intimately melodic music of Norwegian pianist Espen Eriksen and his trio on Perfectly Unhappy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/09/travellers-community-against-settling-local-common","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T14:30:46Z","webTitle":"My community is vehemently against Travellers settling on a local common.

How can I challenge this?","bodyText":"Occasionally Travellers settle on a small common near where I live. There is a playground on the common, but the caravans that were previously here weren’t near it, and didn’t take up much space. I have never noticed any problems when Travellers settle here, but the rest of my community are vehemently against it. They insist that stealing and litter-dropping rise when Travellers arrive. They have signed petitions and asked the council to prevent them from settling. This anti-Traveller sentiment seems to unite all parts of the community. Recently I noticed that large rocks and raised plant beds had been placed around the common, which someone informed me was a council initiative to stop Travellers driving on to the land. How do I know if this is true? Why is it that being anti-Traveller is still acceptable and why is the council supporting the community in this regard? Surely, the Travellers are legally allowed to settle on this land as it is held in common. Your assumption that institutionalised prejudice is not only prevalent, but accepted around Traveller communities, is backed up by evidence. In 2014, the Office for National Statistics revealed that Gypsy and Irish Travellers had the highest number of people with no qualifications (60%) of any ethnic group in the UK and the highest rate of economic inactivity (53%). Emma Nuttall from the charity Friends, Families and Travellers says: “It’s shameful. But many people – including politicians – remain uneducated about the cultural needs and barriers to Traveller communities.” Additionally, Nuttall says, it’s common for local authorities to limit opportunities for Travellers to stop over, even when it is their right to do so: “Local authorities spend hundreds of thousands every year creating ditches and earth mounds, and putting up metal barriers and gates, that prevent Travellers from settling when it may actually be cheaper to house them.” Such restrictions not only stop the council earning money through rents and council tax from the Traveller community, they also create health, education and housing inequalities. So there could be a battle ahead. I have looked into the detail of the common that you mention. It came under local authority ownership a long time ago, meaning your local council is responsible for it. You should scour your council website to see whether any development plans for the common have been included in recent planning or policy papers, giving the reason why. It’s unlikely you will find an outright mention of wanting to disturb a specific community, but you can check whether the council has considered the needs of Travellers through an equality and impact assessment, and write in to raise your concerns if not. But be wary of trying to be a saviour: your intentions may be good, but without consultation with the Traveller community, you could end up accidentally causing more harm. You can take Gypsy and Traveller cultural awareness training online. I have also found a user group that maintains the common. The members have planted trees, hedges and bulbs, so may have been involved in installing the rocks and plants. You should join this group. You won’t know whether they were involved in the decision – and whether their aims were sinister or careless – until you do. Their mission statement is to protect and enhance the common and to improve its use and enjoyment by locals. They may benefit from hearing from you if they truly want to achieve this goal. You may be the only person in the group thinking about the impact of recent changes; or you may provide useful scrutiny and accountability if their aims are more sinister. You are in a difficult position. If prejudice is the driving force at play here, you may find yourself confronted with resistance and denial. But it sounds like you have the compassion and sensitivity to take on the task. Good luck. • What do you think? Or have you got a question for Poppy and readers to consider?

It’s a seductive but in certain ways opaque love letter to the past, a fictionalisation of the director’s experiences as a passionate twentysomething connoisseur of western rock; a rebellion now even more resonant with the director still under house arrest in Russia. Leto means “summer” or “summertime” in Russian – I kept thinking of the summertime that Oasis says is in bloom, although that’s not in this movie’s time-frame. It feels like an almost storyless evocation of mood, a two-hour introduction to an imaginary larger narrative of change and loss that begins after the closing credits have finished. Despite the title, it’s a distinctively wintry movie, with some longueurs and mood swings to nowhere. The setting is Leningrad (as it then was) in the early 1980s, when there was a fiercely committed rock and pop scene, with devotees fanatically consuming the latest imported albums and audiocassette bootlegs from the west, from the classics like the Beatles, Dylan, Velvet Underground, Bowie and the Doors, through to punk and new-wave masters like the Sex Pistols, the Clash and Blondie; just reciting those names was enough to send you into a kind of trance. This was the generation that waited in line for the new Stones LP on vinyl, not the new iPad on which tens of thousands of songs could be casually played at a click. Russian bands got to perform at Communist Party-licensed clubs, which censored the lyrics and employed hatchet-faced goons to stop the young fans doing anything more than bopping sedately in their seats and applauding decorously at the end of each song. But in forbidding western cover versions, the state was at least doing its bit to encourage indigenous Soviet rock’n’roll: there is a toe-curling moment when someone holds up a Brezhnev pamphlet entitled On Youth. Serebrennikov shows that rock’n’roll was a real vocation. These people were like the early Christians, worshipping in secret. And what they were doing was removing the first bricks from the Berlin Wall. The alpha male in this world is Mike (Roman Bilyk), a singer with a wildly popular band who lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Natasha (Irina Starshenbaum), and their baby in a cramped shared apartment. With his sunglasses and longish hair, the rock singer that Mike most resembles, incidentally, is Mud lead singer Les Gray. But there is a newcomer, Viktor (Teo Yoo) who hero-worships Mike and has a band of his own. Natasha takes a shine to Viktor, and pretty soon they are in a Patty Boyd/Eric Clapton/George Harrison situation. And, all the time, their dedication to rock could cause them to be accused of being traitors and western stooges. The very best moment in the movie comes when some of the guys are on a railway carriage, behaving pretty obnoxiously, and get yelled at by a war veteran who is in a state of towering rage and contempt for their disloyal infatuation with western fripperies. At his request, a ticket inspector, or perhaps some security goon, punches one of the rockers horribly, breaking his nose. It is the cue for a fantasy version of Talking Heads’ Psycho Killer – a brilliantly aggressive rendition, in fact. There are more musical interludes, including a performance of Iggy Pop’s The Passenger, and other bizarre “it-didn’t-actually-happen” hallucinations. There are quite a few scenes of everyone stripping off on the beach, revealing early 80s pre-gym culture bodies, and going skinny-dipping. But Leto is mostly about talking, smoking and hanging out – undoubtedly a faithful depiction of what the Russian early-80s rock scene really was about. And there were times when I thought that the film seemed to be going on for a long time but not getting anywhere, or going round in circles, like a guitar solo on the kind of prog rock album that no one in this film would ever deign to mention. Mike begins to ponder his career opportunities (which is a Clash track, come to think of it) and wonders if breaking America – that eternal dream – is feasible or even something he wants to do, given that he is very happy with is own huge prestige in the humbler parochial world of Russian rock: “It’s OK to be in the swamp if you’re No 1 toad.” In its final bars, the movie hints obliquely at early deaths for both Mike and Viktor, but leaves open the question of whether they fulfilled their musical potential, and in fact both men are pretty opaque personalities. Leto is a film with some wonderful moments and some slightly forgettable stretches – like an album with one or two wonderful tracks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/may/14/solo-a-star-wars-story-why-prequels-are-killing-the-art-of-storytelling","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T09:59:25Z","webTitle":"Solo: A Star Wars Story – why prequels are killing the art of storytelling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/14/solo-a-star-wars-story-why-prequels-are-killing-the-art-of-storytelling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/14/solo-a-star-wars-story-why-prequels-are-killing-the-art-of-storytelling","fields":{"headline":"Solo: A Star Wars Story – why prequels are killing the art of storytelling","bodyText":"We’re all excited to see Chewie hit the hyperdrive and test drive the brand new Millennium Falcon, but when the stars turn to streaks of light in Solo: A Star Wars Story, we’ll be in reverse gear. We’re going back: back to 1970s-retro sci-fi aesthetics, back to characters we know better than they know themselves, and back to a story whose intricacies are all but irrelevant since we already know the consequences. You might have been getting this feeling a lot recently. Going to the movies is starting to feel like being Guy Pearce in Memento: instead of forming new memories, we’re discovering what happened before. From a commercial point of view, prequels make perfect sense. They’re a way of cashing in on brand recognition without messing with the original, and of bringing in fresh meat to replace actors too old, weary or expensive to reprise their roles. As Han Solo, Harrison Ford was all three. He pleaded with George Lucas to kill Solo at the end of Return of the Jedi. And he reportedly only returned for The Force Awakens on the condition that he die. But Solo is one of Star Wars’s best-loved characters. What to do? Prequel! That is often the answer these days. Harry Potter runs out of instalments? A prequel quintet! (Part two, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is out later this year). The Alien franchise similarly U-turned from Sigourney Weaver’s Ripley back to Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, stories as murkily convoluted as the original Alien was crystal-clear. Only diehard fans can keep track of where sagas such as X-Men and Terminator are these days but brace yourselves for new instalments of both, since they’ve used time travel to prequelise their stories to death. And I bet you can’t wait for Bumblebee, the 1980s-set origin story of the yellow car-bot from Transformers (chief selling point: it isn’t directed by Michael Bay). It’s not just franchise movies: everyone’s at it. No self-respecting horror misses the chance to go back and explain its villain’s roots: Insidious, Annabelle, The Purge, The Conjuring, right back to Exorcist: The Beginning and Hannibal Rising. Animations such as Monsters University and Despicable Me’s Minions are at it. Meanwhile, Game of Thrones is currently developing five different prequel ideas. Even David Chase is preparing a prequel to The Sopranos, set in the 1960s. It’s not story, it’s backstory. What next? Lady Bird: The Kindergarten Years? Baby Driving School? The Shape of Water: Tadpole Love? Memento: It’s All Coming Back to Me Now? Solo is effectively the fifth Star Wars prequel. George Lucas’s Episodes I to III remain unloved not because we knew how the saga was going to pan out, but because of the stodgy storytelling and bland characters. Rogue One was at least tangential enough to pull a few surprises. But it’s only the recent Episodes VII and VIII that have moved the story on to somewhere new, even if The Force Awakens had its own deja vu issues. In any case, prequels clearly work. People flock to see them, as they will with Solo. In theory, the past can hold as many surprises as the future, and a good prequel can add depth: The Godfather Part II was essentially a prequel, so was The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Maybe the direction of travel matters less than we think. Maybe characters are more important than stories. Maybe viewers enjoy the feeling of omniscience. But is this a substitute for good old chronological-order storytelling? Where new stuff happens, and we don’t know what’s coming next, and we feel as if we’re moving forwards? Like civilisation is moving forwards? Marvel’s current superhero cycle, culminating in Avengers: Infinity War, has demonstrated how chronological storytelling can generate suspense and surprise, even shock, but most studios don’t have the foresight or ambition to plan that far ahead. More often, they stumble upon a hit they weren’t expecting, then clumsily work out how to cash in on it retrospectively. If Solo is a big hit, we could be in store for yet more – Alden Ehrenreich revealed he is signed up for three pictures as Han Solo. After that, they could go down the “Young Han Solo” route. And wait: Chewbacca is already 190 years old in Solo; his prequels could run and run. They could spin this out right back to the Big Bang. Set the hyperdrive!

It’s his ninth, but, as if determined to avoid the grandiloquence that composers have so often felt obliged to employ when they reach that fateful symphonic number, Matthews has produced a modestly proportioned work, whose five movements last just over half an hour. Much of the opening movement does stem from the guileless carol melody that had fired the creative process. Matthews likens it to the naive theme that begins Nielsen’s Sixth Symphony, but where in that work the result is sardonic and almost nihilistic, here the ingenious transformations generate exuberant invention. A pair of scherzos, one brassily assertive, the other more restrained and enigmatic, frame the central slow movement, whose delicate webs of strings seem to me the only point at which the music briefly loses its focus. The carol tune returns in affirmative C major to provide the climax to the finale, although the Sibelius-like cadence that follows almost sounds like a quotation, in a work that otherwise manages to seem unmistakably British without ever becoming derivative. Matthews has recently become the English Symphony Orchestra’s composer in association, and that orchestra and its artistic director Kenneth Woods gave the Ninth its premiere. Even though the scoring is never remotely heavy-handed, the acoustics of St George’s, so matchlessly warm and lucid for solo recitals and chamber music, did struggle to cope with the full orchestral sound, and Woods’ rather blunt conducting exacerbated that, too. There were some more moments of sonic overload in the two works by Elgar that made up the rest of the programme. Sheku Kanneh-Mason was the hugely impressive soloist in the Cello Concerto, wonderfully assured and poised, and always at pains to ensure the music’s intrinsic eloquence spoke for itself. There was also the work that has become a bit of a calling card for Woods and his orchestra – Donald Fraser’s orchestral arrangement of the Piano Quintet. Though it’s an expert exercise in orchestration, I’m not convinced it does Elgar’s music any favours. Everything became a bit too relentless and insistent by the end."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/askjack/2018/may/10/my-nine-year-old-son-wants-smartphone-dumb-phone-device-peer-pressure","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T11:46:14Z","webTitle":"My nine-year-old wants a phone – but will a non-smart device cut it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2018/may/10/my-nine-year-old-son-wants-smartphone-dumb-phone-device-peer-pressure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack/2018/may/10/my-nine-year-old-son-wants-smartphone-dumb-phone-device-peer-pressure","fields":{"headline":"My nine-year-old wants a phone – but will a non-smart device cut it?","bodyText":"My son is nine and beginning to hang out with his pals, some of whom sport smartphones. Despite his pleas, we have made it clear there is no way he’s getting one. Aside from delaying his unbridled internet access, our argument is that if he can look after a dumb phone for a year or two, we might consider getting him a smartphone when he starts secondary school. I don’t want him to feel left out, and I’d like to get him a phone that – even though it lacks internet access – has a certain cachet, and perhaps some built-in games. But all the non-smartphones in the shops seem to be black and decidedly functional. Rikki Dumb phones have very little cachet with children, unless you’re the first to have one, and it’s already too late for that. Your son may be happier if you involve him in buying a new phone, rather than giving him a hand-me-down, which is the usual parental solution. But unless he actually needs a phone, it might be simpler just to promise him a smartphone when he turns 11. Unfortunately for you, not buying him a smartphone will not stop him from accessing the internet – or at least seeing it – on a regular basis. He may well have some direct access via his friends’ phones. If not, there will very likely be shared viewing of YouTube videos and other content, some of which you might find objectionable. At least when your child gets his own smartphone, you will be able to install parental control software, track what he is doing, and track his location. Make sure he knows this and it will, I assume, influence how he uses it. You will also have the powerful threat of taking his smartphone away. Ages and uses Most children in the main European countries get their first mobile phone between the ages of 11 and 18, but it varies by country. According to a 2015 research paper, about a third of British children get phones when they are nine years old, compared with a tenth of Belgian children and two-thirds of Danish children. At age 11, more than half of British children may have mobiles, and at 16, it’s more than 90%. While phone use is not unusual at this age, you should also think about your child’s maturity, and the peer pressure he is under. As a parent, you should already be familiar with your child’s internet use through his interactions with PCs, tablets, games consoles and smartphones in your home. His risk-awareness and self-control, or lack thereof, will help you decide how far to trust him. Peer pressure is trickier. You could dig into which friends actually have which phones, and consult other parents and even teachers. (Some schools allow smartphones to be used in class – which is why Danish kids have so many – while others insist they are turned off.) He may not be as left out as he feels. You should also find out what he really wants to do with his phone, because it probably isn’t to make lots of voice calls. He might want to play smartphone games, in which case a dumb phone won’t be useful. He might want to use text messaging, WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat or whatever services his friends use. He might be better off with, say, an Apple iPod Touch – which isn’t a phone – or an Android smartphone without a sim installed. But how important is it for you to be able to call or text him? Basic phones Not many mobile phones are truly dumb. Low-end models often have cameras for picture messaging and built-in FM radios as well as being able to handle voice calls and send SMS texts. Most include a few simple apps and games. Thanks to Opera’s mini-browser, some cheap phones like the Nokia 216 can even access the web. The problem is that these phones are not designed for kids. They are for adults who want a phone that’s cheap, simple and has long battery life, or because it’s all they can really afford. The major markets have been India, China and many African countries, where adding Facebook and Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, a game such as Angry Birds Lite, or a mini-browser can be a significant selling point. Of course, users in these countries are also switching to cheap Android smartphones, so the market for less-smartphones is in long-term decline. It’s a market still dominated by Nokia, though the phone brand is now owned by HMD Global, which is based across the road from Nokia’s headquarters in Espoo, Finland. Nokia, as you may not have noticed, is now churning out lots of different Android smartphones at fairly attractive prices. The phones are made in China by Foxconn, which also makes Apple iPhones and other products. Nokia picks The Nokia 105 (2017) is one of the most basic phones you can get: it can’t handle picture messaging, Java, Bluetooth, wifi or even WAP. It has no SD card slot so it won’t work as a music player. However, the latest version – released in August – feels pretty robust, and has the rounded “classic” Nokia styling. The features include an FM radio, flashlight and Snake Xenzia game, and you may find a couple of trial games pre-installed. It’s cheap or sometimes free with a £10 or £20 top-up. It’s available in black (£16.94), white (£15.48) and blue (£18.70). It would be better to step up to the Nokia 130 (2017), which was released at the time. This adds a rear-facing VGA (640 x 480 pixel) camera, Bluetooth 3.0, GPRS and Edge support, a bigger battery, and a microSD card slot that can handle up to 32GB of music. As well as Snake Xenzia, it comes with five try-and-buy Gameloft games. It’s available in red, grey and black, but mostly black (£26.93). Note: you need to insert a microSD card to use the camera. The next step up would be the Nokia 3310 3G (2017), which has a bigger, better QVGA screen (240 x 320 pixels instead of 120 x 160), a 2 megapixel camera, and a WAP 2.0/xHTML browser. It also supports WhatsApp. In this case, it’s worth getting the 3G version, which will offer a wider range of networks. It’s available in blue (£41.84), red (£43.18), yellow (£43.95) and charcoal grey (£42.48). But while the retro styling does echo the old Nokia look, it’s pretty expensive for a dumb phone, unless you can find a better deal. Android smartphones start at around the same price, or even less. You can compare the three Nokias side-by-side at GSM Arena. Nokia is also launching a bright yellow Nokia 8110 4G “banana phone” as a new take on the one used by Neo in the Matrix movie. It has been well received on YouTube, and there’s an informative review at AnandTech. It does have internet access but the screen is so small it’s not very practical. I’m not sure it will appeal to pre-teens, but it’s utterly distinctive. I’d love one. Android for beginners It’s getting harder to sell feature phones now that Android phones are so cheap, especially now that Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei (Honor), Xiaomi, and ZTE are established brands. (The French Alcatel OneTouch and the American Motorola brands are also now Chinese-owned.) Some users are buying smaller brands direct from China, though they may also be available on Amazon or from other sources such as GearBest, Chinese Smartphones UK and Laptops Direct. The Alcatel Pixi 4 is one of the cheapest smartphones you can get at £39.28, but it only has a 4in screen. The BLU Grand X (£49.99) is worth a look with a 5in screen, and the Doogee X20 (£52.99) is amazing value for a smartphone with a 6in screen. There’s a huge price gap between a Nokia 105 (£16) and an iPhone X (£999), and you wouldn’t confuse the two. The price gap between a Nokia 3310 3G (£43) and a Doogee X20 (£53) might be small enough to change your mind about buying a smartphone rather than a dumb one. Have you got a question?

Despite the opposition gaining a historic win in the election, gaining a simple majority for the first time in 61 years, hours of uncertainty followed the result, with questions over whether Mahathir, a former prime minister who this year switched to the opposition party, would be allowed to return to power. However, by late Thursday night, it was confirmed by the Palace that, after interviewing all leaders of the opposition parties, the King was finally willing to swear Mahathir into office. At 92, he becomes the oldest leader in the world. Mahathir said he would start on putting together a cabinet on Friday, which will be the first major test of the opposition coalition, Pakatan Harapan (PH), to prove the different parties in the alliance are capable of working together. “We have a lot of work to do tomorrow,” Mahathir told a press conference following the ceremony at the Palace, adding that when it came to appointing government officials, “certain heads must fall”. “We find that some people were aiding and abetting a prime minister who the world condemned as a kleptocrat,” he said. In a thinly-veiled dig at Najib, Mahathir also said he would also abolish the idea in the Malaysian government that “cash is king”. Mahathir’s confirmation had faced post-election setbacks, with reports that the king- who is notoriously anti-Mahathir- was refusing to swear him in and that Najib was attempting to swing the election his way by buying up candidates in the state of Sabah. There was also a suggestion that, according to the constitution, Mahathir was not even eligible to be prime minister because the opposition coalition is not technically one party. The party that got the most seats was PKR, which is led by Wan Azizah, the wife of former rival Anwar Ibrahim, and there were reports she would be named prime minister instead. However, speaking on Thursday morning Mahathir attempted to put all doubts to rest about whether he would be prime minister and said he would be forming a government by the evening with a majority of 122 seats out of 222. “Today I want to emphasise that our coalition, Pakatan Harapan, has already won a clear majority and therefore we are invited to form a government. We stand by the rule of law and whatever we do must be governed by the constitution.” He said that according to the constitution “the prime minister should have the support of the majority of the candidates of parliament, it does not say it should have the support of any one party”, and emphasised that all parties in the coalition had signed a letter backing him as the choice for prime minister. “We would like to form the government here, today, because currently there is no government of Malaysia,” said Mahathir. “We hope that at 5o’clock today we will have formed a government.” Multiple reports from the ground in the state of Sabah suggested that on Thursday morning Najib and Barisan Nasional were still offering the candidates from the local Warisan party 20 million ringgit ($6m) to switch sides, though that would still not give them a parliamentary majority. Mahathir, however, insisted that Warisan were fully backing the opposition coalition and dismissed the reports from Sabah. Najib, who had been prime minister since 2009, made a speech on Thursday morning saying he accepted “the verdict delivered by the people”. However he did not admit defeat and instead highlighted that no party had achieved a simple majority. “Because no party has gotten a simple majority, therefore the king will be making a decision as to who will be the prime minister,” said Najib. With Mahathir now in power, Najib may also be facing the prospect of being investigated and prosecuted for his role in the 1MDB scandal, where $3.2bn of a Malaysian government fund was embezzled, with $681m allegedly ending up in Najib’s personal bank account and funded a multi-million dollar jewellery spree for his wife. As prime minister Najib cleared himself of any wrongdoing, but Mahathir has repeatedly stated his belief that Najib was involved and pledged to see justice done. Speaking on Thursday, he did not rule out prosecuting Najib. “I am not seeing revenge, we don’t want to punish people but the rule rule of law will be clearly implemented,” he said. “If Najib has done something wrong, then he will have to pay the price.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/10/asio-detention-powers-should-be-repealed-bipartisan-report-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T05:41:31Z","webTitle":"Asio detention powers should be repealed, bipartisan report finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/10/asio-detention-powers-should-be-repealed-bipartisan-report-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/10/asio-detention-powers-should-be-repealed-bipartisan-report-finds","fields":{"headline":"Asio detention powers should be repealed, bipartisan report finds","bodyText":"The Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation’s (Asio) powers to detain people for questioning for up to seven days should be repealed, a bipartisan parliamentary committee has said. In a report tabled on Thursday, the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security report recommended Asio keep its powers of compulsory questioning but lose powers of compulsory detention, which have not been used since they were introduced in the wake of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. The committee is reviewing the powers before they automatically sunset in September. It recommended this deadline be extended a further 12 months to allow time to replace the questioning powers. The recommendations were supported by both Liberal and Labor members. The report comes after the passage of a bill on Wednesday that formally transferred Asio from the attorney general’s portfolio into Peter Dutton’s home affairs department. The 2003 law under review gave Asio powers to obtain warrants to question or detain and question a person under compulsion to seek intelligence in relation to a terrorism offence. Detention warrants are available where there are reasonable grounds to believe relying on other methods of collecting intelligence would be “ineffective” or if the person may alert someone involved in a terrorism offence or may destroy or damage records if they are not immediately detained. Questioning can occur for up to eight hours, or 24 hours with an extension, and detention can last up to seven days. Reviews by the independent national security legislation monitors Brett Walker in 2012 and Roger Gyles in 2016 both recommended repeal of the compulsory detention powers as they were “not necessary to prevent or disrupt a terrorist act”. Since it gained the powers Asio has been issued 16 warrants for compulsory questioning, most of which were in 2005 and only one was since 2006. None have been requested for compulsory detention. Asio gave evidence that although the powers were introduced in an “unprecedented security environment”, Australia is still facing a “significant threat from terrorism”. The committee accepted that the questioning powers were little used, because other means such as police arrest could disrupt attacks, but concluded they were useful for Asio’s counter-terrorism work. It recommended they be retained. All non-government submitters, including the Law Council, opposed retention of detention powers. The committee said that one of the most “extraordinary aspects” of the questioning and detention powers was the ability to detain people who were not suspected of involvement in a terrorism offence. Asio submitted that the “unique circumstances” when a detention warrant may be needed had not yet arisen. It provided hypothetical scenarios that would call for them – including the unexpected arrival in Australia of a returnee from Syria or a complex terrorist attack using “multiple attack vectors”. The committee said the detention powers were meant as a tool of intelligence collection not preventative detention, which would “not be acceptable” for an intelligence agency. Law enforcement agencies are preferred to disrupt and prevent attacks. The committee suggested compulsory detention could effectively be replaced by compulsory attendance at questioning and other powers to prevent contact with others or the destruction of information. “The committee accepts that there may be limited and exceptional circumstances where the power is required in order to ensure a person attends questioning, and consequently there is the need to provide a power of attendance,” the report said. “However, noting the seriousness of ongoing detention, the constitutional and human rights concerns with the current framework and the non-use of the powers, the committee is of the view that the current provisions are no longer the appropriate response to the threat of terrorism.” The Law Council president, Morry Bailes, said it had “long argued that the current Asio questioning and detention powers fail to strike the right balance between protecting the community while upholding the rule of law”. “Today the committee has recognised this imbalance and we welcome these recommendations,” he said. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said the report showed the usefulness of sunset clauses for “extraordinary powers granted to our security agencies ... to keep Australians safe”. “As the report says, these powers are not intended to be permanent and it is right that they are subject to review,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14981","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T23:00:12Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,981","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14981","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14981","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,981","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/may/10/football-transfer-rumours-neymar-to-join-real-madrid","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T07:15:57Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Neymar to join Real Madrid?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/10/football-transfer-rumours-neymar-to-join-real-madrid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/10/football-transfer-rumours-neymar-to-join-real-madrid","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Neymar to join Real Madrid?","bodyText":"Thing is, what nobody knows is that a young Neymar had a dream. “One day,” he told his imaginary friend, Cecil, “I’ll play for every single one of the G-14 superclubs.” If today’s rags are to be believed, he will move one step closer by acting in a sufficiently brattish manner to make Paris Saint-Germain wearily decide that life’s too short and sell him to Real Madrid. If Neymar goes, PSG will endeavour to replace him with absolutely everybody, including Ryan Sessegnon. The Fulham sensation is also wanted by most of Her Majesty’s finest, including Spurs, Man Utd, Man City and Arsenal. PSG’s interest in Sessegnon could have an impact on the great property tree that is the transfer market. United, Arsenal and Chelsea are desirous of PSG’s current left-back Layvin Kurzawa. And who knows what that might also mean for Danny Rose’s employment status? Neymar, meanwhile, will be thrilled to hear that comically overrated galoot Edinson Cavani wants to follow him to Madrid – but he’ll be going to Atlético to replace Antoine Griezmann. For his part, Griezmann is wanted by, among others, Barcelona – who will sell weathered genius Luis Suárez if they get Madrid’s favourite Head and Shoulders shill. One of Europe’s brightest talents, Ajax forward Justin Kluivert, is bound for Roma. As usual, Ajax will be pillaged this summer: the talented young defender Matthijs de Ligt could join Spurs or Man City or Bayern or Barcelona. The choice is his, or his agent’s. Another teenage defender, Porto’s Diogo Leite, is wanted by Liverpool, Man City, Arsenal and – breaking news! – millions of Football Manager junkies. Arsenal are also keen to sign Bayer Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd ‘Poor’ Leno to replace the ageing Petr Cech and the peak-age-but-not-entirely-fit-for-purpose David Ospina. Wayne Rooney is still bound for America, just as he was 24 hours ago, though Wolves may attempt to change his flight plans. Rooney’s current club, Everton, have already decided to thank Sam Allardyce for his 11/10 services and replace him with Marco Silva. If that happens, there will be no Pep/Big Sam dilemma for Norwich’s James Maddison. He is being monitored by Spurs, Arsenal, Everton and Man City. Jack Wilshere will sign a new three-year contract with Arsenal, citing his desperation to play for whoever the next manager will be.

The three men emerged from a US government plane, flashing peace signs high above their heads. A huge US flag hung between two fire trucks served as a backdrop against the night sky. “I want to thank Kim Jong-un,” Trump said. “I think he wants to do something and bring that country into the real world.” “We didn’t think this was going to happen, and it did. It was very important to all of us,” he said, referring to the prisoner release. “The true honour will be if we have a victory in getting rid of nuclear weapons.” Just hours later, the date for the historic summit between Trump and Kim was announced by Trump on Twitter as 12 June, with the meeting to be held in Singapore. After welcoming the captives home, Trump tweeted video clips of himself congratulating the men aboard Air Force One. The triumphant return to American soil was very different from the arrival in the US of US student Otto Warmbier last June. Warmbier, 22, came back with severe brain damage, after being sentenced to hard labour for taking a propaganda poster while on a short tourism trip to the secretive dictatorship, and died just days afterwards. His parents are suing North Korea. One of the returning men, Kim Dong Chul, said he had had to do labour while captive in North Korea. And in early morning interviews, Vice-President Mike Pence revealed that at least one of the men had been deprived of daylight while held. Pence told ABC News that the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who went to Pyongyang to fetch the men, told him that, during a refueling stop in Anchorage, Alaska, on the way home “one of the detainees asked to go outside the plane because he hadn’t seen daylight in a very long time”. Pompeo flew to Pyongyang earlier in the week for a surprise one-day visit , where he met the North Korean leader and secured the release of the three men. “It’s like a dream and we are very happy,” Kim Dong Chul said. “We were treated in many different ways, I had to do labour.” The three were then taken to the nearby Walter Reed military hospital for health checks. The emancipation of Tony Kim, Kim Hak-song and Kim Dong Chul was secured less than an hour before Pompeo was due to depart. Kim Jong-un “accepted an official suggestion of the US president” to free the three prisoners, according to a report from the official Korean Central News Agency, which also carried the first mention of the two leaders’ planned summit in North Korean media. Trump has referred to the three men as hostages and the US government has described them as political pawns. Tony Kim and Kim Hak-song were arrested about a year ago and Kim Dong Chul in 2015. They were all accused of anti-North Korea activities. “We would like to express our deep appreciation to the United States government, President Trump, Secretary Pompeo and the people of the United States for bringing us home,” the three said in a joint statement released by the state department. “We thank God, and all our families and friends who prayed for us and for our return. God bless America, the greatest nation in the world.” Later on Thursday, Pence said about the forthcoming summit: “In this moment, the regime in North Korea has been dealing, as far as we can see, in good faith.” He added that despite Trump’s recent praise for Kim, the administration is not ignoring the North’s abysmal human rights record. He said: “We have no illusions about that.” The Associated Press contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/10/joel-wilkinson-statement-afl-racism","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T05:49:24Z","webTitle":"Joel Wilkinson says he 'suffered extreme racism' in AFL","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/10/joel-wilkinson-statement-afl-racism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/10/joel-wilkinson-statement-afl-racism","fields":{"headline":"Joel Wilkinson says he 'suffered extreme racism' in AFL","bodyText":"Former Gold Coast Suns player Joel Wilkinson has said he “will not be silenced” as he confirmed his intention to file a claim to the Australian Human Rights Commission, where he will allege he was racially abused and subjected to sexual harassment during his time in the AFL. Wilkinson, who played 26 games for the Suns from 2011 to 2013, accused the AFL of extreme racism during a press conference on Thursday, while his lawyer revealed two other former players have been in touch in the wake of Wilkinson’s claims. “I’m here because I won’t be silenced any more and what has happened has been a continuous breach of human rights,” said Wilkinson, reading from a prepared statement. “I have suffered extreme racism during my time in the AFL and post my career from the AFL until this very day. “I am here to hold the AFL accountable and stand against injustice ... this is extremely systematic across the AFL.” Wilkinson said he was looking forward to his day in court and improving the human rights of players. “It won’t be happening behind closed doors anymore,” he said. “It seems in recent times the dark works on the inside of the AFL are being revealed and I hope this gives others the courage to come forward.” Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day Wilkinson’s lawyer Will Barsby said it was unclear whether the two other former players who had made contact also wanted to take legal action. “It’s really about whether those individuals want to pursue their legal rights, as Mr Wilkinson has,” Barsby said. Barsby also claimed that Wilkinson lost his place at the Suns because he became too much trouble. “He was labelled as a grandstander ... Joel experienced much racism during his time [in the AFL] and that has been documented publicly,” he said. “That became a problem and like any workplace, sometimes an employer doesn’t want to keep that perceived problem child around. Joel was very advocating on behalf of his rights and others’ rights and he’s been persecuted because of that.” In a statement issued on Wednesday, the AFL said it respected “a person’s right to pursue claims through the legal system”, while noting it was sorry Wilkinson had been racially abused during his time as a footballer. “We will continue to work with Joel to resolve this matter,” added the AFL. Wilkinson was subjected to racist remarks made by Western Bulldogs player Justin Sherman during his debut AFL game for Gold Coast in 2011. The following year, he was racially vilified by a Collingwood supporter during a match."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2018/may/10/richard-dawkins-move-new-zealand-brexit-trump-madness","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T02:40:45Z","webTitle":"Richard Dawkins wants to move to New Zealand to get away from Brexit 'madness'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/10/richard-dawkins-move-new-zealand-brexit-trump-madness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/may/10/richard-dawkins-move-new-zealand-brexit-trump-madness","fields":{"headline":"Richard Dawkins wants to move to New Zealand to get away from Brexit 'madness'","bodyText":"The British scientist Richard Dawkins has said he would like to move to New Zealand as a refuge from the “madness” of a post-Trump, post-Brexit northern hemisphere. “America had just gone mad, and Britain had gone mad in a slightly less dramatic way with Brexit,” he told The Project, a New Zealand current affairs program. “I thought about half the population of America and half the population of Britain would love to go to a country where intellect might be appreciated.

The inquiry comes on the back of a damning report by the Tax Justice Network, which suggested big aged-care providers were shifting profits offshore and paying minimal tax, while simultaneously receiving vast sums of taxpayer funding. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The report alleged big companies used common profit-shifting tricks, including the use of excessive related-party loans, to reduce their taxable income in Australia. The Senate on Thursday referred the matter to an inquiry, which will aim to report by 14 August. It has been tasked to investigate the use of “tax avoidance or aggressive tax minimisation strategies” in the sector, and whether they have caused any impact on service delivery or “value for money for government”. The news was welcomed by the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, which commissioned the Tax Justice Network report. The federal secretary, Annie Butler, said the inquiry would help determine whether government subsidies were being spent on service delivery, as intended. “Companies that receive millions of dollars via Australian government subsidies should be required by law to meet higher standards of transparency in financial reporting,” Butler said. “Proof of government funding being directly spent on the care of elderly residents needs to be mandated as a pre-requisite to receiving a subsidy.” Two of the biggest companies named in the report – Bupa and Opal Aged Care – denied any wrongdoing and said they comply with all Australian taxation and disclosure requirements. Bupa recorded a taxable income of $352m from a staggering total income of $7.5bn in 2015-16, and paid tax of $105m. The report accused it of reducing its taxable income in Australia using massive related-party loans and debt from a corporate restructure, among other things. Opal Aged Care had a total income of $572.2m in the same year, but had a taxable income of just $7.9m, and paid $2.4m in tax. Opal was also accused of lowering profits in Australia using related-party loans, and the Tax Justice Network questioned whether it was renting its own aged care residences from a separate but related corporate entity to minimise tax. Report author, Jason Ward, welcomed the inquiry and said he hoped it would help shine a light on the opaque tax structures used in the sector. “These large for-profit aged care companies have been remarkably silent in response to the report, but other stakeholders have been deeply concerned about our findings,” Ward told Guardian Australia. “There seems to be strong support for our recommendations to require companies receiving over $10 million in annual government funding to be fully transparent.” “We hope this is the beginning of a process to increase transparency and accountability around all government contracting with for-profit companies. The contracting out of public services by government to for-profit companies has blown out of control.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/15/move-over-sia-how-young-australian-songwriters-are-making-it-big-in-la","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T01:56:46Z","webTitle":"Move over Sia: how young Australian songwriters are making it big in LA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/15/move-over-sia-how-young-australian-songwriters-are-making-it-big-in-la","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/15/move-over-sia-how-young-australian-songwriters-are-making-it-big-in-la","fields":{"headline":"Move over Sia: how young Australian songwriters are making it big in LA","bodyText":"You’ll be aware of the “Spotify mafia” even if you don’t know their names. The songs that dominate the streaming service bear the hallmarks of a select group of young international songwriters who have gravitated to LA. And they seem to be cleaning up. Nat Dunn is one of them, part of a wave of Australian songwriters following in the wake of Adelaide’s Sia Furler. One of Dunn’s songs, Friends, was recorded by London singer Anne-Marie and DJ/producer Marshmello (who keeps his identity under wraps by never being seen without his marshmallow head). It reached number 21 in the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, clocking up nearly 300m plays on Spotify. With its no-nonsense chorus – “Haven’t I made it obvious? Haven’t I made it clear?” – it’s been dubbed “the official friend-zone anthem”. But it’s a hard road to recognition, even for those writers who have “made it”. Dunn doesn’t want to be known as a ball-breaker, but she does talk straight, and she’s putting that energy into demanding a fair go for young songwriters – particularly young women. Having written for Noah Cyrus, R3hab, Tkay Maizda, Zara Larrson, Charli XCX, Rudimental and Bebe Rexha, she’s now well established enough to challenge what she calls “archaic mindsets” in the industry. It’s taken a while to pin her down for an interview, but eventually she settles in with her phone in a café in between meetings. With a hint of an LA accent, she peppers her speech with the strange nouns of the songwriting set: “topliner” for a writer who specialises in vocal melody; “vehicle” for a guest vocalist; “track” for the beats underpinning a song. But her overriding message is “know your worth”, and she makes a habit of having that conversation with every female singer she works with, as well as the songwriters, convincing them they’re not just a cog in the machine. Here’s the problem: the formula of a superstar producer/DJ using a hot songwriter like Dunn and a “featured” singer is a winning one, but there’s a power imbalance. Dunn says young songwriters can be easily convinced that they should count themselves lucky simply to be involved. This results in them not getting a fair slice of the royalty pie, or losing control over their song. Singers drafted in by producer/DJs are often referred to as “featured”, implying they have no ownership over the song (an exception is Friends, on which Anne-Marie is credited equally with Marshmello). So Dunn likes to co-write in a room with a singer, to make sure their experiences are represented in the lyrics they’re putting their voice and face to – and to “make it known that if you’re not equally billed and you’re a feature, that’s your choice.” “DJs often try and claim that 50% of publishing is track and 50% is melody and lyrics. That’s just so ridiculous,” she tells Guardian Australia. “If they really want this song to keep them relevant and to keep getting DJ gigs booked all over the world, they need you. Whose lyrics are being sung by everyone in the crowd?” She’s right, and that crowd is becoming increasingly savvy to who these lyricists are, turning them into celebrities in their own right. That includes the Australian contingent. Just recently there’s been a media spotlight on Sarah Aarons, the Melburnian behind compositions such as number one US hit The Middle, recorded by Zedd, Marren Morris and Grey. Just as Sia’s distinctive vocal fry in her guide vocals in demos has influenced a whole generation of singers to adopt her tone, so Zedd and Grey auditioned 12 singers to find a voice that sounded like that of Aarons. This unassuming expat has been so thoroughly profiled by the likes of New York Times and Variety that she’s put a moratorium on further press coverage. Then there are twins Miriam and Olivia Nervo (Kylie, Britney Spears), Samuel Dixons (Adele), Vassy (David Guetta) and newcomer CXLOE (whose collaborations are currently under wraps).Dunn credits her business nous with entering the industry at the age of 15 and having to learn on her feet. “You’re a kid in an adult world,” she says. She won’t disclose her age now – “I don’t think it should matter” – but she grew up in the Glasshouse Mountains of New South Wales, and started working with a manager while still in high school. After cutting her schooling back to three days a week to allow for two days in a recording studio, she blipped on the radar of Australian music industry giant Michael Gudinski and signed a publishing deal with Mushroom. She’s now with Young and Vicious, a Mushroom imprint. She’s also one of many expat Australian songwriters taking advantage of the professional network of APRA AMCOS, which has hot desks, co-writing spaces and offices in LA, as well as London and Nashville. As member relations director Milly Petriella says: “It can be incredibly lonely living and working overseas for a songwriter, particularly for those that don’t have a publisher or label, or even a manager. Often we’re the only support they have, so we do everything and anything sometimes.” That includes placing songwriters into competitive writing rooms and songwriting camps, such as SongHubs in Nashville and Sweden, which Dunn attended. “Basically we gather some of the world’s top songwriters and producers, pair them with Aussie songwriters and lock them in the studio for three days,” Petriella says. “We’ve run over 50 SongHubs since the launch in 2013, and more than 20% of those songs have been released, earning over $1m in royalties for our members.” Dunn acknowledges APRA AMCOS’s doorways into such ventures was career-changing. “It takes a village,” she says. “You can have the talent, but unless you have the support to be there, you can’t do it.” The steady success Dunn has enjoyed has seen her graduate from a one-bedroom apartment in West Hollywood (“I could touch my stove from my bed”) to a loft downtown. She sub-let that recently when her own electronic duo, NAATIONS (with Australian DJ Nicky Night Time), spent six months using London as a base. “I’m trying to work out the balance,” she says. “When I work with an artist, they’re a muse and I love that, but then NAATIONS played a festival in Brixton with 5000 people engaged in our set and there’s something about that.” Whatever her role, Dunn’s finger has to be firmly on the pulse, so it would be churlish not to ask her about the production flourishes she thinks need to die. She singles out what she calls the “girl singer Spotify” sound – which is usually stylistically clipped through a program such as Auto-Tune – and EDM drops. Again, she emphasises that a writer has the right to withdraw their song if they don’t like the window dressing. “If they put themselves at the mercy of labels and DJ producers, it’s enabling [those people’s] power,” she reasons. “You have to care enough. Or why else are we doing it?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/10/indigenous-leaders-say-remote-housing-in-jeopardy-after-devastating-budget-cut","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T07:19:23Z","webTitle":"Indigenous leaders say remote housing in jeopardy after ‘devastating’ budget cut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/10/indigenous-leaders-say-remote-housing-in-jeopardy-after-devastating-budget-cut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/10/indigenous-leaders-say-remote-housing-in-jeopardy-after-devastating-budget-cut","fields":{"headline":"Indigenous leaders say remote housing in jeopardy after ‘devastating’ budget cut","bodyText":"Indigenous leaders have warned that community housing will fall into disrepair – and crucial local employment programs will be scrapped – after the federal government set aside no money for remote housing in three states. Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia each have 10-year remote housing funding agreements with the commonwealth that expire in June. Communities in those states have been left in limbo after money for the program was effectively cut from the federal budget. Local leaders say they could be forced to scale back their construction and maintenance programs as a result. Cape York mayors have told Guardian Australia that housing projects have become a key economic driver of many Indigenous communities, supporting jobs and providing apprenticeships for young people. “I’ve got seven apprentices between their first year and their fourth year – five carpenters and two plumbers – I’m yet to break the news to them,” the mayor of Lockhart River, Wayne Butcher, said. “I always tell people that it’s not about building you a house but who built that house. When your own community and your own people build houses, that’s you building your capacity. When you build your own capacity, you strengthen the social fabric of the community. “It’s a real kick in the guts for Indigenous housing in remote Australia. It will have a devastating effect throughout our community.” Desmond Taley, the mayor of Wujal Wujal, said the program currently supports about 200 homes in a community of more than 650 people. That still leaves, in some cases, 12 people sleeping in a three-bedroom house. “That is not acceptable,” he said. “You wouldn’t have that on the Gold Coast or Sydney or Brisbane. “We have very grave concerns about it, from the bottom of Queensland to the tip of Cape York and the Torres Strait.” Works projects that assist locals to gain employment in their remote communities have extensive economic benefits. They reduce reliance on welfare and they allow maintenance and other work to be carried out by local people with trades skills. Governments and councils would otherwise have to spend thousands on fly-in, fly-out tradespeople. Guardian Australia can reveal the Queensland government offered in March to almost double its contribution over 10 years and spend $1.08bn on remote housing. It wrote to the Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, outlining the commitment and asked the federal government to maintain its share – about 63% of the total program – and spend about $1.8bn over 10 years. The Queensland treasurer and deputy premier, Jackie Trad, said the federal budget marked the first time since the 1967 referendum the federal government had left remote communities without money for housing. “What Scott Morrison and Malcolm Turnbull did on Tuesday night was smash a 50-year tradition in this nation and that is a disgrace,” Trad said. “From our perspective it’s not money that’s the issue, it’s having a process to resolve it.” Trad said she understood if the government wanted to scrap the agreements, which were put in place by the first Rudd Labor government. She said continuing fair funding for remote communities was more important than politics around the nature of the agreements. The Western Australian treasurer, Ben Wyatt, said his state had been “dudded” and criticised the commonwealth for a “belligerent refusal” to negotiate an extension. Only the Northern Territory, which coordinates services to 72 remote communities, was allocated money for remote housing in the federal budget. The NT government has agreed to match the $550m allocation dollar for dollar. In a statement on budget night, Scullion said “negotiations are ongoing” with the Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2018/may/17/close-to-my-heart-a-guardian-video-series","type":"interactive","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T22:23:04Z","webTitle":"Close to my heart: a Guardian video series","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2018/may/17/close-to-my-heart-a-guardian-video-series","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2018/may/17/close-to-my-heart-a-guardian-video-series","fields":{"headline":"Close to my heart: a Guardian video series","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/10/tennant-creek-toddler-was-at-foreseeable-risk-of-nt-report-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T05:06:29Z","webTitle":"Tennant Creek toddler was at foreseeable risk of harm, NT commissioner finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/10/tennant-creek-toddler-was-at-foreseeable-risk-of-nt-report-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/10/tennant-creek-toddler-was-at-foreseeable-risk-of-nt-report-finds","fields":{"headline":"Tennant Creek toddler was at foreseeable risk of harm, NT commissioner finds","bodyText":"The risk to a two-year-old girl who was allegedly raped in her Tennant Creek home was foreseeable, the Northern Territory children’s commissioner has determined, taking to task an “over-reviewed” but continually failing child protection system. In a mostly redacted report, the commissioner revealed the young girl suffered “significant and painful” injuries in the alleged attack, after which she tested positive for gonorrhoea and was given post-exposure HIV medication. The report said the alleged attack, which occurred in February and resulted in the arrest and charge of a 26-year-old man, “was not the only violence that [she] had been exposed to, and experienced, in her short life”. It also revealed the Territory Families department challenged the commissioner’s draft finding that the child was at foreseeable risk of sexual assault, and successfully proposed an amendment to instead say she was at risk of “harm”. Both the draft and final findings said the risks could have been managed or mitigated. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The family of the girl, including her four siblings, were well known to service providers in Tennant Creek, including Territory Families and the Department of Education, and every provider had documented interactions with them. Between 2002 and 2018 child protective services received 52 notifications about the children, relating to all possible harm categories. Of those, 26 proceeded to investigations and 13 were substantiated. There were also more than 150 police interactions with the child’s parents, including eight for aggravated assault convictions against one parent, P2 – who at the time of the child’s assault was in the Alice Springs prison for assaulting the other parent, P1 – and six convictions against P1 for driving under the influence. “Prior to the most recent alleged sexual assault upon [the child, referred to as] C1, police had also conducted investigations in relation to sexual and physical abuse upon her siblings, some of these investigations resulted in prosecutions, with the perpetrator incarcerated,” the report said. The report also revealed the Territory Families department had “an abundance of evidence” that all the girl’s siblings had suffered substantial neglect and numerous harms before the young girl’s birth, and they had “regularly self-placed”, seeking safety with extended family. Last month the two-year-old and her brother were removed from their mother’s care by South Australian child protection services. “The examination of this particular child’s life highlights critical intervention points where the system has failed her and her siblings,” the report said. “The system failures highlighted throughout this investigation report occurred over a significant period of time, and are not new issues. The Northern Territory child protection system has been over-reviewed, however the failures remain.” The vast majority of the commissioner’s report was redacted, but included 14 recommendations to the NT government, police, and Territory Families, all of which have been accepted. However, the report also showed the department took exception to a draft finding that the girl was at foreseeable risk of sexual assault, submitting there was not sufficient evidence for such a conclusion. It said such a finding would have an “unreasonably adverse impact” on the department and on children and families, and in its redacted form would be “likely to be interpreted as a specific finding of failure by Territory Families, rather than of a decades-old systems and resourcing issue”. It said the suggestion that Territory Families had enough evidence to take action preventing the alleged sexual assault was “not dissimilar to suggesting police should have the ability to stop domestic violence homicides”. It warned the suggested approach would set a precedent and see many children with open investigations enter state care, and was in direct conflict with legislation and policy, the government’s reform agenda and the royal commission’s recommendations. The commissioner disputed much of the department’s submission but agreed to its proposed amendment to instead say the child was at foreseeable risk of “harm”. The department also sought to downplay the large number of domestic violence incidents attributed to the family, noting that they were “largely verbal disputes”. The commissioner responded that it refused to “minimise the impact of family violence, whether verbal or physical”, and that the evidence showed the violence was not limited to verbal disputes. The commissioner also accused the department of a “passive acceptance” that various individuals adopting responsibility for the children at different times “sufficiently resolved child protection notifications and investigations”. It said the need for formalised and supported care arrangements had been a key recommendation as far back as 2010 with the Board of Inquiry report, and was implemented by the department at the time. In tabling the report, the Territory Families minister, Dale Wakefield, said many of the recommendations were consistent with those of the royal commission into the protection and detention of children in the NT, as well as other reviews, and some responses were already under way as part of the government’s reforms. The report was heavily redacted but initially published in a format which allowed the redacted sections to be viewed. The alleged assault is currently before the court. The commissioner has been contacted for comment. The government has previously said it cannot afford to implement all of the recommendations of the royal commission, and that it has to balance its priorities, shared between three areas of children, the economy and jobs, and transparency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/10/police-car-filmed-veering-across-road-and-hitting-aboriginal-man","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T04:21:20Z","webTitle":"Police car filmed veering across road and hitting Aboriginal man","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/10/police-car-filmed-veering-across-road-and-hitting-aboriginal-man","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/10/police-car-filmed-veering-across-road-and-hitting-aboriginal-man","fields":{"headline":"Police car filmed veering across road and hitting Aboriginal man","bodyText":"A West Australian senior sergeant has been stood down after an incident in which a teenager was run down by a police vehicle in the Perth suburb of Thornlie on Sunday afternoon.

Scott Morrison has not been so foolish but his desire to flatten the income tax rate is just as insidious. The government’s plan to cut income tax in a manner that is greatly targeted towards the wealthiest comes with a $140bn bill – one that cannot be paid with hopes and prayers about strong economic growth. Morrison’s desire for a flat tax is not about cutting taxes, it is also about inevitably cutting government services in the same way Hockey desired. We probably should have seen it coming. While the treasurer might have talked of the priority of tax cuts for “low to middle income earners”, we should always know the deepest desire of conservative governments is to help the wealthy. The budget tax plan outlined over the next four years is nothing too astounding. The move to not increase the Medicare levy by 0.5% point is one of those tax cuts that we won’t actually notice because no one has had to pay it yet. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday The decision to increase the low income tax offset (Lito) and call it the “low and middle income tax offset” is a sensible way to cut taxes for low and medium income earners. Unlike adjusting tax thresholds, it places a cap on who gets the tax cut. But even here we see where the government’s heart really lies. Whereas the Lito currently cuts out at $66,700 – around the median full-time wage; Morrison has extended it to those earning $125,330 – at which point we are well beyond middle Australia and into the top 10%. That Morrison thinks someone earning $120,000 is in need of a “middle income” offset betrays who he really thinks needs help. While the tax offset is a rebate that you get at the end of the financial year, the government is also increasing the 37% tax threshold from $87,000 to $90,000. That means low income earners benefitting from the offset increase will have to wait till after July next year, those earning over $87,000 start getting their tax cuts from July this year. Yes it is only $135 – or $2.60 a week, but it is rather striking that the initial benefit goes to those who need it least. And yet it is all part of the bigger plan to take move Australia away from progressive taxation. Conservatives hate progressive taxation because it means wealthy people pay more tax than those on lower incomes. The proposal in July 2024 to end the 37% tax bracket and instead have everyone earning from $41,000 to $200,000 paying 32.5% income tax is not about fairness, unless you think fairness involves reducing the amount of tax paid by the wealthiest. Morrison’s big argument is we need to rid ourselves of bracket creep, as though it is some evil that is haunting workers, preventing them from getting ahead. But tax thresholds have only a minor impact on incentives to earn more, because you only pay the higher level of tax on the income you earned above that threshold: In reality the biggest disincentive to earning more comes from non-income tax thresholds – such as the Hecs-Help threshold. If you earn below $55,874 you pay no Hecs, earn $55,874 and you are now paying 4% of all of your income – that actually does see your disposable income fall even though you are earning more. Similarly the Medicare levy, the draw down on family tax benefit payments, the low income tax offset and other government benefits combined means there are much larger forces at play then worrying about what is your highest marginal tax rate. And the reality is Australians don’t pay a high level of income tax. The latest OECD report on taxing wages notes that Australia’s average tax wedge – which “measures the extent to which tax on labour income discourages employment” – is low across all incomes: And lifting the 37% tax threshold from $87,000 to $90,000, let alone removing the 37% bracket completely, is actually not going to affect most workers. In 2017, the median earnings for a full-time worker was $65,572 a year. Even if we use Morrison’s heroic assumptions that wages from 2020-21 onward will grow by 3.5%, that would see such a worker only reach $87,000 by 2025-25 and the new threshold of $90,000 a year later. The median income for all workers is currently just $52,988 – meaning they’ll only hit $87,000 in 2032-33. I suspect such workers might have a few more pressing concerns than bracket creep: So if it’s not really about reducing workers’ incentive to earn more money, then what is the move to a flat tax rate really about? It’s about giving wealthy people a whopping big tax cut. Using the figures in the budget papers, the shift would see a fall in the average rate of tax paid by those on $70,000 of 0.7 percentage points, while those earning $180,000 would drop 2.6 percentage points, and those on $200,000 would see their average rate fall a massive 3.6 percentage points: Or to put it in dollar terms, someone on $70,000 will get an extra $540 a year, while someone earning $200,000 (or 2.9 times more) will get an extra $7,225 (or 13.4 times more): Proposals to flatten the income tax rate are always about giving bigger tax cuts to those on higher incomes. And this is not cheap. In 2015-16 the roughly 400,000 people who had an incomes between $156,500 and $241,000 paid an average 32.6% tax on their income for a total of $24.7bn. Dropping that average tax rate to 29.5% would see a drop of $2.4bn in tax revenue – that’s around a quarter of the cost of Newstart each year. Add in cuts from the other 2 million or so people earning over $90,000 and you are talking big money – every year. And it’s why the prime minister and treasurer have refused to say how much it will cost, and are sticking with the “$140bn over 10 years” line – but refusing to explain what is included in that figure, let alone breaking it down to individual items. But then when you are trying to sell snake oil, you never want the customer to know the real cost. And this brings us to the second reason conservatives like flat taxes – they mean less total revenue, and thus provide an excuse to cut government services and welfare. And yet those services and benefits combined with our income tax system are fundamental to redistributing the national income and improving equality: The flat tax will massively reduce the ability to fund those services – because it massively cuts the amount of tax that can be raised not only in good times, but when the economy is growing less than it is now. He wants to, in effect, lock in the need to cut services or face large deficits. The treasurer and prime minister would have you believe their story that the budget is all good news – tax cuts and joy for “working families” – but their tale has a sting. Right now the government wants parliament to vote for these tax cuts despite refusing to say how much they will cost, and how they plan on paying for them. Because you can bet the people who will pay will not be those who are getting the biggest benefit.

In March Guardian Australia reported that the federal government had quietly made changes to the assurance of support scheme – a program designed to keep new migrants off welfare by ensuring their families have the means to support them. The government more than doubled the amount families of new migrants were required to earn to act as financial backers in a range of visa categories, most notably parent visas. A couple, for example, would have needed to earn $115,475 a year, instead of $45,185, to act as financial backers for their parents. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The government faced significant backlash, particularly from Chinese communities. The Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia said the changes would make reunions far more difficult and would have a “heavy financial impact” on families. A collection of crossbench senators and Labor planned to support a Greens disallowance motion to undo the changes in the Senate. Labor’s shadow social services minister, Jenny Macklin, wrote to the social services minister, Dan Tehan, on Wednesday, warning him that Labor would “vote to block this unfair sneak attack on hard-working migrant families” unless the Coalition backed down. Tehan wrote to the Greens senator Nick McKim on Wednesday night, saying the government would agree to reverse its position. Tehan said if the disallowance motion had been passed, the processing of all related visas would have stopped. “The government wanted to ensure these visas continued to be processed, so in discussions with Senator McKim reached an agreement to avoid an unwanted outcome,” he said. “The government will introduce a revised determination that addresses Senator McKim’s concerns.” McKim described the backdown as an “important win for multicultural Australia”. “I thank [Tehan] for his change of heart and commitment to scrap the changes,” McKim said. “Importantly, he has given me a written assurance that anyone who had their application for family reunion visas assessed under the recently changed rules will have their application reassessed under the old rules.” Macklin said the changes would have unfairly moved the goalposts on thousands of Australians wanting to reunite with their families. “People who thought they were eligible were all of a sudden being told that they were not eligible,” she said. “These changes were introduced without any announcement, and without any consultation. And I think clearly the government just didn’t understand how unfair the changes were.” The changes would have impacted a range of visa categories, including parent, aged dependant, contributory parent and remaining relative."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/09/the-2018-budget-ignores-the-two-major-issues-facing-young-people","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T05:09:54Z","webTitle":"The 2018 budget ignores the two major issues facing young people | Brendan Churchill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/09/the-2018-budget-ignores-the-two-major-issues-facing-young-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/09/the-2018-budget-ignores-the-two-major-issues-facing-young-people","fields":{"headline":"The 2018 budget ignores the two major issues facing young people","bodyText":"On Tuesday night, the treasurer began his budget speech, asking: “What have you achieved? What are you going to do now? What does it mean for me?” For young Australians watching, they might have been wondering, “What have you done for me lately?” The answer? Nothing. Over the past four years, this government’s budgets have been detrimental to young people and their futures. This was no more evident than the 2013-14 budget, in which former treasurer Joe Hockey admonished young Australians, insisting that they should be “earning or learning” and that those under the age of 30 would need to wait for up to six months before they could access benefits. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday This was the same year that youth unemployment rate peaked at 14.1% – the highest since 1998. With or without this context, this budgetary measure was unnecessarily cruel given that that the very definition of unemployed is those looking for work, suggesting young people wanted to be “earning”. The young have also become policy experiments under this government. The “prepare, trial and hire” (Path) program announced in the 2015-16 budget by treasurer Scott Morrison offered up young people as lowly paid interns, and Path has been criticised for its lack of a pathway to secure work. While there have been a change in treasurers, we have seen little change in the way governments have approached youth issues in the budget. Budgets matter because, aside from election time or the odd announcement about education funding, young people are rarely the subject of policy in this country. Budgets are where decisions about young people are most often made. However, budgets have continually failed to address the problem of youth unemployment. The unemployment rate for young people at present is still twice that of the general population at around 12%. In some regions, like the Queensland outback, it is as high as 67%, meaning that two out of three young Queenslanders in this area are looking for work. Evidence suggests that youth employment in the regions has gone backwards in recent years. This is nothing short of a crisis and should warrant the attention of all politicians. It’s been almost 10 years since the global financial crisis, and the fortunes of young Australians have barely improved over this period. It’s highly unlikely the youth unemployment rate will return to pre-GFC levels of around 8% anytime soon, if ever. The focus of this year’s budget, aside from income tax cuts, was on Baby Boomers and their forthcoming retirement. It’s an interesting scenario in which we see a government keen to keep older Australians in their homes but are negligent when it comes to young people entering the housing market. Homeownership rates for young people are in rapid decline and this is another critical aspect of young people’s lives that needs addressing. This is not an emerging social issue, we’ve been discussing it for years. Housing is integral to wealth creation in this country, but the great Australian dream is increasingly out of reach for young people, especially those who are unable to rely on their parents for financial assistance. And what does this all mean? In a very short time, we have become a nation that is unable to see its young enter either the labour or housing market without difficulty. We are raising a generation of young adults who are highly reliant upon their families because they have limited support from their government. They are entering an uncertain economy and have even more uncertain futures. But we need these young people more than we realise. They are our future workers who will have to shoulder the cost of our ageing population. They will also raise the next generation of Australians, but how will they do this without adequate jobs or housing? In what seems like the distant past, young people used to be supported by governments – and this was during a time when the full-time youth labour market was a viable alternative for those not wanting to go into further study. But as the youth labour market disappeared, so too has government support and a more sympathetic understanding of the challenges young people face. Perhaps we’ve let debates about smashed avocados and definitions about what a Millennial is obscure some basic truths: for young people growing up in 2018, entering either the labour or housing market is not as easy as it once was. Governments have the ability to do something about that. And they should. • Brendan Churchill is a research fellow at the University of Melbourne."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/08/mark-hughes-swansea-paralysed-doom-southampton","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T22:37:26Z","webTitle":"Mark Hughes throws off shackles to leave Swansea paralysed by doom | Nick Miller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/08/mark-hughes-swansea-paralysed-doom-southampton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/08/mark-hughes-swansea-paralysed-doom-southampton","fields":{"headline":"Mark Hughes throws off shackles to leave Swansea paralysed by doom","bodyText":"It is a league of billions, of the most famous managers in the world, which prides itself on being the shiniest show in town, that moneyed owners seeking a splash of reflected glory flock to. Who knew the biggest game of the season would be between Swansea and Southampton? It was not so much a game of football, more a 90-minute test of constitutions. The top division of English football hasn’t seen a relegation play-off match in 30 years but purely on the basis of this chaotic affair it might be an issue to reconsider. Because this was essentially a play-off, and panned out like one. The volume inside the ground was that sort of loud you get when a stadium of people are too nervous to do anything but scream unintelligibly. The atmosphere was almost unbearably tense. In the corner where the noisiest Swansea fans sang, a steward tried to get them to sit down. He didn’t keep trying for long. Before the game, the whiff of dirty tricks was in the air, after first Southampton were told they could no longer stay in their chosen hotel and then the police escort they apparently expected from their new lodgings in Cardiff didn’t materialise. “Actually, they’ve done us a favour,” pouted Mark Hughes before the game. “The Swansea Marriott is one of the poorest hotels we stay in.” Of course nobody suggested Swansea themselves were the dark hand behind it all but even the inference of subterfuge indicated what a colossal match this was. Carlos Carvalhal had on the winter coat that is as crucial to his personal brand as those wacky analogies done up right to his chin, hands thrust into the pockets. Hughes’s hands were clamped to his hips, carrying the miffed look of a man who had arrived home to find a stranger’s car blocking his drive. Both managers seemed entirely vexed throughout, perhaps because of their respective teams’ inability to produce much competent football. It would be easy to put the lack of quality down to the tension but it was an accurate representation of the teams seasons. Stoke and West Brom must have watched on and wondered how on earth they had managed to be worse than these two. But it was also a good example to show anyone who equates quality with entertainment. Aside from a terrible film you may like “ironically”, sport is probably the only form of public entertainment that can hold your attention even when the performers are not actually any good. The visceral thrill of games like these is at least on a par with, if not preferable to a display of technical excellence. Chaos is more fun than order, even if most managers will heartily disagree with you. The teams seemed to take it in turns to go hell for leather, as if they had come to some sort of unspoken accord that they couldn’t both keep up the pace so it was best to share the workload. Swansea raced out of the traps, piling on pressure and throwing cross after cross into the box. But, as on many occasions this season, they could not break through, their anaemic total of 27 goals as big a reason as any for their plight. In the second half Southampton took up the baton. Hughes is not a man one usually associates with casting caution to wind but as the clock ticked over to the hour mark he had three centre-forwards on the pitch. A draw wasn’t much use to anyone, so it had to be full throttle. Ultimately it worked, Manolo Gabbiadini scrambling home a goal that seemed to fit the game, messy and uncoordinated, a scene that then moved into the away end, the Saints fans briefly ceasing to be people and becoming a single, undulating mass of limbs and uncomplicated joy. Far from spurring Swansea on, their own doom staring them in the face seemed to paralyse them. Tammy Abraham came on to cause a little havoc but he could not cause enough. Swansea now have to rely on Huddersfield losing their last two games, and beat Stoke on the final day to survive. It could happen but prospects look grim. Still, if it’s any consolation to them, the neutrals among us thoroughly enjoyed the match."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/ng-interactive/2018/may/10/david-squires-on-a-fitting-end-to-the-a-league-season","type":"interactive","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T18:00:50Z","webTitle":"David Squires on ... a fitting end to the A-League season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/may/10/david-squires-on-a-fitting-end-to-the-a-league-season","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/may/10/david-squires-on-a-fitting-end-to-the-a-league-season","fields":{"headline":"David Squires on ... a fitting end to the A-League season","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/may/10/fears-family-violence-is-going-undetected-by-psychiatrists","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T18:00:51Z","webTitle":"Fears family violence is going undetected by psychiatrists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/10/fears-family-violence-is-going-undetected-by-psychiatrists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/10/fears-family-violence-is-going-undetected-by-psychiatrists","fields":{"headline":"Fears family violence is going undetected by psychiatrists","bodyText":"Half of Australia’s psychiatrists are receiving less than two hours of formal training in how to deal with family violence, a study has found. The finding has raised fears family violence may be going undetected by psychiatrists, and prompted calls for a more comprehensive training regimen. Psychiatrists frequently find themselves interacting with survivors of family violence, often affecting patients with complex histories of mental illness, vulnerability and trauma. International studies show about 30% of all psychiatric inpatients and outpatients have experienced domestic violence. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists says it is leading an Australian-first study on the preparedness of its members for family violence, which is due to be presented at its annual congress next week. About half of the psychiatrists were found to have had less than two hours’ formal training on family violence. Manjula O’Connor, chair of the college’s family violence psychiatry network, said the findings were a surprise, although they were in line with other international research. “It was a surprise that there were people who had one hour, two hours, or none,” O’Connor said. “We are recommending at least up to 11 hours of initial training and then they can boost their training as part of their continuing professional development.” About one in 10 psychiatrists felt they did not have the necessary skills to discuss family violence with female patients. That was particularly so for patients from a different ethnic background. The research shows about 56% of psychiatrists felt comfortable in treating family violence, and being able to identify it at the right time and make referrals. About 44% said they were less comfortable asking about family violence that was current. That level of confidence was slightly better than that detected in overseas studies, O’Connor said. She said there were multiple barriers hindering the identification or discussion of family violence between a psychiatrist and patient. “You’re dealing with very complex and highly distressed patients, where the overt symptoms take more precedence than the underlying or associated factors, so the family violence is left a little bit out of the scope of discussion,” she said. “Often what we need to do is chase up on those issues once the patient’s symptomology has settled down. That requires keeping family violence front and centre in your mind when dealing with a mental health patient.” Patients could also feel too embarrassed and ashamed to talk about family violence, which requires the fostering of trust between psychiatrist and survivor. The difficulties were particularly severe for those from migrant or ethnic backgrounds who were still living with perpetrators. “These women are often chronically depressed or chronically suicidal, if you have ongoing family violence, it’s very hard to recover from that,” she said. O’Connor has led a separate anti-dowry campaign to stamp out dowry abuse among migrant communities in Australia. Requesting a dowry has long been outlawed in India, but the practice is still used in Australian communities, and is often linked to family violence, with women who refuse to comply often facing physical harm, emotional abuse, homelessness or visa problems. The Victorian royal commission into family violence recommended the Victorian government consider making dowries a form of family violence. O’Connor said the state government was now preparing to legislate against dowry abuse, and her organisation, the Australasian Centre for Human Rights and Health, was soon to present a submission on the issue to the United Nations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/09/global-warming-is-melting-antarctic-ice-from-below","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T10:00:44Z","webTitle":"Global warming is melting Antarctic ice from below | John Abraham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/09/global-warming-is-melting-antarctic-ice-from-below","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/09/global-warming-is-melting-antarctic-ice-from-below","fields":{"headline":"Global warming is melting Antarctic ice from below","bodyText":"We all know intuitively that in a warmer world there will be less ice. And, since the North and South Pole regions contain lots of ice, anyone who wants to see evidence of climate change can look there. But beyond this simplistic view, things can get pretty complex. First, it’s important to recognize that the Arctic and the Antarctic are very different places. In the Arctic, almost all the ice is floating on water – there is very little land. So, we talk about ‘sea ice’ in the north, formed from frozen sea water. On the other hand, Antarctica is a massive land mass that is covered by ice formed from snowfall (called an ‘ice sheet’). There is some floating ice around the perimeter of the land, but the vast majority of Antarctic ice is on land. This difference not only affects how these regions response to climate change, but it also impacts their importance. We know that when floating ice melts, the ocean levels will not rise, because the ice was already floating in the water. But, when land ice melts, the liquid water flows into the ocean and causes the water levels to rise. So, at least from a sea-level perspective, land ice is more important than floating ice. There are other differences between the north and south. One feature of the south is that there is a strong current that travels around Antarctica and partially shields it from waters elsewhere in the ocean. The Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory provides a good summary of some of the differences between the poles. With global warming, both of the poles are warming quite quickly, and this warming is causing ice to melt in both regions. When we think of ice melting, we may think of it melting from above, as the ice is heated from the air, from sunlight, or from infrared energy from the atmosphere. But in truth, a lot of the melting comes from below. For instance, in the Antarctic, the ice shelves extend from the land out over the water. The bottom of the ice shelf is exposed to the ocean. If the ocean warms up, it can melt the underside of the shelf and cause it to thin or break off into the ocean. A new study, recently published in Science Advances, looked at these issues. One of the goals of this study was to better understand whether and how the waters underneath the shelf are changing. They had to deal with the buoyancy of the waters. We know that the saltier and colder water is, the denser it is. Around Antarctica, water at the ocean surface cools down and becomes saltier. These combined effects make the surface waters sink down to the sea floor. But as ice melt increases, fresh water flows into the ocean and interrupts this buoyancy effect. This “freshening” of the water can slow down or shut down the vertical mixing of the ocean. When this happens, the cold waters at the surface cannot sink. The deeper waters retain their heat and melt the ice from below. The study incorporated measurements of both temperature and salinity (saltiness) at three locations near the Dalton Iceberg Tongue on the Sabrina Coast in East Antarctica. The measurements covered approximately an entire year and gave direct evidence of seasonal variations to the buoyancy of the waters. The researchers showed that a really important component to water-flow patterns were ‘polynyas.’ These are regions of open water that are surrounded by ice, typically by land ice on one side and sea ice on the other side. A satellite photograph of a polynya is shown below. When waters from the polynya are cold and salty, the waters sink downwards and form a cold curtain around the ice shelf. However, when the waters are not salty (because fresh water is flowing into the polynya), this protective curtain is disrupted and warm waters can intrude from outside, leading to more ice melt. Based on this study, we may see increased ice loss in the future – sort of a feedback loop. That concerns us because it will mean more sea level rise (which is already accelerating), and more damage to coastal communities. I asked the lead author, Alesandro Silvano about this work: We found that freshwater from melting ice shelves is already enough to stop formation of cold and salty waters in some locations around Antarctica. This process causes warming and freshening of Antarctic waters. Ocean warming increases melting of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, causing sea level to rise. Freshening of Antarctic waters weakens the currents that trap heat and carbon dioxide in the ocean, affecting the global climate. In this way local changes in Antarctica can have global implications. Multiple sources of evidence exist now to show that these changes are happening. However, what will happen in Antarctica in the next decades and centuries remains unclear and needs to be understood. This is just another reason to take scientists seriously and act to slow down climate change before it is too late."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/09/north-korea-releases-three-us-citizens-in-run-up-to-trump-summit-mike-pompeo","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T16:50:40Z","webTitle":"North Korea releases three US citizens in run-up to Trump summit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/09/north-korea-releases-three-us-citizens-in-run-up-to-trump-summit-mike-pompeo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/09/north-korea-releases-three-us-citizens-in-run-up-to-trump-summit-mike-pompeo","fields":{"headline":"North Korea releases three US citizens in run-up to Trump summit","bodyText":"North Korea has released three US citizens, in a move that continues the apparent thawing of its relations with the United States ahead of a planned meeting between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump.The release of the three men, all US citizens of Korean heritage, marks a major diplomatic victory for the Trump administration and was secured during a visit to North Korea by Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state. Trump announced on Twitter that the former detainees were headed back to the US on the same flight as Pompeo. The president was scheduled to meet them at Joint Base Andrews, an air force base near Washington DC, on Wednesday night. “They seem to be in good health,” Trump tweeted, adding that a date and location for his summit with the North Korean leader had been set, without revealing further details. Speaking to reporters later on Wednesday morning, Trump said he would announce a site for the summit within three days but confirmed it would not be held at the demilitarised zone along the border between the two Koreas. “President Trump appreciates leader Kim Jong-un’s action to release these American citizens, and views this as a positive gesture of goodwill,” the White House said in a statement on the prisoner release. The three men were able to walk “without assistance” to the plane. Pompeo’s trip came amid a frenzy of diplomacy. Kim made a surprise trip to China on Monday for a two-day summit with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The visit came less than two weeks after a historic meeting between the North Korean leader and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in. “North Korea recognises that not releasing the detainees will call its sincerity about progress into question,” said Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who worked on North Korea policy. “By releasing them, it gets to look like it is the driver of progress, putting pressure on the United States to reciprocate, or at least do nothing to disrupt the good atmosphere.” But the release will do little to bridge the chasm that remains between Washington and Pyongyang over the North’s nuclear programme, Oba said. After Kim returned to Pyongyang from China, Trump and Xi spoke by phone and the two “agreed on the importance of continued implementation of sanctions on North Korea until it permanently dismantles its nuclear and missile programmes”, according to a summary of the call released by the White House. Negotiations for the release of the three Americans reportedly began two months ago when North Korea’s foreign minister floated the idea during a visit to Sweden. Tony Kim and Kim Hak-song were arrested last year just months after Trump took office and were accused of committing “hostile acts” against North Korea. Both men worked for the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, a school founded by evangelical Christians in 2010 that mostly teaches children of the political elite. The other detained American, Kim Dong-chul, was arrested in 2015 and later sentenced to 10 years hard labour for spying. The businessman who once ran a hotel in the North said he had tried to steal military secrets for South Korea during a staged press conference in 2016. All three men are unrelated. The US has previously accused North Korea of arresting its citizens for use as “pawns for a political agenda”. Otto Warmbier, an American student, was released last year after 17 months in detention, only to die several days after returning to the US. There are also six South Korean citizens, including three pastors, being held by the North, and Seoul has pledged to push for their release. “Our government has worked to resolve the detainee issue through inter-Korean talks and cooperation with the international community,” Baik Tae-hyun, spokesman for the South’s unification ministry, said according to Yonhap news agency. “It will continue to make active efforts to bring back those detainees as soon as possible.” The move comes as China, Japan and South Korea have agreed to work together to encourage North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and on three-way and regional free trade agreements. The agreements came on Wednesday at a meeting in Tokyo with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, and South Korea’s President Moon. It was the first such trilateral summit since November 2015. Moon called on China and Japan to play an active role in ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons. Abe reiterated Japan’s position that it would normalise ties with North Korea only if the latter took concrete steps toward abandoning its nuclear and missile programmes and resolved the issue of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean agents."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/17/idahobit-time-to-reflect-on-impact-negative-reporting-has-on-trans-kids","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T18:00:08Z","webTitle":"IDAHOBIT: time to reflect on impact negative reporting has on trans kids | Hannah Mouncey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/17/idahobit-time-to-reflect-on-impact-negative-reporting-has-on-trans-kids","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/17/idahobit-time-to-reflect-on-impact-negative-reporting-has-on-trans-kids","fields":{"headline":"IDAHOBIT: time to reflect on impact negative reporting has on trans kids","bodyText":"To say the last six months have been interesting would be an understatement. I’ve found myself in a world that is truly bizarre, and that I think I will always fail to comprehend. The football media is in many ways a false economy; quite often with more space and air time to fill than stories available, which does make me wonder how much my story would have carried in the days prior to social media and the 24/7 news cycle. For those who don’t know what I’m speaking about, I nominated for the AFLW draft last year only to have the AFL reverse their decision to let me play less than a day before the draft was to take place. Given the time frame involved, and the fact I had received assurances I would be taken by at least one club, I was left without a job or a place to live, as I’d left my home in Canberra knowing I would be moving to Melbourne. I ended up moving to Melbourne regardless, and am currently playing for the Darebin Falcons in the VFLW – but it made for a very chaotic and stressful couple of months. Today being International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, it’s a good chance to reflect on what the last few months have taught me, and I’m sure many other people as well; be it the levels of acceptance of trans people in society and sport, the willingness of people to learn about trans issues or simply people’s ability to comprehend information that may differ from what they’ve been brought up believing. What it has taught me most of all, and is the one positive to come out of the whole saga, is the importance of having the right people around you and knowing who those people are. This is something all trans people learn at some point, but for me it has certainly become more evident than for most. I’m incredibly lucky; I have three people in Melbourne I know couldn’t care less about football, and just care about me for who I am. Add another two in Canberra and one in Queensland, and that makes a support network that helps me enormously simply by knowing that they’re there. I couldn’t thank these people enough or love them any more than I do, but if it wasn’t for sport, I would have only met two of them. This is why it’s so important to highlight how far we have to go in making all LGBT people, not just trans people, feel comfortable playing sport. The benefits of sport are as much about the connections you build as they are playing, but being told you can’t play, as if often the case with trans people, makes those inaccessible. No one can feel included if they’re being told that they can run drinks but not play. And as it stands, I know that compared to most trans people I am incredibly lucky. I have a job, I have the people I mentioned earlier and have far more support than almost any other trans person I know. But with latest figures showing 80% of young trans people having self-harmed, 48% reporting having attempted suicide at some point in their lives and rates of depression and anxiety approximately 10 times higher than other young Australians, it is important that people are aware of the impact their actions have. Those commenting on trans people and their place in society – as Chris Judd has recently – really need to be careful about the potential impact this has, as well as ensuring that what they have to say is informed. Every negative comment in the media, whether directed towards a specific person or not, is incredibly harmful to the entire trans community. And this isn’t just restricted to those of us of an age where we can engage thoughtfully with the media; it’s the message it sends to trans kids that is truly damaging. They largely don’t have the ability to recognise who is or isn’t worth listening too; instead they take it all in like a sponge and absorb every negative comment they might come across. For people still coming to terms with or figuring out who they are, it’s impossible to describe how much of a negative impact that has. The time when I realised I was trans and was starting to come out coincided with Caitlyn Jenner’s transition and, a few years earlier, that of Cate McGregor. As a 24 or 25-year-old reading a number of negative news stories and sensationalist headlines, such as this one featuring some appalling signage in a US restaurant, left me terrified of what I knew was to come. Imagine processing those messages and images as a 10 or 15 year old. It doesn’t matter if the negative commentary relates to football, academia, music or any other pursuit you can think of. I can guarantee that in my case – where comments relating to my situation could generally be summarised as: “trans women shouldn’t play football, they’re not female enough” – the message being absorbed by tens of thousands of trans people out there is: “trans people don’t belong in normal society”. It may sound extreme, but when you take into account the well-documented difficulties trans people face in finding employment, housing and health care, it simply reinforces the messages being delivered by other parts of society every day. No one would want their child – and it could well be your child – receiving those messages and feeling so desperately awful about who they are that they become part of that 48%. For that reason, the messaging needs to change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/09/scott-morrison-seeks-backing-for-budget-tax-cuts-without-full-costings","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T03:33:14Z","webTitle":"Scott Morrison seeks backing for budget tax cuts without full costings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/09/scott-morrison-seeks-backing-for-budget-tax-cuts-without-full-costings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/09/scott-morrison-seeks-backing-for-budget-tax-cuts-without-full-costings","fields":{"headline":"Scott Morrison seeks backing for budget tax cuts without full costings","bodyText":"Scott Morrison is asking parliament to pass $140bn of personal income tax cuts without providing detailed costings to support his plan. It is reminiscent of 2016 when the government announced its ten-year corporate tax cut plan without providing full costings. In Tuesday’s budget the Treasurer proposed a radical plan to flatten Australia’s progressive income tax scales, saying he wants people earning between $41,001 and $200,000 to pay the same marginal rate of tax eventually. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The plan will deliver a huge windfall for high-income earners, reducing the number of income tax brackets from five to four, with the new “flatter” tax system coming into full effect from 1 July 2024. The government introduced the bill to parliament on Wednesday morning but the bill did not reveal how much the seven-year plan would cost to implement, nor how much yearly revenue the government would sacrifice as a consequence. The government told journalists on Tuesday night during the budget lock-up that the plan would cost $140bn over the “medium term” – which is 10 years – but the bill does not contain that information. The only costings it contains are for the first four years of the plan. According to Treasury estimates, the plan will cost $13.4bn over the next four years as the government introduces a “low income tax offset” for low- and middle-income earners and begins the process of changing the tax system’s marginal tax thresholds. Morrison was asked on Wednesday why detailed year-by-year costings of his seven-year plan had not been included in the legislation, and he said the government couldn’t do so because the numbers wouldn’t be reliable. “It is not the practice of any government to provide itemised year-by-year costs over the medium term because they’re not reliable,” he said. “You do it over four years and that’s what we’ve done, $13.4bn, and that is covering completely step one of that process, because as you know the remaining steps actually come in over the medium term and the overall cost over the medium term is $140bn. “That is the standing practice for budgeting in this country and we haven’t departed from those transparency rules.” The Coalition ran into trouble in 2016 when it announced its ten-year corporate tax cut plan without providing detailed costings. At the time, it proposed reducing the corporate tax rate from 30% to 25% for all firms by 2026-27, but only provided costings for the first four years, saying the first four years would cost $2.65bn. A few days later, the treasury secretary John Fraser admitted the cost of the plan over ten-years would be $48.2bn revenue foregone. A year later, the government had to admit the ten-year cost of the plan had risen from an initial estimate of $48.2bn to $65.4bn, after maturing for a year. Labor says the cost of the plan has now risen to $80bn, after maturing for two years. The government is pushing Labor to support its new plan immediately, saying low- and middle-income workers deserve a tax cut. It wants Labor to support the entire package, not just the first phase of its seven-year plan that has been costed. It wants parliament to pass the legislation before 1 June, saying it’s urgent to pass the legislation before the end of financial year so low- and middle-income earners will receive the tax offsets - worth between $87 and $530 depending on their income - when they file their tax returns for the 2018-19 financial year. Parliament only has one fortnight to go before the end of the financial year – starting 21 May and ending 31 May – and the government wants Labor to back the entire bill before then. Labor has given initial backing to the tax relief for low- and middle-income earners but has reserved its position on the proposal to axe the 37% tax bracket. Bill Shorten has criticised the government for its attempt to pressure Labor to support the entire $140bn package without explaining how much it will cost each year. Morrison’s plan will flatten Australia’s progressive income tax scales dramatically. At the moment, the tax system is designed to ensure that workers with the greatest ability to pay tax contribute a larger share of personal income tax revenue, with five income tax brackets being applied progressively. Under the current system, for every dollar you earn between $37,001 and $87,000 you are asked to pay 32.5 cents in tax, then for every dollar you earn between $87,001 and $180,000 you pay 37 cents in tax, and for every dollar you earn over $180,001, you pay 45 cents in tax. But Morrison wants to abolish some of the system’s progressivity by requiring everyone earning between $41,001 and $200,000 to pay 32.5 cents for each dollar earned between those amounts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/09/in-australias-reduced-aid-budget-pacific-gets-lions-share","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T01:02:06Z","webTitle":"In Australia's historically low aid budget, Pacific gets lion's share","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/09/in-australias-reduced-aid-budget-pacific-gets-lions-share","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/09/in-australias-reduced-aid-budget-pacific-gets-lions-share","fields":{"headline":"In Australia's historically low aid budget, Pacific gets lion's share","bodyText":"The Pacific will get the lion’s share of a straitened aid budget, as Australia seeks to counter China’s growing influence in the region.

Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The director of the Development Policy Centre at the Australian National University, Prof Stephen Howes, said on Wednesday morning the budget presented “a fairly bleak outlook” for Australia’s aid budget. “Australia is getting richer, but as a nation, we are becoming less generous,” he said “What we’re seeing in Australia is not symptomatic of a broader trend. The rest of the world is moving in the other direction. The rest of the world is growing more generous; Australia is becoming less.” Howes said the rationale for cutting aid spending could not be justified economically. From 2012 to 2021, the aid budget fell by 32%. All other non-aid spending, increased by 31%. “The old rationale for aid cuts has been the debt and deficit,” Howes said. “But this rationale doesn’t really make a lot of sense, because the fiscal situation is improving. We should have seen some respite for aid, if that really was the rationale.” The minister for international development and the Pacific, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, argued last month that the government’s aid budget could not be increased while a majority of Australians opposed higher spending on developing nations. Howes did welcome the budget’s renewed emphasis on labour mobility – such as the seasonal worker program and the Pacific labour scheme. The World Bank recently recommended that Australia scrap its regional work requirement for backpackers in favour of getting more seasonal workers from the Pacific to work in the horticultural industry. The remittances earned by seasonal workers have been shown to be effective in increasing household budgets, improving education and healthcare for children, and benefiting broader communities. Aid budgets to nations outside the Pacific have been cut deeply. East Asia has faced massive aid cuts over successive years, while other regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, have also lost funding. Australia’s role in the Pacific, where it has traditionally been the dominant power, is under increasing threat. China has poured up to $1.7bn in aid into the region over a decade, still far behind Australia’s $7bn over the same time. But China’s growing interest has been followed by reports of plans to build military bases in countries such as Vanuatu and its assertiveness in militarising atolls in the South China Sea is seen as a template for increased military influence. An OECD report in March said Australia’s diminishing aid commitment was impairing its efforts to foster development in fragile small-island states and reduce the risks and impacts of natural disasters. “The decline in [Australian aid flow], despite steady economic growth, has affected the scope of development and humanitarian programmes” OECD development assistance committee chair Charlotte Petri Gornitzka said. Four countries have met the OECD target of budgeting aid spending at 0.7% of GNI, while another three are above 0.5%, compared with Australia’s 0.23%. In New Zealand, foreign affairs minister Winston Peters announced a NZ$714m (A$670m) funding boost in aid for Pacific Island nations over the next four years, aimed at tackling climate change and increasing New Zealand’s commitment to the region. Spending on the Pacific accounts for more than 60% of New Zealand’s aid budget. “The South Pacific has become an increasingly contested strategic space,” Peters said Peters in a speech on Tuesday night, ahead of the New Zealand budget. “Our voice has been weakened during the past decade at the same time as Pacific nations face a myriad of challenges they are not, in many cases, well equipped to tackle. The wider Asia Pacific region is also showing signs of strain at the very time when regional stability has never been more critical to maintaining New Zealand’s security and prosperity. “First and foremost, our identity is anchored in the Pacific and it is fitting and proper that we foster our fraternal bonds with our Pacific neighbours. What is good for them is good for us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/08/trump-gift-hardline-iranian-political-elites","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T22:57:58Z","webTitle":"By ending the nuclear deal, Trump has handed a gift to Iranian hardliners | Sanam Vakil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/08/trump-gift-hardline-iranian-political-elites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/08/trump-gift-hardline-iranian-political-elites","fields":{"headline":"By ending the nuclear deal, Trump has handed a gift to Iranian hardliners","bodyText":"For Iranians, Donald Trump’s announcement that he is withdrawing the US from the nuclear deal and reimposing sanctions, despite Iran’s compliance with the deal, is deeply disappointing. This is a manufactured crisis, and in making it, Washington and its allies in Tel Aviv and Riyadh have set their sights on a zero-sum option of containing and even forcing political change in the Islamic Republic. This naive thinking reflects Washington’s limited understanding of Iran and its internal politics as well as the deep regional divide between Iran and its Arab neighbours. So rather than address the principal challenge of Iran’s regional meddling and the wider tensions in the Middle East in an initiative separate from the already functioning nuclear deal, Trump has unleashed a genie that will not so easily go back in its bottle. The consequences and challenges ahead are multiple. First, the US withdrawal creates a transatlantic divide at a time when cooperation between Washington and its European allies is critical. Since January, France, Germany and the UK have scrambled to find solutions, albeit unsuccessfully, to placate Trump’s concerns about the nuclear agreement. Trump’s zero-sum decision, however, leaves the EU with little room for manoeuvre, either to save the deal or to create openings for new negotiations. In the absence of either, a full-scale collapse of the deal will ultimately empower China and Russia. Both will capitalise on western paralysis in the Middle East by building strong economic and political ties not only with Iran, who will have no where else to turn, but also its neighbours that are already looking east. Inside Iran, President Rouhani’s initial reaction was to translate Iranian anger and disappointment into nationalism. He immediately responded by summoning the “Iranian nation … to be more united and resolved.” But Trump has handed a unique opportunity to hardline political elites to build on Iranian frustration. Not only can the hardliners use the breakdown of the deal to establish unity among the divided elites, but they can also build bridges with the Iranian population after protests in January. The knock-on effects of conservative unity could even lead to a victory for a hardline candidate in the 2020 parliamentary elections and the 2021 presidential poll. Moving beyond symbolic speeches, though, Iran has a hard task ahead that includes trying to maintain European, Russian and Chinese solidarity. Without that Tehran faces renewed economic isolation. In the weeks ahead, Tehran will seek to pressure the EU in particular to defend the deal. If that defence does not materialise, though, Iran will gradually restart its nuclear programme. The wider consequence here is that other regional actors such as Saudi Arabia will also make similar moves accelerating the issue of regional nuclear proliferation. The Middle East is a tinderbox of tensions as conflicts rage in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon and Iran is the driver of much of this toxicity. Here too, the potential for a wider regional escalation is high. Israel remains rightly intent on preventing Tehran from gaining a significant foothold on the Syrian border. Yet, Iran has developed asymmetrical ties with militias and proxies affording it great opportunity to stir up trouble and demonstrate its leverage. With these consequences in mind, it is clear that the Trump administration has miscalculated. While Trump is proud to have maintained his campaign promise to roll back the “worst deal ever”, he does not yet realise that by doing so he will be breaking another – and the United States could yet again become embroiled in another Middle East war.

The focus on digital wellbeing comes at a time when technology companies are being scrutinised for the habit-forming design practices that encourage people to spend more time on their devices, such as infinite scrolling, notifications and other behavioural “nudges”. The latest version of Google’s mobile operating system, Android P, has an “app dashboard” to help people better understand their own tech usage. It shows how much time you spend using specific apps each day, how many times you unlock your phone and how many notifications you receive. Users can set time limits on specific apps each day, and they will get a warning when they are close to their allocation. “For the rest of the day that app is greyed out to remind you,” said Samat, speaking on stage at Google’s developer conference, I/O, at the Shoreline Amphitheatre near the company’s headquarters in Mountain View. There is also a “wind down” mode that helps you switch off at night by automatically setting the “do not disturb” feature – which stops you from receiving calls, texts and notifications – and turning the screen to greyscale. The “do not disturb” feature has been upgraded so that it not only silences phone calls and texts but the visual interruptions that pop up on screen. Users can turn the setting on by flipping their phone over so it is face down on a surface, a gesture Google has codenamed “shush”. “People struggle to be truly present because notifications on the device can be too distracting,” Samat said. The company has introduced features to YouTube so that users can see how many hours of content they have watched across their phones and desktop computers. They can also schedule “custom breathers” to encourage them to step away from devices. “If you have been watching for a while it will show up and say ‘maybe it’s time to take a break’,” explained the Google CEO, Sundar Pichai. Pichai reminded the audience of existing tools for helping parents manage the apps their kids use and reduce screen time such as Family Link and YouTube Kids – although the latter has come under fire for hosting disturbing algorithmically generated videos. Google also has a training programme to help kids stay safe online called Be Internet Awesome. The programme covers how to be mindful of one’s online reputation, avoid scams, protect privacy, report inappropriate content and deal with online harassment. “A lot of technology is designed to be addictive,” said Caroline Knorr from the technology watchdog Common Sense Media. “Companies have created business models around keeping users engaged as long as possible and using persuasive techniques developed with psychologists.” “I want to applaud Google for these changes. Some of them seem great. However, Google is one of the biggest innovators in some of the sneaky techniques to keep people hooked, like auto-play videos on YouTube.” Knorr said that Common Sense Media did not necessarily believe in “using technology to fight technology” but that any tool that help parents regulate their and their children’s usage of technology is a positive thing. These digital wellbeing initiatives come at a time when several prominent technology execs have expressed regret over their role in building addictive products. Facebook’s founding president, Sean Parker, said that the company built a platform that exploited “a vulnerability in human psychology”. Tristan Harris, a former Google employee, has set up the Center for Humane Technology, a not-for-profit organisation that focuses on “re-aligning technology with humanity’s best interests”. The Center has convened several technology and policy experts to develop design standards and business models that are good for society. “In the future, we will look back at today as a turning point towards humane design: when we moved away from technology that extracts attention and erodes society, towards technology that protects our minds and replenishes society,” states the center’s website."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/11/friday-best-tv-the-bridge-our-wildest-dreams-episodes","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T05:20:32Z","webTitle":"Friday’s best TV: The Bridge; Our Wildest Dreams; Episodes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/11/friday-best-tv-the-bridge-our-wildest-dreams-episodes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/11/friday-best-tv-the-bridge-our-wildest-dreams-episodes","fields":{"headline":"Friday’s best TV: The Bridge; Our Wildest Dreams; Episodes","bodyText":"The Bridge 9pm, BBC Two The final series of the Scandi-noir begins with Saga imprisoned for murdering her mother and struggling with a lack of control over her routines.

Theresa May said she would consider plugging the gap, acknowledged the important work done by the organisation in “horrendous” conditions. The US government previously contributed about a third of the overall funding for the group. Since 2011, the UK has provided £2.71bn in aid to the Syrian humanitarian effort. Of this, £38.4m went through the conflict, stability and security fund to the White Helmets, a freedom of information request revealed this month. On Wednesday, Matthew Pennycook, Labour MP for Greenwich and Woolwich, told the House of Commons of the life-saving work done by the White Helmets, despite the “ever present threat of death” from both Syrian and Russian airstrikes in the face of “smears and disinformation”, and asked the prime minister whether the government would pledge to make up the shortfall. May replied: “We recognise the very important and valuable work that the White Helmets are doing. They are, as he says, doing this in horrendously difficult conditions. They are incredibly brave to be continuing that work. We do support them, we will continue to support them and … the international development secretary will be looking at the level of support in the future.” The group’s 3,000 volunteers work in rebel-held areas where Syria’s official emergency services do not venture, rescuing civilians from collapsing buildings after airstrikes. In March, Trump froze a $200m (£148m) package of US aid to Syria, which included money for the White Helmets. The US has given the group $33m to date, and the freeze puts projects such as demining and the restoration of water and power supplies at risk. The White Helmets have faced accusations of collaboration with al-Qaida and, after publishing footage that documented a chemical attack, were accused of staging chemical weapons offensives to discredit the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said that it provided £200m to grassroots humanitarian projects in Syria last year. She said: “The UK remains committed to supporting the White Helmets and the vital work they do, providing life-saving assistance to civilians affected by Syria’s conflict.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2018/may/08/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire-review-swashbuckling-retro-fun","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T17:00:24Z","webTitle":"Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire review – swashbuckling retro fun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/may/08/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire-review-swashbuckling-retro-fun","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/may/08/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire-review-swashbuckling-retro-fun","fields":{"headline":"Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire review – swashbuckling retro fun","bodyText":"Pillars of Eternity is an ambitious and successful gamble on role-playing game nostalgia, aimed squarely at people who enjoyed Baldur’s Gate and Planescape: Torment. The first game, released in 2015, brought in $4m in funding on Kickstarter. Its sequel, Deadfire, also raised over $4m in crowdfunding, and has just been released. Unlike its predecessor, Deadfire is arriving into a market with many similar games attempting to leverage 90s RPG nostalgia while adding their own twists to the genre. It doesn’t rock the boat too much, but a fresh theme, clever writing and improvements to the look and feel make it a very enjoyable play. Speaking of boats, in Deadfire you are a naval explorer: you choose where you go, on land or at sea, and what route you take. Expeditions into the unknown are fun, but each day spent sailing costs resources; as you travel your stores deplete, your crew’s morale fails and you’re soon searching for the next city to resupply. It’s no carefree cruise across the high seas. You spend a lot of time maintaining your ship, exploring the seas and fighting turn-based, choice-driven naval battles – as well as chaotic on-deck battles involving your entire crew. Ship combat can be frustrating when cannons repeatedly miss; and when your ship’s cook charges headlong into a fireball, it is sometimes more of a hassle than swashbuckling fun, especially because injuries from such fights affect your ability to sail. Back on land, your party is comprised of up to five characters. You accept quests, talk to people and go into dungeons to kill things for money and experience-points. Fewer party members mean fights are less frenetic, but with the number of spells and abilities in play, this doesn’t reduce the game’s challenge. However, fights do feel more engaging than they did in the original Pillars of Eternity, because they are less frequent and foes use their abilities more intelligently; adversaries probe for weaknesses in your party’s formation rather than repeatedly charging into your strongest members. Players can also programme their party members’ behaviour, which allows AI teammates to handle complicated encounters. (If you don’t want to go into this much detail, more general settings allow the party to function without you having to micromanage every encounter.) The quality of the writing is where the game shines. From listening to your companions make ironically awful bawdy jokes to being forced to negotiate with the gods, it’s what makes the world believable, and what makes your decisions (and their consequences) feel as if they matter. Deadfire’s story picks up shortly after the original, and the player retains their role as a Watcher – someone who can see the past lives of others and the souls of the dead. The storytelling in the sequel is noticeably more confident, and the introduction more grand and engaging. But even players familiar with the setting could be confused by the sheer scale of the world. There is a lot of lore to read, but it is only relevant and interesting when it becomes part of the character’s story; delving into the in-game “cyclopedia” to understand the full background is not a necessarily an appealing prospect. The story setup is geared towards people who are already fans of this series: saves carry over from the first Pillars of Eternity, and decisions made during that game have consequences in Deadfire. You do have the option to start fresh, but without the context from the previous game a lot of the plot will be baffling. Deadfire does much to make the arcane systems originally derived from 20-year-old role-playing games more palatable. It is easy to see what loot and items are in the shared party stash, and class roles and party skills are clearly laid out. Enemies have cones of vision to show when they can see you. Instead of being limited by the specialisations of your main character – which can mean missing out on interesting story scenarios – your whole party contributes skills, opening up more options during fights and conversations. Graphically, it is a lot more elaborate than its 90s inspirations; its environments are rendered beautifully, without causing older PCs to struggle. Boats toss and turn on the waves, islands are vibrant, and colourful and characters have facial expressions and body language that were impossible to express with old-fashioned sprites. Deadfire is an entertaining adventure that will keep anyone with a soft spot for this genre hooked. It has a confidently told story and the combat and character progression are as fun as the original but easier to understand. It is also a commitment to finish, taking tens (if not hundreds) of hours to complete. In 2015, a mere 6.4% people completed the original Pillars of Eternity; today that figure has only risen to 10% on the platform Steam. Many players won’t reach the end of the narrative, but with so many interesting things to do, it doesn’t matter. Sailing frees you from the need to follow a set path, and most encounters in this ridiculously gigantic world are expertly written. Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire is £32.99. Playstation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch versions are planned for the end of the year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/25/christine-queens-girlfriend-track-of-week","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T10:00:43Z","webTitle":"Tracks of the week reviewed: Christine and the Queens, the Kooks and Backstreet Boys","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/25/christine-queens-girlfriend-track-of-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/25/christine-queens-girlfriend-track-of-week","fields":{"headline":"Tracks of the week reviewed: Christine and the Queens, the Kooks and Backstreet Boys","bodyText":"Christine and the Queens Girlfriend You can always rely on the newly monickered Chris to go the whole hog where funk is concerned.

Now, there’s a premiere date and a first look at the series, which follows a boozy princess named Bean, her aptly named elf friend Elfo, and Luci, Bean’s “personal demon”. The 10-episode first season of Disenchantment, which marks Groening’s long-awaited return to television, lands on Netflix on 17 August. Broad City’s Abbi Jacobson will voice Bean, who, in the four promotional photos released by Groening on Reddit and the show’s official Twitter account, carries either a sword, scimitar or a pint of beer, suggesting no ordinary princess. Bean’s sidekicks Elfo and Luci will be voiced respectively by Nat Faxon, who in 2011 won a best adapted screenplay Oscar for The Descendants, and the comic Eric Andre, last seen partaking in bachelor-party shenanigans in Rough Night. Supporting the main trio is a group of celebrated voice actors including Futurama’s John DiMaggio, Billy West, Maurice LaMarche, David Herman, Tress MacNeille, Jeny Batten, Rich Fulcher, Noel Fielding and Lucy Montgomery. “In Disenchantment, viewers will be whisked away to the crumbling medieval kingdom of Dreamland, where they will follow the misadventures of hard-drinking young princess Bean, her feisty elf companion Elfo and her personal demon Luci,” reads the official summary for Disenchantment. “Along the way, the oddball trio will encounter ogres, sprites, harpies, imps, trolls, walruses and lots of human fools.” In a statement last summer, Groening described Disenchantment, which has been picked up for 20 episodes, as a show “about life and death, love and sex, and how to keep laughing in a world full of suffering and idiots, despite what the elders and wizards and other jerks tell you”. In April, Groening made history when The Simpsons aired its 636th episode, surpassing Gunsmoke to become the longest-running scripted primetime series. The show premieres its 30th season this fall amid a debate about the character of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, the Indian store clerk who was the subject of comedian Hari Kondabalu’s 2017 documentary about The Simpsons and South Asian stereotypes, The Problem with Apu. Asked about the criticism last month, Groening replied tersely. “I’m proud of what we do on the show,” he told USA Today. “And I think it’s a time in our culture where people love to pretend they’re offended.” Disnechantment will be co-executive-produced by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, Groening’s frequent Simpsons collaborators (and the co-writers behind the classic Simpsons episode Marge Gets a Job). In Groening’s characteristically tight-lipped fashion, the teasers for the show tell us little. But since Disenchantment will be available on Netflix, in Groening’s first production away from Fox, the inevitable late-summer binge watch should make up for the show’s carefully cultivated mystique."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/25/tom-slade-funniest-things","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T13:00:23Z","webTitle":"Tom Stade: ‘The funniest number?

Due to the bravery of so many who have spoken about the impact the eighth has had on their lives, we know what that will mean for the women and families of Ireland – a woman with a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality will be forced to travel to get the care they need; doctors can take a woman to court while she is in labour over the method of birth; a family may have to go to court to get their daughter’s/wife’s life support switched off if she was pregnant; a survivor of rape who is pregnant as a result will have the additional trauma of being forced to travel abroad; and our mothers, daughters, sisters and wives who can’t travel will continue to put their lives in danger and risk jail time by seeking out unsafe methods out of desperation.

For the first time in the series, that also includes a heavy focus on female soldiers, with a substantial chunk of the single-player mode starring women, and the option for players to bring female characters into multiplayer games. Battlefield V (which, depending how you count, is actually somewhere between the seventh and 13th Battlefield game) will see players run and gun their way across fields of war ranging from the Netherlands to Norway to north Africa, according to developers EA Dice. “All of us have yearned for years for the possibility to go back to this era, to go back to where Battlefield started,” Lars Gustavsson, Dice’s creative director, said. “This is really the war that forged the modern world, science and man. It also has an endless amount of stories to be told … and allows us to challenge our preconceptions of the second world war.” The single-player mode from the first world war-themed Battlefield 1, War Stories, will make a return alongside large-scale multiplayer combat. The company was tight-lipped about the content of these episodic stories, save for a momentary preview at the London unveiling of one of the protagonists: a woman fighting with the Norwegian resistance. “Here, during the German occupation a young resistance fighter is about to pay the unthinkable price,” Gustavsson said, “not to save the world, but to save her family.” Bridging the gap is a new gameplay type, Combined Arms, which sees small squads of up to four people playing through dynamically generated missions. “Combined Arms is really what connects the dots between single-player and multiplayer,” Gustavsson said. “There’s no hiding that we as developers have an agenda here, to create a safe haven for new players to Battlefield that feel overwhelmed.” At the opposite end of the spectrum are Grand Operations, an evolution of another mode found in Battlefield 1. These multi-stage battles will be fought over the course of four in-game days and many real-world hours. One example given sees a cohort of Allied paratroopers trying to take out Axis artillery in Rotterdam, with their success dictating how scarce their resources are for the second phase, a ground assault. That leads into an all-out battle for control in the third phase. A welcome addition to the series is that players can now make soldiers of either gender. In Battlefield 1, the game introduced a playable Bedouin woman in the single-player campaign, but left the multiplayer an all-male affair. This time round, anyone can play as any gender, with the option to customise up to eight separate characters – one for each of the classes, for both Allied and Axis powers. Every few months, a new “chapter” of the game will begin, bringing with it a whole new swath of content for all modes at once. The entire field of war shifts – from Rotterdam to Norway at the end of the first chapter, for instance. “All players will have access to the same maps and modes,” Dice says, “keeping the community unified as they progress through Battlefield V.” EA had nothing to say about how these live elements will be monetised, or what might replace the “premium pass” that funded previous entries in the series, save to add that the game will not have randomised loot boxes. It did give one hint, however, in the release dates for the game. Yes, plural: the deluxe edition will be released 16 October, with the standard edition following three days later on 19 October."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/23/corbyn-and-may-fail-to-land-punches-in-pmqs-bar-brawl","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T17:49:09Z","webTitle":"Corbyn and May fail to land punches in PMQs bar brawl | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/23/corbyn-and-may-fail-to-land-punches-in-pmqs-bar-brawl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/23/corbyn-and-may-fail-to-land-punches-in-pmqs-bar-brawl","fields":{"headline":"Corbyn and May fail to land punches in PMQs bar brawl","bodyText":"Same as it ever was. After two weeks in which he had cruised to easy victories at prime minister’s questions simply by standing up and asking: “How’s Brexit going?” – something to which Theresa May has no convincing answer – Jeremy Corbyn instead went back to plan A. In hindsight, he may regret passing up the opportunity to complete his hat-trick with another tap in, as the session soon resembled two drunks fighting outside a pub who were too pissed to lay a glove on one another. The Labour leader began with a straightforward question on the NHS, a subject Corbyn considers home turf. In 2010, £4bn of services had been outsourced to the private sector: what was the current figure? True to form, May didn’t have a clue and answered a completely different question. This is becoming such a habit, it can’t be long before someone suggests she get a hearing test. If she can get one, that is, as most audiology services have already been severely cut. To help her out, Corbyn answered his own question. £9bn of NHS services had been outsourced. May put her fingers in her ears and shouted: “La, La, La.” A couple of her backbenchers looked slightly bemused, but most didn’t bat an eyelid. This kind of behaviour has now become the new normal. There is no reality you don’t like that now can’t not be ignored. It’s just a matter of will. Or blind stupidity. “WALES,” yelled the prime minister when the Labour leader asked her about a National Audit Office report that had found private contractors put patients’ health at risk. Much like Ken Livingstone, who feels obliged to shout “Hitler” whenever a microphone is put in front of him, May has developed her own particular verbal tics. Whenever she is asked a question about the NHS she gets panicky and blurts out: “Wales.” She must have a thing about countries; ask her about the economy and her default setting is to shout: “Venezuela.” Had he been a bit sharper, Corbyn might have spotted that Jeremy Hunt and Philip Hammond were looking distinctly twitchy on the front benches opposite. The health secretary and the chancellor are locked in a metrosexual arm-wrestling contest over the NHS budget and now would have been as good a time as any for the Labour leader to exploit the divisions in the cabinet. Instead Corbyn chose to engage in a handbags at dawn slanging match about who cared most about the NHS. “I really, really, love the NHS,” said Corbyn, spilling his drink. “No, I really, really love the NHS,” May slurred, her arms windmilling wildly. “You really, really hate the NHS.” “Well you want to overthrow capitalism.” Democracy at its finest. After a brief embarrassed pause during which no one quite knew where to look, Conservative Steve Double broke the silence by asking the most ridiculous question he could think of. Would the prime minister make Cornwall the centre of the UK’s space programme? Given that most of Cornwall struggles to find an internet connection this sounded like a long shot, but the prime minister was insistent that within a decade the UK would launch a rocket from Penzance and take over the entire galaxy. As the prime minister had set up two sub-subcommittees to investigate two solutions to the Irish border – both of which she knew to be unworkable – was it not the truth she didn’t really have a clue what she was doing? “No,” May lied. Doing something that was fundamentally pointless was exactly what the country had voted for in the referendum. Especially now she knew the Brexiters preferred unworkable “max fac” option, which she would inevitably support as she always did the opposite of what she wanted, was predicted to cost the UK £20bn per year. Take back control. But not of herself. Emboldened by the prime minister’s obvious mastery of the subject, Tory Peter Bone took a leaf out of Corbyn’s old playbook to enquire how Brexit was going. Never better, she insisted. It would have been kinder for one of her minders to pressing the control-alt-delete keys and crash her systems in the hope of getting a sensible answer when she rebooted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/24/sharent-trap-should-parents-put-their-children-on-social-media-instagram","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T06:00:44Z","webTitle":"The 'sharent' trap – should ​you ever put your ​children on social media?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/24/sharent-trap-should-parents-put-their-children-on-social-media-instagram","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/24/sharent-trap-should-parents-put-their-children-on-social-media-instagram","fields":{"headline":"The 'sharent' trap – should ​you ever put your ​children on social media?","bodyText":"Follow some bloggers or Instagram stars and you will know more about their children than you do about the children of your closest friends and relatives. You will see them sleeping or having tantrums; in their swimsuits in paddling pools or having their nappies changed. You will see their mealtimes, their holidays and what they looked like on Christmas morning. You may have seen them in the minutes after they were born, umbilical cord still attached, and perhaps even before they embarked on this childhood of unwitting digital documentation, in a fuzzy black-and-white ultrasound picture. The ethics of this – publishing photographs of one’s children to build a social media following, and then monetising it – have always been shady, but the issue has been amplified this week. On Mumsnet over the past few months, there have been active threads criticising parenting bloggers or “influencers” – that euphemism for advertisers – mainly about the transparency of sponsored posts and advertising content, but also about the perceived exploitation of their children. The account of one Instagram-user, Clemmie Hooper, was taken down this week and though it is unclear who took it down and why – there were allegations of abusive comments under a post – she has in the past attracted criticism for the use of her children. Hooper’s account, Mother of Daughters, had nearly 470,000 followers and documented life with her four girls. The account of her husband, Simon Hooper, who runs Father of Daughters for his 845,000 followers, is still running – and his posts almost always feature one or more of his daughters. The couple have been singled out this week – neither would comment for this piece – but they are far from the only ones. An extreme few have, either by accident or design, managed to turn themselves and their families into brands, but posting pictures of children online is something many parents do, and it all has ramifications. In a recent report for the London School of Economics (LSE) project Preparing for a Digital Future, three-quarters of parents who use the internet at least monthly share photographs or videos of their children online. Parents are more likely to do this with younger children. A little more than half only share pictures with close family and friends, and most don’t share pictures with “a wide audience” (defined by the researchers as more than 200 contacts). Just one in 10 do this, and only 3% of parents share pictures on a public website such as a blog or open Instagram account. So is sharing pictures online of our children something we should be worrying about? “In an age of visibility, it is important that parents discuss the pros and cons of sharing with their children, even when quite young,” says Sonia Livingstone, professor of social psychology in the department of media and communications at the LSE, and one of the project’s researchers. “We interviewed several families where even small children wished their parents would share fewer photos, and consult them more. We observed in a few families that children are even learning to tell their parents to stop. But insofar as this sharing is to bring families together, even when geographically dispersed, there are also advantages, and children appreciate those, too. It’s a matter of respect and consent, and protecting that is important, more than the actual fact of sharing itself.” Are generations of children now growing up without privacy? “I don’t think so,” she says. “The conditions of their privacy are changing, partly because of their own actions, partly others’. What will matter to children is to feel they have agency, respect and dignity – that’s at the heart of privacy. So anyone sharing or using their images should prioritise this.” Genevieve von Lob, clinical psychologist and author of Five Deep Breaths: The Power of Mindful Parenting, says: “More and more parents are questioning the wisdom of posting so much about their kids online. The pictures that are uploaded can form a permanent digital tattoo. Because it’s all so new for parents, we need to start thinking about asking children’s permission to post online.” Children will learn their own online behaviours from their parents, she adds. “Are you leading with a positive, respectful, appropriate example? Are you modelling that you think before you share online? If parents are posting things online to get likes, it’s about getting that validation from others. It’s important kids aren’t learning that posting [photographs] is a way of being validated.” It’s probably unreasonable to expect parents to stop altogether – social media is a fact of life now and there are benefits, Von Lob points out. “For parents, it can be a lifeline – you feel supported, [get] practical advice, reassurance. It can be very lonely if you’ve been with the kids all day, and putting pictures online is a way of connecting with other adults, but I do think parents need to keep in mind how those children will feel in the future. Will they feel ashamed, embarrassed, anxious, annoyed? Will your kids feel empowered enough to say: ‘I don’t feel happy about you putting this online’? You could affect your future relationship with your children if you haven’t asked their permission.” Will we ever get to the point where children are routinely suing their parents for exposing their childhoods online? It’s not impossible, says Claire Bessant, associate professor of law at Northumbria University, who is leading a project on “sharenting”. “Technically, there are remedies they could use. They could use the Data Protection Act or the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that comes into force tomorrow, because if parents are putting photos up without consent, [the child] could argue they have the right to take those down. They might consider they have a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to some of the information parents are putting out there.” This could be applied to medical information, or pictures taken in the home. If you think about how children are being profiled on the basis of social media images, there is a real risk Most children won’t have the finances to bring a court case, “and a child is normally not considered to have the capacity to bring legal proceedings themselves”. And the implications of such a case on family relationships could be disastrous. Bessant prefers the idea of educating parents and children “so there can be a dialogue at an earlier age. I’ve done research talking to parents about how they share information and what they think privacy is and there are a number of parents who said that once their children start to say, ‘I don’t want those photographs out there’, they would be quite willing to either not post at all, or only post once they have spoken to their kids.” Veronica Barassi, a media and communications lecturer at Goldsmith’s, University of London who is leading the Child Data Citizen research project, says “there is a moral panic” about sharing pictures online. However, she admits there are dangers. “If you think about big data and how children are being profiled on the basis of social media images, there is a real risk. I’m particularly interested in things like facial recognition: the way in which that data is sold, and the lack of transparency, is the most worrying aspect of so-called sharenting.” This can have unforeseen implications. One example she gives is parents posting pictures of their children at political demonstrations, and I think back to a picture I posted on my (private) Instagram account of my child at an anti-Trump rally in London. “They give the child a political agency in some way. But [parents] tend not to think about the fact that that’s creating a political trace that can be tracked in the future. It’s important that we start thinking about the way in which data is bought and used without us knowing.” Along with educational and medical information, “social media is one tiny dimension of the data traces that are produced about children today.” It’s important that parents consider the long-term implications for their child of having a highly visible digital footprint What, then, should parents do? Those setting out with the intention of making themselves and their children famous are one thing. “It’s important that parents consider carefully the long-term implications for their child of having a highly visible and widely shared digital footprint,” says Livingstone. “In our interviews with parent bloggers, we found they were becoming more conscious of this, and often taking care only to present their child in a positive light. Of course, it’s possible that this too could be problematic, creating an ideal self that the child must live up to.” As for the rest of us, who have no intention of using photographs of our toddlers to advertise a nappy brand but are still exposing them online, consent is key and “can begin very early,” she says. “Perhaps sharing should be kept to a minimum early on. Sharing photos with a handful of friends and family is one thing. Sharing on public sites is quite another, and I’m not sure parents should do that at all.” Much of it is common sense, says Bex Lewis, senior lecturer in digital marketing at Manchester Metropolitan University and author of Raising Children in a Digital Age. “Try not to put their school uniform in, try not to show that you have a regular pattern every day.” Most parents, you would hope, wouldn’t post pictures of their children naked but there are other things parents should perhaps think twice about. It is probably not fair, she says, to show pictures of a child having a meltdown, “although those are quite funny to watch”. Turn off geotagging, which tells internet users where you are, and lock down your privacy settings. Even then, “there is always a chance someone could screenshot the pictures, but someone could take a picture of your child in the park, and if you thought like that you’d never go anywhere. Keep the child involved in the conversation from an early age. The digital world is an everyday part of our lives now. It’s still evolving, so I’m not sure there are any fixed rules, but having a bit of thought about what you are posting and where you’re posting it is the critical thing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/23/nfl-protest-national-anthem-new-rules-fine","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T16:52:53Z","webTitle":"New NFL rules: teams face fines if players kneel during national anthem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/23/nfl-protest-national-anthem-new-rules-fine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/23/nfl-protest-national-anthem-new-rules-fine","fields":{"headline":"New NFL rules: teams face fines if players kneel during national anthem","bodyText":"NFL owners have issued new guidelines that will see teams fined if their players or staff do not show appropriate “respect” for the national anthem. According to the new rules, “a club will be fined by the league if its personnel are on the field and do not stand and show respect for the flag and the anthem”. The NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, said the league had been “sensitive” on the issue. “We want people to be respectful of the national anthem. We want people to stand,” Goodell said. “That’s all personnel, and to make sure they treat this moment in a respectful fashion. That’s something that we think we owe. We’ve been very sensitive on making sure that we give players choices, but we do believe that moment is an important moment and one that we are going to focus on.” Dozens of NFL players have knelt during the anthem over the past two seasons in protest against social injustice in the United States. Critics of the protests, including Donald Trump, believed them to be unpatriotic. Trump called players who knelt “sons of bitches” last year. The league, perhaps aware of the strength of feeling among players, has included what it may hope is a workaround: players can choose to stay in the locker rooms during the anthem if they wish. Previous rules stated that all players should be on the field for the anthem but said only that they “should” stand during the Star-Spangled Banner. Trump’s attack on protesting players prompted a backlash among players and owners, even ones known for their conservative views, and many players took a knee before the anthem following the president’s “son of a bitch” comments. Goodell said he did not believe players who knelt were unpatriotic. “It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic,” wrote Goodell. “This is not and was never the case.” The US vice-president, Mike Pence, made it clear how the Trump administration feels about the new policy. He tweeted the CNN story on the new rules with the hashtag “winning”. All 32 NFL owners approved the new rules at their annual pre-season meeting on Wednesday. However, there was disagreement on how to handle the issue. Some may have privately agreed with Trump, while others worried that the protests would hit revenues in a league that is incredibly popular in conservative parts of America. ESPN reports that some owners wanted all players to stand while others wanted to avoid the appearance of dictating players political views. Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid, who were two of the first players to protest at the start of the 2016 season, are currently unsigned. They have filed grievances against the league saying they have been blackballed due to their protest. The NFL Players Association said it was not part of discussions on the new rules. “We were not consulted ahead of this meeting on any potential changes to the anthem policy,” it said in a statement. “If there are changes to the policy that put players in a position where they could be disciplined or fined, we are going to do what we always do: fight anything that encroaches on players’ rights to the end. It went on: “The vote by NFL club CEOs today contradicts the statements made to our player leadership by commissioner Roger Goodell and the chairman of the NFL’s management council John Mara about the principles, values and patriotism of our league.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/23/cooking-for-one-isnt-so-easy-with-feast","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T16:41:48Z","webTitle":"Cooking for one isn’t so easy with Feast | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/23/cooking-for-one-isnt-so-easy-with-feast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/23/cooking-for-one-isnt-so-easy-with-feast","fields":{"headline":"Cooking for one isn’t so easy with Feast","bodyText":"In a speech on Monday, the prime minister said: “We will ensure that people can enjoy five extra healthy, independent years of life by 2035.” That’s a grand aspiration for genuinely progressive governments – but there’s surely a credibility gap when this pledge comes from the first PM under whose administration life expectancy in deprived areas, according to the Office for National Statistics, has actually fallen.

Everybody who voluntarily moves countries goes through this, and knows that these doubts can keep you awake all night. Except that this time it is really, really easy for us to be at peace with our decision to leave the United Kingdom. We simply go online and read a story like the one that broke yesterday: “Ex-mayor of Ipswich denied citizenship after almost 40 years in UK”. The reason: the Home Office “cannot be satisfied” that Inga Lockington, who moved from Denmark in 1979, is a permanent resident. No doubt the wave of publicity in this case will force the government into a U-turn. This government has made so many already it is a miracle that Theresa May isn’t permanently dizzy. But the underlying dynamic will not change, as the recent Windrush affair demonstrated all too well: this government is either incapable of, or unwilling to, treat citizens’ rights with respect, especially those who have their origins abroad. This is the life in Britain that my family of five rejected: we chose not to spend our life in complete and utter insecurity over our rights and future status: the Dutch are among those EU citizens who would have to give up their national passport in order to acquire a British one – meaning that after Brexit I would lose not only the right to live and work in 27 EU states, but also the right to a dignified death that Dutch euthanasia laws allow. (And, of course, the Netherlands is almost 25% richer per capita than Britain.) But worst of all, we could not be sure that we would even have qualified for that British passport – meaning total insecurity about the university fees for our children, and about their status when applying for jobs later in life. The same holds for our rights to social security and access to the NHS – if the NHS survives Brexit, that is. Such insecurity might last for years, if not decades, considering that almost two years after the referendum result the British government still does not even have a position on what it would like the country’s relationship with the EU to be. Given the Tories’ woeful ineptitude, deluded thinking and many deceitful statements, it is also becoming increasingly hard to see how the EU could take any British position on good faith. How to reach an agreement when you cannot trust the other side to uphold it? For EU citizens in Britain there is no certainty about when the insecurity about their status might be settled. Still, there are moments when I think that it was a mistake to move. London was such a great place to live, and our state school offered such excellent education. But then I remember just how many EU nationals have already left Britain, and how many are in advanced stages of leaving. The same is true of a number of British friends, who are fanning out across continental Europe. To kill any remaining longings for a return to the UK I then go online once more to browse the billionaire-owned Brexit press. This is my way of reminding myself just how psychopathically vile and mendacious most of the UK press still is. Once Britain begins to pay the full economic, political and diplomatic price for what it recklessly voted for in June 2016, the Brexit media will not throw up their hands and beg for forgiveness for all their lies, falsehoods and empty promises. Instead they will blame lots of British individuals and institutions, but most of all they will direct their anger and hostility towards one place in particular: the EU. Do I want to expose my children to the tabloid propaganda about EU aggression towards poor Brexit Britain, and the way it will be pumped into the heads of millions of Brits – including some in the school playground? I still miss Britain every day.

Meghanomics","bodyText":"There’s nothing quite like a royal wedding to get the British to part with their cash, so in one respect the idea that the new Duchess of Sussex could be good news for the economy is a statement of the blindingly obvious. Retailers have had a tough time recently, and a bit of Meghanmania was just what they needed to get the tills ringing. Interest in the newest member of the royal family will linger longer than the feelgood factor. People are clearly fascinated by her backstory and take notice of what she thinks. Role models are important, and just as it matters that Christine Lagarde sees fighting for women’s rights as a vital part of her job as head of the International Monetary Fund, so it matters that the Duchess of Sussex calls herself a feminist and wants to champion female empowerment. Feminism is an economic issue. Plenty of explanations have been canvassed for Britain’s recent woeful productivity record: too little investment, poor infrastructure, insufficient spending on research and development, too many low-paid, low-skilled jobs, weak management and a long tail of under–performing firms among them. Strangely, the one that gets the least attention is the failure to utilise fully the skills of the available workforce. Women outperform men in higher and further education, yet their talents are being wasted. Women and men are not equal partners in the workplace and the gap between them remains large despite some progress in recent decades. A report by McKinsey in 2015 said that advancing women’s equality could add $12tn a year to the world economy – equivalent to the economies of Britain, Germany and Japan combined. As David Coates says in his new book, Flawed Capitalism, an enormous pool of human capital is being squandered because of sexist cultures, glass ceilings and economic structures that make it hard for women. The evidence for this starts right at the top of British society. Five out of 21 permanent secretaries in Whitehall are women; there is one women out of nine members on the Bank of England committee that sets interest rates; there has never been a female chancellor or cabinet secretary. When Moya Greene steps down from the Post Office in the summer, there will be just six women running FTSE 100 companies. The Labour governments from 1997 to 2010 sought to address gender issues in the economy in a number of ways: through the tax and benefits system, by introducing a national minimum wage, by providing financial help with childcare, and by making maternity pay more generous. Many of those gains have been rolled back over the past eight years. Tax credits have been made less generous; Sure Start centres have been closed; and job cuts in the public sector have disproportionately affected women. Austerity has had a gender dimension. Meanwhile, the way in which workplaces are organised is unfit for purpose in an age in which brains are more important than brawn. Childcare remains a big problem. The gender pay gap will never be closed while women take most of the responsibility for childcare, because they are out of the workplace in their 20s and 30s and lose out on promotion to men who are often less qualified to do the job. Many parents make the choice to look after their young children, but incentives for women to get back to work quickly after having children are weak, because expensive childcare combined with low wages means that the sums simply don’t add up. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has said the cost of childcare as a share of wages is higher in the UK than in any other rich developed nation. As a consequence, many women take the decision to look after their young children rather than return to work. There is an obvious solution to this problem – a nationwide system of universal free childcare that would start from when a child is six months old. On the face of it, this would be an expensive commitment, although the Women’s Budget Group says it would pay for itself. Upfront costs are certainly high – £33bn a year if the staff hired to run the scheme were paid at current wage rates, and £55bn a year if they were paid the same salaries as primary school teachers. But this assumes that all parents would take up the offer immediately, which they almost certainly wouldn’t. A more realistic cost, as suggested by the Women’s Equality party, would be £28bn a year, which would be offset by the additional revenue the exchequer could expect to get. More women would be working, so income tax and national insurance receipts would go up. The new entrants to the workforce would have more money to spend and so extra VAT would be paid. Finally, the bill for benefits would go down. In all, the Women’s budget group says this adds up to just under £27bn a year. If the government plumped for the more expensive £55bn a year option, the Women’s equality party says, it could raise £28bn by introducing a single rate of pension tax relief at about 25%, postponing further cuts to corporation tax, unfreezing fuel and alcohol duties, and reallocating the money it already spends on childcare and early education. The wider economy would also benefit because better-educated and better-qualified women could be expected to make smarter decisions than men, if only they were in a position to make them. Recent trends are perfectly illustrated by the Harry and Meghan match. He struggled at school and went off to join the army rather than go to university; she got a double major in theatre and international relations and has had a successful acting career. If the monarchy were abolished and the members of the royal family had to fend for themselves, there’s little doubt which of the couple would be the more reliable breadwinner. • Larry Elliott is the Guardian’s economics editor • This article was amended on 24 May to include references to the Women’s Equality party"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/may/24/obese-patients-more-likely-to-survive-infection-in-hospital","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T22:01:29Z","webTitle":"Obese patients more likely to survive infection in hospital","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/24/obese-patients-more-likely-to-survive-infection-in-hospital","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/24/obese-patients-more-likely-to-survive-infection-in-hospital","fields":{"headline":"Obese patients more likely to survive infection in hospital","bodyText":"Obesity can shorten lives, but obese people who are hospitalised for infectious diseases, pneumonia and sepsis have a better chance of surviving than those who are of normal weight, according to new research. The so-called “obesity paradox” was illustrated by three separate presentations at the European Congress on Obesity in Vienna. A study of more than 18,000 people admitted to hospital with an infectious disease in Denmark found those who were overweight were 40% less likely to die, and those who were obese 50% less likely to die, than those of normal weight. A second study using data from 1.7m hospital admissions for pneumonia in the United States in 2013 to 2014 found that overweight patients were 23% more likely to survive and obese patients 29% more likely to survive than those of normal weight. Other data from the US in patients with sepsis – blood poisoning – found a similar pattern. In more than three million hospital admissions, overweight patients were 23% less likely to die and obese patients 22% less likely to die than those of normal weight. Sigrid Gribsholt from Aarhus University hospital department of clinical epidemiology in Denmark led the research in the first study, on people admitted with infectious diseases during 2011-2015 in the Central Denmark Region. They looked at the risk of death within 90 days of entering hospital and made allowances for people who smoked or had other medical conditions. Gribsholt said there were two reasons obese people might be more likely to survive. One is that obesity causes inflammation which invokes a strong response from the immune system – which could help people recover from infection. The second is that people who are obese are less likely to experience wasting as a result of their disease. “They have larger energy reserves, which may also be protective,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/23/guatemala-ex-military-officers-convicted-of-crimes-against-humanity","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T16:57:30Z","webTitle":"Guatemala: ex-military officers convicted of crimes against humanity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/23/guatemala-ex-military-officers-convicted-of-crimes-against-humanity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/23/guatemala-ex-military-officers-convicted-of-crimes-against-humanity","fields":{"headline":"Guatemala: ex-military officers convicted of crimes against humanity","bodyText":"Four former high-ranking Guatemalan military officers once considered untouchable have been convicted of crimes against humanity. They were also found guilty of aggravated sexual abuse against a young activist, Emma Guadalupe Molina Theissen, one of a small number of civilians who escaped army custody during the country’s 36-year civil war. Three of the officers – the former head of the armed forces, Benedicto Lucas García, former intelligence chief Manuel Antonio Callejas y Callejas and local commander Hugo Ramiro Zaldaña Rojas – were also found guilty of the forced disappearance of Emma’s 14-year-old brother Marco Antonio and sentenced to 58 years’ jail by the court for high-risk crimes in Guatemala City. The Molina Theissen family have been searching for Marco Antonio since 6 October 1981, when he was bundled into a sack by military officers and driven away. The Guatemalan state admitted responsibility for grave crimes against the Molina Theissen family in 2000, but it has taken 37 years for the perpetrators to be brought to account. Wednesday’s verdict was hailed by anti-impunity campaigners as it is the first time senior military officers have been prosecuted for serious human rights violations since the 2013 genocide verdict against the former dictator Efraín Ríos Montt was sent back to trial. Jo-Marie Burt, associate professor at the Schar school at Virginia’s George Mason University, who has been monitoring the trial, said: “The significance of this sentence cannot be overstated. It shows that Guatemalan justice system has not bowed under pressure from powerful military and economic elites to end human rights prosecutions. The perpetrators must tell the Molina Theissen family the truth about what happened to their beloved son.” The crimes took place as part of the military junta’s “national security doctrine”. Key to this were counterinsurgency operations used to detain, torture for information, and then kill or “disappear” people regarded as the internal enemy – suspected communists, critics of the military dictatorship and activists. At the time, senior military officers received training at the School of Americas and in Argentina. Molina Theissen was captured in September 1981. The then 21-year-old social and political activist was then taken for interrogation to a clandestine base in Quetzaltenango, western Guatemala, known as MZ17 (military zone 17). She was deprived of food, beaten, given electric shocks and raped. When she refused to help identify other suspected subversives, the torture intensified. But Molina Theissen managed to escape, causing embarrassment to military intelligence. Her family had been under surveillance since 1955, the year after the CIA-backed coup, and were designated “internal enemies”. The following day, a raid was organised to recapture the escapee at home. When they could not find her, her brother was taken instead. Marco Antonio is one of an estimated 5,000 children forcibly disappeared by the military during the internal conflict, according to the Truth Commission. “Enforced disappearance was used as a weapon of war, just like a rifle or a bullet,” according to historian Marc Drouin, an expert prosecution witness. In court, the victims’ mother, Emma Theissen Álvarez de Molina, pointed at Zaldaña Rojas as one of the men who took away her son. “That is him. His face is forever recorded in my memory.” The defence sought to cast doubt on Molina Theissen’s escape from military detention. In a moving testimony, she said: “The fact that I escaped is not just unusual, it is very unusual, because otherwise, there would not be 45,000 victims of enforced disappeared in this country. “They did not kill me, but what they did profoundly destroyed my life … The fact that by escaping I had managed save my own life filled me with pride, but this became my worst mistake … because it resulted in the kidnapping and the disappearance of my little brother.” Former MZ17 commander Francisco Luis Gordillo Martínez was sentenced to 33 years for crimes against humanity. His number two, the retired colonel Edilberto Letona Linares, was absolved of all charges."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/27/carry-on-brussels-a-very-english-scandal-humans-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T06:00:18Z","webTitle":"The week in TV: Carry on Brussels; A Very English Scandal; 24 Hours in Police Custody; Humans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/27/carry-on-brussels-a-very-english-scandal-humans-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/27/carry-on-brussels-a-very-english-scandal-humans-review","fields":{"headline":"The week in TV: Carry on Brussels; A Very English Scandal; 24 Hours in Police Custody; Humans","bodyText":"Carry on Brussels (C4) | All 4 A Very English Scandal (BBC One) | iPlayer 24 Hours in Police Custody (C4) | All 4 Humans (C4) | All 4 Among Nigel Farage’s many traits, one has been his capacity, even amid all the sly dissembling and slithery fearmongering, for sudden bursts of appalling, appealing, refreshing honesty. It almost endears him even to his legions of detractors. So it was little surprise to hear him, at the start of a nakedly revealing three-parter on the EU, saying of that institution: “In some ways I’m going to miss it. I’ve had a hell of a lot of fun doing this… it’s been terrific!” And there you have it: Brexit has been a game, a joke, a dream. Fine. Can we wake up now? Carry on Brussels was arguably too jokey a title for a programme looking, essentially, at Brexit since the vote, as it affects seven immensely disparate British MEPs. As the cameras – which have been filming there since spring 2017 – rolled on, however, it became clear that it might be horribly apt. I came as close as I ever will to accepting Farage’s argument that the Brussels experiment is one huge, mismanaged shudder of dysfunctionality. There was the crazed, pointless monthly decamping to Strasbourg, where poor Emily Stewart, assistant to staunch Remainer Seb Dance (Lab), only had access to a Bulgarian keyboard (no question mark key: she had to cut and paste from random emails). At a less trivial level, the dreadful dance that passionate, tearful Mr Dance had to go through, a dark ballet of compromise between the insanities and inanities of far right and far left in the sprawl of Europe, to pass any bill, even – perhaps especially – one that satisfies precisely no one. If Brussels/Strasbourg were out-dysfunctioned by any one institution, that would be Ukip. Gerard Batten, the party’s Brexit spokesman, was one dour, angry antihero; press officer and Derryman Hermann Kelly another, though the two could have been on opposite sides. Kelly was battling to explain to Batten how his 120-page Brexit plan was not only unprintable (they didn’t have the budget) but, basically, really boring. It is something of a marvel, in hindsight, how Ukip, ever riven by infighting, actually managed to scare the Tories into that referendum; one that is actually removing from Europe, lest we forget, the third-largest representative nation. Meanwhile, Nigel chortles on. If you watch one thing about Brexit this sixmonth – and let’s face it, most of us run bawling for the hills at the overlong near-nightly reports about incremental twitches – do watch this series. Jeremy Thorpe – for younger voters, and for older centrists who are still “blocking”, as I believe the Americans say, he was once the charismatic leader of the Liberal party, with a good chance at PM – would have had conniptions at Brexit. At his height, would have made effortlessly stylish, witty rejoinders in the house. One of the little tragedies unearthed by A Very English Scandal is the loss of a fearless and fearsome orator, who took on various causes – anti-hanging, pro-immigration, pro-Europe – very much not shared by his constituents. There is little doubt this three-part series will win awards. And, screenwritten by Russell T Davies from John Preston’s fine book, directed by Stephen Frears, and featuring an utterly captivating Hugh Grant as Thorpe, it will deserve them, mostly: Grant, in particular, brings a lugubrious playfulness that still haunts. Even his windmilling arms (something of a trademark for Grant, as is his sudden gauche grin) are given new gravitas, coming as they do with real power, real threat – and real snobbery. If I had doubts about the opener, it was in terms of tone. There is no doubt that much of the real story bordered on farce, not least the dog-shootery. But this first episode bordered not on the farce of little tragedies but the farce of (at times, dare I say it) Ray Cooney. It’s still splendid, it’s still hugfully witty, and gives very much the sense of the times, but I almost find myself hoping it’s less… fun from now on. After all, we’re still talking about the persecution, to blackmail, and often to suicide, of gay men in just-about-recent memory; and fragile mental health; and how much powerful men think they can get away with. I wonder whether the team behind this will conclude that Norman Scott was a poor, exploited soul or a lazy charlatan who steadfastly ruined, over a decade, a politician with the potential of a colossus. L’affaire Thorpe has long been viewed by the establishment with a certain ribald hilarity – Auberon Waugh’s take was famously “Jeremy, Jeremy, bang, bang, woof, woof” – but times, do they not, change? Bizarrely, given that this was a true (and awful) story, there was also an element of high farce to this week’s 24 Hours in Police Custody, an ever-enthralling slice of watchability. Dean Robinson, taken in for the murder of his partner, Sharon Fade, accepted his arrest almost with a tut and annoyed shrug. He gassed away with the Bedfordshire police about his flexibility as a runner: if they wanted a DNA sample, he tried to joke, given that his fingernails were terribly short, he could give them a sample of his toenails. “I could bite them off for you.” His entire air was appallingly misjudged – Sharon had just been found on waste ground, her throat cut with a broken bottle – but the police, studiously, stoically, declined to leap to judgment. Rightly so. What emerged was the sad tale of a Walter Mitty man coupled with a fragile, suicidal, abusive, alcoholic woman. Dean, for all his braggadocio, was in the end a poor soul trying to care for a quite hopelessly lost cause. I was left suffused with admiration, for the police’s even-handedness and for the programme makers’ astonishing access, and almost broken by the thought of the desperation that must have led Sharon to slash her own neck with a jaggy bottle. Humans, back for a third series, has never exactly shied from parallels, but this week’s metaphors could not have been clearer had they been DayGlo’d on a Brexit bus. “We have an emergency… a large number of green-eyes are gaining access to the country by sea.” The Brits are working out a strategy for dealing with the rebellious “synths”. “Some other countries have outlawed the lot. At the other end of the spectrum, the Swedes are trialling integration.” I get it: s’all about immigration, otherness, innit? Having said that, after a ropey, confusing second series, we’re now seemingly back on track, with the government dithering between hardcore and harder-core, and angry Ukip yokels even attacking the safe (orange-eyed) servant synths. And we now have Mark Bonnar as a cool and groovy behavioural psychiatrist, and we still have Gemma Chan, and all is well."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/24/fears-puffins-die-out-farne-islands-numbers-plummet","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T23:01:36Z","webTitle":"Fears puffins could die out on Farne Islands as numbers plummet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/24/fears-puffins-die-out-farne-islands-numbers-plummet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/24/fears-puffins-die-out-farne-islands-numbers-plummet","fields":{"headline":"Fears puffins could die out on Farne Islands as numbers plummet","bodyText":"Puffin numbers at one of Britain’s most important habitats have fallen sharply, raising fears they could die out completely there within a century. Every five years National Trust rangers carry out a census of the birds on the Farne Islands, and the latest survey has potentially grim news for the colourful seabird. The numbers have been reduced by 12% on average from the 2013 census, with one island’s population falling by 42%. Puffin records on the Northumberland coast archipelago date back to 1939 when 3,000 breeding pairs were recorded, and every census until 2008 showed a steady increase in pairs. But in 2008 numbers fell by a third, from 55,674 to 36,835. This is thought largely due to the impacts of climate change. Numbers recovered slightly, according to the 2013 census, which found 39,962 breeding pairs. Tom Hendry, a ranger, said: “Initial findings are concerning. Numbers could be down due to stormy or wetter weather as well as changes in the sand eel population, which is one of their staple foods. “So far we’ve surveyed four of the eight islands where we conduct the census. Figures from the two largest islands are vastly contradictory, with numbers on Brownsman 42% down, while recordings on Staple show an 18% increase. We will now do some further investigations as to why this might be. “Predictions have been made that within the next 50 to 100 years these stunning birds will have completely died out on the Farne Islands. The Icelandic population in particular is really struggling, with exceptionally low productivity for over 10 years. “The monitoring of puffin numbers worldwide is therefore really important to discover whether the species can continue to survive.” To conduct the survey, the rangers arrange grids on the most populated islands to determine the best locations and to cover different habitat types. Harriet Reid, another ranger, said: “We then put a stake in the middle of each plot and put a piece of string five metres long out, and use that diameter to check all the burrows around the central stake. We will also do a full census on the least populated islands, looking at every burrow. “We’ll be looking out for the first birds with fish in their beaks, a sure sign their burrows are occupied by hungry pufflings. We also look for external signs around the burrow to determine whether puffins are using it – such as fresh digging, puffin footprints, clearance of vegetation at the burrow entrance, hatched eggshells, or fish or guano in the entrance. “If we are unsure, it’s only on this occasion that we’ll put our arm down the burrow to gently and carefully feel for any occupants. We then carefully record our findings.” The puffin was given “vulnerable” status in 2015 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature when worldwide numbers dropped and is also on the British Trust for Ornithology’s “red list” for species of conservation concern in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/27/china-taking-digital-control-of-its-people-to-unprecedented-and-chilling-lengths","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T06:00:18Z","webTitle":"China is taking digital control of its people to unprecedented and chilling lengths | John Naughton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/27/china-taking-digital-control-of-its-people-to-unprecedented-and-chilling-lengths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/27/china-taking-digital-control-of-its-people-to-unprecedented-and-chilling-lengths","fields":{"headline":"China is taking digital control of its people to chilling lengths","bodyText":"Watching Donald Trump trying to deal with China is like watching a clown dancing in front of an elephant. The US president’s entire approach is transactional – the methodology he employed in his allegedly successful career as a property developer. It’s all sticks and carrots, bluff and counter-bluff, aggressive bluster followed by rapid retreats. Sometimes, it appears to work. For example, the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, clearly leant on Kim Jong-un to force him to agree to a summit meeting with Trump. But then Xi leant on Trump to rescue the Chinese tech company ZTE, brought to its knees by a US ban because it had evaded sanctions on trade with Iran. Trump duly complied and ZTE executives breathed again. And so it goes on. But behind these scenes a much bigger long‑term game is being played out. If it were a board game, it would be called Hegemony. (drat: a quick search reveals that there are already games on this theme.) Hegemony is an old concept, much beloved of Marxists, coined to describe the (military or cultural) predominance of one country or group over others. From the mid-1940s until 1990, the world was overshadowed by two hegemons – the US and the USSR. After the Soviet Union imploded, the US became the sole global hegemon. But now, with the rise of China, that hegemonic grip seems to be loosening. The big issue, then, is whether we are witnessing a tectonic shift in geopolitics. My guess is that we are. Trump, who has the attention span of a newt, probably can’t see what’s going on, but the Chinese do – and so too do many parts of the US government, notably those concerned with economic development and national security, and some of the more reflective members of Congress. What these folks understand is that hegemonic power is largely about industry – and therefore about technology. And the dominant industries of the future will be dominated by information technology rather than by heavy industries such as steel and cars. Which is why there is now so much panic in the US about allegedly wholesale theft of intellectual property by Chinese agencies and the astonishing progress that the country is making in computing and artificial intelligence. In the old days, western snobbery led to the complacent view that the Chinese could not originate, only copy. One hears this less now, as visitors to China return goggle-eyed at the extent to which its people have integrated digital technology into daily life. One colleague of mine recently returned exasperated because he had been expected to pay for everything there with his phone. Since he possesses only an ancient Nokia handset, he was unable to comply and had been reduced to mendicant status, having to ask his Chinese hosts to pay for everything. If the future is digital, therefore, a significant minority of China’s 1.4 billion citizens are already there. More significantly, the country’s technocratic rulers have sussed that digital technology is not just good for making economic transactions frictionless, but also for implementing sophisticated systems of social control. In particular, they are adapting the ubiquitous “reputation rating” system by which online platforms try to get feedback on vendor and customer reliability. The government is beginning to roll out its social credit system, which is designed to “raise the awareness of integrity and the level of trustworthiness in Chinese society”. It will focus on four aspects of behaviour: “honesty in government affairs”, “commercial integrity”, “societal integrity” and “judicial credibility”. When first conceived in 2007, the intention was to replicate the credit rating systems common in the west for assessing people’s financial creditworthiness. But why, thought the Chinese, stop at finance? Why not use the technology to assess how “good” a citizen one is? Everyone starts off with a baseline allowance of, say, 100 points. You can earn bonus points by doing “good deeds” such as separating and recycling rubbish. On the other hand, behaving in what is regarded (by the state) as antisocial behaviour can lose you points. Examples of deductible behaviour can apparently include: not showing up at a restaurant without cancelling your booking, cheating in online games, leaving false product reviews and even jaywalking. And if your social credit score is too low, you find yourself barred from taking flights or travelling on certain trains. As a way of using digital technology for social control, this takes some beating. There are already pilot systems in operation. The Chinese plan to have the system fully in place by 2020. By which time it will be ready for export to other countries – who will be queueing up to buy it, because one of the things states do is to buy the current hegemon’s technology. In 2020, though, Donald Trump will still be ranting on about steel dumping and import tariffs. And running for a second term. What I’m reading Four Seasons retreat Weaponised Bach?

They were on a night out in Koh Phi Phi, the Thai island group made famous by the film The Beach, and where the storied Maya Bay will close this June to enable its recovery following unsustainable levels of tourism. In awe, they watched the man pour liquid on to a cold grill and, using a pair of paddles, turn it into ice-cream while a crowd filmed the process. After a swim, the pair, now both 23, had the moonshot idea to bring it to the UK. Their first stall was a gazebo, but they currently have four outlets in the UK, some in a pink and blue Citroën CV van, under the name Pan-n-Ice, which sounds like boyband but is actually an accurate description of how the stuff is made. First, a creamy, milk-heavy base is poured on to a -30C metal plate. Toppings are added and, using two spatulas, the mix is chopped and spread into a paste. This is then scraped into small cigar-shaped rolls and stacked in a pot. It is pretty standard in Thailand, Malaysia and Cambodia. Pan-n-Ice make about 500 a day on the weekend; most variations cost less than £4, which is bang for your buck given the manpower. The whole process, which takes about 90 seconds, looks like an extended gif – so while its success could partly be down to their spellbinding Instagram feed, I would hazard that it’s the weirder, more private subgenre of “oddly satisfying” videos that have given it a boost. I devour these videos, which fetishise tactile processes such as slicing melons, crushing goo, squeezing warm wax or extracting blackheads. They pinball from satisfying to hypnotic to borderline carnal, depending on what you’re into. But back to Pan-n-Ice: toppings vary, and you can bring your own; the Ice Cream Rolls YouTube channel provides solid inspiration. There has been at least one version made with chicken nuggets, another with fries and ketchup. Because it is now food law, Huysinga has made it with avocado. Because of the banter, he has also made it with dog biscuits. My first try was with Oreos and chocolate sauce. I wanted to hate it but couldn’t. It was narcotic to watch the flattening and the rolling, and the result was delicious, with a lightly whipped texture. Crushing the little cigars is certainly oddly satisfying. In the spirit of things, I also ordered the “Mess that was Eton” – strawberries, raspberries and meringue. Was the concoction designed as a takedown of the patriarchal establishment? Or a sly dig at their school, perhaps? Neither: “I played them a few times at rugby,” said Huysinga. “And by the end of it they were definitely a ‘mess that was Eton’.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"news/2018/jun/19/weatherwatch-midsummer-a-hotly-contested-concept","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T09:10:24Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: midsummer - a hotly contested concept","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/19/weatherwatch-midsummer-a-hotly-contested-concept","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jun/19/weatherwatch-midsummer-a-hotly-contested-concept","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: midsummer – a hotly contested concept","bodyText":"We call it “midsummer”, yet midsummer’s day – this Sunday 24 June – traditionally marks the start, not the middle, of the summer season. In my view, this is down to a linguistic confusion. Just as the word “midwife” has nothing to do with middle (it derives from the German word “mit”, meaning “with”, and so refers to a person attending a woman giving birth), so surely “midsummer” means “with summer” – the first day of the new season? Either way, the start of summer depends both on where you live and that particular year’s weather. On a visit to Shetland in mid-June 2015 I recall the weather feeling more like late winter than summer, with temperatures struggling to reach double figures. Last year, on the other hand, midsummer was one of the warmest periods of the year. In 1976, it marked the start of the longest period of above-average temperatures ever recorded in the UK, topping the magic 90F (32C) mark for 15 days in a row.

Or, as my wife calls it, the wanker van,” smirks Clive, a 61-year-old retired teacher from the Midlands. There’s a reason why Clive’s vehicle has no windows in the back. In order to get the freshest possible product to his customers, he pulls up directly outside their houses, clambers into the back and, 20 minutes later, appears on their doorstep with a full syringe and a serene expression. Gird yourselves, ladies and gents, for Four Men, 175 Babies: Britain’s Super Sperm Donors (Tuesday, 10pm, Channel 4), a film that examines the gloopy world of unregulated sperm donation. Eagle-eyed viewers will notice that women don’t figure in the title of this show – which is best watched with a sick bucket nearby – despite their rather critical role in the baby-making process. Their appearance in this cock-eyed investigation is secondary to the narcissistic creeps who zigzag the country jizzing into plastic pots in order to create their own mini master-race. On average, Clive makes 14 donations a month and reckons to have given 500 deposits to strangers. He travels up to 80 miles to make his deliveries, which means that, were he to have fathered 500 children, the gene pool in his part of the country would be alarmingly narrow. This doesn’t bother Clive, who, lest we forget, is on a mercy mission. That he doesn’t charge for his services means, in his eyes, that he’s up there with the Messiah. “Being a sperm donor is being a Samaritan,” he says. Another self-styled Samaritan, Mark, has thus far fathered 54 babies, and has nine more in the pipeline. Several years ago, feeling “under-used” after having his own children, he visited a series of licensed clinics but was turned down on account of his age, and so decided to go it alone. “I want to reproduce with as many women as possible and pass on the genetic characteristics that I have,” he says. And so we watch Mark, who in another life would make an excellent dictator, visit a young woman who, having already had one baby with him, now wants a second. Observing his first child, Emilie, he notes: “She’s got the wonderful blue eyes that all my babies have.” Oof. How did we get to a place where women are accepting the seed of middle-aged strangers rather than visiting official clinics? And what does this mean for their children? Alas, this film isn’t interested in finding out. While there are brief encounters with women as they take grateful delivery of the fluids, Britain’s Super Sperm Donors is firmly about the male end of the bargain. Amazingly, despite the health dangers posed to women and their babies by these rogue traders, and the potentially tortuous issue of parental rights, what they are doing is still legal. Theirs is an exercise in power over often-vulnerable women, and a clammy affirmation of their virility. This much is clear when Clive, whose strike rate has dipped lately, finally scores a pregnancy with a woman who had previously tried, and failed, with Mark. Clive’s first thought is to text Mark with the good news. “The magic’s still there, it’s still happening,” he beams from his wanker van. Pride pitifully restored, off he drives, a eugenics hero ready to spread his seed again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2018/may/25/weatherwatch-whit-monday-extremes-snow-heat-flood","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T20:30:36Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: Whit Monday extremes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/25/weatherwatch-whit-monday-extremes-snow-heat-flood","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/may/25/weatherwatch-whit-monday-extremes-snow-heat-flood","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: Whit Monday can blow hot or cold","bodyText":"It’s a bank holiday weekend – again – so we are primed to expect bad weather. And it’s true that some late May bank holidays have been rather poor, weatherwise. Following a very harsh winter, May 1891 began quite promisingly, with fine, sunny weather across much of the country. By 11 May, a blocking anticyclone allowed temperatures to rise to a sweltering 27.2C. But the good weather did not last: that year the Whitsun holidays fell very early – on Bank Holiday Monday, 18 May, snow fell across much of Britain, with heavy falls from Norfolk to Yorkshire. Night frosts destroyed fruit and vegetable crops, while daily maximum temperatures struggled to reach an unseasonably chilly 8C. In Devon and Cornwall, there were hailstones the size of marbles. In complete contrast, the later Whitsun bank holiday of 1944 (29 May) was the warmest and sunniest on record. Temperatures peaked at almost 33C (over 91F), the hottest day of the year, and the hottest May bank holiday ever. This gave rise to heavy storms and floods, especially in the Yorkshire town of Holmfirth. Of course, it couldn’t last.

Trump’s comments come one day after he said he was “not satisfied” with the trade talks that have become stressed on the US side by an apparent lack of coordination among administration officials. According to a New York Times report published on Monday, the strained relationship between the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the National Trade Council director, Peter Navarro, devolved into a shouting match in front of Chinese officials on a trip to Beijing earlier this month. The stock markets reacted further to the president’s latest comments, with the Dow Jones dropping 120 points in early trading. In trading on Tuesday, the index dropped 300 points. Market analyst Capital Economics said in a note that the vague agreement for China to reduce tariffs on US auto imports and to purchase more agricultural and energy products would do little to address underlying trade tensions. “The deal will have little impact on the bilateral deficit with China and a minimal impact on the overall deficit. Nor does it address long-standing (and increasingly vocal) complaints that many US firms are forced to transfer technologies and cede ownership to Chinese partners in return for market access, which prompted the trade investigation into China in the first place.” Accordingly, the paper concluded, “tensions over trade policy will almost certainly flare up again in the coming months”. Several administration officials were then obliged to walk back optimistic comments that China would agree to cut its trade surplus with the US by $200bn, largely by increasing US imports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/02/sabrina-nick-drnaso-review-graphic-novel","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T06:44:51Z","webTitle":"Sabrina by Nick Drnaso review – an extraordinary graphic novel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/02/sabrina-nick-drnaso-review-graphic-novel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/02/sabrina-nick-drnaso-review-graphic-novel","fields":{"headline":"Sabrina by Nick Drnaso review – an extraordinary graphic novel","bodyText":"The cartoonist Nick Drnaso has produced an extraordinary – and extraordinarily upsetting – novel. His first book, Beverly, a collection of interrelated short fiction published in 2016, announced him as a writer of keen attentive-ness to the present moment, offering a fresh, kaleidoscopic view on contemporary life that called to mind the films of Todd Solondz or the writing of George Saunders; Beverly won an LA Times book prize. His second book, which Zadie Smith has called “a masterpiece”, is, appropriately, twice as good. And given that Drnaso is only 29 this year, it offers a rather formidable calculus by which to anticipate the trajectory of his artistic development. Drnaso was born in the Chicago area, the setting for his first book. He opens this story there as well, with a homey scene of a homely young woman cat-sitting for her parents. Her sister, Sandra, arrives for a brief visit, reminiscing about their parents, asking about her boyfriend, and soliciting some help with a crossword puzzle. Sandra mentions an urban bus trip she took by herself when she was 19 that opened her eyes to the dangers of the world and asks her sister if she’d like to take a bicycle vacation along Lake Michigan later that summer. The two make a half-promise to do so – “That sounds great. Get out of the city. Get away from the internet,” her sister jokes – and Sandra leaves. It will be the last time Sandra sees her sister. From there, we are catapulted to a town in Colorado, where Calvin, an Air Force soldier (although he is addressed by his fellow soldiers as “airman”, he never sets foot on a plane), meets his childhood friend Teddy in the airport. He’s offering to put Teddy up for a while because, as we learn, Teddy’s girlfriend went missing a month before. Teddy, a quiet man-child who peers through shoulder-length blond hair, is shell-shocked and has little to say; Calvin’s overtures at rehydrating some flow of camaraderie between them via fragmentary memories of school and a mixtape Teddy made for him years before go nowhere. Calvin drives Teddy to his bland strip-mall encircled condominium townhouse, a home of dispiriting banality that suits the earnest vapidity of his conversation. Granting Teddy use of the room that Calvin’s daughter occupied until his recent separation from his wife, he clears stuffed toys away for Teddy to lie down on a single mattress, then excuses himself to go to work. These two scenes and locales set up the story for the next year and roughly 200 pages that follow, which I won’t spoil, other than to say a video of an apparent atrocity plays a central role. Teddy is, of course, the boyfriend of the cat-sitting girl, whose name, Sabrina, echoes through the remainder of the book with an ever-increasing resonance and horror. With Sabrina vanished, Drnaso allows himself to think the unthinkable; one’s worst fears about the disappearance of a loved one are directly addressed and, in most cases, grimly and grittily realised. He at no point lapses into cliche or sensationalism; the book is dispassionately presented – I was reminded of Flaubert’s advice to write “scientifically” – and feels as dislocatingly real as one imagines real life might be under similarly dreadful circumstances. What’s most curious and, ultimately, valuable about this book is that it is not a crime story; it’s a perspicacious and chilling analysis of the nature of trust and truth and the erosion of both in the age of the internet – and especially, in the age of Trump. Sabrina’s story develops from the uncertain, unpredictable emotions of lived experience to the micro-paranoias of clickbait with a speed and, worst of all, a familiarity that is blood-curdling. The malleability of recorded evidence, the chatroom dissection of apparent contradictions in video and news footgage and the airless metastasis of radio and online conspiracy theories all dismantle the reality of the characters with a grotesquerie and a speed that’s become unsettlingly customary in our age of mass shootings and terror attacks. Drnaso sets out his arguments expertly, even invisibly, weaving a history lesson on conspiracy theories from 9/11 to deniers of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting directly into the story itself. Again, though it is very carefully constructed – rhymes and echoes of action are spaced throughout the story like landmines. No line of dialogue is wasted – Drnaso’s story doesn’t feel “plotted”, but as though it is happening just as one feels life does, even those moments of great emotion, such as a character’s unimaginable anguish and helplessness in the face of uncertainty, or the clinical interest one can take in the prurient details of a reported crime as a distraction from the painful realities of one’s own existence. Ultimately, certain contradictions in the narrative subtly invite the reader to theorise about Sabrina’s fate, incriminating the reader and in the very process driving the story itself. The effect is all too nauseatingly routine. And the fact that the very idea of “believing one’s eyes” is under attack by digital technology that can produce confected videos of such verisimilitude that it’s undetectable, should terrify us all. “Get away from the internet,” indeed. But at least believe what you see in Drnaso’s book, because it’s a story told entirely in pictures. And you will find yourself looking carefully, trying to piece it all together. I found the experience deeply unnerving. Most especially because Sabrina is a book that looks right back at you. Chris Ware’s Monograph is published by Rizzoli. • Sabrina is published by Granta.

I hesitate in equating the read to a narcotic-fuelled high, but in recovery terms (as a recovering addict/alcoholic myself) this wonderfully precise, cogent and razor-sharp piece articulated everything that is so critically important about the serialisation of Edward St Aubyn’s books. I have heard some people asking: “Where is the relatability in this series? His mania isn’t real – he’s too posh.” And yet, as John Crace brilliantly observes, within the jaundiced and grandiose head of the addict, the surrounding world is precisely as dramatic, self-centred and in many ways as sickeningly coloured and stylised as this series suggests. As I finished Crace’s article I had tears in my eyes at how simply and deftly he described the lot of the addict. It reminded me of a useful quote I once heard from an actor friend when he had hit his own rock bottom: “You see, old boy, the lot of the addict is not too dissimilar to the lot of the actor – we are both, it seems, the biggest pieces of shit at the centres of our very own universes.” I doff my cap to Benedict Cumberbatch, who brilliantly navigates this contradictory lake of self-importance coupled with self-loathing. And thank you to John Crace for explaining perfectly why it is one of the most remarkable pieces of TV in recent years.

He was a successful soldier, an excellent athlete, good company and seemed a decent family man. His Facebook page, which he continued to update while on trial, shows him in his military finery, taking part in army expeditions and international competitions and enjoying time with children or relatives. But as Winchester crown court has heard, there was a much darker side to him than the images would suggest. Cilliers mentally bullied his wife, Victoria, cheated on her with at least two women and contacted sex workers. His love of the high life – trips abroad, smart cars, big nights out, fine clothes – left him debt-ridden. When he saw the chance of a new life with another woman, plus the opportunity to clear his debts by pocketing £120,000 in life insurance, he took it and tried to murder his wife. His first attempt was relatively prosaic. He tampered with the gas supply at the home they shared in Amesbury, Wiltshire, hoping to cause an explosion while he was out at work. When that failed, he opted for the extraordinary: he sabotaged his wife’s parachute, which resulted in her falling 4,000ft (1,200m), surviving only because of her slight frame and a landing in a soft ploughed field. Prosecutors and detectives were shocked at how calm Cilliers remained even after he came under investigation. They saw him as a cruel, cunning chancer and a pathological liar. Ian Harris, of the Crown Prosecution Service’s Wessex complex casework unit, told the Guardian: “Anyone hearing this case cannot fail to be struck by the callousness, the deliberation that went into the two attempts to murder someone he had said a few years before he would love and protect. It was a shocking betrayal. “It’s quite clear that Emile Cilliers was trying to engineer a situation where he could kill his wife, run off with his lover and collect the money from an insurance policy and have a lot of sympathy because his wife had apparently died in a dreadful accident.” Harris paid tribute to Victoria Cilliers, who has two children with Emile. “She thought she was going on a routine parachute jump. To her horror, her main parachute and her reserve failed her. She miraculously survived. When she came round she found that all her worst fears about her husband were confirmed and police had begun an investigation into whether her husband had tried to kill her. It’s been an extraordinarily difficult situation for her.” South-African-born Cilliers arrived in the UK in 2000, by which time he had two children. He worked on farms and in pubs in the UK before meeting his first wife, Carly. They married and had two children. One day he popped his head around the door of an army recruitment centre. “There and then I decided that was what I wanted to do,” he said in court. Cilliers dreamed of joining the SAS but instead completed a physical instructor’s training course, joined the Royal Army Physical Training Corps and rose to the rank of sergeant. In January 2009 he suffered a serious knee injury while skiing with the army, and at that time he said he realised his marriage was in trouble. Cilliers and Carly separated and Victoria, an army physiotherapist, helped his rehabilitation. They began dating in March 2010. Both enjoyed sport. He was a rock climber and rower as well as a skier. She was a fine parachutist with 2,600 jumps under her belt and an instructor. They married in South Africa in 2011, and Cilliers earned money to save for the wedding by packing parachutes. It was those packing skills that later meant he knew how to sabotage his wife’s parachute. The marriage did not thrive for long. Victoria Cilliers was expecting their second child when her husband met Stefanie Goller via the dating app Tinder while skiing with the army in Austria in November 2014. Cilliers lied to Goller that his marriage was over and the child his wife was expecting was not his. Cilliers was also continuing to see Carly and contacting sex workers. He arranged to meet one woman and film them having sex. He insisted this did not actually happen but explained in court he was a “very sexually active person”. Victoria Cilliers suspected he was not being faithful. In police interviews and in the witness box at Winchester crown court she described how their relationship was under pressure. “He was constantly on his phone, it was ridiculous,” she said. “I wasn’t allowed anywhere near it.” He would stay out late or away and she found condoms in the house and car. She was frightened. “I was scared, panicky, everything seemed to be going massively pear-shaped and I didn’t really understand why, I didn’t understand what I had done wrong. I felt like I was living on a timebomb, not knowing if at any point he might turn around and say ‘I’m off’.” She tried to keep the relationship alive, messaging him: “I love you so very very much and our life together and our plans for the future you are and always will be the love of my life.” On 30 March 2015 Cilliers made his first attempt to kill his wife by tampering with a gas pipe. It failed and she texted him: “Are you trying to kill me?” Cilliers brushed the idea off and asked his wife if she fancied making a parachute jump the following weekend to cheer her up. She told him she would love to. At exactly the same time he was texting Goller: “Have I told you lately that I am massively in love with the most amazing woman in the world? I want my life with you to start now.” Though she had been parachuting since she was 16 and has described the rush as being like a drug, her fragile mental state meant Victoria Cilliers was not looking forward to her jump at the Army Parachute Association at Netheravon in Wiltshire on 5 April. “I did not talk to anyone, I was quite tired and emotional by that point. I just put my goggles and my helmet on and put my head down,” she said. “I remember the pilot giving me a smile as I went out. Usually that’s the part that I love, the cold rush, the smell. And it just did not hit me.” She tried to open the main parachute but it was full of twists. She cut it away and attempted to deploy the reserve. It did not work. One witness said the reserve canopy looked like a bag of washing while another said Victoria Cilliers was being thrown around like a rag doll. “I could not figure how to slow it down,” she said. “It was just getting faster and faster and faster. The speed was unreal. The last thing I remember is trying to get some kind of control, then everything went black.” Nobody watching thought she had a chance but she survived and was airlifted to hospital with fractures to her pelvis, several vertebrae and ribs. When she woke up her husband was at her side. Cilliers exchanged hundreds of messages with Goller while sitting next to his injured wife in hospital. One said: “I can’t imagine anything like that happening to you, all I can think about is you.” Following a major operation, Victoria Cilliers told her husband she loved him. “He didn’t reply, which is harsh in that situation, really fucking harsh,” she said. She remained in hospital until 22 April. “I came home and just cried,” she said. “We just sat in silence that night, I couldn’t stop crying.” By then a police investigation had been launched. At first detectives did not know if they were dealing with an accident or crime. But experts who looked at the parachute were shocked at how tangled the lines of the main were and could not understand why two of four slinks – kit that keeps the harness attached to the parachute canopy – were missing. A US company has built and sold more than 40,000 reserve parachute canopies with slinks fitted and there have been no known issues of them failing anywhere in the world. The British Parachute Association held a board of inquiry and concluded that between 2005 and 2014 about 2,300,000 sport parachute descents were made in the UK – and there had never been an instance of both the main and reserve failing. Detectives probed Cilliers’ life and found out about his affairs and his debts. He was arrested on 28 April. They established that the parachute Victoria Cilliers used had been hired out the day before she jumped. Her husband had taken it into a toilet at Netheravon and must have sabotaged it there before storing it in a locker overnight. At the family home in Amesbury they found flecks of blood next to the gas pipe that had been tampered with and he was charged with two counts of attempted murder. In court, however, Victoria Cilliers was not always helpful to the prosecution. She said she had exaggerated some of her testimony to police to paint her husband in the worst light because she was so upset at his infidelities. It was not clear whether she believed the case against him. Clearly there are no winners. Cilliers’ six children and the women he deceived his wife with are all victims. Asked how she felt, Victoria Cilliers said: “Empty, alone, angry that all the time over the years I’ve had my little suspicions and niggles, and he has made me feel really bad and blamed my past insecurities. “My intuition was right, that makes me angry and upset. What I thought was a reasonable relationship and family, he’s just torn apart.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/09/alison-steadman-older-learning-lines-harder","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"Alison Steadman: ‘As you get older, learning lines gets harder’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/09/alison-steadman-older-learning-lines-harder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/09/alison-steadman-older-learning-lines-harder","fields":{"headline":"Alison Steadman: ‘As you get older, learning lines gets harder’","bodyText":"Sleep I am a good seven-hour person, although I find that now I am a bit older I need less.

If I’m particularly stressed learning lines, I sing along to a few songs by Nina Simone, Adele or Susan Boyle. • Alison Steadman stars in Scarlet City, now available on audible.co.uk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"culture/2018/may/23/jimmy-kimmel-brandi-chastain-plaque-artist-late-night","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T15:07:24Z","webTitle":"Jimmy Kimmel to Brandi Chastain: 'Do you know who this artist is and why he hates you?'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/23/jimmy-kimmel-brandi-chastain-plaque-artist-late-night","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/may/23/jimmy-kimmel-brandi-chastain-plaque-artist-late-night","fields":{"headline":"Jimmy Kimmel to Brandi Chastain: 'Do you know who this artist is and why he hates you?'","bodyText":"Late-night hosts discussed the daily events, including the improper use of the term “constitutional crisis” and Brandi Chastain’s bizarre plaque. Jimmy Kimmel: ‘Like a Russian powerlifter mid-squat’ This week saw football player Brandi Chastain inducted into the Bay Area Hall of Fame with a plaque that has gone viral for all the wrong reasons. “It looks nothing like Brandi at all,” Jimmy Kimmel said. “It looks more like a Russian powerlifter mid-squat.” He then interviewed Chastain about her experience, and asked her to recall what she thought when she saw it for the first time. “Something struck me as odd,” she said. Kimmel joked: “Do you know who this artist is and why he hates you?” Chastain remained in good spirits about how she’s been commemorated, saying that: “It’s been a great day of laughter.” When asked who the plaque reminded her of, she said Mickey Rooney. Kimmel then asked if she knew if it would be changed. “I’ve been in discussions with them and they’re gracious,” she said. “They obviously didn’t want this to happen.” She has also been told that she will have approval over the next attempt. Stephen Colbert: ‘It’s down with a pillow over the constitution’s face’ On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, the host started by creating a memorable mental image. “We have passed certain milestones on Trump’s highway to American greatness,” he said. “Sometimes you just have to pull the car over, get a breath of fresh air, maybe puke in the grass.” He believes that one of those moments is now after Trump called for an investigation into the investigation into him. “Some people are calling this a constitutional crisis but I don’t know about that,” he said. “A constitutional crisis technically requires that one branch of the government push back against another branch of the government. Everybody here is pushing in the same direction, and it’s down with a pillow over the constitution’s face going: ‘Sssssshhhh, it’ll be over soon.’” He then joked that the constitution has changed under Trump’s reign. “It’s gotten so bad that the opening words have gone from ‘We the people’ to ‘Help, I’ve forgotten the safe word,’” he said. Seth Meyers: ‘To put it in Catholic terms, he got moved to another diocese’ On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host covered the aides and officials who have been fired and rehired during Trump’s time in the White House. Before he became president, Trump said he would work hard to employ ferocious and mean people to get the job done. “I have to give Trump credit here,” he said. “He did warn us that he was going to hire some vicious, horrible people and he followed through.” Meyers spoke about Carl Higbie, who was originally hired as the chief of external affairs for the Corporation for National and Community Service – yet fired after hateful comments resurfaced that showed him to be a bigot. Yet despite this, he was ultimately given a job by a pro-Trump group promoting his policy agenda. “So Higbie did something terrible but instead of getting rid of him, they just moved him to a new job,” he said. “To put it in Catholic terms, he got moved to another diocese.” Meyers continued: “The guy who repeatedly said racist things about black people is still on the board that is run by the National Diversity Coalition. That’s like Charlie Sheen teaching D.A.R.E.” Similarly, Trump’s ex-assistant John McAntee was escorted off the White House premises after it was found that he was under investigation for serious financial crimes. Yet he’s now working on Trump’s re-election campaign. “So he got escorted off the White House grounds and into a promotion,” he said. “That’s like getting thrown out of a bar and the bouncer saying, ‘Get out and stay out and then come back tomorrow because you’re the manager now.’” He continued: “Trump keeps recycling these people and others because he only uses one yardstick to measure employees: are they loyal to me? And the problem with that is the kind of people who are unquestionably loyal to an ignorant bigot like Trump are pretty much always terrible people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/may/24/the-curious-incident-of-the-opossum-and-denied-time","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T11:00:50Z","webTitle":"World Cup Fiver | The curious incident of the opossum and denied time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/24/the-curious-incident-of-the-opossum-and-denied-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/24/the-curious-incident-of-the-opossum-and-denied-time","fields":{"headline":"The curious incident of the opossum and denied time","bodyText":"PERU PERUSAL News that Peru fans have been protesting in the streets against the doping ban imposed on the country’s captain, Paolo Guerrero, has got the Fiver looking forward to some thrilling attacking football from the South American side and wondering again about a vengeful marsupial. We may be extrapolating too much from the precedent set by Peru’s 1970 campaign but you knew the risks when you signed up for this guff. And the fact is that 1970 was Peru’s most successful World Cup and it, too, was preceded by popular rage against a perceived injustice – and followed by a curious incident of an opossum and denied time. In the qualifiers for the 1970 tournament Peru lost 2-1 to Bolivia in circumstances that led to the referee becoming a marked man down Lima way. The Venezuelan whistler disallowed one Peruvian goal, sent off two Peruvian players and detonated the golden age of Peruvian swearing, with new terms invented at a rate of 73 per minute just to pour scorn on the official. Even though Peru overcame that defeat and went on to play dazzling attacking football all the way to the quarter-finals, some folks remained embittered enough to smile when they read three years later about a Venezuelan cup match between Aragua and Portugesa that ended in mayhem as the same referee was accused of blowing for full-time five minutes early, leading to furious Aragua players hitting him with fists and feet and, in the case of goalkeeper Dario Castillo, reportedly with a black-eared opossum that happened to be passing. Now, the Fiver is not suggesting English referees should be thankful they aren’t good enough to have been selected for this summer’s Ethics World Cup or that there is any chance of marsupials being deployed as weapons in Russia. We’re just noting that there are good and bad ways of channelling anger and Peru seemed to get it right in 1970. Aragua, not so much. All of which brings us back to Guerrero, who is likely to miss the Ethics World Cup after the court of arbitration for sport ruled on Monday that his ban for testing positive for the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine should be extended from six to 14 months. Cas accepted the player did not seek to gain an advantage but maintained he should have been more careful, disappointing the player who had explained: “I had an anise tea in Peru because I had indigestion, and I had black tea with lemon and honey in Argentina because I had the flu. I don’t blame anyone, but the substance could have been in a jar or a cup.” Indeed, the player’s lawyers suggested there’s no way of knowing for sure when the substance invaded their client’s system, noting that remnants linger for ages if traces found in three perfectly preserved 16th century Inca mummies discovered in 1999 are anything to go by. That cut no ice with Cas, apparently. Peruvians have mobilised to persuade Fifa otherwise, as have the captains of France, Denmark and Australia. “We believe that in the interest of fairness and proportionality (…) Paolo who — as everyone agrees did not cheat — should be able to participate with, and against, his fellow professionals in the [Ethics] World Cup,” wrote Hugo Lloris, Simon Kjaer and Caltex Caltex Mile Jedinakeroo in a letter to Fifa. Guerrero even met this week with Fifa overlord Gianni Infatino – to little effect. “The Fifa president stressed the fact that the sanction had been imposed by the court of arbitration for sport, after an appeal lodged against a decision of an independent Fifa judicial body,” a Fifa wonk wibbled. In happier news, Fifa also announced this week that all of Russia’s players are clear to play at the tournament after an investigation into anti-doping violations found “insufficient evidence” of any cheating by anyone in the hosts’ squad. QUOTE OF THE WEEK “We have consulted with different experts and we decided to take actions that, to our understanding, will not prejudice Márquez” – The Mexican Soccer Federation explain that defender Rafael Márquez will train in a strip featuring no sponsors in case a training kit emblazoned with logos somehow affects a US Treasury Department investigation into him for alleged drugs trafficking.

BITS AND BOBS Michel Platini has raised his standing on the international stage by suggesting a “little trickery” was used to increase the chances of France meeting Brazil in the 1998 World Cup final. Radja Nainggolan has dispatched each and every toy from his pram in a perfect parabola after not being included in Belgium’s squad by immediately retiring from internationals. “The reason is tactical,” sniffed Bobby Martínez, whose tactics, however, do include Christian Benteke. Adrien Rabiot has told Didier Deschamps he must be off his bascule if he thinks he’ll sit on France’s standby list rather than in the main squad, and has sent the manager a snotty email to that effect. “He made a bad decision,” bof, zut-alorsed a French FA suit. England will train their squad in how to be racially abused over fears they could be targeted in Russia. Meanwhile, new England captain Harry Kane says anything other than winning the Ethics World Cup “is not good enough” so let’s see how that one unfolds. Argentina’s Sergio Romero will miss the Ethics World Cup due to knee knack, while Mauro Icardi will miss it with selection-gah after he was left off Jorge Sampaoli’s 23-man list.

Reports in Libya’s state media say Macron’s emissary has sent invitations to Gen Khalifa Haftar, the dominant military figure in the east of the country, Fayez al-Sarraj, the president of the UN-recognised government of national accord based in Tripoli, the president of the house of representatives, Aqila Saleh, and Khalid Al-Meshri, the chair of the state consultative council. The aim, according to documents leaked in Egypt, is to bring the warring factions together to agree to reopen registration for the elections for a further 30 days, back a referendum on a new constitution before or after the presidential elections, unify the Libyan central bank, and to ensure that the parties recognise they will be subject to international sanctions if they seek to disrupt a UN-verified electoral process. The groups would also agree to hold a politically inclusive national conference either inside or outside Libya in a bid to foster reconciliation after what has been constant chaos since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Formal invitations to Macron’s summit have not been sent out or confirmed by Paris, but foreign embassies have been made aware of the plan for a French mediation meeting set for 29 May. A call for elections this year does not have universal support, with the former Libyan leader Mahmoud Jibril warning a premature move could lead to the country’s partition. Jibril, who led the National Transitional Council during the uprising that toppled Gaddafi after more than four decades in power, said a UN-endorsed target of holding national polls by the end of the year was unrealistic. He told Reuters: “The country is still not ready. More unity is needed, more consensus is needed. To go for elections when the country is so divided – we are exposing the country to real partition.” At the UN this week, Russia also urged caution, saying it was concerned elections without a constitution would mean there was no legal basis for the work of national authorities after the elections. “If the parties do not agree in advance on their modalities, then the entire system of state administration in Libya may be incapacitated,” it warned. Macron brought together key political leaders last year in a move that was privately criticised by the Italians and British as an ad hoc initiative. But France is understood to be so frustrated by the slow political progress that Macron would like to force an agreement on the terms for holding parliamentary and presidential elections this year. The elections would be a test of whether the authoritarian Haftar has appeal that extends beyond Libya’s east. His often brutal anti-Islamist forces, backed by the UAE, are currently besieging the coastal town of Derna. A group of young, technocratic Libyan businessmen are drawing up an economic recovery plan to swing into action if a political breakthrough is reached. The French move comes as Italy, normally a dominant player in Libyan diplomacy, faces the distraction of forming a coalition government. At a UN security council session this week the UN’s Libya special envoy, Ghassan Salamé, admitted he had been unable to forge agreement on a revised Libyan political accord. But he said elections should still go ahead. Due to Russian objections, the UN was unable to press ahead with plans to impose UN sanctions on six Libyans believed to be involved in trafficking migrants. The US ambassador, Nikki Haley, said evidence against the six people, who were not identified, was clear and “failing to move forward with the designations would be a travesty in the face of so much global outrage over these abuses”. Salamé said Libya had to address the flow of trafficked people and goods through its borders as well as the issues of subsidies and “the severe mismatch between the official and black-market exchange rate”. “These facets provide opportunities for those few who sit at the heart of Libya’s political stalemate, plundering the nation’s coffers, resisting any actions which might challenge their predatory economy,” Salamé said. “It is this perverse economic model which must be shattered if the political process is to meaningfully progress.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jul/31/mandy-patinkin-interview-homeland-sondheim-princess-bride","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-31T14:04:40Z","webTitle":"Homeland's Mandy Patinkin: ‘Reality, for me?

Not so good’","bodyText":"“Let’s be honest,” Mandy Patinkin says. “The beard is far more loved and famous than I am.” He’s sitting in a New York apartment crowded with art and photos and antiques. (Not fussy antiques, but the chipped, comfortable, roadside-stand kind.) His beard, which starts out pepper and declines to salt, oscillates between Mephistopheles and mountain man. Today it’s somewhere in the middle. On the set of Homeland, where Patinkin is having a late-career renaissance as the CIA daddy bear Saul Berenson, Patinkin has had a dedicated beard groomer every season, except for the sixth, which was filmed in New York. “Every minute another person was touching me, and it was making me crazy,” he says. “And so I insisted – it was the only time I insisted in all the years – ‘I need one person who can do this right.’” That, he says, “was my one ‘Mandy Patinkin is difficult’ moment in my Homeland journey.” Patinkin, a tearjerker tenor, a leading interpreter of Stephen Sondheim, and for years a primetime US TV star, used to have a reputation as difficult, exacting, impossible. He won an Emmy for his work on Chicago Hope and then left the show. He walked away from Criminal Minds when he couldn’t countenance the storylines. At 65, he hasn’t exactly mellowed. He has been critical of the Trump administration and went after Ted Cruz when he learned Cruz was quoting his Princess Bride lines. His work with the International Rescue Committee has made him an outspoken advocate for refugees. (Outspoken is pretty much his default.) “Saying that you have to be afraid of these people because they’re all terrorists, it’s not even – it’s lies!” he says. “In this post-truth world, it’s lies!” The emotionalism he has always brought to his work hasn’t slackened. When he recorded Diary: January 27, 2018, the first in his new series of albums, he had to reject several takes because the feelings were too extreme. “I’m a very emotional fellow,” he says. “Good for work. Not so good for life.” (He tears up a few times during the interview, once while talking about Children and Art, a Sondheim track he’s recorded.) But experience and a behavioural therapist have taught him to make space, to do less, to keep the “Mandy Patinkin is difficult” moments to a minimum. He has just returned from a trip to Uganda, where he and his wife, the actor and writer Kathryn Grody, visited refugees, some of them fleeing the violence in South Sudan. “They would literally cut off their arm in front of you for your worst day on this planet,” he says. “And that changes you in a really long-term, rooted way. It’s not that I don’t have bad days any more, that I don’t complain, but it ain’t the same.” The pair take a trip like this every year when Homeland finishes filming. It’s an apology for escaping from the world for seven months, a way of reconnecting to reality. “I spend more time on this planet in an imagined world, than in the real world,” he says. “I’m much more comfortable in an imagined state. Reality, for me? Not so good.” The album, a collection of 10 covers ranging from Randy Newman to the Faroese songwriter Teitur to Marc Bolan, seems to live in that imagination. It’s tender, personal, largely apolitical. One exception: the plaintive Rufus Wainwright song Going to a Town, in which, with Wainwright’s permission, he substituted the word “Jerusalem” for “America”. He characterises it as “a prayer for peace”. But otherwise the music mostly ignores what he calls “a moral/ethical crisis that’s going on all over the globe”. “We’re broken,” he says. “Not just broken-hearted.” But he argues that art is different from activism. If activism is about calling attention to the problems that persist, art is about presenting possibilities and alternatives. The album, he says, is a work of “positive, hopeful, optimistic energy”. That intention seems mostly absent from Homeland, a series about a brilliant, troubled CIA operative, played by Claire Danes, that offers few hopeful lessons about the world and its workings. Its early seasons drew accusations of stoking Islamophobia. “We all spoke about correcting it. And we did correct it in future storylines,” he says. The series has reminded viewers of Patinkin’s talents – compassion, authority, gravitas – and turned him into an occasional sex symbol. (“Make that the headline,” he says. “It won’t bother me!”) It has also given him a platform for his politics, which have sometimes appeared at odds with the series’ own, though he won’t put it so bluntly. The past several seasons, which have involved an embattled American president, have had moments of overwhelming prescience, which doesn’t sit so comfortably with him. Patinkin says that over the years he has argued to Alex Gansa, the creator and showrunner, “that we are not here to be a Polaroid or a reality television show.” “We’re a fictional form,” he says. “And therefore, I think it is our obligation to create an optimistic possibility.” I ask what possibilities the final season, the show’s eighth, might offer. Maybe world peace? Not that one, he says – “but you’re not cold in terms of poetic, dramatic offerings.” Patinkin worried about how he’ll feel when Homeland ends. His family likes him better when he’s playing Saul, he says, and he knows he’ll feel unmoored without the role. It’s one of the reasons he has returned to his music – “a real anchor in my soul”. He’s finishing the second Diary album, he’s planning a 90-minute concert, he’d like to do more theatre. He quotes the final line from Sondheim’s Sunday in the Park with George: “So many possibilities.” • Diary: January 27, 2018 by Mandy Patinkin is on Nonesuch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/may/23/jordan-peterson-public-intellectual-isnt-clever-violent-men-monogamy","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T14:07:45Z","webTitle":"Jordan Peterson may be a ‘public intellectual’, but his latest theory isn’t very clever","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/23/jordan-peterson-public-intellectual-isnt-clever-violent-men-monogamy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/may/23/jordan-peterson-public-intellectual-isnt-clever-violent-men-monogamy","fields":{"headline":"Jordan Peterson may be a ‘public intellectual’, but his latest theory isn’t very clever","bodyText":"I read an interview recently in which a gentleman by the name of Jordan Peterson claimed that chaos is represented by ‘the feminine’ and order is masculine. What? Tamsin, by email At the risk of angering the many, many men who have been, online and off, urgently assuring me of Peterson’s genius for near on a year now, I never quite got it. Oh sure, the man is clever – he’ll tell you that himself. But how smart can a person be if he retweets Daily Caller articles that begin with lines such as, “Yet again, an American city is being torn about by black rioters”? If you judge a man by the company he keeps, what to make of a man whose fans include Mike “Pizzagate will be huge!” Cernovich and Sean “Did I forget to mention I’m one of Michael Cohen’s clients?” Hannity? I mean, these guys are part of America’s current intelligence blackout, so what to make of their intellectual lode star? Last weekend, the New York Times decided to find out and sent reporter Nellie Bowles to interview him and, hoo boy, did she write up a doozy of an article, one that is the very opposite to all the fanboy cant about him that fills the internet. Needless to say, his fans, shocked by the disrespect shown to their kahuna, are describing it as “a hit piece”, which is internet talk for “daring to quote his exact words and print them”. Bowles describes his house, which is filled with communist propaganda from the former Soviet Union “to remind him of oppression”. “I say it seems stressful to live like this,” Bowles writes. “He tells me life is stressful.” Life is pain, sheeple! Did you learn nothing from The Princess Bride? Further details from Peterson’s home include the revelation that “over his bed is a painting celebrating electrification in the Soviet Union. On the wall across from it is a hyper-realistic painting of two nude women with swords.” With such taste in art, it will perhaps not come as a surprise to learn that Peterson, who is married to a woman who is presumably very good at compartmentalising, has some sympathetic thoughts about men who blame their misogyny on women who don’t want to have sex with them. “Violent attacks are what happens when men do not have partners, Mr Peterson says, and society needs to work to make sure those men are married. ‘The cure for that is monogamy. That’s actually why monogamy emerges,’ [he says.] Enforced monogamy is, to him, simply a rational solution. Otherwise, women will only go for the most high-status men, he explains, and that couldn’t make either gender happy in the end. “‘Half the men fail,’ he says, meaning they don’t procreate. ‘And no one cares about the men who fail.’ “I laugh, because it is absurd. “‘You’re laughing about them,’ he says, giving me a disappointed look. ‘That’s because you’re female.’” Bowles was soon not the only person to be laughing at Peterson. Such was the reaction to her interview that Peterson felt compelled to blog about it, explaining in his usual “Look, you may not like it, but I’m just stating the scientific truth, guys” tone, that he wasn’t advocating the “arbitrary dealing out of damsels to incels”, just that scientific facts show that “socially enforced monogamous conventions decrease male violence”. How any of this explains his theory that feminine is chaos and masculine is order was left unexplored. So too were certain other scientific facts, such as that up to 70% of women globally have been abused by their partner, and two women a week in England and Wales alone are killed by former partners. No, we’re just told we should cure violent men with our magical vaginas, and if we fail to do so, our vaginas were presumably insufficiently magical. Personally, I thought everyone knew that anyone described as “a public intellectual” is clearly more about the former half of the term than the latter. But I am glad we’ve had that matter settled at last with this New York Times interview. So thank you, Nellie Bowles, and goodbye, Mr Peterson. Enjoy your time with your stressful communist art."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/live/2018/may/21/markets-ftse-100-record-us-china-trade-war-truce-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T16:27:54Z","webTitle":"FTSE 100 at record high after trade war truce, but pound hits 2018 low - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/may/21/markets-ftse-100-record-us-china-trade-war-truce-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/may/21/markets-ftse-100-record-us-china-trade-war-truce-business-live","fields":{"headline":"FTSE 100 at record high after trade war truce, but pound hits 2018 low - as it happened","bodyText":"The US-China trade truce has given a lift to stock markets at the start of the new trading week. Helped by a weaker pound, the FTSE 100 has hit a new peak, while most European markets managed to move higher. A notable exception was Italy, where investors are growing increasingly concerned about the new coalition’s plans for borrowing and its attitude to the rest of the European Union. Italian bond yields rose sharply and the stock market fell back. Dan Smith, investment analyst at Thomas Miller Investment, said: The Five Star Movement (5SM) and Lega progression in forming a coalition government has increased the level of political risk in Italy, particularly as both parties are interested in relaxing fiscal policy (government spending and taxes) – a result which will raise tensions between Italy and European institutions and raise question marks over the country’s commitment to the European Union. Overall the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 rose 1.03% to a new closing high of 7859.17 Germany’s Dax was closed for the Whit Monday holiday France’s Cac climbed 0.41% to 5637.51 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 1.52% to 23,092.38 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 1.2% or more than 300 points. On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. The FTSE 100 has finished at 7859.17, up 1.03% and a new record closing high. Earlier in the day it touched a new all time intra-day peak of 7868, on relief that the chances of a trade war between the US and China seemed to have receded. A weaker pound also helped, of course. Companies dealing with China are among the gainers in the FTSE 100, not surprisingly. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The US-China news has been excellent for the stock of Burberry and AstraZeneca, both firms with key operations in China. The fear stalking such companies has been that any wider spat between Beijing and Washington will take a chunk out of economic growth in the former. Now, fears of a hit to middle-class incomes and GDP growth have been reduced, and we have seen six-month highs in the former and an eleven-month peak in the latter. Throw in further declines for the pound and further upside looks likely. Corn prices have hit a two year high following the cooling of the trade dispute. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The prospect of more US agricultural exports to China if the communist country agrees to open up its markets helped corn prices hit a two-year high. Corn is already in a price-supportive environment of supply shortages in China, Brazil and Argentina, which make up a third of global production. The FTSE 100 could breach the 8000 barrier soon after its boost from the US-China trade news, depending on this week’s economic news. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Investors seemingly haven’t been put off by the general lack of specifics surrounding what was actually agreed between the US and China, crucial details like the extent to which America’s deficit with its rival will be reduced by and how this new trading ‘framework’ will be implemented. It helps that there has been little in the way of data or other economic news to challenge these developments for headline-dominance, allowing the markets to indulge in a bit of bullishness. That bullishness arguably most benefited the FTSE, which piggybacked on this wave of market-relief, alongside the pound’s politically fragile Brexit problems, all the way to a fresh record peak. Crossing 7850 for the first time in its history following a 1% surge, the FTSE now has 8000 in its sights – and with a pair of much-anticipated inflation and GDP readings on Wednesday and Friday respectively, the index could just get the boost it needs if sterling is dealt another dovish blow. Here’s the AP report on the latest trade developments: President Donald Trump on Monday hailed his administration’s temporary truce with China on trade, even as his Treasury secretary and China struck a note of caution on the latest agreement. After high-level talks in Washington last week, Beijing has agreed to “substantially reduce” America’s trade deficit with China. “On China, Barriers and Tariffs to come down for first time,” Trump tweeted. Farmers, he promises, will come out on top. “Under our potential deal with China, they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce,” he tweeted. Both sides, however, have said there are no guarantees trade tensions are over. China hasn’t said how much it’s willing to reduce the U.S. trade gap. The Trump administration had sought to slash the deficit by $200 billion. Also left unclear is the issue of intellectual property. The U.S. has long accused Beijing of secretly stealing U.S. technology from American businesses. Treasury Security Steven Mnuchin said Monday those issues “are part of our framework. These things cannot be fixed overnight.” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has been part of the U.S. negotiating team, is expected to go to China soon to follow up on last week’s discussions. A day after declaring the trade war “on hold,” Mnuchin told CNBC Monday that Trump is reserving the right to reimpose tariffs against Chinese goods if the two countries can’t agree on specifics to bring down the massive trade deficit with Beijing. Likewise, China’s foreign ministry said details still have to be worked out. “Given the increasing interaction between the two countries, we cannot assure you they will not encounter more frictions or disputes in the future,” said spokesman Lu Kang. The trade talks truce has given a lift to US markets, along with a spate of acquisition activity. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added more than 1% to 25,016, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.59% higher and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7%. Among technology shares, chipmakers which supply to Chinese companies were in demand after the trade news. Apart from relief that a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies had been averted, at least for the moment, US investors welcomed news that General Electric planned to merge its transportation business with rail equipment maker Wabtec. Financial shares gained ground after Fifth Third Bancorp said it would buy MB Financial for $4.7bn. Time for a summary, before the opening of Wall Street... Relief that the US and China have backed away from a trade war has sent Britain’s stock market up to a record high. The FTSE is currently up 51 points at 7830, on track for a record close. Earlier it reached an intraday high of 7851, as the City welcomed the news that Washington and Beijing have reached an agreement on trade. US secretary Steven Mnuchin has told reporters that “meaningful progress” has been made, with China promising to help close the US trade gap. However, details for the deal are yet to he ironed out. Both sides have agreed to abandon plans to raise tariffs on each other’s exports; however, tariffs could yet be imposed if the deal falls apart. Donald Trump has tweeted that China will bring down barriers preventing American firms from exporting more goods. Grain and soybean prices have risen, in a boost for US farmers. The Chinese government has also welcomed the easing in tensions. There is also quiet satisfaction in Beijing that China did not bow to pressure to cut the US trade deficit by $200bn, as Trump demanded. The US dollar has strengthened against most other currencies, including the pound, which has slumped to a new 2018 low. Sterling is bobbing around $1.34, as traders worry about Britain’s economy and the slow progress around Brexit. Steven Mnuchin has also predicted there will be “a 35 to 40% increase” in exports of US farm products to China in the near future. Here’s a clip of the Treasury secretary speaking to reporters: US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin on CNBC now. Mnuchin says the US and China made “meaningful progress” during this month’s trade talks. Both sides have agreed to suspend tariffs, he confirms, and US exports to China will increased “significantly” going forwards. Mnuchin agrees that these talks now need to be turned into a proper framework - US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross will travel to China soon to help achieve this. But what about Donald Trump’s pledge to help Chinese telecoms firm ZTE overcome sanctions imposed by America? Mnuchin denies that there was any “quid pro quo” here. The Treasury secretary also warns China that Trump can put tariffs back onto exports, if the US doesn’t get what it wants. Despite Donald Trump’s optimism, we really don’t have much detail about exactly how China will help to cut the US trade deficit. The agreement reached last weekend states that China will buy more US goods to achieve a “meaningful increases in United States agriculture and energy exports”. But with no firm target, judging whether China is delivering (and accepting enough deliveries from America) could be tricky. That’s why some experts predict that the dispute will flare up again. Vincent Chan, head of China equity research for Credit Suisse, predicts that US-China trade spats could become an annual event. He told clients: “Any expectation of a fundamental settlement of the disputes between the both sides would be unrealistic. The political and economic relationship between China and the U.S. has changed dramatically in the last few years.” President Trump is also welcoming the agreement with China - saying it will help US exporters such as farmers. President Trump has just tweeted: Chuck Schumer, a senior Democrat, warned Donald Trump last weekend not to let Chinese President Xi Jinping “play” him in trade talks. Schumer challenged Trump not to stop pushing China over the theft of American intellectual property - something the president says has been a problem for too long. Today’s rally means the FTSE 100 has now gained over 900 points, or 13%, since late March. Good news for anyone who had the foresight to buy equities then, in the face of worries over a trade war. However, this rally is partly driven by the weakness in the pound over the last month. Sterling has dropped by almost 10 cents, or 0.6%, from $1.43 to $1.34 as the government’s failure to make progress on Brexit has worried the City. American farmers are waking up to some good news - soybean and grain prices are up, thanks to the trade war truce. A bushel of soybeans is trading at $10.15 this morning, up 1.7%. Corn is up 0.8% and wheat has risen by 0.5%. Soybeans featured highly on the list of US products which China proposed imposing tariffs on. It followed up this threat by actually cancelling purchases of US soybeans, which are an important source of protein for both humans and animals. Trade tariffs are a blunt weapon that can cause self-inflicted pain, as Paul Donovan of Swiss bank UBS explains: China and the US have agreed not to increase taxes on their own consumers by avoiding tariffs for now. The agreement at the conclusion of trade talks was suspiciously light on details. The overall US trade deficit is likely to grow this year. The Chinese government has welcomed America’s decision to row back from a trade war. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters in Beijing that a consensus was good for all parties. Lu said (via Reuters): “China has never hoped for any tensions between China and the United States, in the trade or other arenas.”. Chinese media are also pointing out that this consensus was reached without any major concessions on their side. For example, the China Daily newspaper says that “Despite all the pressure, China didn’t ‘fold’”. Instead it “stood firm” and negotiated with the Trump administration - without accepting demands for a $200bn cut in the US trade deficit with China. Here’s Neil Wilson of Markets.com on today’s stock market rally: “The FTSE 100 notched up a fresh record high, rising clear of 7800 for the first time as the feel-good factor from the trade war truce bolstered risk sentiment and a weaker pound delivered the usual shot of adrenalin for the blue chips. It looks like progress on talks between China and the US means we are not about to descend into a punitive trade war. Whilst there is still long way to go and nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, there has undoubtedly been solid progress and the sense of relief in equity markets is palpable. But we must note that the FTSE’s gains of late are probably more attributable to a weaker pound as the dollar rallies across the board. The strengthening dollar is also causing pain in some emerging markets, where currencies are falling fast this morning: The weaker pound is driving shares in London to fresh record peaks. The FTSE 100 has now climbed 60 points to 7838 for the first time ever, a gain of 0.78%. Firms with large overseas earnings, such as chemicals group Johnson Matthey and advertising giant WPP, are benefiting from the fall in sterling. The truce between Washington and Beijing is also fuelling the rally, of course, even though they haven’t reached a detailed agreement. Mihir Kapadia of Sun Global Investment explains: The general positive sentiment reflects the decline of worries of a possible trade war between the U.S. and China, following weekend developments. Packaging firm Smurfit Kappa, who would have suffered from a trade war, are up 1.5%. Mining giant Anglo American is up 1.8%; it would have been hit by weaker commodity prices if new tariffs had been imposed between the US and China. Bloomberg says the British pound is suffering from Brexit angst and signs that UK growth has slowed. The main thing investors are waiting for is to see whether the latest economic figures show any upturn, after a sluggish first three months of the year when the Beast from the East snowstorm swept across the country. That could push higher the odds of an interest-rate increase as early as August by the Bank of England..... Aside from the date, the U.K. will go into the next round of Brexit talks this week against a backdrop of euro-zone turmoil as Italy’s populist coalition pushes ahead with an agenda that’s at odds with the European Union establishment. At home, backbench members of parliament are said to be preparing for an Autumn election as they anticipate defeats on Prime Minister Theresa May’s key piece of Brexit legislation. The pound has hit its lowest level since the start of the year. While traders aren’t worrying about trade wars, they are getting jittery about Brexit again. Sterling has just fallen back to $1.3397, down 0.77 of a cent, the lowest level since 28 December 2017. Foreign secretary Boris Johnson can take some credit, or rather blame. On a trip to Argentina yesterday, he issued a new challenge to prime minister Theresa May not to allow Britain to remain tied to the customs union after 2020 through a ‘backstop’ agreement. Our political editor Heather Stewart is in Buenos Aires, and explains: This backstop has been one of the sticking points in talks with the EU27 and some in Westminster believe it could become the post-Brexit norm if Brussels accepts the UK’s proposal. But Johnson insisted: “Brexiters fearing betrayal over the customs backstop must understand that the PM has been very clear that it is not an outcome we desire; we want a deal with the EU and she will deliver it.” Yesterday, the Sunday Times claimed that Conservative MPs are preparing themselves for a snap general election over fears Theresa May will not be able to break the Brexit deadlock. That would create even more political tension and uncertainty, just months before Britain’s exit from the EU. Metal prices are also getting a small lift this morning. Reuters has the details: Copper edged higher on Monday after China and the United States put their trade row “on hold”, easing concerns that the dispute could escalate, although headwinds from a stronger dollar capped further gains. “It appears that America and China have moved towards a trade deal, which will mean the expansion of U.S. goods purchased by China, and thus, avoiding the prospect of an out-and-out trade war,” said Kingdom Futures in a report. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 0.1 percent at $6,860 a tonne by 07:27 GMT, reversing small losses from the previous session. Prices have been caught in a tight $6,765-$6,900 range for the past week. The FTSE is continuing to climb to fresh record levels, putting 8,000 points in its sights (I don’t think we’ll get there today, though!). Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx says: After intermittently fretting over signs that hostile relations were heating back up between the US and China last week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s claim on Sunday that a trade war was ‘on hold’ has sent a – cautious – wave of relief through the market. Italy, though, is bucking the trend with a sharp fall. That’s partly due to nervousness over the prospect of two populist parties taking power. But....several big Italian companies have just gone ‘ex-dividend’, meaning the deadline to buy them to receive the next payout to shareholders has passed. That has knocked their shares lower. The US dollar has hit its highest level in five months, against a basket of other currencies. That’s another sign that traders are comforted that the US and China have frozen tariffs on a swathe of exports - something that could have hurt the American economy. This truce may also make it easier for the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, to raise American interest rates in the months ahead - another reason to buy the dollar now. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, reminds us that America and China haven’t actually hammered out a full agreement on trade yet. Sayed points out that details of the truce remain vague. This was the second round of trade negotiations without clearly defined targets, suggesting that there’s still a long way to go. Today, a trade war may have been averted, but according to the joint statement from both countries, nothing is being guaranteed apart from China promising to increase American imports Boom! The UK’s FTSE 100 index has burst to a new-alltime high this morning. The Footsie gained 35 points, or 0.45%, to 7814 points for the first time ever. European markets are also benefiting from the easing of trade war fears. France’s CAC has gained 0.24%, while the Spanish IBEX is up 0.33%. Shares in London are also getting a currency boost - the pound has dropped half a cent against the US dollar this morning to $1.3414. Although there’s relief that the US and China have stepped back from a trade war, analysts are also cautious. Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia Pacific at JP Morgan, predicts further clashes between the two sides: Historical precedents suggest the U.S. could re-engage with China on trade issues if it sees China dragging its feet on fulfilling its pledges. Moreover, the last three months have further exposed Washington’s concerns over China’s advancement in technology and its threat as a competitor, both commercially and strategically. It’s like a back pain that never goes away. It was a shock in the first instance it happened, but then life goes on as the most acute symptoms are addressed. The good news is that markets should learn to live with it and consider its impact more rationally.” Eswar Prasad, trade policy professor at Cornell University, says we are looking at “little more than a brief de-escalation of tensions,” “The fundamental differences on trade and other economic issues remain unresolved.” Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at ADS Securities, believes last weekend’s breakthrough will boost stock markets: The undeclared “trade war” between US and China has been put on hold according to US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin as the two superpowers agree on a economic truce. This development puts the planned tariffs on hold while the two countries work on a plan to re-balance their trade relations and dampens the geopolitical risk. An easing of risks on a global scale will be a positive catalyst for the dollar and global equities while demand for safe haven assets like gold and the Japanese yen will remain subdued. Britain’s blue-chip share index of top shares is likely to smash through 7,800 points for the first time ever today. City traders are predicting a rally in London, thanks to the new spirit of detente between the US and China over trade. The FTSE 100 is forecast to gain around 30 points to 7815, breaching the previous intraday high. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group points out that the two sides haven’t resolved all their issues. But it’s a start, at least. US and China stepping back from the brink of a trade war has lifted sentiment, boosting equity indices, putting the FTSE on track for a fresh record high. Asian equities have bounced and Europe points to a higher start, as Trump’s administration halts plans to impose trade tariffs on China, whilst China promises to significantly increase its purchase of US farm exports and energy. This is by no means the end of the matter, especially given the huge gap that remains between the two sides, as highlighted by the lack of any real detail in the announcement. However, this was the encouraging start to talks that traders were after. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Relief is coursing through the markets today after America and China stepped back from the brink of a trade war. Following tense negotiations, the two sides have reached an agreement that means tariffs will not be slapped on tens of billions of dollars of imports. The news has sent markets rallying in Asia, and could push Britain’s FTSE 100 index to a fresh all-time high today. Stocks on Wall Street are all expected to gain, with the Dow Jones industrial average being called up 200 points (0.8%). US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the ceasefire last night. He told Fox News that Beijing had agreed to a framework to help reduce the US’s huge trade deficit with China. This includes China buying more US products. Mnuchin said: “We’re putting the trade war on hold, right now, we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework.” Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He, who took part in trade talks in Washington, has also told the media that the two sides had agreed not to launch a trade war. The breakthrough means that tit-for-tat tariffs will not now be imposed on good flowing between the two countries, such as robots, machinery, chemicals and soybeans But, significantly, China hasn’t agreed to cut the deficit by a fixed amount - and certainly not the $200bn which the Trump administration were pushing for, But still, the deescalation has been welcomed by investors. China’s stock market has posted gains; the SSE Composite index of leading shares is up 0.8% today. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index has gained 1%. European markets are expected to follow suit when trading begins. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: Concerns about an escalation in tensions between China and the US appear to have been deferred in the short term after progress in trade talks at the weekend. We’ll be tracking all the reaction through the day..."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/22/meet-bon-and-pon-the-japanese-retirees-making-coordinated-outfits-cool","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T23:30:38Z","webTitle":"Meet Bon and Pon: the Japanese retirees making coordinated outfits cool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/22/meet-bon-and-pon-the-japanese-retirees-making-coordinated-outfits-cool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/22/meet-bon-and-pon-the-japanese-retirees-making-coordinated-outfits-cool","fields":{"headline":"Meet Bon and Pon: the Japanese retirees making coordinated outfits cool","bodyText":"Whether they’re standing next to a work of art, against an ocean backdrop or in front of their home, the location doesn’t seem to matter. The hundreds of thousands of fans who have turned an ordinary Japanese couple into online megastars are really interested in only one thing: what they are wearing. Bonpon511 – otherwise known as Tsuyoshi and Tomi Seki – have attracted a huge following since they started posting Instagram photos of themselves decked out in coordinated clothes in late 2016. But they are not your average Instagram stars. The couple, who are in their 60s, appear almost daily in an array of outfits incorporating similar styles and colours. The simplicity of their sartorial choices has earned them praise from fashion commentators and adoration among their almost 720,000 followers. The playful images, taken with an iPhone mounted on a tripod, also communicate the obvious pleasure they derive from each other’s company, 38 years after the college sweethearts married. A year on from the Yahoo! Japan article that helped their Instagram images go viral, the couple have published two books celebrating married life and have been the subject of numerous articles in Japanese newspapers and magazines. Next month they will launch their own range of clothes and accessories, in collaboration with a designer, at the Japanese department store Isetan Mitsukoshi. They have their daughter to thank for their unlikely celebrity, Tomi told the Guardian from their home in the north-eastern city of Sendai. “She took photos of us and posted them on her own Instagram account. She received lots of comments so suggested that we start our own account.” Their Instagram handle combines their nicknames as children with their wedding anniversary on 11 May, which they marked this year by appearing in Gingham check, accompanied by the familiar hash tags #over60 and #greyhair. They have always had similar tastes in clothes, but it was Instagram fame that prompted them to coordinate more closely, even during lazy days at home and trips to the supermarket. “But it’s not just about coordinating our clothes,” said Tsuyoshi. “We try to choose outfits that complement our surroundings.” Much of their wardrobe comes from Uniqlo and other high street chains – a no-frills approach they believe has contributed to their popularity. “Of course we’re happy to be described as style icons in the media, but that’s not really how we see ourselves. We wear simple, inexpensive clothes that anyone can buy,” said Tomi. Outfits aside, they hope to convince other older couples that retirement should mark the start of a second life – the title of one of their books. “Now we’re on our own and finally have the time to do all the things we didn’t have the time to do when we were raising a family and working,” Tomi said. “We want to show that retirement can be a lot of fun, especially if you find something you enjoy doing together.” The couple met at a festival when they were both students at an art school in Tokyo. Tsuyoshi went on to work in design and marketing, while Tomi chose to stay home with their daughter. Each of their photos attracts tens of thousands of likes and universally upbeat comments in Japanese, English and other languages. “We’re overwhelmed by the number of comments, although we’re unable to understand all of them,” said Tsuyoshi “But we’re extremely grateful to everyone who takes the time to post.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/21/westpac-made-claim-against-house-of-pensioner-with-chronic-poor-health","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T09:17:11Z","webTitle":"Banking royal commission: Westpac made claim against chronically ill pensioner's house","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/21/westpac-made-claim-against-house-of-pensioner-with-chronic-poor-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/21/westpac-made-claim-against-house-of-pensioner-with-chronic-poor-health","fields":{"headline":"Banking royal commission: Westpac made claim against chronically ill pensioner's house","bodyText":"Westpac Bank made a claim against the house of an elderly pensioner with multiple debilitating health conditions after it had allowed her to become guarantor for her daughter’s loan, and her daughter’s business failed. The pensioner was only allowed to stay in her home after New South Wales Legal Aid made a claim to the financial services ombudsman on her behalf and Westpac agreed to let her stay there until she died. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The banking royal commission heard the case on Monday as the commission’s third round of public hearings began. This round is focusing on small business lending practices. Witness Carolyn Flanagan appeared on Monday via videolink because she was too ill to travel to Melbourne. Flanagan has suffered multiple debilitating health conditions including nasopharyngeal cancer, depression, osteoporosis and pancreatitis. She is legally blind due to glaucoma and has trouble hearing. The commission heard Flanagan visited a Westpac branch in 2010 with her daughter, because her daughter wanted a business loan and Flanagan agreed to be guarantor for the loan. She was receiving a disability support pension at the time. She signed the Westpac documents without receiving legal advice. A bank official had to show her where to sign the documents because she could not read them herself. “I would have signed anything for my daughter, in hindsight,” Flanagan told the commission. I have to be honest about that. If you can’t help your children, who can you help?” In 2012 Westpac brought a claim against Flanagan’s house, trying to force her to sell her home. She sought help from NSW Legal Aid, which made a claim to the financial services ombudsman on her behalf. Eventually an arrangement was reached with Westpac that allowed her to stay in her house until she died. If she wants to sell her house before she dies, Westpac will take some of the funds from the sale. Alastair Welsh, Westpac’s general manager for commercial banking, appeared as a witness after Flanagan. He told the commission he had reviewed Flanagan’s file and believed the bank had followed the right processes in her case, and there was no problem with Westpac accepting a guarantee from her. “My review of the file shows we followed the process that I would have wanted the banker to follow,” he said. “Technically there’s not a problem.” However, Welsh acknowledged that when a request for hardship consideration was made by Flanagan, the request should have been looked at faster. He said there was no problem with Westpac’s lending practices for assessing the suitability of guarantors. He said Westpac staff were not expected to inquire into the health of potential guarantors, nor to engage directly with them. The commission also saw the Commonwealth Bank secure a significant public relations victory. Senior counsel assisting the commission Michael Hodge told the commission he had investigated claims CBA had deliberately defaulted loans of Bankwest customers after it bought Bankwest in late 2008, and he had found no evidence for the claims. CBA has been dogged by claims for years that it was motivated to impair the loans of some Bankwest SME customers in 2009 and 2010 after it acquired the smaller bank from HBOS. Former Bankwest customers have claimed CBA unnecessarily defaulted their loans for its own financial gain and their claims eventually led to a parliamentary inquiry in 2015. The inquiry failed to produce a unanimous view on the events. Hodge told the commission he had investigated the “clawback ulterior motive theory” – the claim that CBA deliberately impaired Bankwest loans so it could “clawback” the amount of the impairment from HBOS under the price adjustment mechanism in the sale contract between CBA and HBOS – but he found no evidence for the theory. “This ulterior motive theory is not supported by either the facts or the operation of the contractual mechanism,” Hodge said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/21/aboriginal-astronomy-can-teach-us-about-the-link-between-sky-and-land","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T03:03:56Z","webTitle":"Aboriginal astronomy can teach us about the link between sky and land | Kirsten Banks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/21/aboriginal-astronomy-can-teach-us-about-the-link-between-sky-and-land","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/21/aboriginal-astronomy-can-teach-us-about-the-link-between-sky-and-land","fields":{"headline":"Aboriginal astronomy can teach us about the link between sky and land","bodyText":"Recently, astronomers have been calling for a “dark sky reserve” in Central Australia – minimising artificial light to make it a reclaimed area for astronomical observing. There are already 12 international dark sky reserve sites around the world, but it would be the first of its kind in Australia. If you’ve had any form of state education in Australia, I’m sure you must have heard an Indigenous dreamtime story at least once in your life. Maybe it was Tiddalick the Frog, or maybe even the Rainbow Serpent. These stories you may have heard as a child hold a wealth of astronomical knowledge – and there’s more where that came from. First Nations peoples of Australia have been studying the sky for tens of thousands of years. They are the first astronomers of Australia. Their science may seem subtle at first, but once you open your eyes to this alternative perspective of space and the cosmos, you will find concepts of astronomical phenomena within these star stories. My relationship with Aboriginal astronomy started in my first year of tertiary education, around the same time I started working at Sydney Observatory. I learned about great celestial bodies in the sky and found a new perspective for the sky and the cosmos. Since then, I’ve delved into learning more about Australia’s great astronomical history and joined a group of Aboriginal astronomy researchers. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday So, let me share with you some of the interesting concepts found within Aboriginal astronomy that absolutely blew my mind on my journey into the realm of the Indigenous sky. I want to start by discussing the comparison of perspectives of the sky. In Western astronomy the sky seems very abstract, cluttered with constellations or dot-to-dot shapes and objects. Constellations that come to mind are the Southern Cross or the zodiac constellations, also known as the star signs, among many more. When looking at these constellations you can easily see that some make sense, others ... not so much. A lot of imagination is needed in some cases! Take this constellation here. It’s quite obviously a dog – it is called the big dog. This one on the other hand is not so obvious. But, believe it or not, it is also a dog – little Canis Minor. Clearly! Constellations in Aboriginal astronomy are a little more subtle than western constellations like Canis Minor. In general, a single celestial body like a star or a planet will represent a single entity or a single thing, like an animal or a person. Although, sometimes there are greater astronomical bodies that construct images in the sky. My favourite Aboriginal constellation would have to be, hands down, the Great Celestial Emu. This constellation is very different to all of the constellations mentioned so far. Instead of being forged with the bright spots in the sky, the dark clouds of our Milky Way galaxy manifest a huge emu in the sky. In my country, Wiradjuri (now known as central NSW), as well as many other Indigenous nations, the emu’s position in the sky signals at what point during the year is best for emu egg collection. When the emu, known as Gugurmin in Wiradjuri language, is on the eastern horizon just after sunset, this indicates that the emus are currently nesting. So, at this time there are no emu eggs to collect. Later in the year, Gugurmin makes its way up higher into the sky. Once its body is directly overhead after sunset, it’s time to go collect emu eggs. Not only does the sky act as a seasonal menu, it is also used as a tool for teaching many lessons. These lessons could be about Aboriginal law, or they could be about how the universe functions on a fundamental level. One of my favourite star stories is one that hints to multiple astronomical phenomena. This story comes from the Boorong people of the Wergaia language group, an Indigenous region in north-west Victoria. It speaks of a star called Unurgunite, an old spirit with two wives that are represented by the two bright stars either side of him. The moon, known as Mityan, fell in love with one of the wives and tried to lure her away. Unurgunite found out about this and had a great battle with Mityan. Mityan lost the battle and was left to wander the heavens forever more, the battle scars still strewn on his face. My research in Aboriginal astronomy involves reading stories such as this one, and unveiling astronomical concepts hidden within them. While it may not be so obvious to begin with, this story has two astronomical phenomena layered within. The most obvious one is the battle scars on the face of the moon. This immediately refers to the dark patches on the moon known as mare or the seas. The second, not so obvious phenomenon is occultation. Occultation is an astronomical phenomenon where one object passes in front of a second object, thus blocking the light from the second object. In this story, it speaks of the moon falling in love with one of the wives and luring her away. After a bit of research, it was found that the moon and one of the stars that represent the wives actually go through an occultation. I see this as the act of “luring her away” in the story. Not only can the sky, and the stories affiliated with the sky, be used as a tool for learning about the cosmos, it can also be used for navigational purposes. The Wardaman people, an Indigenous group south-west of Kimberly in the Northern Territory, use the ecliptic and the shadow of the moon for navigation. The ecliptic is the apparent path of the sun in the sky. All of the planets, and the moon, also appear on or close to this line. Uncle Bill Yidumduma Harney, a Wardaman elder, speaks of the ecliptic as being unmissable in the sky. So now you can see, Aboriginal star stories are not just stories, they are lessons that educate us about the relationship between the sky and the land, as well as how the universe functions around us.

The union, called Hospo Voice, was formed in response to the transient nature of work in the restaurant and bar sector. The industry employs a high proportion of backpackers and migrant workers, making it difficult for unions to organise workers and deal with allegations of wage theft. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon A survey of 624 workers conducted by United Voice last year estimated 76% of hospitality businesses were underpaying their staff. In recent months, high-profile restaurants have become embroiled in wage theft scandals involving allegations of underpayment of workers, including Bar Coluzzi in Sydney and Vue de Monde in Melbourne. Hospo Voice is being run by United Voice with backing from the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The online union is being piloted in Victoria, but hopes to expand across Australia. Members have access to digital tools to check how much they should be getting paid, a tracking tool to record and prove hours worked and a harassment diary to keep track of workplace bullying. “Endemic wage theft and sexual harassment have prompted hospitality workers from bars, cafes and restaurants to come together and fight to change their industry,” United Voice said. “Hospitality has a young, transient and casual workforce often working in small, single-site venues. These workers have often felt powerless, disposable and unable to unionise. But the internet and social media have changed the game.” Ruby Lethbridge, a 19-year-old university student, works casually as a waiter, barista and bartender in Melbourne’s outer eastern suburbs. Her boss recently told staff that half of the cost of any meals mistakenly put through the register would be docked from their wages. “It hasn’t gone down well with staff at all,” Lethbridge told Guardian Australia. “I’ve talked to lots of fellow staff members and we’re all aware that this is illegal. “I and others I work with are getting dramatically underpaid about $9 under the award rate; we are paid in cash and are not given penalty or holiday rates. Previous staff have requested wage increases, which have never been granted, and the owners say they simply can’t afford to pay us any more, although they have recently opened a new restaurant and bought a new delivery car.” Lethbridge said while she had considered leaving and had applied for other jobs, other hospitality jobs were similar. “I have since been in contact with United Voice and hope to make a pay dispute complaint for backpay,” she said. Lethbridge said she also wanted to complain that she had not been paid any superannuation for the past seven months. She is one of dozens of people to have contacted Guardian Australia in recent weeks with stories of wage theft. Robert Li said his wife received $10 per hour working in a Chinese restaurant. He said there were too many “creative” ways for employers to steal wages. Li believes payrolls and salaries for the hospitality industry should be outsourced to an independent third party responsible for paying wages and monitoring hours worked. “I understand it may mean rising costs for restaurants, but currently it is the employer that benefits the most from the wage theft and they should be held accountable for that,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/21/monday-briefing-russias-dirty-money-damaging-uk-say-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T05:16:37Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: Russia's 'dirty' money damaging UK, say MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/21/monday-briefing-russias-dirty-money-damaging-uk-say-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/21/monday-briefing-russias-dirty-money-damaging-uk-say-mps","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: Russia's 'dirty' money damaging UK, say MPs","bodyText":"Top story: ‘Business as usual’ policy with Putin must end Good morning. I’m Martin Farrer and it’s my turn to bring you all the news fit to email straight to your inbox. Britain is putting its national security at risk by allowing Russian “kleptocrats and human rights abusers” to use the City of London to launder “dirty money” to circumvent sanctions, according to a hard-hitting report by MPs. The government’s lax approach was putting money into the hands of regimes opposed to the UK, the report by the foreign affairs select committee says, and accuses ministers of failing to live up to tough rhetoric in the wake of the Salisbury poisoning affair. The committee chair, Tory MP Tom Tugendhat, says the UK can no longer allow a “business as usual” approach to the Kremlin. “The scale of damage that this ‘dirty money’ can do to UK foreign policy interests dwarfs the benefit of Russian transactions in the City,” he says. Our investigative team has produced this very handy guide to explain, by way of Breaking Bad and the Paradise Papers, all you need to know about money laundering. * * * ‘She will deliver’ – The cabinet’s cold war over Brexit goes on after a thinly veiled threat from Boris Johnson to Theresa May that she has to deliver a deal that takes Britain out of the customs union. On a trip to Artgentina, the foreign secretary said he was confident the prime minister “will deliver” a deal that keeps the Brexiters happy and avoids what would be a doomsday scenario for them of having to remain in the customs union beyond 2020 – the so-called “backstop” solution. Jacob Rees Mogg, the leader of backbench hardliners, has described this outcome in suitably biblical terms as “perpetual purgatory”. But Johnson, in an outward display of loyalty, says his boss must be given “time and space to negotiate this Brexit vision”. Our columnist Nesrine Malik, meanwhile, says Jeremy Corbyn must show some leadership on Brexit – hard, soft, whatever, just some leadership. * * * Trump trashing – Back to Russia, or at least its tentacles, and Donald Trump’s never-ending imbroglio over the investigation into his campaign’s alleged links to the Kremlin. On Sunday the US president lashed out at the New York Times for reporting that his oldest son and other aides met in August 2016 with a representative of two Gulf states offering to help the Trump campaign. Those people are now cooperating with Robert Mueller’s investigation, the report said. Trump earlier said he was asking the justice department to examine the possibility that the FBI had infiltrated his campaign. * * * Rough justice – Vulnerable homeless people are being punished by the courts and even imprisoned for begging and rough sleeping, according to a Guardian investigation. More than 50 local authorities have targeted homeless people with public space protection orders (PSPOs). Examples include a man jailed for four months for breaching a criminal behaviour order for begging in Gloucester and another who was fined £105 after a child dropped £2 in his sleeping bag. * * * It’s a triumph – Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro has won a second six-year term as leader of the crisis-stricken nation. Maduro dismissed the concerns about electoral fraud that persuaded opposition parties to boycott the poll, and instead hailed an “impeccable process” that had returned him to power with 67.7% of the vote. “The whole of Venezuela has triumphed! Democracy has triumphed! Peace has triumphed! Constitutionality has triumphed,” he told supporters. * * * Unfairbnb? – The lettings site Airbnb may be a very convenient way to find a place to stay but it’s wrecking city communities all over Europe and the authorities in Brussels are aiding and abetting the process, campaigners say. Although it started out with people letting spare rooms, a report snappily titled Unfairbnb shows that in a selection of tourist hotspots more than half of the site’s listings – sometimes as many as 85% – are whole apartments. That reduces the housing stock for local rentals, the activists say, and pushes up prices. One of those cities, Berlin, has introduced laws to crackdown on the number of holiday rentals and has a team of investigators trying to root out illicit operators. * * * Cougar attack – The horrifying story of the mountain biker mauled to death by a cougar in Washington state prompted questions about what the man and his friend could have done to avoid the attack. But police have said the men did everything right by getting off their bikes and making a lot of noise when they realised the lion was following them on the remote Cascade mountains track. Although the animal was chased off initially, it returned and dragged one of the men to his death. “Something was wrong with this cougar,” police said. Lunchtime read: ‘I’m proud to be a feminist,’ says Meghan Markle You really didn’t think the briefing was going to miss out on the royal wedding did you? As Windsor begins its mighty cleanup, the Duchess of Sussex (aka Suits star Meghan Markle) has announced her arrival with a profile on the in-laws’ family website. “I’m proud to be a woman and a feminist,” it says, and tells us that she has been interested in social issues from an early age helped by stints as a volunteer in the soup kitchens of her native Los Angeles. And in case you missed it, Hadley Freeman invokes the John Goodman film King Ralph to argue that the duchess could be just the right American that the royal family needs. Sport Gary Cahill, the Chelsea captain, has urged the club’s board to end the uncertainty surrounding Antonio Conte’s future at Stamford Bridge after leading his team to victory in the FA Cup final. A year after Alexander Zverev announced his arrival in the big time by crushing Novak Djokovic to win the Italian Open, the young German held his own but not his crown as Rafael Nadal outlasted him to win his eighth title in Rome. Meanwhile, the women’s world No 1, Simona Halep, collapsed spectacularly in her rematch with Elina Svitolina to hand the Ukrainian a second Italian Open title. England’s rugby World Cup preparations have been thrown into turmoil with their defence coach, Paul Gustard, leaving Eddie Jones’s coaching staff to join Harlequins. And with Pakistan getting ready for the first Test on Thursday, Azhar Ali believes they can take 20 England wickets at Lord’s. Business The face of Britain’s high streets really is changing and that is very bad news for hundreds of workers at Marks and Spencer who could find out as soon as today if their stores are among those being earmarked for closure. M&amp;S was once the flagship of British retail but has seen its share price fall by 25% in the past year and is in danger of disappearing from the FTSE100. The index itself is set for a bounce of 0.75% this morning thanks to the prospects of a US-Chinese rapprochement over trade tariffs. No feelgood factor for the pound though. It’s down again to $1.343 and €1.143. The papers The royal nuptials still dominate many front pages. The Mail and the Telegraph both lead with what the former calls “Meghan’s manifesto”, namely her new profile on the royal website. The Sun focuses on the happy couple’s choice of music – Whitney Houston apparently, which provided the punning headline: “Ooh, one wants to dance with somebody”. More prosaically, the Mirror says “Meghan: I have found my prince” and the Express can only gush: “Absolutely stunning”. The Guardian leads with our investigation into rough justice for the homeless, with the Roman Abramovich visa story as the second story. The Times leads on the latter and the FT also has the story on its front. However, its lead is that the UK is looking to Australia for help in launching rival to Galileo satellite system.

Top stories Macquarie Bank wrongly withheld $875,000 from a Sydney couple after using “not unusual” practices that prompted allegations of forgery and misconduct. As the royal commission on banking this week turns its sights on small business lending, the bank’s treatment of Steve Wise, 66, and his wife has also exposed mistakes by the industry-funded financial ombudsman service, which misconstrued evidence to initially recommend Macquarie be cleared of wrongdoing. The case prompted a surprise intervention from Tony Abbott, Wise’s local member, who last week wrote to the financial services minister, Kelly O’Dwyer, urging her department to “take another look” at what appeared to be “improper behaviour by both a bank and a regulator”. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The US has pulled back from a potential trade war with China by agreeing to put proposed tariffs on Chinese imports “on hold”. The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said negotiations with Chinese officials had borne fruit, so Washington and Beijing could step back from imposing punishing tariffs on each other’s exports. The breakthrough came after two days of talks between Mnuchin and China’s vice-premier, Liu He, in Washington. The Greens have ruled out supporting both major parties’ planned tax cuts, accusing them of attempting to bribe voters, by “giving away cheques like a breakfast TV show trying to increase ratings”. The government has promised a $530 tax offset for workers earning between $41,000 and $90,00 from next year, as the first tranche of the tax plan revealed in the budget. But Scott Morrison is so far having trouble convincing the crossbench that the final stage of its $140bn plan – which would bring in a flat rate of tax for earners between $41,000 and $200,000 by 2024 – is workable. The mayor of Bundaberg says his community has turned against the cashless welfare trial after learning its cost. When locals were told how much the trial program would cost to administer – about $10,000 a year per participant, according to the Australian Council of Social Service – support for it stood at just 26%, down from 56% before they knew the cost. “Surely there’s ways to incentivise people,” said the former mayor and former LNP stalwart Jack Dempsey. “When you look at $10,000 ... per individual, it suddenly stacks up that you could nearly pay for them to have a job in the first place.” A Queensland MP who spoke out against the dumping of Jane Prentice has been summoned to appear before the LNP’s candidate review committee, a move described by supporters as “politically stupid payback”. Michelle Landry is one of a group of MPs, including Trevor Evans, Warren Entsch and, reportedly, George Christensen, who have been called before the panel. All four have contradicted party lines, three on social issues and one against the leadership. Sport AFL was played all over the country – and even internationally – in round nine. But as just over 10,000 people attended a dour contest in Shanghai, even fewer turned out to see the Kangaroos play GWS in Hobart – evidence that Tasmania may be turning its back on an organisation that sees no future for a football team in the state, writes Craig Little. State of Origin looms and, with spots up for grabs, players took to round 11 looking to prove their worth. In this case, many chose to prove their aggression, beginning with James Roberts and Latrell Mitchell on Friday night. Thinking time Strathalbyn station is cattle country, 34,000 hectares of north Queensland grazing land, and the site of a pilot program that has demonstrated the potential to drastically improve the quality of water flowing towards the Great Barrier Reef. The project has recorded a remarkable reduction – from tonnes to grams – in the amount of soil washed away from the test site every year. As Ben Smee reports, it aims to work through many more sites by 2030, enough to have a measurable impact on reef water quality. One of the world’s most unconventional film-makers, Jane Campion, talks about the end of the patriarchy, doing away with decorum, and how losing her baby son changed her forever. “I think we got caught in a complicated supplicancy, a very sophisticated supplicancy,” says Campion of women being sidelined in the film industry. “[But] right now, we’re in a really special moment. I’m so excited about it. It’s like the Berlin wall coming down, like the end of apartheid.” “The decision to finally make an official police complaint about a sex offence wasn’t so much a ‘lightbulb moment’ as the gradual knocking away at a tall wall with a small mallet, brick by brick,” writes Bri Lee, whose memoir, Eggshell Skull, recounts her journey through the Australian justice system. Lee wrrites about wall she constructed from the moment she realised what had been done to her. The one that had been fortified by all the casual sexism women absorb every day. The bricks that people added when they didn’t believe the women who came forward, and the bricks she added herself. What’s he done now? Donald Trump has called for an investigation into whether the FBI infiltrated his presidential campaign after the New York Times reported that his son and other aides met a representative of two Gulf states offering to help the campaign in 2016. After a long string of furious tweets about the “Witch Hunt”, Trump wrote: “I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes – and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!” Media roundup Amid further coverage of Saturday’s royal wedding, the Australian reports that ABC journalists are being sent for more training in an attempt to halt declining ratings of the 7pm news – 660,000 people watched ABC news in the mainland capital cities last week, 100,000 fewer than a year ago. The Hobart Mercury reports that Tasmania’s police force is being investigated over possible leaks and the misuse of information by its officers. And the Liberal party president, Nick Greiner, has told the ABC a 50/50 gender ratio of candidates is unlikely to be achieved by 2025. “It’s tough from where we are now, given the realities of the timetable,” he said. “The important thing is to maintain the pressure.” Coming up The banking royal commission resumes today, looking at loans to small businesses.

The powerful economy. The changing demographics. All the kids who can’t remember when the USA didn’t have a pro league and Americans couldn’t watch the Premier League every weekend on TV. All of those things, they say, will propel the US men to global dominance one day, if we can only fix one or two things. There’s only one problem. It’s not going to happen in a long, long time. Not by 2022. Not by 2026, when the USA may be a World Cup co-host, depending on the level of anger over US policies when the vote is taken in June. Not in the next century at the very least. And the women may not win much in the near future, either. Here’s why We the People of the United States cannot form the perfect soccer union. We’re too far behind. In Europe, soccer has been entrenched since the 19th century. English and German soldiers stepped out of the trenches in world war one to play games during an unofficial Christmas ceasefire. Most of the final 16 clubs in this year’s Champions League boast at least 100 years of history. The sport also has long dominated in South America and large parts of Africa and Asia. The USA had a good foothold 90 years ago, with a promising young American Soccer League providing the backbone of the players who reached the 1930 World Cup semi-finals (although only 13 teams entered.) But the ASL disappeared a few years later, starting a cycle that would become too familiar through the generations. Without the beacon of a pro league, soccer was relegated to leagues of dedicated immigrants who shrugged off the scorn of the neighbors who eagerly assimilated into “American” sports like gridiron football, baseball and basketball. In the 1960s, a few different leagues vied for supremacy before the remnants were forced to join up to form the NASL, which had a few good years in the late 70s and early 80s before collapsing under the weight of overexpansion and inequity. In the 1980s, the future of US soccer seemed to be indoors, with several teams averaging more than 10,000 fans per game to see a soccer/hockey hybrid. At the same time, youth soccer started to boom. But with the federation taking a laissez-faire attitude, youth clubs went in all sorts of different directions. Today, we have two national umbrella organizations – US Youth Soccer and US Club Soccer – racing to form regional elite leagues. Confused parents sign up kids for tryouts and hope for the best outcomes while praying they don’t end up spending thousands of dollars on airfares and hotel rooms. A team may travel 700 miles for a blowout instead of traveling seven miles for a competitive game. Even those who agree US Soccer needs to change can’t get on the same page. In the 2018 federation presidential election, we needed two hands to count all the “reform” candidates in the field. Meanwhile, efforts to unify lower-division soccer and push the USA toward a promotion/relegation system are bogged down in an alphabet soup of brand names – NPSL, UPSL, PDL, ASL and more – most of which insist on being a national framework rather than a regional component of a larger pyramid. And we’re too litigious. The US soccer community is very good at establishing legal precedent. The old NASL’s legal skirmishes with the NFL were landmarks of sports business law, as was the MLS players’ lawsuit against the league in the late 90s. What those lawsuits did not do was establish a firm ground for soccer in the USA. Far from it. The MLS players’ suit hindered the league’s early growth. Today, you need a scorecard to keep track of all the legal actions. A possible move of the Columbus Crew to Austin is held up in court. Other actions challenge the lack of promotion/relegation or the disparate pay structures between the men’s and women’s national teams. The new NASL is even suing individual members of US Soccer’s board over a vote that didn’t go their way. Some of these problems could be solved if the interested parties were forced to sit down and negotiate. The lawsuits, though, have simply calcified everyone’s positions and limited the capacity to talk about new approaches to build up pro soccer. There’s the competition too. Soccer is the most popular sport in the world. Not here. Even in Washington DC, where thriving immigrant communities love the global game, the local media hailed the NHL’s Washington Capitals as the first major pro team to make a conference final for many years, ignoring the feats of the Washington Spirit (NWSL) and DC United (MLS). If you want success it’s best to be patient. But we’re too obsessed with the quick fix. Futsal! Focusing on dribbling – no, wait, passing – at an early age! Ending “pay to play” (they don’t say how)! The hotly contested US Soccer presidential election showed we have no shortage of ideas. And a vast contingent of supporters, many of them new to the sport, remain convinced that all evils will disappear if the USA merely institutes promotion/relegation, which will magically yield an exponential rise in investment and make every US child hungry to represent his or her hometown club in its fight to climb the ladder. Fixing things is indeed easy. All we have to do is make up for generations of cultural antipathy, incentivize people who are currently staying out of soccer to put their money and children into it, ensure the vast expenditures of those who’ve paid to be part of MLS’ effort to accelerate the USA’s pro and youth growth, get kids to put down their video games and get out on a neighborhood futsal court, get the powers that be to check their egos and lawyers at the door, and perhaps build a time machine. Maybe that could happen. Or maybe the Yellowstone supervolcano could render much of the United States uninhabitable. The good news? There’s little harm in trying, and we’re in good company. Only eight countries have ever won the men’s World Cup. England only won it on home soil – and that was more than 50 years ago. Holland haven’t won it. Mexico haven’t come close. And yet, the sport thrives in all of those countries (and dozens more where a World Cup victory is the most distant of dreams). It’s certainly close to thriving here in the States. Sports bars catering to Premier League fans are now the rule rather than the exception. Plenty of cities, not just at MLS level, have rollicking live soccer atmospheres. The National Women’s Soccer League has lost a couple of teams but gained more, already outlasting previous attempts at a women’s league. All without a winning a World Cup. And maybe a wave of talent can coincide with a run of good luck as it did in 2002, when the US men made it to the quarter-finals. Perhaps the US women will win again, though they now face many of the same issues (fractious and litigious stakeholders especially) as the men. We can always dream."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/may/20/andrew-wilson-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T17:13:06Z","webTitle":"Andrew Wilson obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/20/andrew-wilson-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/20/andrew-wilson-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Andrew Wilson obituary","bodyText":"My friend and colleague Andrew Wilson, who has died of acute leukaemia aged 65, was a pioneering general practitioner. He made a substantial contribution to British medicine through his work as an associate dean for Health Education England and as convener of the membership examination of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP). He was born in London and raised by his mother, Jessie (nee Franklin), a secretary, in Bounds Green, as his father, Thomas Wilson, a theatre agency booking clerk, died of a heart attack aged 41, before Andrew’s third birthday. He attributed his zest for life to the fact that his father had died so young. After attending Reed’s school in Cobham, Surrey, Andrew initially studied engineering at University College London but moved to Westminster hospital medical school when he noticed that his childhood sweetheart, Chris Dunn, was having a lot more fun studying medicine. They married in 1972. Andrew won the prestigious University of London gold medal for the medical student who had most distinguished himself in the final examinations. He joined Chris as a partner at the Schopwick surgery in Elstree, Hertfordshire, which they turned into a thriving, exemplary practice. Andrew was a highly capable, empathetic and caring general practitioner. Countless colleagues have been influenced by the intellectually rigorous approach he brought to his work on the Teaching the Teachers courses for GP educators and his leadership of the RCGP examination as it became the qualifying standard for all GPs in the UK. Andrew approached life with a great curiosity and passion. He often attended several plays a week, explored new cuisines, captained sailing boats across the Channel and danced salsa all over the world. A man of strong opinions, he also had a gift for friendship. Visits to the theatre were followed by amiable debates: Andrew loved the plays of Harold Pinter but had little enthusiasm for musicals, some of which he would dismiss as “drivel”.

A huge publicity drive backed Sunday’s biggest ever timetable change but, despite the big build-up, passengers trying to get into and around London found few of the promised new services were actually running. For more than a year, Govia Trains has been working on an ambitious plan to merge its Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern train operations and introduce a raft of promised improvements. South-east London was particularly badly hit in the morning, with passengers facing mass cancellations and long waits. Throughout the day, between half and a third of timetabled trains across the new enlarged network were being cancelled. While the train company had warned the changes would result in disruption, passengers were taken aback at the level of cancellations and were furious at the lack of information. “It takes a very special rail company to screw up its new timetable as soon as it starts. Trains cancelled and a reduced service already announced for tomorrow. Well done the @TLRailUK buffoons,” was one sentiment on Twitter. Others described it as a “farce”. Sunday’s disruption does not bode well for Monday, when commuters would really put the new system to the test, commenters warned. The biggest change to the London commuting network ever seen allows trains to run from Cambridge and Peterborough through London to Gatwick airport and on to Brighton for the first time, along with a number of other services. The new Govia operation accounts for around a quarter of all UK rail services. Charles Horton, Govia Trains’ chief executive, said last week: “The introduction of the new timetables is a major milestone in the delivery of RailPlan 20/20, our programme to modernise rail services, taking advantage of the new infrastructure and trains provided by the government’s £7bn Thameslink programme.” He said passengers would see huge benefits from changes that provide for an extra 50,000 passengers in the capital’s morning peak, with Govia running 400 more trains a day.

Kearney used her first speech to parliament on Monday to telegraph her intention to work towards a “humane refugee policy” during her time in federal politics – a public signal before a policy debate expected at the Labor conference in July and a state party conference in Victoria this coming weekend. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The member for Batman said the plight of asylum seekers was “a passionate and emotional issue” for her local constituents and she used Monday’s speech to identify that the looming internal battle will be around the issue of indefinite detention. Kearney said people currently detained on Manus Island and Nauru must be permanently resettled “as a priority”, but the speech did not specify whether that resettlement should be in Australia or in a third country. Australia, she said, must ensure that indefinite detention “never happens again”. Kearney also said all refugees needed to have access to social services and income support. “I think proudly of the great bipartisan achievements of both sides of this house: of Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke, who with bipartisan support provided sanctuary to those fleeing the consequence of wars in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, and later from the events of Tiananmen Square,” Kearney said. “I cannot comprehend how a nation that provided a safe home to so many in the wake of world war two – including our large Jewish community of Holocaust survivors – allowed the Tampa and the children overboard scandal to evolve into the shameful policy of indefinite detention on Manus and Nauru. “Racist dog-whistling has demonised and vilified a community that has everything to give to Australia and the sacrifice of this human potential has been made solely for political gain.” Kearney said the debate about refugees should be based on fact, recognising that the “overwhelming majority” of arrivals are fleeing conflict zones and meet the test set out by the international conventions to which Australia is a signatory. “We are a rich country,” the Labor MP said. “We can afford to take more refugees. I doubt, however, we can afford the ongoing cost to our national psyche of subjecting men, women, children to years of indefinite detention in camps.” In pursuing humane policies on asylum, Kearney said, foreign policy and foreign aid supporting people in extremis needed to be considered. There was a requirement for “assessment, not punishment” and “assessment within a fair time limit, as part of regional agreements for humane resettlement”. She said a humane policy for asylum seekers required collaboration with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees “and more funds for its operation, as well as a greater permanent intake of refugees, with an expansion of our humanitarian intake”. Kearney said “offering sanctuary to refugees does not need to compromise or undercut other paths to citizenship that Australia offers to migrants, like family reunions”. “Our society is living evidence that we have, actually, done it before.” Kearney prevailed in a hard-fought byelection contest against the Greens candidate, Alex Bhathal, in the inner Melbourne seat of Batman in March, gaining a two-party-preferred swing of more than 3%. The Greens pressed Labor on asylum throughout the campaign, particularly in the closing stages, and Kearney will be under significant pressure locally to take a public stand on the issue. Last week Kearney telegraphed she was building up a local consultative structure to progress the debate before the July national conference. While it is clear the major agitation is around indefinite detention, specifics about the direction of the national policy debate are not yet clear. A draft proposal put together by the immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, restates Labor’s commitment to move asylum seekers out of mandatory detention within 90 days, and to raise the refugee intake from 18,750 to 27,000. But it makes no mention of Manus Island or Nauru. The 90-day processing rule would not cover refugees on Nauru or Manus Island, given that they have already been processed. Labor’s right faction has expressed confidence that it will either have a small majority in its own right for 2018, or a working majority on contentious issues, such as the refugee debate, with the support of the delegation from the CFMEU. But insiders have expressed caution, saying that no one can be certain about that until Queensland selects its delegation. Activists are waiting on the final resolution of delegates from each state before beginning the process of drafting resolutions and platform amendments. A precursor to the national conference debate is likely this weekend at the Victorian state conference. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has acknowledged there will be a debate on the issue of refugees, but says he has “no interest” in changing Labor’s stance on asylum boat turnbacks. However, reflecting internal agitation about offshore detention becoming de facto indefinite detention, Shorten has raised the issue of the lengthy detention periods people are subjected to in offshore camps. “We don’t believe that mandatory [indefinite] detention has to be the necessary result of stopping the boats,” the Labor leader said in late March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/21/coalition-mps-introduce-bill-for-ban-on-live-exports-saying-industry-is-not-viable","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T03:16:05Z","webTitle":"Coalition MPs introduce bill for ban on live exports, saying industry is not viable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/21/coalition-mps-introduce-bill-for-ban-on-live-exports-saying-industry-is-not-viable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/21/coalition-mps-introduce-bill-for-ban-on-live-exports-saying-industry-is-not-viable","fields":{"headline":"Coalition MPs introduce bill for ban on live exports, saying industry is not viable","bodyText":"Liberal MP Sussan Ley’s private member’s bill to ban live sheep exports is gaining support. Labor is talking up the prospect it could pass with votes from the opposition, crossbench and government MPs. Ley introduced the bill on Monday, with backing from Liberal colleagues Sarah Henderson and Jason Wood, but indicated the trio would not cross the floor to force a vote but rather use it to build support to change Coalition policy. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Ley’s bill would ban live sheep exports in the northern summer from next year, and in five years totally ban the transport of sheep and lambs to the Middle East or to any routes through the Persian Gulf or Red Sea. The Turnbull government has rejected a ban on live exports in favour of rules to increase space allocated to sheep on ships by 39%, improved ventilation and increased penalties for directors who flout the standards. Ley told the lower house she had not allowed “emotions to overcome reason” but the case for live sheep exports “fails on both economic and animal welfare grounds”. “If the rules were actually enforced — access to feed, water and rest and avoidance of high heat stress — no commercial operator would undertake the trade,” she said. “Exporters have explained to me that it would not be viable. “Unfortunately, this is an industry with an operating model built on animal suffering.” Ley said that the industry had 33 years and “countless second chances” to improve conditions but exporters “do not comply with the rules” because “regulations written on paper in Australia cease to mean anything once the ship departs”. On Monday Henderson told ABC News Breakfast it was “very disappointing” the review by livestock vet Michael McCarthy had not “come up with recommendations that follow the science” by recommending a ban as the Australian Veterinary Association has done. “It doesn’t matter really whether the ships are destocked, whether they’re better ventilated,” she said. “It’s like putting a dog in a car on a hot summer’s day – that will lead inevitably to death.” Labor’s agriculture spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon told ABC’s AM that he had “no doubt” that Ley’s bill reflected the view of the broader Labor party, and he was “very confident” his party would support the bill. Fitzgibbon suggested that if Labor retained its seats in the upcoming byelections, the bill would need five more votes to pass, and three could come from the crossbench. In addition to Ley and Henderson, he said “a number of the government’s own ranks have approached me expressing their support privately for this bill”. However, with the government controlling the order of business in the lower house, Ley’s bill may be debated but never voted on. Ley said the Liberal MPs would not cross the floor to force a vote. Ley said the group was not “running around the corridors counting the numbers” but “a significant” number had approached her to discuss the bill. “We are doing this the right way. We are doing this by building support within our party, something that I believe should be a change of policy.” Earlier, the Nationals MP and former agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce rejected a live export ban. He warned it would make farmers poorer, especially those forced to compete with the sale of sheep and lambs no longer exported. He told reporters in Canberra the backlash “will be vastly more politically potent than the first effect of the devastating conditions we saw on the boat”. “People say [the industry] is not viable and fading out. If that is the case, let it happen.” Joyce has come under fire for his failure to improve animal welfare conditions in the live export industry, including for the Abbott government’s decision to abolish the Australian Animals Welfare Advisory Committee. Joyce defended his record, saying he “rang up all the exporters personally” to demand they lift their game and that incremental changes to regulations were preferable to a ban. The latest controversy was sparked by whistleblower footage from the voyage of the live export ship Awassi Express on which 2,400 sheep died."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/21/new-zealand-drugs-mp-blames-pacific-failed-states-drug-problems","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T03:19:12Z","webTitle":"MP blames Pacific 'failed states' for New Zealand's drug problems","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/21/new-zealand-drugs-mp-blames-pacific-failed-states-drug-problems","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/21/new-zealand-drugs-mp-blames-pacific-failed-states-drug-problems","fields":{"headline":"MP blames Pacific 'failed states' for New Zealand's drug problems","bodyText":"A New Zealand MP has said the country’s Pacific neighbours are to blame for New Zealand’s worsening drug problems, blaming “failed states” in the region for failing to stop drug smugglers. Shane Jones, the assistant finance minister, has earned a reputation in his six months in government for his blunt and often controversial rhetoric. Speaking at an event last week regarding New Zealand’s “Pacific reset” strategy Jones said: “Many of the problems that we are dealing with here, with P [methamphetamine] and drugs, where do you think that is coming from folks? That is coming from closely failed states in the Pacific,” Jones said. “That is the transit route where a lot of this drama is costing good ordinary middle class, upper class, lower class people inordinate pain and fear and anguish.” “I have extraordinarily high fears about Pacific Island states being used as transit points for mischief and mayhem, eventually making its way to New Zealand,” Shane Jones said. The New Zealand Drug Foundation said while it was true the Pacific islands were increasingly being used as a transit route for drugs bound for New Zealand from South and North America, Pacific Island countries did not have the resources - and in some cases, the will - to crack down. “The issues he raises are very genuine, Pacific islands don’t have a lot of surveillance capability, they don’t have strict border control, so there are a lot of reasons in terms of infrastructure about why the Pacific is vulnerable to the flow of drugs,” said executive director Ross Bell. “We shouldn’t be too complacent. If that region is increasingly more important as a drug trafficking and trading route then there are real threats to democracy because of that.” New Zealand recently announced its “Pacific reset” strategy, aimed at curbing foreign influence in the region from superpowers such as China, and boosting New Zealand’s commitment to its neighbours. Part of the strategy includes a NZ$700m boost in aid funding over four years. New Zealand is the Pacific’s second-largest donor, with about 60% of its total aid budget directed towards its Pacific neighbours. Lopeti Senituli, spokesperson for the Tongan prime minister said the comments by Jones were bordering on racism and his country was not the “wild west”. Jones specifically name-checked Tonga as having a major issue with drugs, but Bell also mentioned Fiji and French Polynesia as countries of concern. “They [prime minister Ardern and foreign affairs minister Winston Peters] espoused that we have a common culture and common values...and here is Shane Jones saying they are a failed state,” Senituli told Dateline Pacific. “That’s not a reason to state that the country was a failed state. I think we are a thriving democracy, we have a good prime minister and government in place, and His majesty is at the helm of the country, it it’s a really belittling statement to make of the Kingdom of Tonga,”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/20/rapfael-nadal-alexander-zverev-italian-open","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T18:41:16Z","webTitle":"Rafael Nadal fends off Alexander Zverev to secure Italian Open title","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/20/rapfael-nadal-alexander-zverev-italian-open","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/20/rapfael-nadal-alexander-zverev-italian-open","fields":{"headline":"Rafael Nadal fends off Alexander Zverev to secure Italian Open final","bodyText":"A year after Alexander Zverev announced his arrival in the big time by crushing Novak Djokovic to win the Italian Open, the young German held his own but not his crown as Rafael Nadal outlasted him to win his eighth title on the Campo Centrale, 6-1, 1-6, 6-3 in two hours and nine minutes with two rain breaks. When it was put to him that the rain was not his friend Zverev smiled and nodded. “No, it’s not. But it happens. Nothing you can do about it. He came out way faster, played way more aggressive than I did. It took me a long time to get activated again. I ran out of time. The break took my momentum away.” Asked how he might convert his good run of three-setters to the much different challenge of a slam, he said: “I will try to play the same way over a longer period of time. But I don’t even want to think about tennis the next few days, then to Paris, where Rafa will be the favourite, no doubt about it.” Nadal was asked why Zverev has yet to convert his three-set form into success in the slams [he has not got past the fourth round and twice has blown 2-1 leads] and he bridled a little. “Tennis is tennis – best of three, best of five. Five sets is best for the best players and Sacha is one of the best players.” Ten years separate them in age, there is a gap of $90m in career earnings and the Spaniard now has 70 more titles than the 21-year-old world No 3. But Zverev is here to stay. He is growing in power and confidence and, seeded second in Roger Federer’s absence, he will be a threat at the French Open, which starts on Sunday and where Nadal will reach for his 11th Coupe de Mousquetaires. They cannot meet until the final. The demands of winning seven best-of-five matches in a row is still a huge ask for Zverev – as it will be for Dominic Thiem, who stopped Nadal’s run of 50 clay sets in a row in Madrid 9 days ago, before losing in the final to Zverev. The rival most likely to stop Nadal at Roland Garros could still be the man he has played 51 times over 12 years, and whom he beat for the 25th time in the semi-final on Saturday. Djokovic provided an exhausting test of Nadal’s game from start to finish; this was a stop-start skirmish, because of the elements and the efforts of the combatants. The sharpness the German showed in pushing Kyle Edmund deep and wide in their close third-round battle was not quite there in the early exchanges. He had to take risks he could get away with against lesser players. From there, errors crept into his game. He had been 40-love up in the sixth game when a lazy forehand handed Nadal another break opportunity and he cashed, in when a return popped up off the net, to go 5-1 up after half an hour. He served out the set, untroubled. The match was then turned on its head. Zverev put his heart and soul into a fightback and he finally got a look on Nadal’s serve in the second game and forced Nadal wide enough to overstretch on his forehand for the break. Zverev held to love and, in the space of a few minutes, the complexion of the contest changed from walkover to engaging theatre to potential upset. The fourth game was pivotal – in the match and possibly in Zverev’s season. He got overexcited when he dumped a forehand when trying to pass Nadal at the net for a 4-0 lead, then lobbed long. He outfoxed him in an exchange of drop shots to grab another break point – this time sealing it with a devastating backhand down the line. His fist-pump to his box screamed defiance and resolve. The match was taking on an eerie familiarity for Nadal. In Buenos Aires 13 years ago, he beat Gastón Gaudio 0-6, 6-0, 6-1. There would be no bagel – nobody has done that to him since Roger Federer in Hamburg nine years ago – but he could not stop Zverev wrapping up the set 6-1 with another unreachable backhand. Zverev played a drop-shot to engineer the break at the start of the final frame – and, as the rain arrived, he held for 2-0. The gathering – including most of Nadal’s family – took in a gasp of warm, moist air. For Zverev, impatient to finish the job, a 22-minute pause to let the showers pass was a minor irritant. For Nadal, it allowed him time to regroup and when they resumed ever so briefly in a light drizzle he held for 2-3. Again, the rain held up the royal progress. Nadal was asking the more searching questions. His whipped forehand was down from a tournament average of 193kph to 167kph, yet he still bossed the important exchanges with angles and timing. Trailing in the serving cycle, Zverev struggled to control his temperament and his opponent. Another attacking lob drifted long and Nadal finished the job with a backhand drop shot that not even the fleet-footed Zverev could reach."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/20/john-bercow-to-face-andrea-leadsom-after-stupid-woman-row","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T18:57:06Z","webTitle":"John Bercow to face Andrea Leadsom after 'stupid woman' row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/20/john-bercow-to-face-andrea-leadsom-after-stupid-woman-row","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/20/john-bercow-to-face-andrea-leadsom-after-stupid-woman-row","fields":{"headline":"John Bercow to face Andrea Leadsom after 'stupid woman' row","bodyText":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, will face Andrea Leadsom on Monday for the first time since claims he called her “a stupid woman” after angry exchanges during Wednesday’s business in the House and a later exchange in which, it is claimed, he called the leader of the Commons a liar. Their encounter will come as MPs are set to debate a technical motion on whether the government is obstructing backbench business. Bercow has been a champion of backbench rights, and the government is accused of trying to block them. It has now emerged that after Leadsom was told of last Wednesday’s remarks, which she did not hear herself, she went to the Speaker to ask him to apologise. She can be seen on a internal House of Commons tape talking to Bercow. He seems to then wave her away. Leadsom’s office claims that he called her a liar during the exchanges. Bercow could not be reached for comment. There has been no formal complaint to the parliamentary standards commissioner since the episode, which Bercow has not denied. His office put out a statement about the difficult circumstances of the day. Leadsom is understood not to want to complain herself because she is anxious not to jeopardise the future of her independent complaints and grievance policy. The final proposals, which are due out before the summer recess in July, have to be signed off the House of Commons commission, which is chaired by Bercow. A spokesperson for Leadsom said: “Andrea is completely focused on ensuring that anyone who is bullied or treated unfairly in Parliament is able to come forward and have their concerns and complaints dealt with in an independent, rigorous and fair manner. “That is and must be her absolute priority at the moment, which is not to say that any unfair treatment she receives personally will not also be raised in the right way for her.” The Green party MP Caroline Lucas, who is on the working party refining the proposals, has said that the system is so flawed that it is not worth making complaints. Individuals can make a complaint directly to the commissioner, Kathryn Stone, but her report is then passed to the parliamentary standards committee, which has complete control over what happens to the report and what sanctions, if any, can be imposed. Although the committee has lay members, only the MPs on it have a vote. Last Tuesday, they voted to block a move to refer allegations of bullying by Bercow that led to one senior Commons official taking early retirement and a second being signed off sick. The lay members were reported to be unanimously in favour of a referral of the allegations, which related to events several years ago and had been the subject of a Newsnight investigation. Lucas has argued strongly that MPs will not restore trust unless they lose the power to control the final outcome of an inquiry into their own conduct. The counter-argument is that MPs must be able to preserve their independence and be confident that they will not be made victims of malicious complaints. When the report of the cross-party working group was published in February, it did include the possibility of reviewing the powers and structure of the parliamentary standards committee. Its chair, the Labour MP Sir Kevin Barron, has made it clear that he thinks the lay members should have a vote as well as a voice on the committee. Lucas hopes that events since February, which include the allegations against Bercow, might change MPs’ minds: “I pushed hard to make some specific stronger proposals to change the way the committee works. “I still think there’ll be a struggle to persuade all colleagues that MPs shouldn’t have the final word – but I think the most recent Newsnight stories are persuading more people that we can’t continue with the current system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/20/the-coiled-glory-of-a-cumberland-sausage","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T17:03:47Z","webTitle":"The coiled glory of a Cumberland sausage | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/20/the-coiled-glory-of-a-cumberland-sausage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/20/the-coiled-glory-of-a-cumberland-sausage","fields":{"headline":"The coiled glory of a Cumberland sausage","bodyText":"I was very moved by Owen Jones’s article about grief (12 May).

In the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, directed by Danny Boyle, we dramatised a confidence, openness and multiplicity that only a nation at ease with itself could muster. The global “soft power” of our language, cultural and scientific institutions, and international development programmes – still ringfenced by the Treasury – remains formidable. And on Saturday, hundreds of millions around the world watched the royal wedding: as glorious a fusion of pageantry and pluralism, of monarchy and modernity, as you could hope for. Yet this spirit of generous self-assurance has its evil twin. We are also the country of Brexit; of Nigel Farage; of Jacob Rees-Mogg posing outside No 10 to deliver a petition demanding cuts to the aid budget; and, most recently and shamefully, of the Windrush scandal. Which is the authentic Britain? Open or closed? Warm or frostily parochial? Both, I suppose. Most countries are, to use a word much-loved by Nick Clegg, “bicephalous”: two-headed and contradictory. The question we should ask in 2018 is: which of the two heads dominates? On my travels in the past year, I have encountered understandable confusion about our national trajectory. To crunch a complex series of perceptions into a seriously oversimplified narrative, the view from beyond our shores runs as follows: Britain was in terrible shape in 1979. Margaret Thatcher’s shock therapy, painful for a great many, laid the foundations of renewed national prosperity. Labour’s election in 1997 marked a determination to match economic growth with social justice and liberalism. According to this happy version of events, the 2012 Olympics represented the culmination of more than three decades of regenerative work: a global festival in which Britain declared itself to be both open for business and open in spirit. Into which narrative, the rusty spanner of Brexit was thrown with clanking ferocity four years later. Suddenly, Britain was declaring its furious hostility to “mass immigration”, to its putative imprisonment as a “vassal state”, to the supposed mutilation of its island heritage. Optimism had yielded to fear. We were, to quote Nigel Farage’s vile poster, at “breaking point”. You can forgive the rest of the world its perplexity. When, exactly, did Britain decide angry nativism was the way forward? This global confusion about who we are and what we want has profoundly practical consequences. Ask any senior diplomat or chief executive and they will tell you the same thing: namely, that technical detail forms the structure of any deal, alliance or treaty, but that the much more nebulous question of culture, shared ideals and emotional identity determines the foundation. Trade agreements and investment decisions are not decided by algorithm alone. Each side must ask: what sort of partner am I aligning myself with? Will my employees be heading towards an outstretched hand or a “hostile environment”? If I had to single out the principal cause of our national identity crisis, I would cite the catastrophic absence of leadership on immigration policy. The issue has maddened us, unnecessarily and tragically. It has drained much of our national confidence, made us mean, bred an uncharitable insularity. In their words, deeds and tactical silences, politicians of both main parties have allowed a series of myths to enter and settle into mainstream discourse: that migrants depress wages and take jobs from indigenous citizens; that migrants are a drain on the taxpayer; that only the “metropolitan elite” benefits from migrant labour; that migrants are more likely to commit crimes. All this is rubbish, and deserves to be robustly and repeatedly dismissed as such – not left to fester in the national consciousness. I also believe immigration is culturally enriching. But then I have skin in the game (the surname is a clue). So let us concentrate on economic necessity. A familiar refrain of pro-Brexit MPs is that their constituents were somehow “not consulted” on recent immigration. To which the only answer should be: oh yes they were. They were consulted when they voted repeatedly for an NHS that has the capacity to treat them – an objective that would be unthinkable without migrant labour. They made a decision in favour of immigration when they opted for low-price consumer goods, for rapid delivery services, for facilities and shops that are open around the clock. They chose. We all did. It is outrageous hypocrisy to pretend otherwise. In cabinet, I am told, even the arch-Brexiteers declare that national prosperity should not be sacrificed to the achievement of arbitrarily low net migration targets. Well, thanks a lot. Now they spot the flaw in the plan. To be fair to the Brexit secretary, David Davis, he has repeatedly conceded that immigration policy post-Brexit will require many exemptions to meet the needs of the labour market. And as for all those shiny trade deals we are promised after 29 March 2019: the immigration minister, Caroline Nokes, told a Commons committee in February that visas could “absolutely” be exchanged for commercial access in future negotiations. Brexit encapsulates this cognitive dissonance and its damaging consequences: it is about much more than our institutional relationship with the EU. I long for political leaders with the courage and candour to declare that the great challenges facing this country – automation, fiscal fairness, entrenched poverty, human longevity – have nothing to do with immigration, race or the much-needed influx of newcomers.

In a speech in Macclesfield on Monday that is being billed as the first of a series on industrial strategy, May will say: “Late diagnosis of otherwise treatable illnesses is one of the biggest causes of avoidable deaths. “The development of smart technologies to analyse great quantities of data quickly and with a higher degree of accuracy than is possible by human beings, opens up a whole new field of medical research and gives us a new weapon in our armoury in the fight against disease.” May wants industry and charities to work with the NHS to develop algorithms that can use patient data and lifestyle information to warn GPs when a patient should be referred to an oncologist or another specialist. The plans envisage at least 50,000 people being diagnosed at an early stage of prostate, ovarian, lung or bowel cancer each year. It is thought that AI could help prevent 22,000 deaths from cancer each year by 2033, and give patients an additional five years of healthy, independent life by 2035. The NHS has amassed a huge and valuable collection of data from its universal cradle-to-grave service. Very few other providers have access to comparable data. The government believes internet companies that are used to very large-scale data analysis could take a mix of genetic and medical data to produce algorithms able to swiftly generate information for a GP. But the proposal would also include allowing commercial firms access to NHS data for profit, raising controversial questions about the ethics of data sharing, privacy, and making money from a public asset. The prime minister anticipated the risk of opposition in her Davos speech in January, when she spelt out plans for a council on data ethics. Although the figures are steadily improving, the UK has less good outcomes for common cancers such as bowel, breast, ovarian and prostate cancer, than most other comparable economies. Campaigners blame funding shortages, but research by the King’s Fund also found that hugely increased demand also played a key role in making it increasingly hard to meet targets. According to the health thinktank, the 18-week referral-to-treatment standard for planned care has not been met since February 2016, and the 62-day cancer standard for more than three years. There are also concerns about staff shortages delaying test results and diagnosis. A Downing Street spokesman said the plan was a long-term investment. Digital strategies that could speed diagnosis and accuracy would lead to earlier and cheaper intervention. Late intervention is often invasive and expensive and ultimately unsuccessful. Sir Harpal Kumar, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, welcomed the announcement. “If this infrastructure enabled us to reduce late diagnosis by half in the next 15 years, then for just four types of cancers – lung, bowel, prostate and ovary – 22,000 fewer people each year would die within five years of their diagnosis. “Our goal is that three in four people will survive their cancer by 2034 and we support efforts that will help us achieve this ambition.” The government’s industrial strategy is based on incentivising technological innovation. Over £1.4bn has been invested in research and development to support the Grand Challenge programme. There are four Grand Challenges reflecting global trends. They include artificial intelligence and the data economy; clean growth; healthy ageing; and the future of mobility. So far investment has been put into reducing domestic energy consumption and better building methods, work on improving the health of the ageing population, and the Faraday battery challenge to improve energy storage. • This article was amended on 22 May 2018 because Theresa May’s speech was set to be in Macclesfield, not Mansfield as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/21/saracens-exeter-premiership-final","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T09:00:22Z","webTitle":"Exeter and Saracens show pedigree to promise spectacular grand finale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/21/saracens-exeter-premiership-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/21/saracens-exeter-premiership-final","fields":{"headline":"Exeter and Saracens show pedigree to promise spectacular grand finale","bodyText":"Major finals featuring the competition’s two best teams peaking at precisely the right moment are surprisingly few in number. Not this year. When it really counted Saracens and Exeter performed as well as they have done all season in their respective semi-finals on Saturday, paving the way for a rip-roaring Premiership finale at Twickenham. If Saracens were spectacular at times in their 57-33 destruction of Wasps, the Chiefs were even more dominant in crushing Newcastle 36-5 at Sandy Park. The two top teams in the end-of-season table have raised their play-off games and neither sounds inclined to settle for consolatory pats on the back on Saturday. It says a lot about Exeter’s consistency over the past 18 months that, on paper, Rob Baxter’s defending champions boast the slimmest of edges. Having finished eight points clear of Saracens in the regular season and beaten their north London rivals home and away, they play relentlessly to their strengths and will back themselves to fight to the finish just as they did in their extra-time victory over Wasps a year ago. One key statistic also suggests they are a club still on the rise. Of the XV who kicked off the final against Wasps last May, just four started Saturday’s semi-final despite virtually everyone being fit. Even popular elder statesmen like Gareth Steenson and Thomas Waldrom are on the bench these days, having been superseded by the Simmonds brothers from Teignmouth. Breaking into the Exeter line-up is increasingly as tough as the actual games. With Dave Ewers also returning to his best and Don Armand continuing to make a mockery of his exclusion from England’s summer tour party, the Saracens pack can expect a much heavier-duty contest than Wasps could supply. While Maro Itoje, Mako Vunipola and Vincent Koch are all finishing the domestic season in impressive fashion, the possibility of Billy Vunipola’s tight hamstring limiting his final involvement might just give the Chiefs further cause for cautious optimism. Armand, for one, feels the days of Exeter being overawed by big occasions are long gone. “We are not going to be starstruck by the fact it is the final,” he said. “We just have to pitch up and do what we do. We will take it in our stride, take the learnings of the last two years and hopefully make it work in our favour.” No team containing Itoje, Owen Farrell or the Vunipolas could ever be described as vulnerable, but their next opponents certainly do not view them as invincible. “They have certainly started hitting their straps but we have had very good results against them over the last three or four years,” said Armand. “We know how to play them, we know how to play our game and it is going to be an exciting match. We need to make sure we pitch up and bring what Exeter brings.” While Armand is doing his best to remain diplomatic on the England selection front – “Obviously I am disappointed but we are in a final and I have bigger things to focus on at the moment” – a second consecutive Premiership crown for Exeter would reopen the debate about England’s best options a year out from the World Cup. Henry Slade and Sam Simmonds are in outstanding form, Alec Hepburn makes other loosehead props look positively lethargic and the 21-year-old Joe Simmonds will approach Twickenham full of confidence despite never having played there before. The ultimate test, though, still awaits the young fly-half who kicked a nerveless 19 points against Newcastle to set alongside tries from Nic White, Olly Woodman and Armand. His opposite number Farrell knows Twickenham rather better and slotted 11 out of 11 kicks against Wasps in a display that impressed his team-mates and coaches alike. “The guy’s incredible,” said his Lions Test colleague Jamie George. “He just keeps getting better and better. From what we’ve seen here, the more leadership and responsibility he is given, the better he gets.” Coincidentally, Farrell is due to have his stag weekend on the same weekend as Dylan Hartley, from whom he has just inherited the England tour captaincy, and Saracens’ director of rugby, Mark McCall, feels Eddie Jones has an increasingly key decision to make at No 10 in South Africa. “Owen had a brilliant game and was outstanding for us,” said McCall. “It is going to be a big call for Eddie where he plays him in South Africa. For me his best position is at 10 but I know Owen is happy to play wherever is best for the team.” This week, though, will be all about satisfying Saracens’ ambition to avoid a trophy-less season for the first time since 2013-14. “This is our fourth final in five years and we have been in three Champions Cup finals in five years,” said McCall. “To have those kind of tallies is an incredible achievement from the whole group but we want to go and win it now. You saw in the first 20 minutes against Wasps – which was maybe as good as we have ever played – the real intent and desire in the group to do that.” Two seasons ago, Sarries defeated a slightly off-key Exeter 28-20 in the final, but this year’s rematch could be a modern classic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/24/facebook-accused-of-conducting-mass-surveillance-through-its-apps","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T12:01:56Z","webTitle":"Facebook accused of conducting mass surveillance through its apps","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/24/facebook-accused-of-conducting-mass-surveillance-through-its-apps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/24/facebook-accused-of-conducting-mass-surveillance-through-its-apps","fields":{"headline":"Facebook accused of conducting mass surveillance through its apps","bodyText":"Facebook used its apps to gather information about users and their friends, including some who had not signed up to the social network, reading their text messages, tracking their locations and accessing photos on their phones, a court case in California alleges. The claims of what would amount to mass surveillance are part of a lawsuit brought against the company by the former startup Six4Three, listed in legal documents filed at the superior court in San Mateo as part of a court case that has been ongoing for more than two years. A Facebook spokesperson said that Six4Three’s “claims have no merit, and we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously”. Facebook did not directly respond to questions about surveillance. Documents filed in the court last week draw upon extensive confidential emails and messages between Facebook senior executives, which are currently sealed. Facebook has deployed a feature of California law, designed to protect freedom of speech, to argue that the case should be dismissed. Six4Three is opposing that motion. The allegations about surveillance appear in a January filing, the fifth amended complaint made by Six4Three. It alleges that Facebook used a range of methods, some adapted to the different phones that users carried, to collect information it could use for commercial purposes. “Facebook continued to explore and implement ways to track users’ location, to track and read their texts, to access and record their microphones on their phones, to track and monitor their usage of competitive apps on their phones, and to track and monitor their calls,” one court document says. But all details about the mass surveillance scheme have been redacted on Facebook’s request in Six4Three’s most recent filings. Facebook claims these are confidential business matters. It has until next Tuesday to submit a claim to the court for the documents to remain sealed from public view. The developer is suing Facebook over the failure of its app Pikinis, which allowed users to zero in on photos of their friends in bikinis and other swimwear. It claims the social media company lured developers and investors on to the platform by intentionally misleading them about data controls and privacy settings. As part of the January filing, it claims Facebook tracked users extensively, sometimes without consent. On Android phones, the company was able to collect metadata and content from text messages, the lawsuit alleges. On iPhones it could access most photos, including those that had not been uploaded to Facebook, Six4Three claims. Other alleged projects included one to remotely activate Bluetooth, allowing the company to pinpoint a user’s location without them explicitly agreeing to it. Another involved the development of privacy settings with an early end date that was not flagged to users, letting them expire without notice, the court documents claim. In a submission to the court, an “anti-Slapp motion” under Californian legislation designed to protect freedom of speech, Facebook said: “Six4Three is taking its fifth shot at an ever-expanding set of claims and all of its claim turn on one decision, which is absolutely protected: Facebook’s editorial decision to stop publishing certain user-generated content via its Platform to third-party app developers.” One court filing, referring to a period in 2013 and 2014, alleges: “Facebook made partial disclosures around this time regarding privacy settings, but did not fully disclose that it had caused certain settings to lapse after a period of time.” The lawsuit claims the ability to read text messages on Android phones was also partially disclosed, presented to users as a way to make logging in easier, but Facebook deployed it to collect a range of other messages and the associated metadata. It also collected information sent by non-subscribers to friends or contacts who had Facebook apps installed on their phones, the court documents claim. Because these people would not have been Facebook users, it would have been impossible for them to have consented to Facebook’s collection of their data. “Facebook disclosed publicly that it was reading text messages in order to authenticate users more easily ... [but] this partial disclosure failed to state accurately the type of data Facebook was accessing, the timeframe over which it had accessed it, and the reasons for accessing the data of these Android users,” the complaint alleges. “Facebook used this data to give certain Facebook products and features an unfair competitive advantage over other social applications on Facebook Platform.” Facebook admitted recently that it had collected call and text message data from users, but said it only did so with prior consent. However the Guardian has reported that it logged some messages without explicitly notifying users. The company could not see text messages for iPhone users but could access any photos taken on a phone or stored on the built-in “camera roll” archive system, the court case alleged. It has not disclosed how they were analysed. Facebook has not fully disclosed the manner in which it pre-processes photos on the iOS camera roll, meaning if a user has any Facebook app installed on their iPhone, then Facebook accesses and analyses the photos the user takes and/or stores on the iPhone, the complainant alleges. Facebook has an option to “sync” photos taken on the phones with the app downloaded, which it says users need to opt into to use."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/25/j-balvin-vibras-review-latin-superstar-brings-reggaeton-to-heel","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T08:30:41Z","webTitle":"J Balvin: Vibras review – Latin superstar brings reggaeton to heel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/25/j-balvin-vibras-review-latin-superstar-brings-reggaeton-to-heel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/25/j-balvin-vibras-review-latin-superstar-brings-reggaeton-to-heel","fields":{"headline":"J Balvin: Vibras review – Latin superstar brings reggaeton to heel","bodyText":"Reggaeton has been huge in Latin America for more than a decade, but few artists have achieved the worldwide success J Balvin did in 2017 with his track Mi Gente. The video has 1.8bn views on YouTube, it reached No 3 in the US, and Beyoncé hopped on a remix. Included here, it features a loud beat and singalong chorus, as does Machika, which has too many horn sounds and feels quite disjointed, lacking the sheer Latin pride of Mi Gente. But Balvin often deploys a smoother kind of reggaeton with hints of trap and dancehall; in Latin America, reggaeton is still thought of as repetitive and only suitable for dancefloors, but he explores its wider potential. En Mí opens with a soft rattle that helps to build a sweeter take, thanks to Balvin’s mellow and slightly Auto-Tuned vocals, plus the pleasingly aquatic synth sounds; No Es Justo offsets a sharp reggaeton beat with acoustic guitar to make a sunny track with the help of Puerto Rican duo Zion &amp; Lennox. Sexuality plays a big role in reggaeton lyrics, but the aggressive misogyny of the first years of the genre has decreased: Balvin seduces by describing the chemistry of dancing, but he also sings about wanting to talk and get back with his ex in Dónde Estarás, and even adds “I like how easily you understand me” in En Mí – quite a big step in reggaeton. His vocals sound best when going from a fast-singing cadence to deep, calm rapping, as on Ahora and Ambiente. Since he released Ginza in 2015, Balvin and his longtime producer Sky have relied on a clever combination of few elements – beat, synth line, bass – to prize subtlety over grandiosity. A good example is Brillo, a sensual track where the delicate and versatile vocals of Spanish flamenco singer Rosalía shine over a minimal background. Tracks such as this still make Vibras perfect as a party playlist, but confirm that the noisy style of early reggaeton hits such as Daddy Yankee’s Gasolina is slowly being left behind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/22/the-guardian-view-on-goves-clean-air-plan-just-hot-air","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T17:32:39Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Gove’s clean air plan: just hot air | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/22/the-guardian-view-on-goves-clean-air-plan-just-hot-air","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/22/the-guardian-view-on-goves-clean-air-plan-just-hot-air","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Gove’s clean air plan: just hot air","bodyText":"Michael Gove, the environment secretary, made his name during the Brexit campaign for quipping that “the people have had enough of experts” and likening economists who warned against leaving the European Union to Nazi propagandists against Einstein. Mr Gove knows how to attract an audience. Nor has he discarded his insight that the public, if presented with facts that contradict a deeply held belief, will ditch the facts. This week Mr Gove was at it again: making headlines without making policy. The cabinet minister produced a clean air strategy which purported to tackle a public health crisis by getting families to open their windows more often because “air pollution inside the home can often be higher than outside”. This is true, but it smacks of the kind simplistic commonsense answer that Mr Gove favours because it avoids the knotty trade-offs called for in any policy, be it Brexit or the environment. The main contributor to the air quality crisis, one that sees thousands of lives ended prematurely, is road transport – a subject about which Mr Gove has strangely little to say. Instead, his plan envisages local authorities finding the cash, presumably by defunding libraries or other essential public goods, to pay for an army of local inspectors to check the dryness of the wood being sold on petrol station forecourts that is used as fuel for stoves. Given his policy’s impotence, it would be absurd to say Mr Gove is taking the issue seriously. As lives are at stake, it is actually offensive. It is also audacious to argue, as the environment secretary did, that “Brexit will allow us to clean up Britain’s air” when his government’s air pollution plan has been rejected by the courts three times because it failed to meet legal limits set by the EU eight years ago. It becomes outrageous when one knows that Mr Gove’s strategy is a response to an EU air quality law that set legally binding emission reduction targets for five pollutants. The question is whether such a committed Brexiter would develop such a strategy if we were not in the EU? Mr Gove’s record of pushing for deregulation and repressing teaching on climate change in schools bodes ill. He was found to be acting illegally under EU laws, which can be disappeared from March 2019. Who will hold the government to account following Brexit? Will it be Mr Gove’s environmental watchdog, one so toothless it can only scare ministers into meeting standards by issuing advisory notices? If that is the enforcement agency, then every climate sceptic and fossil fuel fan ought to be celebrating in the streets. If ministers are serious about dealing with a public health emergency that is “cutting lives short, damaging children’s health and poisoning our natural environment”, then they will have to change the car culture in this country and support that kind of change in behaviour by going with the grain of what people want to do, which is to be sustainably mobile. The government needs to encourage a virtuous circle of declining car use coupled with increasing use of greener modes of public transport. This needs cash, and crucially must allow local government to charge motorists to use road space. Ministers will have to face down the motor lobby and embrace electric cars, as they have done in Norway. Charging car batteries from central power stations is more efficient than burning fuel in separate engines. If Mr Gove wants to be remembered for more than just PR stunts that divert attention from a trick being pulled, he should adopt a policy that hastens the demise of the internal combustion engine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/22/letters-tessa-jowell-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T17:16:15Z","webTitle":"Letters: Tessa Jowell obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/22/letters-tessa-jowell-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/22/letters-tessa-jowell-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Letters: Tessa Jowell obituary","bodyText":"Sebastian Kraemer writes: During our Tavistock clinic training in family therapy in the late 1970s, Tessa Jowell and I were co-therapists with a particularly complex case.

The trade minister, Steve Ciobo, has said Australia would aim for a “high-quality, comprehensive free trade deal with the European Union in as quick a time as possible” but would not “sacrifice the quality of a trade deal for speed”. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon At a press conference in Canberra on Wednesday Malcolm Turnbull announced that the EU had agreed to a mandate to negotiate a free trade agreement with Australia. The prime minister said free trade was “key to my government’s plan” for economic growth and the EU deal would “create more jobs in Australia and it will create more jobs in Europe”. “It is not a zero-sum game.” Asked about European resistance to reducing agricultural barriers, including the French president Emanuel Macron’s assurances that French farmers would not be affected, Turnbull said Australia imported more agricultural products from Europe than it exported. That fact “tells you a lot about how relatively little access Australian farmers have to Europe”, he said. “There is a huge amount of scope for more access to the European market.” Turnbull praised Macron, saying that he and Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, had pushed to allow EU negotiations with Australia to get under way. Ciobo said Australia wanted to conclude the EU deal “as quick as we practicably can” but added: “I’ve always said I won’t sacrifice the quality of a trade deal for speed.” “A good-quality trade deal with Europe will include enhanced agricultural access for Australian exporters.” Ciobo said Australia exported $3.6bn of agricultural products to the EU and impored $4.9bn and that “had to change”. But he said agriculture was only “one aspect” of a trade deal. In a statement Turnbull said the Coalition would also seek “better access for Australian services exporters; [to] expand two-way investment flows; and deliver a more seamless business environment”. “We will explore rules and initiatives to support the digital economy and innovation, which are important for small and medium-sized enterprises.” The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has vowed to complete the EU’s talks with Australia and New Zealand by 31 October 2019, when his time in office expires. The UK will not be able to start its negotiations over future trade with New Zealand and Australia until 30 March 2019. Earlier, speaking to ABC’s AM, Ciobo insisted the talks would happen “in parallel” with free trade negotiations with the UK. “That’s progressing, these things are happening in parallel. It’s not a case of it being black or white, it’s a case of doing both of these together.” Turnbull trumpeted his government’s achievements on free trade, including a new deal with Peru and reviving the Trans-Pacific Partnership with 11 nations, despite the withdrawal of the US. He said Australia was also in “advanced negotiations with Indonesia”. Given the combined GDP of US$1.7tn of the EU, a deal with the regional bloc would potentially be Australia’s largest free trade agreement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/22/congress-passes-partial-dodd-frank-rollback-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T23:35:55Z","webTitle":"US Congress passes partial Dodd-Frank rollback in move to deregulate banking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/22/congress-passes-partial-dodd-frank-rollback-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/22/congress-passes-partial-dodd-frank-rollback-trump","fields":{"headline":"US Congress passes partial Dodd-Frank rollback in move to deregulate banking","bodyText":"The US Congress on Tuesday passed a partial rollback of banking rules put in place to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, sending the bill for Donald Trump’s signature, in what amounts to a major step in the administration’s plan to return to a more deregulated banking system. While the measure does not entirely repeal the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, as many Republicans wanted, the legislation lifts the threshold at which banks are deemed too big to fail and releases smaller and medium sized banks from stricter capital and planning requirements. Critics argued that the measures would increase the prospect of future taxpayer bailouts and rejected claims that the post-crisis measures had subjected financial services industries to excessive compliance regulations that stifled growth. Support for the legislation split Democrats. “This is not a bill that benefits consumers. It is a big-bank bonanza,” the congressman Al Green, of Texas, said in debate before the vote. The bill would make a fivefold increase, to $250bn, in the level of assets at which banks are deemed to pose a potential threat if they failed. Among the institutions expected to benefit from the change in threshold are BB&amp;T, SunTrust Banks, Fifth Third Bank and American Express. Congressman Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who heads the House financial services committee, said “Main Street” – ie consumer banks – “have been suffering for years under the weight” of the Dodd-Frank regulations. “Help is on the way,” Hensarling said. “Today is an important day in the history of economic opportunity in America.” US banks’ net income climbed to $56bn in the January-March quarter, a 27.5% increase from a year earlier, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

I pray a lot at that particular moment. I don’t sleep at night,” he said. Mansaray and 24 other African migrants had set out from the African nation of Cape Verde in April, on what they were told by the two Brazilian crewmen would be a relatively quick and easy voyage to a new country where they hoped to find work. This weekend, they were rescued by fishermen 80 miles off the coast of Brazil, after an incredible 3,000km (1,864-mile) journey across the Atlantic. The men, from Senegal, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau had been at sea for 35 days – the last few days without food and water. Details have now begun to emerge of the men’s terrifying and chaotic voyage in a 12-metre catamaran barely big enough for them to squeeze on. When food and water ran out, some even drank sea water and urine. “After 35 days of journey in these conditions it is really lucky that nobody died,” said Luis Almeida, head of the federal police’s immigration department in São Luís, the capital of Maranhão state. “There was not a cabin for all of them, so they were exposed to a lot of sun and solar radiation during these 35 days,” he said. The rescued men were disorientated, dehydrated and some had problems seeing after so long exposed to the glare of sun reflected on the waves. Almeida said the case was unprecedented: African stowaways have been found on cargo ships in Maranhão ports before, but this was the first time a boatload of migrants had arrived in the state. The two Brazilians also on the boat were arrested for promoting illegal immigrations. The journey began in the island nation of Cape Verde, 400 miles west of Senegal. Mansaray, a Muslim from Freetown in Sierra Leone, had moved there five years ago to study science and technology with hopes of becoming a teacher. He studied for two years but was struggling to pay his university fees and working as a cellphone repairman. “They called me the cellphone doctor,” he told the Guardian by phone from São Luís. A friend who is a student in São Paulo told him he could study for free in Brazil’s biggest city and would be able to send money home to his elderly parents and sister in Freetown. “I said, cool, that’s why I got that boat,” he said. He said he had been introduced to a Brazilian on the street and then paid $700 (£521) for what he was told would be a 22-day passage. He became scared when he saw the size of the vessel he was about to cross the Atlantic on. “I am the last to arrive, when I enter on the boat, a lot of guys, oh my God, is this going to be safe all of us?” he said. “How can I do this journey? Because I am already in, I cannot discourage other people, so I find courage and go.” ‘The motor broke, and the sail broke’ Others had paid more on the promise that they would be given food, but within 10 days the food had run out, so the men survived on two biscuits or a few spoonfuls of food each day. One day, one man caught a fish with a rope. “We boiled a fish, and everybody eat,” Mansaray said. But the mast snapped when one of the boat’s crew was trying to tie it to the other side of the boat, he said, and the motor would not work because the crew had mixed kerosene and diesel. A storm came as a relief because at least there was rainwater to drink. Elhadji Mountakha Beye, 36, was hit on the head when the mast broke and has been left with a scar. The mechanic from Dakar in Senegal had previously lived in Cape Verde, and paid €1,000 (£877) for his passage in the hope of finding work in Brazil where he hoped to meet up with a Senegalese friend in São Paulo. “There is better work there than in Senegal,” he said. He described a hellish journey. “It was tiring, there was no food, the food ran out, the water ran out,” he said. “Just on that sea. The motor broke, and the sail broke. Now just wait for someone to help us.” Just as the situation was becoming dire, the men aboard the drifting vessel spotted a fishing boat and signalled that they were in distress. The fishermen, from nearby Ceará state, towed the catamaran to the nearby port of São José de Ribamar. “The next day someone would have died,” Moisés dos Santos, one of the fishermen, told reporters when the men landed. “They said they ate two biscuits a day. They even drank urine, that’s what they say, they told us. We felt very honoured to save the lives of a lot of people.” The men were met by a medical team from the Maranhão state government’s secretariat of human rights, taken to a health post for checks and then housed in a local gymnasium. “All of them said life was precarious in their origin countries and they all have relatives or people they know living in Brazil. They were looking for a better life and to work in Brazil,” said Jonata Galvão, the state’s adjunct secretary for human rights. Federal police said they were now evaluating a “migratory solution” for the men to stay in Brazil. “We are not criminals. We are hard-working guys. So I believe that the government will help us to do that,” Mantsaray said. “It is my dream, and I believe my dream will come true with the help of God, and I can support my family back home.” This story was amended on 23 May 2018 to correct the length of the journey across the Atlantic. It is 3,000km, not 3,000 miles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/22/stoke-city-appoint-gary-rowett-new-manager-leaves-derby","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T20:18:45Z","webTitle":"Stoke City appoint Gary Rowett as manager on three-year contract","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/22/stoke-city-appoint-gary-rowett-new-manager-leaves-derby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/22/stoke-city-appoint-gary-rowett-new-manager-leaves-derby","fields":{"headline":"Stoke City appoint Gary Rowett as manager on three-year contract","bodyText":"Stoke City have appointed Gary Rowett as their new manager on a three-year contract after agreeing a compensation package with Derby County. They will be looking to him to bring about an immediate return to the Premier League after replacing Paul Lambert, who left the club last Friday after their relegation to the Championship. “This has come round quite quickly but I am absolutely delighted to make the move to such an ambitious football club,” Rowett told the club’s official website. “This is a club that has been established in the Premier League for some time and the challenge for me now is to get Stoke City back into that division as soon as possible,” the 44-year-old added. Rowett has agreed a move after asking his former club, Derby, permission to talk to the Stoke board on Monday. Rowett led the Rams to this season’s play-off semi-finals, where they lost to Fulham, and previously managed Burton Albion and Birmingham City. “There are certain things to do now and to get right but the undoubted ambition of myself and the people above me is to take this club back up as soon as we possibly can,” Rowett added. “You have to be robust enough to face 46 games, have the correct mentality to approach going to varying grounds, and you have to be ready to match the quality of opponents too because the standard of this league has gone up enormously.” Peter and John Coates, the club’s chairman and vice-chairman, said in a statement: “We are delighted to be able to move so quickly to secure Gary’s services and we are now looking forward to working with him towards our objective of returning to the Premier League as soon as possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/may/28/what-is-cbd-cannabidiol-cannabis-medical-uses","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T11:00:52Z","webTitle":"What is CBD?

The 'miracle' cannabis compound that doesn't get you high","bodyText":"In early May, a federal court declined to protect cannabidiol (CBD), a chemical produced by the cannabis plant, from federal law enforcement, despite widespread belief in its medical value. The ruling was contrary to existing evidence, which suggests the chemical is safe and could have multiple important uses as medicine. Many cannabis advocates consider it a miracle medicine, capable of relieving conditions as disparate as depression, arthritis and diabetes. The perception of its widespread medical benefits have made the chemical a rallying cry for legalization advocates. The first thing to know about CBD is that it is not psychoactive; it doesn’t get people high. The primary psychoactive ingredient in marijuana is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). But THC is only one of the scores of chemicals – known as cannabinoids – produced by the cannabis plant. So far, CBD is the most promising compound from both a marketing and a medical perspective. Many users believe it helps them relax, despite it not being psychoactive, and some believe regular doses help stave off Alzheimer’s and heart disease. While studies have shown CBD to have anti-inflammatory, anti-pain and anti-psychotic properties, it has seen only minimal testing in human clinical trials, where scientists determine what a drug does, how much patients should take, its side effects and so on. Despite the government ruling, CBD is widely available over the counter in dispensaries in states where marijuana is legal. CBD first came to public attention in a 2013 CNN documentary called Weed. The piece, reported by Dr Sanjay Gupta, featured a little girl in Colorado named Charlotte, who had a rare life-threatening form of epilepsy called Dravet syndrome. At age five, Charlotte suffered 300 grand mal seizures a week, and was constantly on the brink of a medical emergency. Through online research, Charlotte’s desperate parents heard of treating Dravet with CBD. It was controversial to pursue medical marijuana for such a young patient, but when they gave Charlotte oil extracted from high-CBD cannabis, her seizures stopped almost completely. In honor of her progress, high-CBD cannabis is sometimes known as Charlotte’s Web. After Charlotte’s story got out, hundreds of families relocated to Colorado where they could procure CBD for their children, though not all experienced such life-changing results. Instead of moving, other families obtained CBD oil through the illegal distribution networks. In late June, the US Food and Drug Administration could approve the Epidiolex, a pharmaceuticalized form of CBD for several severe pediatric seizure disorders. According to data recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the drug can reduce seizures by more than 40%. If Epidiolex wins approval it would be the first time the agency approves a drug derived from the marijuana plant. (The FDA has approved synthetic THC to treat chemotherapy-related nausea.) Epidiolex was developed by the London-based GW Pharmaceuticals, which grows cannabis on tightly controlled farms in the UK. It embarked on the Epidiolex project in 2013, as anecdotes of CBD’s value as an epilepsy drug began emerging from the US. While parents treating their children with CBD had to proceed based on trial and error, like a folk medicine, they also had to wonder whether dispensary purchased CBD was professionally manufactured and contained what the package said it did. GW brought a scientific understanding and pharmaceutical grade manufacturing to this promising compound. Fortunately, like THC, CBD appears to be well tolerated; as far as I can tell, there are no recorded incidents of fatal CBD overdoses. Since Weed first aired, GW’s stock has climbed 1,500%. GW’s first drug Sativex, which contains both CBD and THC, is available as a treatment for MS-related spasticity in Canada, Australia, and much of Europe and Latin America. The company is also studying cannabinoid-based drugs as a treatment for autism spectrum disorders, an aggressive brain tumor called glioblastoma, and schizophrenia. Other industries, not subject to the strict regulations governing pharmaceuticals are eager to develop their own CBD products, everything from joints and vape pens to skin creams and edibles which may or may not have valid medical use. In Los Angeles, it’s among the latest wellness fads. It can be found in cocktails, and an upscale juice shop will even add a few drops of CBD infused olive oil to a beverage for $3.50.

The Germany midfielder said it was a “great achievement” for Liverpool to have reached Kiev but denied that their motivation would be any greater than Madrid’s as he prepares to face a familiar opponent in the shape of the former Borussia Dortmund manager Jürgen Klopp. Kroos, who played Klopp’s sides often while at Bayern Munich, including in the 2013 Champions League final at Wembley, said: “Whenever we faced his teams it was difficult; at Bayern, we always had a lot of problems against Dortmund. Always. That is what I expect on Saturday. His teams are always aggressive, they press you a lot – for 90 minutes. They are highly motivated. I expect a very tough game for us but with opportunities to win. “My feeling is that [Klopp] is happy there,” Kroos added. “It is a great achievement for Liverpool to reach a final and to have a chance to win the Champions League. In my experience, it is always tough to play his teams, they always have more or less the same style. “So, I know for sure that it will be a very difficult game for us on Saturday. I know how he is able to motivate his teams, he gives them good tactics and I am sure it will be difficult, but I am also sure it is going to be difficult for Liverpool. They’ll be 11 animals, all really up for it, we’ll be better on the ball but they’re going to put us under pressure for 90 minutes and will be at 100% or even more. We’re expecting an aggressive Liverpool, who have a really quick forward line, but we can stop them,” he said. “They’re different to us and maybe don’t touch the ball as much, but they’re really rough, competitive, aggressive and really strong at the back. For them it’s an opportunity, they’ve not been in the final for more than 10 years and I don’t think they were expecting to get here so for that I think they’re going to give their all. “Both teams are hungry; I don’t see a favourite [and] I don’t see Liverpool having more hunger or anything,” Kroos added. “To reach a Champions League final you can’t be a bad team. I don’t see a favourite, Liverpool beat Manchester City, one of the big favourites. We can be a favourite as well. If you reach three Champions League finals in a row it shows you must be top in terms of motivation. If not, you don’t beat Paris, Juventus and Bayern in a row. Reaching three consecutive finals gives confidence but it does no mean we are any less motivated.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/22/england-squad-racial-abuse-fears-russia-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T21:30:06Z","webTitle":"England players concerned by possible racial abuse of family and friends","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/22/england-squad-racial-abuse-fears-russia-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/22/england-squad-racial-abuse-fears-russia-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"England players concerned by possible racial abuse of family and friends","bodyText":"Concerns have been expressed within England’s multi-ethnic World Cup squad over bringing family and friends to the tournament, given fears that they could become targets for racial abuse in Russia. The Football Association is working closely with players to ensure those family members who wish to go to the tournament will be safe but some squad members have expressed private concerns about potential problems. The experiences of the young Liverpool forward Rhian Brewster have been noted by the players, the teenager having lodged a complaint with Uefa after alleged racial abuse from the Spartak Moscow captain, Leonid Mironov, during a Uefa Youth League game last December. That investigation was dropped by the governing body, which said it could find no evidence against Mironov after an inquiry which involved interviewing five players from each side and the match officials from the game at Prenton Park. Kick It Out said it was “deeply disappointed” with that result, with Liverpool praising Brewster’s “courage”. Mironov had denied the allegation. Fifa confirmed this month that the Russian football association had been fined 30,000 Swiss francs (£22,000) after fans racially abused France players during a friendly in St Petersburg, where the England players’ family and friends would most likely stay. Monkey chants had been aimed at several black players during Les Bleus’ 3-1 win in March. Zenit St Petersburg were twice charged by Uefa last season following incidents of fan racism. The FA has confirmed that England’s planning for the tournament will include preparing players for possible racial abuse, with Pippa Grange, a psychologist and the head of people and team development at the governing body, to cover in her World Cup workshops how to cope with racist incidents. England’s players will not leave the pitch if they are victims as that runs the risk of being excluded from the tournament. Fifa protocol is that the match referee should be informed and he will in turn tell the fourth official. Gareth Southgate has previously stressed that countries, including England, must also “get our house in order” over racism in football but the manager is aware of the history of the problem in Russia. “We work with our players on how we will support each other if anything like that was to happen,” he said. “The most important thing is that internally we are able to support our players if something does happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/24/david-hogg-parkland-shooting-gun-control-activism","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T10:00:50Z","webTitle":"Parkland survivor David Hogg aims to 'create the NRA – except for the opposite issues'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/24/david-hogg-parkland-shooting-gun-control-activism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/24/david-hogg-parkland-shooting-gun-control-activism","fields":{"headline":"Parkland survivor David Hogg aims to 'create the NRA – except for the opposite issues'","bodyText":"In the past three months, David Hogg has helped organize a protest march that mobilized hundreds of thousands of people around the world. He and his younger sister have written a book about the birth of a new, youth-led gun control movement after the school shooting at their high school in Parkland, Florida. And when a Fox News host mocked him for not getting into college, the 18-year-old sparked an advertiser boycott of her show. But the real impact of Hogg and his fellow Parkland students’ activism will depend almost entirely on what happens in November’s midterm elections – whether he and other teenage gun violence prevention activists can deliver on their vow to get National Rifle Association-backed candidates voted out of office. That’s why Hogg is looking at voter data in places like Republican congresswoman Mia Love’s district in Utah. “The youth voter turnout rate is around 6%. Six!” Hogg said in an interview with the Guardian on Monday in New York, where he was accepting an award for his advocacy. Love, he said, had received about $63,000 from the NRA. “If we can double the turnout rate, we could probably change the election, and get someone that’s not supported by the NRA elected,” Hogg said. His full goal: for youth turnout in Utah to be “80%. At least.” Hogg wasn’t necessarily going to be focusing on Love’s district, he said. “It’s just a case example.” Over the summer, Hogg and other March for Our Lives organizers will be working on what they hope will be “the largest voter registration push for youth ever in American history”. Rather than heading to college after he graduates from high school later this spring, he said: “I’m going to be working on a candidate basis over the fall in key congressional districts.” To break the stalemate of the gun control debate – a stalemate upheld by Republican lawmakers’ belief that the NRA can mobilize crucial votes for or against them – Hogg and his fellow teenage activists need a targeted strategy, one that mirrors the focused, reliable political activism of the NRA. Hogg, a skinny teenager with a stern face, speaks with the unshakable confidence of a high school debater, moving swiftly from issue to issue, peppering his comments with statistics and citations. As he prepares to graduate, he is constantly on the move, in New York one day meeting with a voter registration group, lobbying in DC the next, using his Twitter feed, which reaches nearly 800,000 followers, to push supporters towards a constantly growing set of campaigns and initiatives. His future travel plans are always in flux. “I need a secretary,” he said at one point, not joking. It’s not enough for the Parkland activists to tweet links about voter registration, or broadly encourage young people to head to the polls, as they have been doing. To change legislators’ voters on gun control laws, they need wins. What the March for Our Lives activists are finalizing right now, with just over five months to go before the midterms, is their strategy for picking their battles. Most of the details are not yet public. But they will be focusing on a “large number” of districts, Hogg said, using “multiple sources of voter turnout data” looking for races where youth voters could have “the largest impact but vote the least” and also in places “where students and young people in general are disproportionately affected by gun violence”. On Monday, the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg presented Hogg with an award for citizen activism from the Common Good, a non-profit founded by entertainment industry leaders. Bloomberg, a billionaire gun control advocate who funds the country’s largest gun violence prevention group, Everytown for Gun Safety, was previously one of the NRA’s most reviled opponents. Bloomberg called Hogg “an inspiring young man”. He also presented Hogg with a check for $2,500 to go towards his future college tuition. His advice to the 18-year-old, Bloomberg said, was to “start out by finishing high school and then go to college”. Later, in a room outside, another well-wisher had different advice: he urged Hogg to run for Congress in Florida “right now, when you’re hot”. (Americans must be 25 years old to serve in the House of Representatives.) A poll earlier this spring found that nearly a quarter of respondents believed that the Parkland students were “being manipulated by outside groups” rather than advocating for issues they really believe in. In a wide-ranging interview on Monday at Manhattan’s University Club, Hogg spoke for 40 minutes without a single adviser or strategist hovering nearby. He jumped quickly from issue to issue, touching on summer campaign trail goals, a protest in Washington he’s hoping to organize against the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and the non-partisan behavioral interventions that prevent gun violence, like the Cure Violence model, that he believes both Democratic and Republican politicians ignore. “If you look into it,” he said, “what we need to create is the NRA – except for the opposite issues.” While the March for Our Lives students have long focused on the money the NRA gives to elected officials, “the reason why they’re effective isn’t just because they spend a lot of money,” Hogg said. “What they’re effective at is in mobilizing people to go to their congressman’s office and say: ‘I’m not going to vote for you if you vote this way on this bill.’” Even as he makes plans to hit the campaign trail, Hogg hasn’t given up on passing gun control legislation in Washington. He’s outraged at Ryan for continuing to block a vote on legislation to mandate universal background checks on gun sales. “I’ve flooded Paul Ryan’s phone lines and jammed them because so many people were calling. That didn’t work. People have written letters to him, people have constantly called him out on Twitter, and he still hasn’t done anything.” Hogg wants to gather support for a discharge petition, a way to force a vote on legislation even if congressional leaders oppose it. “If that means getting 5,000 kids to DC, I’ll do it,” he said. “It’s going to look really bad for House Republicans if there are 5,000 students that come to DC, flood the halls of Congress and get a discharge petition because they couldn’t fucking do it.” Why hasn’t he organized this protest already? “Been too busy,” he said. “I have to graduate high school.” The Parkland students’ activism has been lower-profile in recent weeks. Why? “It was prom,” Hogg explained. “I’m still in high school – you only get to go to prom once, [and] I was going to do that with my friends. Because I still can. I was lucky enough to survive.” Asked why he has been the focus of particular frustration from gun rights advocates, Hogg said: “Because I scare them. Because I know what I’m talking about, and they know that the young people will win.” Even as Hogg and his fellow activists have vowed “Never Again” in response to school shootings, they have watched mass shootings happen again, and again, most recently at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, that left 10 people dead. “It’s disturbing,” he said. “It feels like I’m getting stabbed again and again and it’s like, just scars are forming around that at this point. “It’s almost like you get kind of numb to it,” he said, then adding: “You never get numb to these things, but I feel like American society gets kind of desensitized.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/may/22/ms-marks-spencer-latest-radical-restructure-not-bold-enough","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T18:45:02Z","webTitle":"M&S's latest 'radical' restructure may not be bold enough | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/may/22/ms-marks-spencer-latest-radical-restructure-not-bold-enough","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/may/22/ms-marks-spencer-latest-radical-restructure-not-bold-enough","fields":{"headline":"M&S's latest 'radical' restructure may not be bold enough","bodyText":"Marks &amp; Spencer has been restructuring itself for about two decades, so no one can be surprised that the latest rejig is being rewritten already. It was as recently as November 2016 that the chief executive, Steve Rowe, declared that a “forensic” review of the store estate would mean 30 shop closures within five years. That figure became 60 a year later. Now it is 100, suggesting the original estimate was just a rough guess. Usdaw, the shopworkers’ union, is right to complain about “salami slicing” – this programme should have been handled better for staff. For all that, restructuring is a way of life in modern retailing as the old guard struggles to adapt to the rise of online shopping. Once upon a time, a hubristic Tesco pitched its non-food Tesco Direct operation as a way to defeat Amazon in the UK; now it is opting for discretion and will close the unprofitable venture. In M&amp;S’s case, there can be little confidence that the third iteration of the store plan will be the last. Twenty-five per cent of the old floorspace devoted to clothing and homewares will close but, if the opening of new stores (typically bigger out-of-town outlets) is taken into account, the net reduction will be closer to 10%. Is that bold enough, if you expect a third of your sales to be online by 2022? Even after the closures, M&amp;S will have 220 clothing and home outlets, whereas John Lewis serves England, Scotland and Wales from 51 department stores. The only real certainty is that restructuring is expensive. The extra financial damage from Rowe’s more “radical” plan will likely be unveiled with Wednesday’s full-year profit statement. But the fuller story is the astonishing £890m in “adjustments to reported profit” – all downwards adjustments, naturally – that the group has recorded over the last six years. Even at a business the size of M&amp;S, that’s going some, especially when the end is not in sight. Shell’s proxy war Companies are obliged to issue a few conciliatory words these days if more than 20% of votes are cast against the report on directors’ remuneration. At Shell, where the protest was 25%, the charm offensive amounted to three short paragraphs that said, in effect, “You’re wrong.” The high-ups in The Hague seem to have decided that the result can be dismissed because proxy voting agencies – firms that advise fund managers on how to vote – played a role. Thus the oil and gas giant said it “would particularly welcome the opportunity to work with proxy advisers more closely in the future”. What Shell seems to be implying is that the revolting shareholders were silly to take their cue from outsiders. It’s a favourite plea of companies on the receiving end of a pay rebellion: blame the proxies. Shell would have done better to reflect on why Institutional Shareholder Services, one of those firms, recommended a vote against a report that detailed the €8.9m (£7.79m) pay packet awarded to the chief executive, Ben van Beurden. It objected to the “silence” in the report about the explosion of a Shell Pakistan oil tanker that killed more than 200 people. Shell’s view is that, because the tanker was operated by a subcontractor, the disaster did not have to be considered when setting Van Beurden’s pay; the bonus framework, you see, looks only at safety issues where Shell has “operational control”. That’s advantageous for the executives, obviously. But, given the size of the disaster (and the fact that Shell’s subsidiary paid a fine to the local regulator), it is surely entirely reasonable for ISS to suggest that the bonus setters think more deeply. Shell’s lofty dismissal of the views of proxy agencies jars horribly. Halfords grinds the gears Halfords gets a new chief executive roughly every two years, and each one says the same thing: the business is full of potential, but more investment is needed in “service”. Graham Stapleton, four months into the job, is the latest boss to repeat the diagnosis and he promptly knocked 12% off the share price. Pretax profits, after falling 5% last year to £71.6m at an underlying level, will be flat this year, he said. The City had expected an improvement of at least 6%. The explanation, naturally, is that more money needs to be spent on training staff and marketing. It is also proving impossible to increase the price of bikes. When he unveils his full strategy in September, let us hope Stapleton spares shareholders another empty slogan. Matt Davies’s “Getting into Gear” mantra was followed by Jill McDonald’s “Moving up a Gear”, refrain but the share price is where it was in 2013. “Still in Neutral” might be more honest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/22/middle-class-bear-blame-for-drug-related-violence-says-police-leader","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T18:09:35Z","webTitle":"Blame middle class for drug-related violence, says police leader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/22/middle-class-bear-blame-for-drug-related-violence-says-police-leader","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/22/middle-class-bear-blame-for-drug-related-violence-says-police-leader","fields":{"headline":"Blame middle class for drug-related violence, says police leader","bodyText":"Middle-class drug users bear blame for the drug trade and associated violence on Britain’s streets, a leader of rank-and-file police has said. Simon Kempton, who leads on drugs policy for the Police Federation, also said banning illegal drugs did not work and new thinking was needed. He told the federation’s conference in Birmingham: “‘The only reason gangs are into drugs is because people want to buy them, and a big part of that is not street-level users. Street-level users are a problem because they steal to fund their habit but on their own they will not support an organised crime group. “The big market is people with money to spend and they are often oblivious to the misery they cause because it is not on their doorstep. Middle-class drug users do not come across the radar of police because they are consuming it behind closed doors.” Sheldon Thomas, a former gang member who now works to divert youngsters away from crime, said: “The police target street gangs but the problem is organised criminal networks and the middle-class white people who buy the drugs. The question is: who is buying the drugs at that level? Who is buying them and are we tackling them as well? “We need to tackle street gangs and gang crime but for me the big incubator is middle-class people who buy these drugs. We need to tackle middle-class white people who are buying cocaine in very large amounts.” Kempton said the longstanding policy of drug prohibition did not work: “Police do what the government tells them to do. We will enforce prohibition as long as they want. It has not worked.” Ministers are wedded to a ban on illegal drugs, and Kempton said a royal commission was needed. At least one chief constable, Mike Barton of Durham, has also said prohibition is failing. On Wednesday the home secretary, Sajid Javid, will attempt to reset the relationship between the government and police, which has been strained since Theresa May’s time as home secretary. At a time of rising crime rates, Javid is contemplating abandoning the government’s claim that more could be done with less. In a speech to the conference, the home secretary will say: “I get that there’s increased demand. You’ve told me you’re feeling stretched, overburdened and not sufficiently rewarded. I know it’s frustrating when your rest days get cancelled – often at short notice. And I know your work can take its toll on your mental and physical health. And you deserve to be respected and valued.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/24/jake-gyllenhaal-mysterio-marvel-avengers-ultimate-outsider","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T06:00:44Z","webTitle":"Jake Gyllenhaal could be magic as Marvel's Mysterio, the ultimate outsider","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/24/jake-gyllenhaal-mysterio-marvel-avengers-ultimate-outsider","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/24/jake-gyllenhaal-mysterio-marvel-avengers-ultimate-outsider","fields":{"headline":"Jake Gyllenhaal could be magic as Marvel's Mysterio, the ultimate outsider","bodyText":"From the moment he emerged, seemingly fully formed, into the searing spotlight of the public eye in the cult Richard Kelly fantasy Donnie Darko, Jake Gyllenhaal never quite seemed cut out for the Hollywood heart-throb mould. There have been efforts to recast the actor as a smouldering, musclebound action hero since that spiky early foray into the heart of post-pubescent darkness – conspicuously, if not memorably, in 2010’s Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. But he has always seemed more comfortable – certainly more watchable – playing offbeat outsiders such as Darko, Nightcrawler’s sociopathic stringer Lou Bloom and Okja’s screwball TV zoologist Dr Johnny Wilcox. The news that Gyllenhaal is in talks to star as Marvel supervillain Mysterio in the upcoming sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming should therefore come as no surprise. For this is surely a role the US actor was born to play. In the comics, Mysterio is a high-grade pain in the neck, a Wizard of Oz-type figure who uses illusion and subterfuge (rather than superpowers) to mess with Spidey’s head and make him doubt his own worth and reality. He’s a nasty, bitter piece of work, who really shouldn’t be so much of a threat to the masked wall crawler, but ends up being far more dangerous than many of his more vaunted supervillain peers due to his poisonous nature and single-minded determination. It’s a part that seems to sync perfectly with Gyllenhaal’s knack for portraying society’s wild-eyed misfits and green-eyed American eccentrics. And it requires an actor capable of holding the stage, to make up for Mysterio’s deeply unimpressive superpowers with the ability to project a genuinely magnetic screen presence. To join the garlanded ranks of big screen Spider-Man villains, from Willem Dafoe’s maniacal Green Goblin to Alfred Molina’s Doc Oc, in style. For long-term comic-book movie superfans, it’s also about time the Brokeback Mountain star joined the party. Gyllenhaal was due to play Batman prior to Christian Bale taking up the cape and cowl, and also auditioned to play the webslinger in Spider-Man 2, during a period when incumbent Tobey Maguire had injured his back starring in 2003’s Seabiscuit. “I believe whatever happens, happens for good,” he told an interviewer in 2015. “I was definitely open to both the roles. However at a certain point you realise there is always someone more interesting, talented and ready to do the role. In any case, you are not going to get every role you go for. So you can say I neither rue nor am I thankful for having not worked on these superhero films.” With his aptitude for damaged psyches, it’s easy to see why producers considered Gyllenhaal to play the Dark Knight. If Bruce Wayne had taken just a few more wrong turns in his efforts to avenge his parents’ deaths, he might easily have found himself down in the gutter with Bloom, Wilcox et al. Gyllenhaal was also recently rumoured to be replacing Ben Affleck as the DC Extended Universe’s caped crusader, but given the mess Warner Bros’ rival superhero stable finds itself in, Mysterio seems like a far more sensible career move. Unlike Affleck, Gyllenhaal appears a prime candidate for an early sashay into character roles, 20 years ahead of Hugh Grant and with barely a wrinkle to his brow – and yet so ready for it. Moreover, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is in need of a new ultra-devious, mischief-making supervillain after (spoiler alert!) Loki ended up facing his own personal Ragnarök in Avengers: Infinity War. And there is no reason Mysterio can’t cross over into other storylines beyond those involving Spider-Man – in the comics, the villain has also menaced Daredevil. Certainly it would be rather a waste if Gyllenhaal only pitched up for one outing as Mysterio before being pushed back behind the magician’s veil. Variety has already confirmed that Michael Keaton’s pleasingly multilayered Vulture will return for Homecoming 2, after all. Might Mysterio, with his fondness for smoke and mirrors, even hold the clue to explaining how Peter Parker survived Thanos’s finger click at the end of Infinity War? That seems like a stretch, but the supervillain certainly has a ring of ersatz Doctor Strange about him, and it is Benedict Cumberbatch’s reality-bending sorcerer supreme who likely holds the clue to the mad titan’s eventual defeat in next year’s still-untitled sequel. There are certainly a few of us who watched Infinity War’s strikingly grim denouement who would be more than pleased to discover it was all just a petty illusion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/may/23/the-friend-effect-why-the-secret-of-health-and-happiness-is-surprisingly-simple","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"The friend effect: why the secret of health and happiness is surprisingly simple","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/23/the-friend-effect-why-the-secret-of-health-and-happiness-is-surprisingly-simple","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/23/the-friend-effect-why-the-secret-of-health-and-happiness-is-surprisingly-simple","fields":{"headline":"The friend effect: why the secret of health and happiness is surprisingly simple","bodyText":"For some, eating alone can be a joyous thing: forking mouthfuls of pasta straight from the pan, peanut butter licked off a spoon, the unbridled pleasure of walking home from the chippie alone on a cold night. But regularly eating meals in isolation is a different story. This one factor is more strongly associated with unhappiness than any other apart from (unsurprisingly) having a mental illness. This is according to a new study by Oxford Economics that found, in a survey of 8,250 British adults, that people who always eat alone score 7.9 points lower, in terms of happiness, than the national average. This research is far from the first to suggest a link between eating with others and happiness. Researchers at the University of Oxford last year found that the more that people eat with others, the more likely they are to feel happy and satisfied with their lives. The study also found that people who eat socially are more likely to feel better about themselves and have wider social and emotional support networks. Robin Dunbar, a professor of psychology, worked on the Oxford University study. He says that “we simply don’t know” why people who eat together are happier. But it is clear that this is a regular social ritual, a moment of union and communion in our often chaotic lives. It can be a place of conversation, storytelling and closeness. “At a psychological level, having friends just makes you happier,” says Dunbar. “The kinds of things that you do around the table with other people are very good at triggering the endorphin system, which is part of the brain’s pain-management system. Endorphins are opioids, they are chemically related to morphine – they are produced by the brain and give you an opiate high. That’s what you get when you do all this social stuff, including patting, cuddling and stroking. It is central to the way primates in general bond in their social groups and relationships.” Our face-to-face relationships are, quite literally, a matter of life or death. “One of the biggest predictors of physical and mental health problems is loneliness,” says Dr Nick Lake, joint director for psychology and psychological therapy at Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. “That makes sense to people when they think of mental health. But the evidence is also clear that if you are someone who is lonely and isolated, your chance of suffering a major long-term condition such as coronary heart disease or cancer is also significantly increased, to the extent that it is almost as big a risk factor as smoking.” One of the most striking pieces of evidence for this, says Dunbar, is a meta-analysis of 148 epidemiological studies that looked for the best predictors that patients would survive for 12 months after a heart attack. “The best two predictors, by a long way, are the number and quality of friends you have and giving up smoking,” he says. “You can eat as much as you like, you can slob about, you can drink as much alcohol as you like – the effect is very modest compared with these other two factors.” Human beings are biologically engineered for human interaction – and particularly face-to-face interaction. One study from the University of Michigan found that replacing face-to-face contact with friends and family with messages on social media, emails or text messages could double our risk of depression. The study also found that those who made social contact with family and friends at least three times a week had the lowest level of depressive symptoms. “We are the most social of all the animals,” says Prof Paul Gilbert, a psychologist and the founder of compassion-focused therapy. “Our brains and our bodies are built to be regulated through interactions with others from the day that we are born.” This is not the case with many creatures, such as turtles and fish, that procreate in vast numbers. “They don’t need looking after,” says Gilbert. “Many of them will die before they reach reproductive age. The caring behaviour [associated] with mammals is a major evolutionary adaptation – it changes the brain and the physiology of the body so that a parent is interested in staying close to an infant. One of the most important things is the human capacity for soothing and engaging. So, when a mother smiles at a baby and makes eye contact, that positive emotion in the face and the voice of the mother is stimulating positivity in the child. You can see why it’s called mirroring, the baby smiles back. “The ability to stimulate positive emotions, which is linked to happiness, begins in interactions with others who are having positive emotions about you. So, when we see our friends and they say, ‘Good to see you’ – it’s important.” But there are many factors that might prevent us from seeing friends and family: mental ill health, immobility, a lack of money. Alison Harris is a consultant clinical psychologist and professional lead for psychological services in Salford. “Austerity has a huge influence on the loss of happiness and wellbeing,” she says. “Homelessness and unemployment in particular takes us out of contact with others. In addition to the obvious harms of homelessness, it does massively increase social isolation and anxiety. To take that even further, many people are in exile from their communities. In mental health services, we see an enormous amount of grief, depression and anxiety in people who are asylum seekers and refugees and much of that is not just due to trauma or torture or detention or fleeing from their country, but from the severe rupture of being cut off from their families and communities of origin.” When we are around others, it has an effect on our body. Some forms of friendship – going to parties, getting married, having positive interactions with others – stimulate our sympathetic nervous system. Gilbert says that the parasympathetic nervous system (otherwise known as the “rest and digest” system) “is stimulated through the verbal and voice tone of relations with each other. As far as we know, it’s not that stimulated through texts. Generally speaking, you’re designed to respond to voice tone and expression, and stroking. We are physiologically designed for face-to-face interaction.” Of course, for those struggling with depression, the idea of physical contact can be impossible to fathom. At those moments, the capacity to lift up a mobile phone and type out a text is an enormous mark of progress. It may not be the ideal form of interaction, but it’s a vast improvement on staring at a wall. Dragging ourselves out of low energy states – be that by trying to cultivate compassionate voices internally or having compassionate relationships with others – is key to Gilbert’s work. “If you ask someone, ‘What is your internal critic most frightened of?’ [you will find] it’s frightened of rejection, of being seen as no good. Of being unlovable, of not being wanted. All the raging that goes on beneath us, the thing that we fear most is shame – not being good enough or wanted. We are frightened of being revealed to be not so nice.” He says that what has happened in the past decade, with the rise of social media, “is that it has become a very plastic society. We are all living like theatrical actors, presenting ourselves as our best. That can’t be real, and so we have many people who feel like failures or useless. They say: ‘I’m not as attractive as that, I’m overweight, I’m not kind or compassionate to others.’” As Gilbert says, the best relationships are the ones where people love us for our perceived dark sides and flaws. “People forget that love is about loving you for the difficult things, not the easy things,” he says. It is those who know us intimately who can provide that, and they do it through their physical presence, through touch, and through eating, drinking and sharing with us. Spending time together is social nourishment. So, instead of texting a friend or messaging them on social media, why not knock on their door, look them in the eye and make yourselves both feel better? This article was amended on 23 May 2018.

I was living with my mother, spending a lot of time writing. One day I was sitting at the dining room table, reading the New York Times Magazine. There was an article about a woman who’d thought her life would change and be perfect when she had her debutante ball. The first line was, “I learned the truth at 18.” Since “At Eighteen” didn’t scan, it became “At Seventeen”. It took three months to write, because it was scary. This was the mid-70s, before confessional songs, and I’d never been that honest about feeling ugly and never being asked out. I kept picking it up and putting it down, saying: “I can’t do this.” In the third verse, the narrator steps forward and you realise it’s about her. “Those of us with ravaged faces,” she says, but near the end there’s the line: “Ugly duckling girls like me.” Well, ugly ducklings become swans, so there’s hope. It was a very tense recording session. It was the first time I felt like I’d written a hit. I have no idea why I thought that. The melody sounded so familiar, I worried that I’d lifted it. So I called three musician friends, sang it and said: “Have you heard this before?” They all said no. My manager told me I was ruining my chances because it was over three minutes long. But it was a great session and we finished what we thought was a killer take, then realised the ending wasn’t as strong as the beginning so we did another and spliced its ending on to the previous take. When we brought it to CBS, they said four minutes was too long. They didn’t have a clue how to market it either, because it was so wordy. I went on a promo tour that seemed to last 10 years. We played small shows for six to eight months, getting up at 5am to do TV, then having lunch with promo people. At five we’d stop for dinner with someone from the record company, at eight there’d be a show, then it was bed at midnight. In Britain, I did an early-morning show with Queen, who were promoting Bohemian Rhapsody. I remember the day I first thought At Seventeen might be doing something. We’d graduated from playing to 100 people to 800. We were at a college in the midwest and I walked out of the dressing room - which was the locker room – and there were kids lined up on both sides. And it was: “Look, there she is! There she is!” That was the highlight, exactly what I’d been working for. I don’t think the song would be successful now. I told a friend that I am the American dream, the reason why my grandparents came here, so that someone with my talent could have these breaks. Brooks Arthur, producer I melted the first time Janis played the song. It wasn’t folky, it wasn’t pop – it was just honest and straight from her heart. She was powering through her feelings, which was very delicate territory, but she wouldn’t really uncork vocally. It took us two or three days to finesse it. She was easy to work with, though, because she was so organised – beyond organised, actually. She’d come in to the studio with lyric sheets and arrangements printed out. There’s was a moment during recording when I suddenly felt like we were in a spaceship blasting off from Earth. It was the most incredible feeling and it’s only happened a couple of other times – while I was recording Bruce Springsteen’s first albums.Two or three hours later, we landed safely. We listened to the track and knew we were making some kind of wonderful. But I didn’t feel it was a hit. I’d just been trying to make Janis sound as good as she did on Stars. But then Allen Klein, who’d managed the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, dropped by and said: “This is a hit.” • Janis Ian headlines the Cambridge folk festival on 5 August."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/may/22/donald-trump-north-korea-nuclear-summit-12-june","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T18:22:43Z","webTitle":"Trump says 'very substantial chance' North Korea summit could be delayed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/22/donald-trump-north-korea-nuclear-summit-12-june","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/22/donald-trump-north-korea-nuclear-summit-12-june","fields":{"headline":"Trump says 'very substantial chance' North Korea summit could be delayed","bodyText":"Donald Trump said there was a “very substantial chance” that his summit next month with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, could be postponed. Trump raised doubts over the timing of the summit, due in Singapore on 12 June, at a White House meeting with the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in. “We’re moving along. We’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters. “There are certain conditions we want to happen. I think we’ll get those conditions. And if we don’t, we won’t have the meeting.” Trump did not specify the conditions the US was setting for the meeting. “There is a very substantial chance that it won’t work out, but that’s OK,” he added. “It doesn’t mean it won’t work out over a period of time, but it may not work out for June 12. But there is still a good chance we’ll have the meeting.” Harking back to his real estate career, Trump said that deals that seem certain sometimes fail while those which appear to have little chance of success end in triumph. Referring specifically to his talks with North Korea, the president added: “In the end it will work out. I can’t tell you how or why, but it always does.” Trump said that if Kim agreed to disarm: “We will guarantee his safety. He’ll be safe. He’ll be happy. His country will be rich.” Moon expressed high confidence that the summit would go ahead and achieve a dramatic breakthrough, which he attributed to Trump’s leadership. His national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, said before the White House meeting: “We believe there is a 99.9% chance the North Korea-US summit will be held as scheduled.” Chung added: “But we’re just preparing for many different possibilities.” The Singapore summit has been thrown in doubt following official North Korean comments criticising joint war games by US and South Korean forces, and US insistence that the summit would lead to unilateral North Korean surrender of its nuclear weapons programme. Trump has warned Kim that if he refuses to make a deal he could face the same fate as the Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, who was toppled and killed after a Nato-backed insurrection. Pyongyang says it supports the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula” but interprets it as a gradual, phased and mutual disarmament process. The US national security adviser, John Bolton, has insisted that the regime hand over all its nuclear weapons and production equipment before receiving any benefits. Trump would not be pinned down on the issue, saying he would prefer an “all-in-one” option in which North Korea gives up its arsenal soon after an agreement is made. He said, however, that he believed Kim to be serious about denuclearisation: “I do think he’s serious. I do think he’d like to see that happen.” Trump attributed the firm line against unilateral disarmament last week to a trip Kim made to China to meet Xi Jinping on 8 May. Trump said that after that visit – Kim’s second in two months – Pyongyang hardened its negotiating position. “There was a very difficult attitude by the North Korean folks after that meeting ... so I can’t say I’m happy about it,” Trump said, describing Xi as a “world-class poker player”. However, former officials and North Korea experts have pointed out that North Korea never committed to unilateral disarmament and that Trump may simply have misunderstood what would be on the table in Singapore. “We’ve now entered the ‘who knew North Korea was so hard?’ phase of Trump’s diplomacy,” said Mike Fuchs, the deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, now at the Centre for American Progress thinktank. “North Korea is beginning to play hardball, as expected. Trump and Moon must ensure that the two allies are on the same page about how to approach North Korea, and what to expect. If the allies are not coordinated, Kim Jong-un will exploit any daylight in the US-South Korea alliance to the detriment of both Washington and Seoul.” When asked about North Korea’s more assertive rhetoric last week, Moon’s advisor, Chung said: “We’re trying to understand the situation from the North’s perspective. “South Korea and the US have been sharing every bit of information and have remained in close coordination with each other,” Chung added, according to Yonhap News. “We’ve had various working-level discussions on how to steer North Korea in a direction that we want, and I expect (Moon and Trump) will have great talks this time.” “Thanks to your vision of achieving peace through strength and your strong leadership, we are looking forward to the first US-North Korea summit and we find ourselves standing one step closer to the dream of achieving the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and world peace,” Moon said, sitting alongside Trump in the Oval Office. “All of this was possible because of you, Mr President, and I have no doubt that you will be able to complete and accomplish an historic feat that no one has been able to achieve in the decades past.” Duyeon Kim, a senior fellow at the Korean Peninsula Future Forum in Seoul, said: “President Moon really needs these US-North Korea summit to happen to fully achieve his own peace agenda.” She said that the two Koreas alone could take diplomatic and symbolic steps to defuse tensions, but she added: “Eventually the two Koreas are gong to need economic exchanges, and for that to happen, sanctions have to be lifted. Also the South needs a nuclear-free North Korea to be able to say there is peace.” The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who took part in the White House meeting with President Moon, said he was “optimistic” about the Kim summit. He added that the state department was preparing for a 12 June date. The Associated Press quoted senior administration officials as saying Trump had been focused so far on the potential pageantry of a summit with Kim, including the gradual staged release of details to raise the level of suspense surrounding the event, rather than on the details of the North Korean nuclear programme itself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/22/arsenal-ivan-gazidis-unai-emery-mikel-arteta-new-manager-wenger","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T19:03:00Z","webTitle":"Ivan Gazidis has won Arsenal power battle but Arteta was a gamble too far | David Hytner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/22/arsenal-ivan-gazidis-unai-emery-mikel-arteta-new-manager-wenger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/22/arsenal-ivan-gazidis-unai-emery-mikel-arteta-new-manager-wenger","fields":{"headline":"Ivan Gazidis has won Arsenal power battle but Arteta was a gamble too far","bodyText":"Ivan Gazidis met the higher-ups at Real Madrid in August 2013 with the intention of signing one player – Ángel Di María. The Spanish club would not sell and, what was more, they told the Arsenal chief executive he could not have anybody. Then Gazidis’s stars aligned. Over at the Real training pitches the club’s new manager, Carlo Ancelotti, told Mesut Özil he would not be assured of a starting place. Özil threw his toys and, rather abruptly, Gazidis was told he could take the Germany superstar, which he did. Gazidis is fond of telling the story because it has plenty of zesty ingredients, not least football’s everlasting capacity to surprise. But he tells it, more than anything, because it was a cool thing to have been a part of and, at times like these, even men in his position and with his icy temperament can be touched by a childlike excitement. Gazidis is, first and foremost, a football lover. Born in Johannesburg, he moved to Manchester at the age of four where he supported City and was an outstanding schoolboy player. Having obtained a masters in law, he pursued his career as a lawyer but the bug did not leave him. Gazidis was one of the founder members of Major League Soccer in the United States, and he worked there until 2008. The Özil deal has been one of the high points of Gazidis’s nine and a half years at Arsenal and yet the opportunistic element to it did not seem to fit with his personality. Gazidis is not an off-the-cuff operator. He is a contemplator, a deep thinker, who will calmly consider each decision from every conceivable angle. Perhaps he quickly concluded that Özil was a no-brainer; he did not have to over-analyse this one. Gazidis is primed to announce the most significant signing of his career and, as the process to appoint a managerial successor to Arsène Wenger approached its endgame last week, there was the temptation to wonder, once again, whether he was about to act out of character. The 53-year-old is, by nature, risk-averse and not inclined to roll the dice. And yet he looked set to go for Mikel Arteta – a man with zero experience of being a manager. Gazidis sounds like a marketing executive when he describes Arsenal’s determination to do things their way, even if it means going against the grain. “We zig where others zag,” he once said. They were ready to zig and then some. Something changed over the weekend and, rather than Arteta, Gazidis is now putting the finishing touches to the appointment of Unai Emery, the former Paris Saint-Germain and Sevilla manager – an altogether safer bet, despite his often volatile touchline manner. Many will say the Arsenal squad, so indulged by Wenger, need an iron-fist-in-an-iron-glove kind of guy. The club have attempted a piece of revisionism and who can blame them? There was from the outset only one outstanding candidate for the job, they say, and he is about to get it. Why, then, were discussions so advanced with Arteta that the conversation had turned to his backroom staff? On Sunday night he still expected to be offered the post. Maybe it was a fiendish attempt by Gazidis and his inner circle to throw people off the scent, to use Arteta as a smokescreen for Emery, before dashing his hopes at the last. Or maybe not. It is simply not Gazidis’s style. More likely is that, when push came to shove, Gazidis played the percentages. Emery has experience, pedigree. He is an outstanding candidate because of his body of work over 14 seasons in management, particularly at Sevilla, where he won three Europa Leagues in a row. Why is there still the feeling that Gazidis has somehow copped out; that he has taken the middle ground? Emery does not have the cachet of Ancelotti, Max Allegri or Luis Enrique while, at the other end of the spectrum, neither does the appointment fire the imagination in the same way that Arteta or Patrick Vieira might have done. Arsenal had an interest in Thomas Tuchel but he chose PSG. Now they have the man supplanted by him in Paris. The broader context to the decision-making process has been shaped by Gazidis’s experience of working alongside, or underneath, everybody’s favourite benevolent dictator, Wenger. Gazidis has long advocated a management structure that does not rest on a single point or employee because, when it fails, there is the potential for the whole thing to collapse. He has wanted a broader coalition of talented specialists greater than the sum of its parts and, for so long, his efforts were frustrated by Wenger, to whom the club’s majority shareholder, Stan Kroenke, was in thrall. Wenger had a hotline to Kroenke and he could shape or veto Gazidis’s ideas. Gazidis wanted a director of football but Wenger pushed his friend Dick Law into a position of executive-level authority. Gazidis wanted greater expertise in data and contracts and hired Hendrik Almstadt only for Wenger to say he did not want him. Almstadt ended up going to Aston Villa. Gazidis oversaw the purchase of the data analytics company, StatDNA, but Wenger was not a fan. Gazidis wanted to find a role for Arteta after he retired as a player at the club in 2016 but Wenger had warned that “you cannot create artificial positions”. A criticism of Gazidis is that he picks his battles so carefully he avoids having them at all; that he did not do enough to fight Wenger for so many years and, consequently, the club was allowed to drift. There was the sense he feared that to fall out with Wenger would be to lose his job. But, as the writing came to be writ larger on the wall for Wenger, Gazidis made his move. He said at the end of the 2015-16 season that the on-field under-achievement had to serve as the “catalyst for change” and, since then he has manoeuvred a clutch of new hires into position. Gazidis has overhauled the structures at the club, with the most important appointments being those of Raúl Sanllehí, the director of football in all but name, and Sven Mislintat, the head of recruitment. Huss Fahmy has come in to handle player contracts and Gazidis has finally realised his vision – the creation of a bespoke support system around the manager, whose role is purely to coach the first team. Emery is merely the final piece in the jigsaw, albeit the pivotal one. It was a meticulously orchestrated coup and Gazidis carried it off while showing all the respect in the world to Wenger, who has watched virtually all of his people leave the club. It has felt like a plot-line from Gomorrah, the Neapolitan mafia drama. Gazidis was not always the favourite to outlast Wenger. Now, his position looks stronger than ever. With power comes public profile and Gazidis has never been comfortable with that. He made the decision to step out of the spotlight soon after his appointment at Arsenal, fearing that no good would come from being in the headlines and he very rarely agrees to media interviews. However, when Wenger’s end-of-season departure was announced on 20 April, it was Gazidis who faced the cameras and journalists. By doing so he put himself front and centre of the club’s new era and he has stepped into the line of fire. Gazidis desperately needs Sanllehí and Mislintat to deliver, let alone Emery. Will it work? Will the various cogs click?

Over the 90-minute session, the Facebook founder told MEPs there would be no repeat of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal as he fielded accusations that his company had too much power. The format meant Zuckerberg spent around 30 minutes giving answers to a 60-minute block of consecutive questions. The 12 MEPs asked dozens of overlapping questions that allowed the Facebook boss to pick and choose his answers. Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the liberal group, slammed the “precooked format” as “inappropriate” and said it had permitted Zuckerberg to avoid questions. Zuckerberg promised that his firm would follow up with written answers: “I realise there were a lot of specific questions that I didn’t get around to answer,” he said as he noted the session had run out of time. Damian Collins, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, which Zuckerberg has refused three times to appear before, tweeted: After the hearing, Collins said it had been a “missed opportunity for proper scrutiny” on many crucial questions. “Questions were blatantly dodged on shadow profiles, sharing data between WhatsApp and Facebook, the ability to opt out of political advertising, and the true scale of data abuse on the platform. “Unfortunately, the format of questioning allowed Mr Zuckerberg to cherry-pick his responses and not respond to each individual point.” The format is the European parliament’s preferred way of running meetings. But this time it broke up with tetchy exchanges between the MEPs, led by Verhofstadt, who complained that he had received no answers to his charge that Facebook enjoyed a monopoly. Verhofstadt had called on Facebook to cooperate with the EU’s antitrust authorities. “Are you in fact a genius who creates a digital monster that is destroying our societies?” he asked. Manfred Weber, the leader of the European People’s party centre-right group, the largest in the European parliament, said it was time to discuss breaking up Facebook’s monopoly because “it has already too much power”. The European parliament has no power to break up Facebook, but theinterventions will increase the pressure on the European commission’s antitrust arm to scrutinise the company more closely. Zuckerberg said Facebook accounted for 6% of the global advertising market, and he urged MEPs to look through this “important lens”, while talking about 70m small businesses that use Facebook. He said policies in place since 2014 prevented any app developer from misusing data. But he said Facebook was likely to find other apps that “we [will] want to take down” as part of a shift away from a reactive approach to problems on the site. “Now what we’re doing is taking a much more proactive approach. We are going through and investigating ourselves up front,” he told MEPs. It was the latest leg in the Facebook apology tour after the Observer reported that the personal data of tens of millions of people was harvested and shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Facebook admitted that the data of 87 million users may have been improperly shared, including that of 1 million users in the UK. The MEPs touched on issues ranging from terrorism, tax and fake news to data protection rules, false accounts and online bullying. A few noted their own follower numbers. “I am your best client here in the room,” said Nigel Farage, who boasted that he had more Facebook followers than any other MEP. The former Ukip leader accused Facebook of censoring him and other right-leaning politicians. “Since January this year you’ve changed your algorithms, and it’s led to a substantial drop to views and engagements for those who’ve got right-of-centre political opinions. On average we’re down about 25% over the course of this year,” he said. “I’m not talking about extremism. What interests me is: who decides what is acceptable? Who are these third-party fact-checkers? Why is there no transparency in this process?” Farage had a place at the questioners’ table as he leads the Eurosceptic Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group. The panel comprised 12 MEPs who led the parliament’s political groups, plus the European parliament president, Antonio Tajani. In his opening remarks, Zuckerberg stuck to the script he used when he faced US lawmakers last month. “In 2016 we were too slow to identify Russian interference in the US presidential election. We weren’t prepared enough for the kind of coordinated misinformation operations we are now aware of,” he said. The session took place three days before the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation comes into effect. The GDPR, which replaces a 1996 law, boosts people’s rights online, for example by ensuring that companies obtain consent before using data rather than taking silence as implied assent. Companies breaking the rules can be fined €20bn or 4% of their global turnover. Zuckerberg said the company expected “to be compliant by May 25”, having been asked whether Facebook had moved the data of 11.5m users out of reach of the law. The European commissioner on justice and consumer affairs Vera Jourová said she would be following closely the work of national data protection authorities in enforcing the law. “As of Friday new strong EU data protection rules will be in place. These rules will have teeth and protect Europeans. They come just in time.” The European commission, which is responsible for drafting EU law, has also warned Facebook and other social media companies that it could draw up regulations to tackle misuse of personal data and misinformation unless they clean up their acts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/22/graham-corbett-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T16:17:10Z","webTitle":"Graham Corbett obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/22/graham-corbett-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/22/graham-corbett-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Graham Corbett obituary","bodyText":"In 1975, with the UK newly in the European Union, my husband, Graham Corbett, became senior partner for Peat Marwick Continental Europe (the continental firm of what is now KPMG), a post he held for 12 years and which shaped the insights that made him a European. Graham, who has died aged 83, developed his team in Paris to show that European cooperation could function well in professional services across 14 countries. His political insight was that our continental friends and colleagues had grown up in the shadow of occupation and defeat. He understood why they saw the EU as a solution for moving on – and why Britons, undefeated in the second world war, were so often unwilling to see the bigger picture. In 1987, the then Franco-British Eurotunnel recruited him as chief financial officer. Despite the dramas of financial near-collapse, he called it his dream job. More motivating than the UK refrain “you won’t get your money back” was the French slogan: the tunnel construction was un pas de géant (a giant step). A spell in regulation followed; first he was deputy chair of the Competition Commission, then chair of the Postal Services Commission (Postcomm, now part of Ofcom). The remit to modernise via competition drove the parties involved to war with Postcomm. We would regularly wake to the headline “Corbett must go”. Yet eventually all parties signed an agreement, a success for the consultative strategy that he led. Graham was born in Bletchingley, Surrey, one of three sons of John Corbett, a senior partner in Peat Marwick Mitchell, and his wife, Greta (nee Sillars). His wartime childhood was spent in north Wales, where his father was seconded to the Ministry of Food to help steer the national rationing scheme. Graham was sent to school at Stowe and was politically matured by 1950s national service on Christmas Island. He was in charge of a motorised vessel monitoring fish potentially affected by radioactivity from the UK’s nuclear tests in the Pacific. When Graham and I married in 1964 he was a rising accountant in Peat Marwick Mitchell, taking part in interesting jobs, such as the audit of the government of Kuwait, and playing a forthright role in the ongoing debate on accounting standards. Later he was deputy receiver on the Rolls-Royce insolvency. When Burmah Oil collapsed, he was the one to tell Denis Thatcher his services were no longer needed. In his teens Graham had suffered a spinal injury, which became debilitating when he was in his 40s. The partial paralysis, which Graham stoically refused to see as a handicap, meant an end to some of the things he had loved, such as hiking holidays and sailing. He compensated in part by chairing the Research Institute for Consumer Affairs, an organisation founded to test equipment for disabled people. He came to that world detesting the condescension that so often surrounds disability, so he put his energies, with some success, into campaigning for access for all. Graham is survived by his sons, Giles and Julian, six grandchildren and me."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/may/22/hospitals-struggling-to-afford-new-equipment-after-nhs-budget-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T16:30:00Z","webTitle":"Hospitals struggling to afford new equipment after NHS budget cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/22/hospitals-struggling-to-afford-new-equipment-after-nhs-budget-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/22/hospitals-struggling-to-afford-new-equipment-after-nhs-budget-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Hospitals struggling to afford new equipment after NHS budget cuts","bodyText":"Hospitals can no longer afford the most modern scanners and surgical equipment to treat patients who have cancer and other diseases because of multibillion-pound cuts to the NHS’s capital budget, research reveals. Staff are having to continue using vital diagnostic and treatment technology beyond its natural life because there are insufficient funds to replace it. For example, radiographers are using out-of-date scanners that produce images so unclear they impede correct diagnosis. In one case, 200 patients had to be rescanned because the images of their lumps, tumours and broken bones were of such poor quality. Ambulances are breaking down because they have been kept in service for too long, and hospitals are having to continue using archaic IT systems in the wake of repeated government raids on NHS capital funding, the researchers heard. One trust had to scrap plans to bring in electronic scheduling of operations because it could not afford the technology. Others are unable to expand their A&amp;E units to help them cope with rising patient numbers, while some lack the money to repair rotten windows and leaking roofs in hospital buildings because of the cash squeeze. The problems are outlined in research conducted at 30 trusts by the health services management centre at Birmingham University and funded by the Health Foundation, a thinktank. Trust bosses told the academics the lack of money for new equipment and repairs had started to affect the quality and safety of patient care. “The surroundings that they [patients] are actually being cared for in are appalling and we all know … that those surroundings do impact the recovery rate. So in that respect it is impacting their recovery as well,” one NHS trust finance director said. Since 2014 Jeremy Hunt, the health and social care secretary, has taken £4.3bn from the NHS in England’s capital budget and used it to help pay for day-to-day running costs, in response to its deepening financial crisis. In 2016-17 alone he removed £1.2bn, a fifth of the entire capital budget. “This has left the NHS between a rock and a hard place, postponing and cutting vital capital investment to fund day-to-day running costs,” said Anita Charlesworth, the Health Foundation’s director of research and economics. “It’s clear that shortfalls in NHS capital spending are starting to hurt: spending on new equipment such as medical scanners has more than halved over the last four years.” NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said the shortage of capital funding was so acute that hospitals could not afford to replace outmoded machines that deliver radiotherapy to cancer patients. “Just in the last few days one trust leader told us of frustrating delays in funding needed to improve an emergency department. Another spoke of her worries about being able to replace linear accelerators. But as we see in this report, this is also a major problem for mental health, community and ambulance services as well,” said Phillippa Hentsch, the organisation’s head of analysis. A separate analysis of NHS finances by the Health Foundation found that capital spending for healthcare, such as for hospitals and equipment, in the UK was low compared with other OECD countries, at 0.3% of GDP compared with an average of 0.5%. Increasing the percentage spent in the UK to the OECD average would mean the NHS had another £3bn a year for such projects, it said. Charlesworth said: “The maintenance backlog for hospitals is now over £5bn. Most worryingly, £2.8bn of this backlog is high or significant risk, related to clinical services and safety.” She said cutting capital spending was “a false economy” that made hospitals inefficient and prevented them from improving patient care. One trust boss said £40m of “priority one high-risk” urgent repairs were needed in one year, but only £11m was available for them. On Wednesday Labour will use parliamentary procedure to try to force ministers to disclose documents that reveal what elements of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 they want to scrap. There have been reports that Theresa May is keen to repeal some sections of the legislation to help pave the way for an overhaul of how the service works, tied to a big increase in NHS funding planned to mark its 70th birthday on 5 July. The Department of Health and Social Care said: “We want patients to receive world-class care in world-class facilities, which is why the governmenty recently announced £3.9bn of new capital investment in the NHS. This will pay for new buildings, wards and beds to improve the patient environment and patient treatment whilst offering good value for money.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/23/how-do-you-break-up-with-someone-google","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T07:00:16Z","webTitle":"How do you break up with someone?

You asked Google – here’s the answer","bodyText":"First of all, consult someone who’s messed it up horribly at least a couple of times. They will offer some mature and very wise counsel, not at all tinged with bitterness and regret. They won’t simply spout generic “good advice” about kindness, understanding and listening; they’ve lived. They will know that, in certain instances, it’s better just to get out and not think about the other person’s feelings; it’s thinking about their damn, stupid feelings the whole time that’s landed you in this decade-long misery-fest. If this is your case, just pack your stuff and do your thinking later. In the end you will both be glad. (See? Very sophisticated.) If, however, it’s you that’s the scoundrel – you’re having an affair or have just “gone off” someone nice who seems to love you – try not to be too much of a twit about it. It can be really shameful to be on the wrong side of this one, and shame can push you either to be dishonest or to try to redistribute the blame. Don’t attempt to convince yourself, and especially not your mutual friends, that the other person isn’t exactly a paragon of partnerhood either. Of course they aren’t, nobody is, but that doesn’t mean you have to highlight their flaws in order to make yourself feel better. Then again, there’s no need to make a massive show of self-flagellation. A touch of stoicism will do just fine. Take them out to dinner, take their feelings seriously, and let them shout at you a bit if they want to. It’s awful to leave someone who doesn’t want to be left, but it can also be awful to stay with them. If you let them go, you will at least be giving them a chance to find someone else who is actually capable of loving them. And when you hear, 20 years later, that they are living in Brooklyn with their partner and child, you will almost cry with happiness. (At the same time as wondering, self-indulgently, whether their romantic good fortune has made it possible for them to forgive you at least a little bit. Wow, Anouchka, you really can’t let go of the idea of being a “good person”!) Come to think of it, kindness, understanding and listening might have been quite a good idea, at least if you’re the scoundrel. There’s nothing more stupid than acting out rather than trying to articulate yourself. It’s got to be kinder to say you’re unhappy than to sleep with some passer-by (whom you then marry). The problem is that, when you start to talk and listen, you often find you can’t help liking, even loving, the other person – and that makes it very difficult to abandon them. The one advantage of dumb acting out is that it can at least give the abandonee an opportunity to hate you. If you’re absolutely sure that leaving is essential then why spend loads of time trying to make it possible for them to continue to think well of you? This could even be considered a little vain. Attempting to do something horrible to someone in a polite way is inherently problematic. (Just look at the government.) While there might be a free-floating cultural ideal that tells us to try to be on good terms with everyone at all times, sometimes this just isn’t possible. Of course there’s no need to be nasty for the sake of it, but neurotically trying to be perfect can be time-consuming and messy. Some breakups take years. There are people who can, apparently, bring about the ideal disunion, but if everyone expects to do the same they might find themselves having a lot of very long, sad and frustrating conversations when they could have been out enjoying the sunshine. But, then again, sunshine gives you cancer and serious dialogue can make you more humane and insightful. It’s hard to feel good about ending a long-term relationship, even when it’s ultimately for the best. Not only are you choosing to throw yourself into the void, but you are also chucking someone else in involuntarily. Whether they are an angel, a devil, or even just an ordinary human being, you might feel dreadful about what you’re about to do to them. That’s not a sign that you’re making a bad choice, it’s just a register of the fact that you do still care about them. So that’s nice. On a more practical note, if you’re married to someone who does properly terrible things, consider divorcing on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour rather than waiting two years and calling it irretrievable breakdown. (But do bear in mind that it’s probably unwise to be too idealistic about divorce courts; #freetiniowens.) It’s so common for these things to be lost to history; the perp wants to go about their life as usual, find another hostage ASAP, and pretend none of it ever happened. Or if it did, it was just as much your fault as theirs. This sort of whitewashing can leave you with a disconcerting feeling of unreality. Possessing a legal document that acknowledges what actually went on might help. Having said that, if you’ve stayed in a long-term relationship with someone who’s demonstrably bad news you’ve probably lost your mental coordinates enough to find it difficult to fight for justice or recognition. If so, re-read the first paragraph, pack, and don’t forget to throw cress seeds on their sofa on the way out (or seek other good revenge advice on Mumsnet). It’s more important to be out than to be “right”. As you can see, this is all very considered and impartial. Sometimes it’s them, sometimes it’s you (but don’t ever actually say: “It’s not you, it’s me”, obvs). And now I think it’s time for me to finally get round to doing that thinking. • Anouchka Grose is a psychoanalyst, and author of No More Silly Love Songs"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/22/trump-hunting-alaska-rules","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T17:04:17Z","webTitle":"Trump administration plan to scrap hunting rules condemned as 'new low'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/22/trump-hunting-alaska-rules","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/22/trump-hunting-alaska-rules","fields":{"headline":"Trump administration plan to scrap hunting rules condemned as 'new low'","bodyText":"The Trump administration is attempting to repeal a rule that bans the shooting of bear cubs, use of dogs and bait to hunt bears, and killing caribou from motorboats in Alaska’s federal wildlife refuges. The proposal would scrap a 2015 regulation by the National Park Service that restricts controversial hunting and trapping practices on about 20m acres of federal land in Alaska. Under the rule, hunters cannot target female bears with cubs, nor the cubs themselves. They are also prohibited from killing wolves and coyotes during the summer denning season, shooting caribou while the animals swim, or shooting at caribou from a motorboat. Using dogs or artificial lights to find bears, or luring bears with bait – doughnuts have previously been used for this purpose – is also ruled out. During Barack Obama’s presidency, the National Park Service stressed the rule was necessary to avoid artificially reducing predators and allowing prey numbers to increase, thereby destabilizing the Alaskan ecosystems. The Trump administration has taken a different view, with the proposed repeal stating the rule is “inconsistent” with Alaska’s state-level hunting regulations, which have been geared around the contentious idea that culling bears and wolves will increase the number of caribou available to hunters. The Alaska state government and the state’s congressman Don Young, who has said he was once paid to kill wolves in their dens, have strongly opposed the federal rule, with Young claiming it “destroys a cooperative relationship between Alaska and the federal government”. Conservation groups have reacted in horror, however. “If the administration has its way, it will be perfectly legal for sport hunters to lure bears with greased doughnut bait piles to kill them,” said Theresa Pierno, president of the National Parks Conservation Association. “Or to crawl into bear dens to kill hibernating females and their cubs. This activity is cruel and has no place on America’s national park lands.” Jamie Rappaport Clark, chief executive of Defenders of Wildlife, added: “The Trump administration has somehow reached a new low in protecting wildlife. Allowing the killing of bear cubs and wolf pups in their dens is barbaric.” Last year, Congress and Trump approved a measure to jettison an Obama-era rule that curbed most hunting for large predators in Alaska’s national wildlife preserves. The Department of Interior, of which the National Park Service is a part, has aggressively pushed for expanded hunting rights on federal land, with the interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, last year signing a pair of orders to this end. “Interior is committed to opening access wherever possible for hunting and fishing so that more families have the opportunity to pass down this American heritage,” said Zinke on Monday, as he announced a further initiative to widen hunting access. Zinke has worked to cultivate an image of a rugged outdoorsman – despite occasional confusion over how to fish correctly – and has developed a penchant for first class travel and ceremonies akin to a monarch, such as raising a personal flag over his department’s headquarters whenever he is in the building. The repeal of the hunting rule will now enter a 60-day period for public comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/22/manchester-night-of-sadness-and-solace-songs-arena-bombing","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T21:48:59Z","webTitle":"Looking back with love: Manchester's night of sadness and solace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/22/manchester-night-of-sadness-and-solace-songs-arena-bombing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/22/manchester-night-of-sadness-and-solace-songs-arena-bombing","fields":{"headline":"Looking back with love: Manchester's night of sadness and solace","bodyText":"Music plays such an important part in Manchester’s identity that it was only right and proper that the council decided to mark the anniversary of the Arena attack with a mass singalong. In the days following the bomb, it was in song that Mancunians found solace. Three days after the atrocity, a member of the public sparked a spontaneous civic singing session when she broke into Don’t Look Back in Anger following a minute’s silence in St Ann’s Square, which had been carpeted with floral tributes. A clip went viral, prompting both Gallagher brothers to donate all future royalties from the song to the We Love Manchester fund, which now stands at £21m. It was that anthem that began the singalong in Albert Square on Tuesday night, introduced on video by Noel Gallagher and led by 2,800 amateur singers from choirs across the region. I took part with the Romiley Rock Choir, which is based where I live in Stockport. There was no time for rehearsals, but that wasn’t a problem for those of us who have been singing Oasis songs since 1996. Ariana Grande’s One More Time proved a little more tricky for anyone over 20 and it turns out no one really knows the verses to Never Forget by Take That, despite its belting chorus. The blue skies and warm air were a reminder of what happened a year ago, when 22 people went to a pop concert and didn’t come back alive. I didn’t need a coat then either, as sirens blared and armed police were pressed up against the windows of Marks &amp; Spencer, preparing for marauding gunmen who never appeared. Some of the children who escaped that night have formed the Survivors’ Choir, along with their parents. They sang Andra Day’s Rise Up, which got half the audience blubbing when a little boy on the front row ran for a cuddle from the choir leader before the track got going. Just when we thought the night was over, a trombone piped up from underneath the Albert memorial and started to play All You Need Is Love. A Liverpool song, sung in Manchester: proof that though football can turn neighbours into enemies, music brings everybody together."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/20/venezuela-president-nicolas-maduro-election","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T02:50:16Z","webTitle":"US rejects 'insult to democracy' as Venezuela president Maduro pursues second term","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/20/venezuela-president-nicolas-maduro-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/20/venezuela-president-nicolas-maduro-election","fields":{"headline":"US rejects 'insult to democracy' as Venezuela president Maduro pursues second term","bodyText":"The United States condemned Venezuela’s election as “an insult to democracy” and opposition leaders rejected a “fraud foretold” on Sunday as low voter turnout looked to have spoiled what President Nicolás Maduro had promised would be a great “fiesta” of democracy. Venezuela’s 34,000 polling stations – open since 6am when Maduro cast the first vote – had been due to close at 6pm. But as darkness fell, state broadcaster Telesur announced they would stay open “as long as there are people in line to cast their vote”. In a tweet posted shortly before polling stations should have closed, the US mission to the United Nations indicated it would reject the result, although there was no indication from Venezuelan authorities when one might be announced. “Today’s so-called election in Venezuela is an insult to democracy. It’s time for Maduro to go,” the US said. The president of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, tweeted that his country, “like the majority of democratic countries”, would not recognise the vote. “Venezuela’s elections do not meet the minimum standards for a true democracy. They are not clean or legitimate elections and they do not represent the free and sovereign will of the Venezuelan people,” Piñera wrote. Claudio Fermín, the campaign chief for Maduro’s main opponent, Henri Falcón, claimed his team had documented 900 cases of voting irregularities involving benefits being offered outside polling stations to those who backed the president. “It’s time to remove this cheating government,” Falcón tweeted. Addressing reporters at the presidential palace, Miraflores, earlier in the day Maduro played down those allegations as “small events” that would not affect the overall result. He claimed international criticism was part of a “permanent” campaign of aggression by “the United States’ Klu Klux Klan government”. Maduro is hoping to secure a second six-year term despite leading his oil-rich nation into a shattering economic depression that has prompted one of the worst migration crises in recent Latin American history. Venezuela, South America’s fifth most populous nation, has hyperinflation, crime and chronic shortages of food and medicine. Critics accuse Maduro of turning a once vibrant democracy into an increasingly dictatorial state. But as he cast his vote in the capital, Caracas, on Sunday morning Maduro claimed a veritable democratic “fiesta” was under way. “Today is a historic day that no one will forget,” the 55-year-old former bus driver and foreign minister told Telesur, Venezuela’s state-run broadcaster. “It’s a day of celebration. We are celebrating the freedom that we enjoy in this country … of opinion, of action, of mobilization, of thought – and the freedom to choose.” Maduro loyalists parroted that message as they headed out to vote for the man who inherited Hugo Chávez’s ‘Bolivarian revolution’ after his death in 2013. “Look at the people in the streets!” Delcy Rodríguez, the president of Maduro’s widely reviled constituent assembly, declared. “A big democratic fiesta is taking place in Venezuela.” Critics ridiculed those claims, denouncing the vote, which Venezuela’s mainstream opposition is boycotting and the United States has called a sham, as a “mojiganga” (farce). “These are not elections. They are a farce intended to keep Maduro in power without popular support,” Juan Pablo Guanipa, a prominent opposition leader, told Reuters. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, tweeted: “Sham elections change nothing. We need Venezuelan people running this country … a nation with so much to offer the world.” Amid reports that polling centres had failed to open in some opposition areas and of eerily quiet streets, Falcón, issued a final plea for voters to exercise their democratic right. “The day has come to make history and to save Venezuela,” he tweeted. That looks unlikely, with experts predicting the lowest voter turnout since Chávez was first elected in 1998 will help return Maduro to power despite the social, political and economic turmoil gripping his country. In a televised address on the eve of Sunday’s vote, Maduro rejected claims Venezuela was “in ruins” as an imperialist smear campaign designed to topple his government. “[Instead of attacking Venezuela] why don’t they deal with the humanitarian crisis in Africa: the unemployment, the hunger, the poverty, the lack of education and services?” he asked. “Why don’t they deal with the killing and the crisis in Gaza and the murders of dozens of men and women who are fighting for their land in Palestine?” The Republican senator Marco Rubio joined a growing chorus of criticism on Sunday evening, tweeting in Spanish: “The dictator Nicolas Maduro isn’t fooling anyone. The world has seen this farce and supports the people of Venezuela in their struggle for the return of a democratic country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/20/the-gap-remains-wide-on-the-impact-of-immigration","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T17:07:16Z","webTitle":"The gap remains wide on the impact of immigration | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/20/the-gap-remains-wide-on-the-impact-of-immigration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/20/the-gap-remains-wide-on-the-impact-of-immigration","fields":{"headline":"The gap remains wide on the impact of immigration","bodyText":"An excellent, sane, necessary article by Aditya Chakrabortty, with sound advice for Labour (Migration has benefited the UK. It’s time to bust the myths, 17 May). What is particularly vile is that it is such a cynical ploy. For Fox, Johnson, Gove and the others, curbing migration is not their main motive (though it might be one of May’s, obsessed with keeping her old Home Office targets). For the neocon corporate-backed Brexiteers, the real purpose of Brexit is, as you recently observed (Cabinet divisions over a customs union area proxy for deeper Tory division, 3 May), the bonfire of European regulations which spoil their desperate ambitions for a “purgative transformation of the UK along ultra-Thatcherite lines”. Can you keep reminding us of that? John Airs Liverpool • On immigration, as with austerity, the political centre has narrowed almost to a vanishing point. Indefinite detention without trial, the deportation of former child asylum seekers to countries like Afghanistan and the very existence of Yarl’s Wood are among the many state-sanctioned abuses that will come to seem shocking in time. Yet until the present crisis, the wider aspects of the hostile environment were rarely contested (except by an honourable minority), but enforced in the rightwing press with a Pavlovian system of shocks and alarms. Due credit then to Diane Abbott for breaking this brutal consensus, and starting to make space – at last – for a wiser and kinder approach. This is the Corbyn project at its best. Emma Jones Abingdon, Oxfordshire • Aditya Chakrabortty is right. Immigration has brought many benefits to the UK. What he chooses to ignore is the fact that it also brings great costs. And unfortunately the benefits are reaped overwhelmingly by the middle and upper classes, while the costs are borne overwhelmingly by the working class. Our society already has an obscene gap between the working class and those above them, and uncontrolled and unlimited immigration from the EU only widens that gap, which is why I voted to leave. Paul Miller London • I’m surprised Aditya Chakrabortty did not mention national identity cards. Several EU countries, including Belgium, have a much more restrictive interpretation of “freedom of movement” than the UK. The reason they are able to do this, and Britain is not, is because they all have ID cards. Some senior Tories, like William Hague, have suggested that the coalition made a mistake in reversing Labour’s plan for ID cards in 2010, as this might have prevented the Windrush scandal. Labour should realise it got this right and re-propose ID cards as a means of having more control over immigration, while keeping the benefits of the single market, eg the Norway option. They could at least argue this met Keir Starmer’s “fair management of migration” test. Bill Bryant London • The usually excellent Aditya Chakrabortty’s outrage over the immigration debate conflates the duplicitous use of this issue by leading Brexiteers with a misinterpretation of what really concerns people. Accusing the vast majority who want controls on immigration as being anti-migrant and racist is unacceptable. As is denying that the rapid increase in immigration has made it more difficult to cope with stresses on social infrastructure and that it will continue to do so even when austerity is swept away. Also worrying was the anti-internationalist acceptance of continuing to take Indian doctors and skilled eastern Europeans “educated at someone else’s expense”. For the left to regain credibility it must rethink migration and make a progressive case for limiting “new, large-scale, permanent migration”. New makes it clear that curbing future levels of migration involves no changes for those already legally resident in the country, such as the Windrush generation and those from the EU. Permanent has the caveat that foreign students are welcome to study here and workers fill vacancies here, but only for a specified period. Crucially, the UK must train its own population to prevent the shameful long-term theft of doctors and nurses from the poorer counties which originally paid for their education. There will also be the need for some exceptions, such as genuine marriage partners, civil partners or reunited family members. Colin Hines East Twickenham, Middlesex • Aditya Chakrabortty is right to argue it is time to puncture the historic cross-party negative ideology on immigration that lay behind the Brexit vote and lingers on in the opposition to free movement that bedevils Labour’s approach to the single market. The widespread public post-Windrush revulsion provides a key moment to roll back the “hostile environment”. Labour should promote a “welcoming” environment on immigration and free movement, dismantling the whole inhumane Home Office apparatus that wrecks immigrant lives and careers with deportations, family separations, visa refusals, resistance to child refugees, and absurd financial barriers preventing needed doctors and nurses entering the count. This will be a fierce battle, especially with the rightwing press, but, as Chakrabortty says, Labour has broken the consensus on austerity; now it must do the same on immigration. If not now, when? Gideon Ben-Tovim University of Liverpool • The claims made by the UN’s special rapporteur on racism and xenophobia that anti-migrant rhetoric has become normalised in Britain as a result of Brexit were alarming (Report, 12 May). But while it is important to acknowledge such concerns we should view them in the context of nationally representative data. Earlier this month we launched the third Aurora Humanitarian Index, a study that examines public perceptions of major humanitarian issues. It revealed that more than half (52%) of Britons feel that refugees deserve more support, and 38% of people are regretful that the country is not doing enough to help, up 11 points from last year. Furthermore, 47% of Britons think that legally established immigrants should be able to become citizens of the UK, up 10 points from 2017. While the numbers are still low, it is an encouraging indication that the more nationalistic sentiments around the refugee crisis are abating. Noubar Afeyan Co-founder, Aurora Humanitarian Initiative, Yerevan, Armenia • I would go further than Aditya Chakrabortty. I believe anyone who comes to the UK, wishes to settle here and likes living here should be allowed to do so, and in due course can receive citizenship without undue expense and formality. It was good enough for my grandparents: why should it be denied to others?

The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said on Sunday that negotiations with Chinese officials have borne fruit, meaning Washington and Beijing can step back from imposing punishing tariffs on each other’s exports. “We’re putting the trade war on hold, right now, we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework,” Mnuchin told Fox News. The breakthrough came after two days of talks between Mnuchin and China’s vice-premier, Liu He, in Washington last week. Mnuchin said that the US has won several commitments from Chinese officials that should cut America’s trade deficit with China, which hit $375bn (£278bn) in 2017. However, Beijing has not agreed to cut the deficit by a particular amount, despite the Trump administration pushing for a $200bn reduction. In a statement, the two sides said they had reached “a consensus on taking effective measures” to cut the US trade deficit in goods with China. “To meet the growing consumption needs of the Chinese people and the need for high-quality economic development, China will significantly increase purchases of United States goods and services,” they said. Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency, said the US-Chinese statement amounted to a vow “not to launch a trade war against each other”. Last month, the US and China announced a series of tit-for-tat tariff measures that, if implemented, could have triggered a full-blown trade war. The Trump administration announced 25% tariffs on more than a thousand Chinese products – from robots and depleted uranium to aircraft parts and dishwashing machines. Rather than be cowed, China swiftly hit back with proposals for tariffs of 25% on 106 American products including soybeans, cars and chemical products. This could have hurt farmers in America’s agricultural sector and manufacturers in the “rust belt” – two key election battlegrounds. None of these tariffs have yet come into effect, meaning China and the US can step back from a conflict over trade. The prospect of a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies has weighed on the financial markets in recent weeks, so investors will be relieved that a breakthrough has been reached. But Tai Hui, JP Morgan’s chief market strategist for Asia Pacific, warned that this is unlikely to be the end of tension between the two countries. “Historical precedents suggest the U.S. could re-engage with China on trade issues if it sees China dragging its feet on fulfilling its pledges. Moreover, the last three months have further exposed Washington’s concerns over China’s advancement in technology and its threat as a competitor, both commercially and strategically,” said Hui. “It’s like a back pain that never goes away. It was a shock in the first instance it happened, but then life goes on as the most acute symptoms are addressed. The good news is that markets should learn to live with it and consider its impact more rationally.” America is battling trade issues on several fronts. It has already imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, with European countries pushing for an exemption. Trump is also demanding a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada. Mnuchin, though, says efforts to renegotiate Nafta (the North American free trade agreement) could run until 2019 as negotiators are “still far apart”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/20/stockton-thatcham-bromley-brackley-fa-vase-trophy","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T19:37:15Z","webTitle":"Andy Brown scores decisive penalty as Brackley beat Bromley in FA Trophy final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/20/stockton-thatcham-bromley-brackley-fa-vase-trophy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/20/stockton-thatcham-bromley-brackley-fa-vase-trophy","fields":{"headline":"Andy Brown’s decisive penalty wins FA Trophy for Brackley over Bromley","bodyText":"For 94 minutes it looked as if Brackley Town’s first appearance at Wembley in their 128-year history would wind up as an occasion that would haunt them for a very long time. It would have been impossible for them not to dwell on the improbable number of chances they missed while chasing an equaliser during the second half of a wild FA Trophy final. They hit the post, shanked wide from close range, had a shot cleared off the line and were thwarted on several occasions by Bromley’s indefatigable goalkeeper, David Gregory. But they refused to be denied. With seconds remaining in the fifth minute of stoppage time the club from a small market town in Northamptonshire, and a division below Bromley, drew level at last, as a long-range shot by Matt Lowe struck the post and rebounded into the net off the unfortunate defender Roger Johnson. A tense period of extra-time ensued, followed by an even tenser penalty shootout, which had a couple of twists and went to sudden death before Andy Brown, a deputy headmaster by day, struck the decisive blow for Brackley. That triggered scenes of joy at Wembley that will live long in Northamptonshire folklore. “The noise and sheer jubilation was just fantastic,” said their manager, Kevin Wilkin. “Hopefully days like this will happen again on a regular basis.” Hopefully, sure, but replicating drama like this would be a tall order for any club. Nearly 17,000 Bromley fans who turned up at Wembley – more than six times their average home attendance – will not remember this day quite as fondly. What will nag at them is the fact that they came agonisingly close to a precious honour on the club’s first appearance at Wembley since the 1949 FA Amateur Cup. Omar Bugiel fired them into the lead in the 19th minute with a sharp finish following a strong run by Adam Mekki. But Bugiel blazed over the bar in the shootout when victory was there for the taking. Between those two shots Bromley withstood ferocious pressure from Brackley, who last week lost to Harrogate in a promotion play-off in which victory would have enabled them to join Bromley in the National League next season. During one chaotic spell around the hour James Armson came close to scoring three times, hitting the post from six yards, slicing wide from nearly as close and seeing Gregory repel a third effort. Aaron Williams was also foiled, his low shot cleared off the line by Dan Johnson. Bromley twice threatened to wrap up victory on the counterattack but Brandon Hanlon was stopped first by a superb last-ditch tackle by Gareth Dean and then by a good save by Danny Lewis. Dean ventured up the other end in the dying seconds and it was he who applied the pressure that forced Johnson to stab the ball into his own goal. Johnson, a former Premier League defender who won the League Cup here with Birmingham City in 2011, was as distraught as Brackley were delighted. Bromley edged back in front when Gregory saved from Shane Byrne in the first shot of the shootout. But then Bugiel missed and Jack Holland hit the post, setting the scene for Brown to claim victory by slotting into the net, which he duly did before towards the outstretched arms of 5,500 Brackley fans. Brackley’s triumph completed a thrilling double-header of non-league showdowns at the national stadium. Earlier Stockton Town and Thatcham Town contested the FA Vase final, the showpiece competition for clubs from the eighth tier and lower. The teams, from different leagues in the ninth tier, were appearing on this stage for the first time, their runs to the final representing the latest high point in several seasons of remarkable progression by each club. Thatcham, champions of the Hellenic League, won 1-0 thanks to a penalty by their prolific striker, Shane Cooper-Clark. Thatcham had good reason to be confident of scoring as they went into the game, having won their league title this season on goal difference after netting 129 times in 38 matches. The west Berkshire side duly broke the deadlock in the 21st minute thanks to a penalty awarded after a foul by Jamie Ward on Jordan Brown. Cooper-Clark rammed the spotkick into the net, albeit via the left hand of Michael Arthur. That brought the striker’s tally for the season to a preposterous 63 goals. Stockton, a Teeside club who began playing senior football only in 2009 and won back-to-back promotions to reach their current perch in Northern League Division One, created chances throughout an absorbing game but could not force an equaliser, as centre-back Baboucarr Jarra twice made goal-saving interventions for Thatcham."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/20/john-bostock-car-crash-bursaspor-crystal-palace","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T14:04:00Z","webTitle":"John Bostock: ‘You see life differently when you’re that close to death’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/20/john-bostock-car-crash-bursaspor-crystal-palace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/20/john-bostock-car-crash-bursaspor-crystal-palace","fields":{"headline":"John Bostock: ‘You see life differently when you’re that close to death’","bodyText":"Footballers enjoy privileges that few can aspire to but for John Bostock the simple pleasure of being alive is enough. Last year when travelling back home in England following a game for his French team Lens, the former Crystal Palace midfielder suffered a head-on crash while driving down the motorway at 3am. The other driver was drunk and going the wrong way at 70mph, resulting in his passenger dying and Bostock’s car being a crumpled heap, but he was miraculously unhurt. “Scientifically, I probably shouldn’t have survived that crash. Two cars hitting each other head-on at 70mph, it made me appreciate life, appreciate family and appreciate the gift that we have to live every day,” Bostock says as we sit in the dugout at his new club, Bursaspor. “It was a big wake-up call, something that there isn’t a plan to get over. You just have to focus on the future and take every day as it comes, appreciate life for what it is. I am grateful that I went through it because you see life in a different way when you’re that close to death.” Bostock expected the damage to be worse but his strong Christian faith ensured he recovered from an incident which could have been far worse. “It is only by the grace of God I survived that crash. It is something you never want to be involved in but a huge wake-up call to life. As footballers we focus on football, your career and your own life but when something like that happens it makes you realise about life in general. My family were really shaken to find out someone lost their life in the crash, which was devastating. I came out without a graze, thankfully. Psychologically it took a bit to get over but I was back playing in 10 days. “When you are involved in something like that, you are always thinking ‘What if? What if?’ and sometimes you get flashbacks. I couldn’t sleep for a night, it has a big affect on your family but it also made me realise I have a destiny to achieve; I am here for a reason.” The tumultuous nature of football is something he can take in his stride after the disappointment of being tipped as a future England captain in his teens. Now that he is 26 and has survived a major car crash the prospect of switching continents at the end of the winter transfer window was not something to be feared. Last season he won the Ligue 2 player of the season award but it took until the 2009-10 Turkish Super Lig champions Bursaspor approached him on the penultimate day of January for him to move on to bigger things. “It just came last minute but I spoke to the coach, I was ready for a change. I really wanted to play first division in a good league in Europe and I had several offers but I spoke to the coach here, Paul Le Guen, who in France is a legend. My friend Will Ekong is here and told me all about Bursa and the club, the supporters and the size of the club. We spoke, I considered it with my wife and my family, it was a quick decision but one we made and really believed it was in my best interests to sign and so far I am happy with my choice.” From the relative tranquillity of Ligue 2, Bostock was thrust into a home debut against the Turkish giants Besiktas. It was a baptism of fire as the Englishman discovered the atmosphere he could expect at his new home ground, which is shaped like a crocodile in honour of the club’s nickname. “One of the things you realise very quickly is that it’s a cauldron of football. If you can play here in front of the fans and with the pressure then you can play anywhere. You see videos of how passionate the fans are. In my debut against Besiktas you couldn’t hear anything on the pitch, you couldn’t hear your team-mates, you couldn’t hear yourself think but that’s just the way of the fans, as they give you everything but they want something back.” This interview takes place on a day the club’s players have refused to train having not been paid for five months, meaning Bostock had not received a penny in wages since his January arrival. Despite the financial issues, the midfielder is adamant he has made the right decision for his well-travelled career. “I’ve played in MLS, I’ve played in Belgium and France but here it’s completely different. I thought I’d seen everything in football but I’ve come here, seen a little bit more but honestly it’s an amazing place to play. The standard is terrific, I am playing against world class players almost every week, internationals in every club.” After helping OH Leuven to promotion in Belgium and being named the best footballer in Ligue 2, Bostock has attracted suitors once again in England where he is still thought of as the kid at Palace who then never made the grade at Tottenham. But now older and more mature, he does not fear returning to England to show what he has become. “People may feel like if I came back to England I may need to prove something but I am not worried. Maybe a few years ago I would feel worried and that I would need to prove myself, that I was this wonderkid but I don’t need to prove any of that any more. If I came back I would just want to do the best job I could for the club I play for and enjoy playing in England in front of my friends and family in the most watched league in the world.” After helping ensure Bursaspor’s top-flight status for another season, Bostock is continuing to look forward as he never wants to dwell on the past, whether it be in football or his horrific car crash. “I want to be remembered as somebody who fulfilled the purpose they were created for. Sometimes if you start comparing yourself to others, you start chasing other people’s destinies and purposes. I believe I was made for a purpose. I am who I am and I’ve been on my own journey, it’s formed me to be the man I am today, my character, the way I play, it’s not been easy, so I want to be remembered as someone who never gave up and pushed to fulfil his potential.” When Bostock left Spurs with nowhere to go, he was worried his football career would be taken away from him but he came close to suffering the greatest loss, so he is rightly content proving himself right and others wrong from afar."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/20/elina-svitolina-simona-halep-rome-open-final","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T12:54:49Z","webTitle":"Elina Svitolina retains Italian Open with straight-sets win over Simona Halep","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/20/elina-svitolina-simona-halep-rome-open-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/20/elina-svitolina-simona-halep-rome-open-final","fields":{"headline":"Elina Svitolina retains Italian Open with straight-sets win over Simona Halep","bodyText":"The world No 1, Simona Halep, collapsed spectacularly in her rematch with Elina Svitolina to hand the Ukrainian a second Italian Open title. It took the fourth seed just over an hour to dispose of her wounded foe, 6-0, 6-4, her fourth win over Halep in six meetings. Last year they battled for more than two hours and three sets in the final before Svitolina overpowered Halep. This time the one-way traffic started early. They head for Roland Garros encouraged by solid performances during the week here but Halep has cause for concern if, as seems likely, she has a back problem. The Romanian was not remotely in the contest in an opening set that sped by in 19 minutes and, after taking a medical timeout in the second, managed to make something of a fight of it. However, it was a disappointing spectacle for a showpiece event on Campo Centrale, which is normally a bearpit in big matches, with the Roman crowd craning forward from the steep seats baying for action as if it were the coliseum. The gladiatorial content was minimal on Sunday. Halep looked to be restricted in her sideways movement, although she was all smiles during the presentation, regretting that she could not have performed better when it mattered. Both finalists had reached the decider having dropped a single set. In the first frame Halep’s attack lacked all potency as she took only two points from 15 first serves and was constantly on the back foot in rallies, yet still managed to save two of five break points before succumbing. Svitolina dominated her with ball in hand, winning a phenomenal 86% of first serves. Halep left the court for a medical time out at 2-3 in the second and returned to engage in a fightback that finally spluttered into life in the seventh game, when she saved two break points to hold with an ace for 3-4. She threatened to break serve in the eighth game but Svitolina held her composure. Clearly still not properly coordinated in her movement, Halep struggled to stay in the contest, with the sympathy of the crowd countermanding the determination of her opponent. She fought to deuce, thrashing her forehand as hard as she could into the corners, and held with a scorching backhand down the line. But she looked far from happy as Svitolina stepped up to serve for the match just past the hour. Svitolina calmly worked the ball to either side, setting up two championship points with a forehand to the deuce corner, but slugged a backhand into the tramlines. Halep did the job for her, though, by dumping a tired backhand into the net. The champion’s celebrations were as low-key as the loser’s resignation was complete. It was not a great final. “It’s the second time, so I wish I will be in the final again next year and maybe win it,” Halep said. For Svitolina it was just “a very, very special day” to retain her trophy. She thanked the fans wholeheartedly, in the worn tradition of such gestures, but there will not have been many in the crowd who went away with fond memories of this one-sided affair."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/20/gary-cahill-antonio-conte-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T21:30:07Z","webTitle":"Gary Cahill urges Chelsea to resolve situation over Antonio Conte’s future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/20/gary-cahill-antonio-conte-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/20/gary-cahill-antonio-conte-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"Gary Cahill urges Chelsea to  resolve situation over Antonio Conte’s future","bodyText":"Gary Cahill, the Chelsea captain, has urged the club’s board to end the uncertainty surrounding Antonio Conte’s future at Stamford Bridge after leading his team to the FA Cup, a success which went some way towards “saving” the club’s season. Chelsea are expected to sack Conte despite the Italian having made clear his intention to honour the final 12 months of his £9m-a-year contract in the wake of the 1-0 victory over Manchester United in Saturday’s final. That win ensured the 48-year-old has claimed major silverware in each of his seasons in charge but the relationship with the hierarchy, strained since last summer, appears fractured beyond repair. The head coach has aired his grievances, largely over recruitment policy, repeatedly over the course of a turbulent campaign and his post-match comments on Saturday, insisting he would not change and that better players were needed to pursue a more expansive brand of football, in effect equated to a “back-me-or-sack-me” message. His players admitted the ambiguity over Conte’s future had been unsettling during a disappointing title defence, with Chelsea having ended up outside the Champions League places in fifth and 30 points behind Manchester City. “Certainly we’ve felt the sense of uncertainty,” said Cahill, who has now claimed seven major trophies in a little over six years at the club. “That is obvious to everybody in the last few months. What I can say is that the players do not have any impact on that situation. I am sure, if I was a guessing man, that the club and manager will have spoken. Let’s see. I am sure the manager will make the best decision for himself and his family. I am sure the club will make the best decision what they feel.” Those sentiments were echoed by the goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who is entering the final year of his contract at the club and suggested he would know only “after the World Cup if I am a Chelsea player next year”. Asked what needs to change for Chelsea to challenge for the top four again next season, Cahill added: “Probably for the uncertainty to be put to bed and whatever is going to happen to happen. It’s totally out of our hands. “All I can say is that it has been a great finish. Winning this trophy feels absolutely amazing. I felt that we really had to win this game to save the season and, in the end, we have won a trophy which a number of teams have not managed to do and it is very difficult to do. If the manager doesn’t stay next year, then he has gone away with a Premier League and an FA cup. That is something that everyone at the club can be proud of.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/20/what-might-saturdays-guardian-have-looked-like-if-unrepentantly-royalist","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T17:05:54Z","webTitle":"What might Saturday’s Guardian have looked like if unrepentantly royalist? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/20/what-might-saturdays-guardian-have-looked-like-if-unrepentantly-royalist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/20/what-might-saturdays-guardian-have-looked-like-if-unrepentantly-royalist","fields":{"headline":"What might Saturday’s Guardian have looked like if unrepentantly royalist?","bodyText":"Gary Younge (It’s not Harry and Meghan. The problem is the monarchy, 19 May) is, as so often, right when he writes: “A monarchy establishes inherited privilege at the heart of government and embeds patronage at the centre of power.” I am preparing a lecture for some very bright students from a Shanghai university on “From monarchy to poverty: social class in the UK in the 21st century”. A colleague tells me this is a frivolous and flippant title, utterly meaningless today. Maybe.

Bruce Ross-Smith Oxford • Thanks to Stuart Heritage for his suggestions of TV programmes to watch instead of the royal wedding (19 May). I found a better alternative. I took the newspaper into the garden and read everything that didn’t relate to weddings or football. (Sali Hughes – eyebrow shapers – who knew?) I completed the quick crossword, made a creditable start on the cryptic and retired hurt from the hard Sudoku when my brain encountered a logical impossibility and shut down. Good old Guardian. All this for £2.90. I think it’s safe to go back indoors now. Lindy Hardcastle Groby, Leicestershire • To paraphrase Marina Hyde (After a toxic buildup to the royal wedding, are we entertained? 19 May), it is fitting that you led your coverage of the royal wedding by repeating one of the oldest pieces of fake news on record. No woman showed her garter to Edward III while dancing – garters were not worn until the 15th century. According to the historian Richard Barber, the term “garter” probably referred to a knight’s belt. The story of the dancing lady is a much later embellishment.

Washing up on the shores of a country they were not expecting seemed, at first, like yet another blow. They had set off for Malaysia where families and jobs were waiting. Instead they arrived in Indonesia’s Aceh province, on the northern tip of the island of Sumatra. The deeply conservative Islamic province is home to Sharia law and remembered worldwide as the epicentre of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. But it is also one of the only places in the world to openly welcome Rohingya refugees, whom many Acehnese regard as their Muslim brothers and sisters. The Rohingya, a Muslim minority from Myanmar, have been called the most friendless people on earth. Nearly 700,000 live in refugee camps in Bangladesh after fleeing violence and persecution at home, something the UN has described as having “all the hallmarks of genocide”. Refugee boats have been turned away from Thailand and Malaysia, but in Aceh arrivals have been met with generous donations and fellowship ever since the first of nine Rohingya vessels washed up in 2015. At least 1,740 Rohingya have landed in Aceh in the past 10 years, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). Nearly all have been from the state of Rakhine. ‘Taking care of us like parents’ The most recent boat arrival, in the coastal town of Bireuen, population 40,000, came during the weekly Friday prayers a few weeks ahead of Ramadan, the holiest month of the year. “They are taking care of us like parents take care of their children,” says Mohammad Shobir, a Rohingya man who came with his wife in the boat. “We were very scared when we landed, but these people have given us everything: food, medicine, shelter … we want to express our sincere gratitude to them.” The refugees are staying in a temporary camp run jointly by the IOM and a local social services agency. After Ramadan they will be moved to more permanent shelter in the city of Langsa. The first day of Ramadan was bittersweet in the camp. “We are fed very well here but we don’t taste the food,” says Mohammad Illyas, 24, who left three children behind in an internally displaced persons camp in Rakhine state. “My family doesn’t eat if I don’t work for even one day, so right now I have no idea how they are coping.” He had hoped to find work in Malaysia, where at least 150,000 Rohingya live. He has no plans to leave now because they are under the care of IOM and the UN and have no way to organise another boat trip. The Rohingya are not generally welcomed in Malaysia – they have no legal right to work or to formal education – but their sheer numbers mean they can find work in the “grey market”. Donations pile up The camp in Bireuen is in an empty government complex of cream and dark green buildings around an open field. There are men’s and women’s dormitories and a mosque where some of the Rohingya work together with local people to conduct their prayers five times a day. “We take turns singing the azan [Muslim call to prayer] and then the Acehnese lead us in prayer,” says Huzaifa, a 16-year-old boy known as “the imam” because he spent years in a madrasa and is proficient in Qur’anic Arabic. There is also a health clinic and one large room devoted to donations: towers of instant noodle boxes, egg crates, cooking oil and piles of clothes. The refugees wear donated hijabs and sarongs, and the men have white pecis, the stiff caps common to Muslim men in the region, which were donated by local mosques and charities. Young Acehnese volunteers appear united in their sense of duty. They variously say they are helping out “because they are our Muslim brothers”; “because my soul felt called to do it”; and “because it’s our duty as Acehnese”. Saw Myint from the office of the United Nations high commissioner for refugees in Bangkok has been visiting the camp and says the reception given to the Rohingya had been “unique” in the region. “The refugees cry when expressing their gratitude. The Achehnese are very pious, humble, helpful.” ‘I am a survivor too’ Zulfikar is an Acehnese man from the social affairs ministry and is in charge of running the camp. He has been sleeping in the camp and has put all other duties on hold. “My wife hasn’t seen me in 22 days!” he says cheerfully. “According to our maritime law in Aceh, we don’t ask any arrivals’ religion, race and so forth,” he says. “The most important thing is saving lives, not national law.” Indonesia does not officially recognise refugees and is not a signatory to the 1945 UN convention. “I’m a survivor of the [2004 Boxing Day] tsunami too, like many people in Aceh,” adds Zulfikar. Aceh bore the brunt of that tsunami with a death toll of more than 100,000. “We all know what it is like to live through a disaster.” Absent family The first fast of Ramadan is broken at 6.45pm. In the afternoon about 40 volunteers cook the evening’s feast: rice, fish, noodles, cucumber salad, beef in a coconut milk curry, fried and spiced eggplant. All the ingredients come from donations. A Rohingya woman named Fatima Khatu, the fiancee of Mohammad Shobir, cooks a spiced chicken recipe from home called kurar gustu rendi. Some other Rohingya men shake a tamarind tree in the compound to make juice from the pulp. At sundown everyone gathers , the women and children on one tarp and the men on another. When the evening call to prayer finally sounds they gulp down fruit punch and eat dates, the traditional fast-breaking food, and then polish off a selection of Acehnese sweets, including slabs of jelly and buns stuffed with sweet shredded coconut. The men pray together on a large, raised platform in rows, while the women retreat to their dormitory building to pray in private. But beneath the celebration and the relief, anguish remains. “We are glad to have food here,” says Fatima, who left two children behind in Rakhine. “We are very lucky. But nothing else is certain. We don’t know how our families are.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/24/liverpool-v-real-madrid-motogp-magic-and-cycling-in-the-snow","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T09:36:07Z","webTitle":"Liverpool v Real Madrid, MotoGP magic and cycling in the snow | Classic YouTube","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/24/liverpool-v-real-madrid-motogp-magic-and-cycling-in-the-snow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/24/liverpool-v-real-madrid-motogp-magic-and-cycling-in-the-snow","fields":{"headline":"MotoGP magic, Liverpool v Real Madrid and cycling in the snow","bodyText":"1) There have been plenty of memorable Liverpool versus Real Madrid, including the 1981 European Cup final, with Alan Kennedy settling it, but if the crucial goal in the competition is not your thing, then catch up with every Reds strike from that year’s competition. They wouldn’t see each other again for another 28 years, until the first knockout round in 2008/9: Yossi Benayoun knocked in a winner at the Bernabéu, setting up a tense return at Anfield...which turned out to be nothing of the sort as Liverpool absolutely hosed Real 4-0, in part thanks to some generous officiating. And then there was 2014, of which the less said the better from Liverpool’s point of view: their first-team lost 3-0 at Anfield, while Brendan Rodgers’s bafflingly selected reserves were beaten 1-0 in Madrid. 2) Motorbikes never seem like the safest vehicle to be riding at 150mph, so when someone crashes inches in front of you, avoiding them is unlikely, unless you are MotoGP rider Jakob Kronfeil who sees it as a mere obstacle to jump over at ludicrous speed. 3) Andrés Iniesta bowed out of Spanish football at the weekend, but his lovely team-mates have paid tribute to him via some delightful words. 4) Stage 20 of the Giro d’Italia brings everything from climbs to snow, making it a tough one for anyone competing, especially as there is plenty at stake. 5) It’s Aston Villa v Fulham in the play-off final this weekend, which is a timely reminder of the cleanest strike in history at Loftus Road when Jon Harley arrowed a 35-yard stunner into the top corner. 6) Tennis is a tough sport and can bring grown men to tears, especially on clay. Alternatively, it can make you feel like dancing (in the rain).

This peculiar fact came to British attention in 2010, during a BBC documentary about the Nigerian capital Lagos. A local man, Chubby, told the filmmakers how life in Lagos is not for the foolish. “Anybody who came to Lagos and he didn’t learn sense, he cannot get sense ever,” said Chubby. “Because here if you are a fool, they will learn you how to get sense. If you are a ‘Dundee United’, when they start to pour shit on you, you will get sense.” As this article in the Scotsman explains, many believe this stems from a disastrous tour in 1972. There is also a suggestion that, when Nigeria were based at Dens Park during the Under-16 World Cup of 1989, some mischievous Dundee fans decided to enrich their vocabulary. That’s one of the better examples of a club team becoming slang around the world. Another comes from Korea, as explained by Oliver Trenchard. “There is a phrase in Korea called ‘Leeds Days’ (리즈시절) that refers to a person or thing’s heyday,” says Oliver. “It relates back to the turn of the century when Leeds and more specifically Alan Smith were enjoying considerable success in Europe, and the fact they dropped off after that heyday.” You’re probably all familiar with the appropriation of Bristol City. The Turkey national team has also unwittingly provided football with soupçon of erotica. “The national team has made its way into the Turkish language with the phrase ‘Milli olmak’, which refers to a player’s first international call-up,” says Önder Susam. “It is used for a man who’s had sex for the first time. It’s use as an innuendo can be seen here as Rıdvan Dilmen bursts into laughter upon hearing the question ‘When did you get your first call-up?’.” Peter Svensson reminds us that, in Denmark, a ‘rigtig Jesper Olsen’ (a real Jesper Olsen) refers to an egregious mistake in any walk of life. That stems from his notorious backpass at the 1986 World Cup, which led to the most exciting team in the competition being pumped 5-1 by Spain. Although poor Loris Karius had the worst night of his life on Saturday, it could be worse. His name may be mud, but at least it’s not slang. Do you have any other examples? If so, you know what to do. Goal difference difference “Hull finished this season 18th in the Championship with a goal difference of 0, while the team directly below them, Birmingham, had a goal difference of -30,” mails Christopher Harding. “Is this the largest goal difference, um, difference between two teams finishing next to one another?” Most of you pointed out this season’s 39-goal gap between Manchester City (+79) and Manchester United (+40). But that’s small beer in the magical world of goal difference difference. “Recently Celtic won the Scottish Premiership in 2014 with a +77 goal difference,” says Sean De Loughry. “Second placed Motherwell had a +4 goal difference. That’s a difference of 73 goals.” “They can’t hold a light to the 1917-18 MTK side who, it would be fair to say, dominated the Hungarian top flight,” continues Sean. “They scored an impressive 147, conceding 10, for a +137 goal difference, 117 goals better than runners-up Ferencvaros.” Michael Peters can see that +117 and raise it. “If it counts, the Federated States of Micronesia finished their 2015 Pacific Games group stage with a goal difference of -114, which is very impressive considering they played only three games. Third placed Vanuatu ended on +45 (thanks to beating Micronesia 46-0), a jump of 159 goals.” Goal difference, bloody hell. If you can beat that, get in touch. Jury service “Has there ever been an occasion where a major team has been disrupted by jury service, with either a manager or a player being called up during the season?” James Schofield asked a few weeks back. “Plymouth’s Welsh international Carl Fletcher once tried to argue he couldn’t sit on a jury as he was too well known,” begins Andy Carswell. “According to reports in 2010, Judge Francis Gilbert told the midfielder that being Plymouth captain was not sufficient reason to excuse him, and that he had enough time to travel to Cheltenhamfor a Johnstone’s Paint Trophy tie after completing his duties. “Fletcher argued that his position meant he was in a position of potentially being threatened, saying: ‘I don’t want anything to come back on me for sitting on a jury.’ His protests fell on deaf ears, with Judge Gilbert adding: ‘Lots of well-known people, some more famous than you, have been required to sit on juries.’” Knowledge archive “Is it true that Chilean players drank vodka during the 1962 World Cup because they thought it would help their chances of beating the USSR?” asked Steven Davison back in the summer of 2006. Incredibly, Steven, it is. During the group stage, the hosts employed an interesting new tactic of pre-game stereotypical eating: before the opening 3-1 win over Switzerland, they ate cheese, followed by a preparatory meal of spaghetti before the 2-0 success against Italy. Once in the quarter-finals, the Chileans prepared for their game with the mighty Soviets by downing a couple of Smirnoffs. The ploy actually worked and Chile went on to win 2-1. Coffee was the order of the day before the semi-final with Brazil, but although it perked them up no end in the morning, it couldn’t stop the Brazilians from winning 4-2 and going on to lift the trophy. Eduardo Galeano wrote in Soccer in Sun and Shadow that Chile “gobbled down spaghetti, chocolate, and vodka, but choked on the coffee”. For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive. Can you help? Rotherham’s victory in the League One play-off final means that all of the three teams who dropped out of the Championship last season have secured an immediate return to the division (Wigan and Blackburn being the others). Are there any previous occasions where this has happened?” wonders Jonathan Hart. “Now that Swansea, Stoke and West Brom are gone and Cardiff and Fulham are in, the Premier League has never looked so alphabetically top-heavy. The 10th team are Huddersfield! Is this a record?” asks Mike McCarthy. “I was watching the highlights of Watford’s 2012-13 season recently and noticed that in the 6-1 win against Leeds, five of their goals were scored from outside the area,” says Will Paterson. “Are there any other examples of games with so many of the goals for one team coming from so far out?” “Which team has the worst record at Wembley Stadium?” asks Chris Beesley.

On Friday night in Brisbane, Broncos super-speedster James Roberts had a veritable ding-do go with rangy Rooster Latrell Mitchell, the pair running into each other with relish and high gusto. It was entertaining and compelling fare, and finished in a split-points decision – Brad Fittler could pick them both. In the same match Dylan Napa threw his not inconsiderable bulk about, and got all lippy and tough with his opponents. With form a little dodgy of late, Napa has gone into warrior mode, bristling with nark and intent. He reminds of a suitor out to impress a mate, in this case Maroons head coach Kevin Walters. Though what Walters thought of Napa’s head-first collision with Korbin Sims’ jaw, one could only speculate. Pundits vigorously defended the prop’s tackling style, arguing that he couldn’t pull out of the play. But it still looked illegal. Napa went at Sims with arms out-stretched like a condor of the Andes, his great red head aimed at Sims’ jaw. Then: boom, and Sims was laid out prone. There followed one of those post-contact “melees” that provided Napa an opportunity to show off his muscles to Walters. Yet Walters has already lost his best player in Cameron Smith; and one fancies he’d understand in the cold-eyed and rational way of the coach that having a player not on the field is bad for a team’s chances. And for all the entertainment of Napa’s aggressive, frothing, gung-ho style, not being on the field is not good. Granted, sending players off in State of Origin has been against the (unstated) rules. Indeed only two players have received “red cards” – Craig Greenhill for nearly decapitating Paul Harragon, and Gorden Tallis for calling Bill Harrigan a “cheat”. Yet in 2018, it seems the whistle men have been empowered to blow it as they see it. Blowing penalties is the new black. There have been a lot. And should you fly into a tackle with crazy-eyed intent, and your head connects with your opponent’s jaw, and lays him out, well, you’re an accident waiting to be penalised. You’re a liability. It’s a lesson one fancies Craig Bellamy will be imparting, and earnestly, upon Curtis Scott, the 20-year-old centre mentioned in despatches around a NSW Origin gig. Because the old trope – what have you gotta do to be sent off in rugby league? – has been answered: punch someone in the head. On Saturday night in Melbourne, Scott set out to show he was a man whose jib Walters might like the cut of. Following rude taunting by fellow Origin aspirant Dylan Walker there was a multi-man ruckus in which Scott threw a punch – an actual punch – which connected with Walker’s left eye socket, and broke it, causing it to swell like that of a bullfrog morphed with Laurie Oakes. Didn’t the locals love it? When Walker’s bulbous black-eye flashed onto the big screen at AAMI Park, Storm fans cheered. Then they cheered again for Scott as he was marched off the field, a man who’d effectively lost them the game. Funny game, rugby league. And no argument. One of the funnier things about it is the popularity of fighting. Former Origin legend Chris “Choppy” Close declared on Facebook: “Curtis Scott is my new Hero!!!” Meanwhile, fresh-made memes flashed about congratulating Scott for single-handedly “bringing back the biff”, the violence that authorities have sought to banish. And yet as we saw across the weekend, every now and again the code harks back to its blood-knuckled roots, and spunk-filled colts, imbued with stories of Origin and battles at Brookvale as men look to live the legend. State of Origin, like any great adventure, provides stories and legends to stoke imaginations. And State of Origin has more stories than Russell Crowe’s Book of Feuds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/21/motability-needs-a-new-road-map-for-managing-finances-mps-say","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T05:00:17Z","webTitle":"Motability needs a new road map for managing finances, MPs say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/21/motability-needs-a-new-road-map-for-managing-finances-mps-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/21/motability-needs-a-new-road-map-for-managing-finances-mps-say","fields":{"headline":"Motability needs a new road map for managing finances, MPs say","bodyText":"MPs have called for an overhaul of the management of the Motability car leasing scheme for disabled drivers after concerns were raised over its “totally unacceptable” pay for top executives. Two select committees – Treasure and work and pensions – say the £1.7m earned by the scheme’s chief executive, Mike Betts, in 2017 was unjustifiable at a monopoly provider effectively sustained by public money. They accuse Motability for maintaining £2.4bn of financial reserves, which they argue is unnecessary and out of proportion to the potential risks faced by the scheme. “It is difficult to square the high levels of executive pay and significant financial reserves at Motability Operations, the company that runs the scheme, with its charitable objectives and the wider context of pressures on welfare expenditure,” the MPs report says. “Motability badly needs a new road map for how it manages the scheme’s finances.” Motability now faces an investigation by the government spending watchdog the National Audit Office into whether its top pay levels deliver value for money and whether its monopoly over car leasing to disabled people should be broken up. “Motability provides an extremely valuable service to disabled people. That should not however exempt it from scrutiny,” the report says. Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, and RBS, the four high street banks that finance the Motability leasing arm are also criticised for making “significant profits from a virtually risk-free investment in a charitable scheme”. They rake in guaranteed payments of more than £700,000 each year from Motability. The scheme enables disabled people to lease adapted cars by using by their enhanced mobility disability benefits – either disability living allowance (DLA) or its successor, personal independence payment (PIP). It currently helps 629,000 people, many of who would otherwise struggle to afford a vehicle. Although Motability does not directly receive public funds, it is dependent for nearly half of its income on £2bn a year of disability benefits redirected by the Department of Work and Pensions on behalf of claimants. It also received £750m in tax breaks through exemptions from VAT and insurance premium tax. Political and media concern over Motability’s top pay levels in recent months has been accompanied by anger that 75,000 disabled people – 43% of Motability clients – have been forced to return lease cars after being re-tested when moving from DLA to PIP. MPs are scathing about Motability’s justification that the amount paid to Betts – up 78% in nine years – was in line with similar roles at comparable FTSE 250 businesses. The report points out that, as a state-supported monopoly, the scheme faces no competition, no shareholder pressure or credit risks. Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions committee, said: “The levels of pay pocketed by its executives and the cash reserves it is hoarding are totally out of whack with reality of its position in the market. That one member of staff is paid over 10 times what the prime minister earns, is one example of where Motability needs to get a grip of itself and realise the privileged position in which it trades.” The report takes issue with Motability’s claims that increasing its reserve levels by 328% since 2008 was necessary to insulate against the risk of used-car values plummeting. It calls on the scheme to take steps to reduce reserves by cutting prices to customers or making higher donations to charities. Motability said it welcomed the NAO investigation and noted that the report said it provided an extremely valuable service to disabled people: “This reflects our priorities of always providing outstanding customer service, value for money, sustainability, and putting disabled people and their families on the road to freedom.” Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury committee, said Motability was a valuable service that appeared to have lost its way: “Such high levels of executive pay and significant financial reserves are difficult to square with the honourable objectives of the scheme.” The Department for Work and Pensions said: “The secretary of state [Esther McVey] has stated that Motability provides an extremely valuable service to disabled people but the levels of executive pay and financial reserves are concerning. Following her intervention, she is pleased agreement has now been secured for the NAO to look into this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/20/machine-head-review-roundhouse-london","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T13:17:59Z","webTitle":"Machine Head review – thrillingly brutal metal marathon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/20/machine-head-review-roundhouse-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/20/machine-head-review-roundhouse-london","fields":{"headline":"Machine Head review – thrillingly brutal metal marathon","bodyText":"After receiving some uncomfortably mixed reviews for their latest album, Catharsis, Machine Head could have embarked on their latest world tour with major concerns about the state of their reputation. The cheering reality is that virtually every show on the Oakland quartet’s current tour has sold out, including two nights at the Roundhouse. Billed as “An Evening With ...”, there is something gently revolutionary about the way Machine Head have abandoned standard package tours and festival slots, preferring to eschew support acts and play for the best part of three hours every night. It’s an approach that suits them perfectly, partly because they have a catalogue big enough to make it work but also because frontman Robb Flynn’s lyrics have taken on a furious political edge of late, subtly isolating the band from their peers in the process. Emerging in front of a stark, ghostly backdrop and launching into the bullish, dramatic Imperium, tonight feels like a victory for Flynn’s crew from the start. Friday night’s crowd had been a little subdued, but Saturday’s is anything but: the swirling mosh pits that erupt during the post-Charlottesville tirade of Volatile are but an hors d’oeuvre for the explosion of crowd-surfers, circle pits and startlingly loud singalongs that steadily build in strength through the show. It’s the classic, heavy tracks that have the most impact, of course. Now We Die, Ten Ton Hammer and Locust all fly by in a blur of limbs and airborne beer. After 25 songs and nearly three hours, Flynn conducts the audience through the dark and brutal but thrillingly euphoric Halo and, for a few thunderous moments, Machine Head seem like the only current metal band who really matter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/20/saturday-night-live-tina-fey-season-finale-seinfeld-cumberbatch-de-niro","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T11:33:14Z","webTitle":"Saturday Night Live: Tina Fey hosts all-star season finale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/20/saturday-night-live-tina-fey-season-finale-seinfeld-cumberbatch-de-niro","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/20/saturday-night-live-tina-fey-season-finale-seinfeld-cumberbatch-de-niro","fields":{"headline":"Saturday Night Live: Tina Fey hosts all-star season finale","bodyText":"A modest diner in New Jersey.

Jerry Seinfeld is first. “Do you think the show has too many celebrity cameos these days?” Benedict Cumberbatch is next. “Is Kenan Thompson going to be on the show tonight? He’s great, but have you ever thought about replacing Kenan with a slightly more famous person? Could be fun?” Chris Rock is next. “Never mind,” he says. And DeNiro: “With all the makeup, could you tell that I was Robert Mueller?” Fred Armisen: “Do you think it’s weird that so many former cast members hang around the show all the time?” “Does it seem weird to you?” says Fey. “No, I think it’s great,” says Armisen. Then he gives a brief lecture about juicing and fiber. Anne Hathaway: “So that was actually Robert De Niro? Wow.” Donald Glover: “I was here a couple of weeks ago and I forgot my hat.” And finally, Tracy Morgan, to give her a special birthday wish. “My birthday was actually yesterday, though,” Tina says. “Well, surprise girl,” says Tracy. “You’re 60, baby. That’s gross but I love you.” The royal wedding reception! Very impressive that Day is wearing an accurate version of Harry’s outfit from the morning. “Meghan’s out in the hallway trying to stop some of her white relatives from coming in, because they’re mental,” he says. Thompson is Meghan’s great-uncle, talking to the Queen in her lime green hat and suit, played by McKinnon. Incredible props to the SNL wardrobe department for turning these around so quickly. He’s telling her to watch The Crown because “they make her a bitch on that show”. She looks slightly appalled. “He wants me to go to Philadelphia,” she says. Harry goes through to the “rando table” where he meets one of Meghan’s Deal or No Deal colleagues, played by Gardner. “I brought the briefcase!” she says. Fey is a duchess who is “both your aunt and your niece”. And Aidy Bryant does a good Elton John: “Hold me closer, tiny ginger,” she sings. Morning Joe: McKinnon is Mika and Alex Moffat is Joe. “Welcome to Morning Joe,” he says, “it’s like Crossfire if it came from the cafe car on an Amtrak.” Day is there as Willie Geist. “The White House still hasn’t apologized for the outrageous remarks about Senator John McCain,” Joe says, while Mika gasps. They cut to an interview with Meghan McCain, played by Bryant, and talk over her before cutting the interview and heavily flirting. Next, Fey is the Russian lawyer who took the meeting with Don Jr about Hillary Clinton. It’s a little light. And then: Mean Girls the Musical: a documentary about Fey starring in her own show even though “she has a really tiny head”. She fails at rehearsals. “Ultimately I realized that Broadway is hard, and the people who do that are super talented,” she says, wearing her arm in a sling, “Maybe I can’t be like Lin-Manuel and jam myself into my show.” Cut to Lin-Manuel Miranda, who starts writing a rap “about this tiny-headed bitch named Tina”. Fey introduces Nicki Minaj. She sings Chun-Li under a neon pagoda with dancers clad in various east Asian motifs. Is it cultural appropriation if the song is about a character in Street Fighter? Weekend Update. Colin Jost and Michael Che are marking the first anniversary of the Mueller investigation – “the first anniversary that Trump remembered”. “What you think about the investigation really depends on what you think of Trump,” says Jost, pointing to a Yanni/Laurel meme. “Some people hear Laurel while some idiots hear Yanny.” “It’s not every day that a black man can root for the feds but I am really enjoying this,” says Che, “I feel like I’m watching Rachel Dolezal get kicked out of a Starbucks.” Eric and Donald Trump Jr are here (Moffat and Day) to talk about the infamous Russian lawyer meeting. “Many in the media are speculating that calls made to a blocked number before your meeting … were actually calls made to your father,” Jost comments. “This may sounds crazy,” says Don Jr, “but the dishonest media is being dishonest.” Comparing the situation to a scenario from their youth, Don says of their father: “He sat us down, he showed us the designs for Trump Tower and said …” “Look at all the hidden swastikas!” Eric interrupts. Don quiets him by giving him some Play-Do. Eric starts eating it. Che on the royal wedding: “Earlier today Suits actress Meghan Markle married some unemployed guy who still lives with his grandma.” Thompson arrives as Bishop Michael Curry, who gave the sermon at the wedding. “It’s good to be around black people again,” he says. “It felt kind of like somebody opened up a chicken and waffles kiosk in the middle of a Pottery Barn.” Since it’s the end of the year, they’ve decided to do some of the jokes that were previously deemed too offensive to tell on air. “Pennsylvania police arrested a one-armed woman who was trying to rob a bank … police said the hardest thing was figuring out how to handcuff her.” They are, admittedly, funny jokes. Pervert Hunters: Fey is the host. “This creep thinks he’s meeting a Romanian prostitute … let’s see what happens when he meets me instead,” she says. The creep is played by Bennett. They cut and reset, following instructions from the director, played by Day. But his direction is undermined by the creep’s bad acting and blocking. Fey is back as Sarah Palin! “Politics is a wild ride,” she says, “one minute you’re on top and the next you’re gone in the blink of a Scaramucci.” She begins to sing What I Did For Love from A Chorus Line, rewritten as What I Did For Trump. Sarah Sanders (Bryant) joins her. “All my friends are gone,” she says. “It’s like Saved By The Bell: The New Class and I’m Screech and I’m still there for some reason.” Kellyanne Conway (McKinnon) descends from the ceiling and sings her own verse. Armisen returns as Michael Wolff: “I’m going to be back because I’m writing a book about Jared and Ivanka,” he says, and then sings a verse about lying. Cecily Strong is carried in as Stormy Daniels: she sings a song about how she’ll be remembered and then plugs her Ted Talk. John Goodman arrives as Rex Tillerson: “I’m the only man ever to go into a situation scathed and come out unscathed!” he says. Leslie Jones sings as Omarosa while the company hums along before they join in for the big finish. Nicki Minaj returns for her second song, Poke It Out, with Playboi Carti. It’s a bop. Livingston high school talent show! Fey and Melissa Villasenor are a PTA mom and a goth teen performing “the very same routine we performed at her first-grade talent show!” It’s a rendition of Girls Just Wanna Have Fun. It feels pretty dated. Finally: a new Dick Wolf drama, Chicago Improv. Dialogue ripped from real-life improv classes … watch as people wearing plaid balance love and ambition in America’s third-ranked comedy market.” And that’s a season! Bryant attends the farewell dressed as America’s Worst White Lady, Jennifer Schulte. And now we can but look ahead at the months of ridiculousness that lie ahead and ask ourselves: is America funny if Saturday Night Live is on hiatus?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/20/the-great-escape-review-raunchy-rap-cracking-synthpop-and-rocknroll-fireworks","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T11:08:34Z","webTitle":"The Great Escape review – raunchy rap, cracking synthpop and rock'n'roll fireworks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/20/the-great-escape-review-raunchy-rap-cracking-synthpop-and-rocknroll-fireworks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/20/the-great-escape-review-raunchy-rap-cracking-synthpop-and-rocknroll-fireworks","fields":{"headline":"The Great Escape review – raunchy rap, cracking synthpop and rock'n'roll fireworks","bodyText":"If Brighton’s three-day festival of new music is any guide, and it’s usually a good one, the talent pool feeding into pop is currently on the tepid side. The sense in previous years that you could dive in at random and pluck out pearls is missing. The drift is towards homogeneity and uninspired solipsism. So many indistinguishable dreamy girls, moody boys and whimsical or overwrought guitar groups, all with half an eye on the BBC Sound poll. So many over-contemplated navels. The Great Escape’s other strength abides: what is good, and new, is likely to appear here. Among the most refreshing acts are those who, turning their focus outward, offer a kind of manic inclusivity. Had early Red Hot Chili Peppers been fuelled by empathy and adrenaline rather than machismo and testosterone, they might have been half as much fun as disorderly punkoid Bristol showband Idles. Queer Russian theatrical disco troupe Sado Opera are all saucy, big-hearted joy. A rambunctious set by London’s Giant Party calls to mind Lionel Richie on Marvin Gaye’s drugs. Future stars of a just universe are here, too. Led by human firework Amy Taylor, Melbourne’s magnificent garage crew Amyl and the Sniffers play the single most exhilarating rock’n’roll show I’ve seen in years. London duo Audiobooks may feel like a baffling wind-up – half art-school brat, half wizard – yet they’re a cracking (and very funny) synthpop act. Effervescent Bay Area rapper Saweetie is more talented than she is raunchy, and she is certainly raunchy. The piercing, dissociative songs Dana Margolin writes for Brighton’s own brilliant Porridge Radio reveal an ever more sophisticated capacity to unnerve. The festival’s closing showcase spot, usually sold out, has recently hosted British rap stars at the moment self-generated success jumps to national fame. Going by the lower turnout, Birmingham headliner Mist isn’t yet at the level Skepta and Stormzy were, and he doesn’t summon here the coiled energy they did. The standout turn is Fredo, the distinctive London grime MC, his steady delivery precisely doubled by his stage partner, giving it real heft, tension and drama."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/20/is-meghan-markle-the-american-the-royals-needed-all-along","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T15:33:34Z","webTitle":"Is Meghan Markle the American the royals needed all along? | Hadley Freeman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/20/is-meghan-markle-the-american-the-royals-needed-all-along","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/20/is-meghan-markle-the-american-the-royals-needed-all-along","fields":{"headline":"Is Meghan Markle the American the royals have needed all along?","bodyText":"In the 1991 John Goodman comedy King Ralph, truly the most important work of art to grapple with what it would mean if an American joined the British royal family, the movie comes to the conclusion that a friendly American is exactly what the royals need to make them bearable. Some Brits, of course, resist this idea: “It’s an unmitigated catastrophe – this song and dance man from the colonies!” wails John Hurt to Peter O’Toole. (It is possible neither Hurt nor O’Toole considered King Ralph to be their finest hour) In the run-up to Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle, a song and dance American, the focus was entirely on what her arrival meant. And no surprise, given she is – in order of importance, in regards to her alliance with the House of Windsor – a mixed race American divorcee actress. But this always was a marriage of two narratives. It’s just that hers was so extraordinary that his, amazingly, was briefly put in the shade. Anyone tempted to underestimate how astonishing it is that a mixed-race woman is marrying into the royal family was duly set right last December when Princess Michael decided that the perfect accessory to sport to a lunch welcoming Markle to the family was a blackamoor pin. We are barely a breath away from when outright racism was very much the norm among the royals, from the Queen Mother talking blithely about “blackamoors” to Prince Harry himself using terms such as “Paki” and “raghead”. And in that regard, there is no doubt the Windsors need Markle a lot more than she needs them. “I’ve come to Windsor because it’s a mixed-race wedding. I felt no affinity to the royal family before. Now I feel more of a connection to them and this country. And if she makes some of the other royals or whoever feel uncomfortable, well, that’s disappointing, but it’s also gratifying because I feel like, well, now it’s YOUR turn to feel uncomfortable,” Susan Botros, an Egyptian-Guyanese from London, told me at Windsor train station, a stray piece of confetti still in her hair. An article in the New York Times this week looked at how Markle’s American-ness will affect the House of Windsor (headline: “I’m American. I hug.”) Markle’s American friends spoke eagerly about how she will be “an agent of change” for the royals, perhaps because they were too young, or too far away, to recall how things worked out for the last woman who tried to change The Firm. The Brits, however, remember all too well. Piers Morgan, who seems to have managed to convince Americans he is an expert on the royals, predicted she would “chafe” at the various rules imposed on her. Morgan also popped up on Fox News, reminiscing about the time he met Markle for a drink in the pub. “There was a moment when she started looking at her phone,” he began, an opener to a namedropping anecdote which definitely comes at the “oh mate” end of the spectrum. “That was almost certainly Prince Harry,” he decided, retrospectively. Dickie Arbiter, the Queen’s former press secretary but still ever-ready with a quote for the media, went even further, foreseeing disaster in Markle’s fondness for expressing an occasional opinion: “That’s why Charles I had his head chopped off.” Welcome to Britain, Meghan! It is a British tradition for the media to celebrate an upcoming royal wedding by trashing the incoming in-laws, from Diana’s stepmother, Raine Spencer, to Kate Middleton’s Uncle Gary and his memorably named Ibizan villa, Maison de Bang Bang. And sure, we can talk all day about the blatant snobbery behind this trashing. But by any measure, the Markle family gave the press plenty to work with. The Markle debacles dominated the weeks leading up to the wedding, from her father being caught posing for pap photos to her half-siblings alternately trashing Markle and then complaining she hadn’t invited them to the wedding. Much shock was expressed in the British press about the Palace’s utter failure to control the Markles and the Markles’ lack of etiquette. But thinking British decorum and the Palace press office could hold back an American craving for celebrity and tmz.com is like sending gentlemen on horseback to do battle in drone warfare. And while one can feel rather sorry for Markle and her father that they didn’t get to walk down the aisle together, one can simultaneously note that he continued, even after his much-discussed humiliation, to feed updates on his health to TMZ.com. (Ultimately, all this nonsense was swept away by lovely Doria Ragland, Markle’s mother, the only member of her family who wasn’t exploiting her and therefore the only one to get an invite.) And so, by early Saturday morning, the talk for so long had been about Markle’s ethnicity, her nationality and her family that it was easy to forget that this was also about Harry. Which is pretty incredible, given that he was the last unfinished storyline of a saga that has become such a part of the national consciousness over the past four decades it feels less like history and more like a myth. When the wedding started I found a spot near Windsor Castle’s entrance, where I could watch the ceremony on a big screen. People who line the roads at weddings are, by definition, the most die-hard royalists, and all the usual figures were out in force: the men bellowing and ringing bells in the hope of convincing a passing American TV crew they are an actual town crier; the men in suits made of Union Jacks. Everyone I spoke to had waved flags at Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding, had camped out for Diana’s funeral and, in some cases, her ill-fated wedding. (No one mentioned going to Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson’s now all-but forgotten wedding, and yet the awkward truth is that Harry and Meghan’s marriage is no more significant than that one was, in terms of lineage.) Not being a royalist of any stripe, I’d not been to any of those. In fact, there was only one royal gathering I’d gone to in person: Kensington Palace, the day after Diana died. The death of Diana and its fallout is the story which the royal family has only just recovered from, barely, and it is the last royal story I cared about at all. I was 19 at the time and in my mind’s eye Harry will always be the little 12-year-old boy in the too-large suit walking in his mother’s funeral procession, stared at by a billion strangers, swathed in privilege but now stripped of affection and warmth. I’d always found the royals a cold proposition, Diana excepted, but the sight of that little boy, his head bent, not daring to look up at his mother’s coffin in front of him was, and remains, genuinely heartbreaking. What was going to happen to this cheeky boy, suddenly deprived of his fun-loving mother, and left with his cold father who barely touched him at her funeral? For a long time – a Nazi uniform here, a game of strip billiards there – it looked like the answer was: nothing good. It looked like he was losing all that had been good about his mother, and was morphing into all that is bad about the Windsors. But then, things changed. He found causes he cared about. He stopped resenting the responsibilities that came with the privilege he’d always enjoyed. He also started talking about mental health issues, a conversation his mother began 30 years ago. Not since Harry made that awful walk 21 years ago has he been watched by as many people at once as he was at his wedding, and it would take a stonier hearted republican than me not to have felt something at seeing how that sad and lost little boy is now such a happy man. Many could say that his mother’s spirit was represented by the presence of Elton John at his wedding, and that’s true. But a more fun representation of it to me was him appearing to mutter to Markle at the altar “I’m shitting it” and then giggling, in front of millions of people. I saw some snarking online about Bishop Michael Curry’s passionate sermon, and certainly the royal family seemed unnerved by it, with Zara Philips watching it in apparent open-mouthed shock and Kate and Camilla shooting each other some heavy side-eye. But as I watched the bishop refer to love, emphatically and repeatedly, not hurriedly rushing over the word as is more traditional in royal and, to be honest, English weddings, I thought, well, maybe this is what Harry needs after all, this kind of corrective. Enough English coldness, bring on American demonstrativeness – it was what his mother had strived for, after all. The day before the wedding, when it was announced that Prince Charles would walk Markle down the aisle, instead of her mother or one of her friends, it looked like The Firm had asserted itself against any potential for change Markle might bring. But the inclusivity and diversity of the ceremony refuted that, and it could only have been Harry who ensured that would be the case. Against all odds, Diana’s boys have grown up OK, and as embarrassing as the monarchy is as an institution, they themselves are not embarrassments. Harry in particular may well be genuinely good for this country, thanks to Markle. It turns out King Ralph was right: what the royals needed all along was an American."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/20/spain-podemos-leader-pablo-iglesias-no-confidence-vote-anti-austerity-principles-house-purchase","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T10:36:41Z","webTitle":"Spain's Podemos leader to face party vote over luxury house purchase","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/20/spain-podemos-leader-pablo-iglesias-no-confidence-vote-anti-austerity-principles-house-purchase","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/20/spain-podemos-leader-pablo-iglesias-no-confidence-vote-anti-austerity-principles-house-purchase","fields":{"headline":"Spain's Podemos leader to face party vote over luxury house purchase","bodyText":"The leader of Spain’s anti-austerity Podemos party and its parliamentary spokeswoman are submitting themselves to a confidence vote in the hope of putting an end to criticism of their decision to buy a €600,000 (£525,000) house in the mountains outside Madrid. Pablo Iglesias and Irene Montero, who are expecting twins, have been accused of betraying the party’s principles and joining the petty bourgeoisie by purchasing the property. Among those who have criticised the move is José María González, the Podemos mayor of Cádiz. “Podemos’s ethics code isn’t a formality,” he said. “It’s a commitment to living like working people so that you can represent them.” On Saturday night, Iglesias and Montero announced a vote in which party members will decide whether they should carry on in their posts. “I didn’t think this would generate a debate or turn into such big news,” Iglesias told a press conference. But I think that when a political leader’s credibility is called into question, you need to face up to it and not hide away. “It should be party members who decide whether we should carry on as general secretary and parliamentary spokeswoman and whether we should carry on as MPs. And we’ve decided to ask them.” Montero said she and Iglesias had lost their right to privacy over recent days, adding that she would not wish their current situation on anyone. But, she said: “We knew this is what we’d be up against when we went into politics.” Podemos members will be asked the question: “Do you think that Pablo Iglesias and Irene Montero should continue as Podemos’s general secretary and parliamentary spokeswoman?” Podemos, which was born from the indignados movement and fury over corruption and austerity, has redrawn Spain’s political map. Along with the centre-right Ciudadanos (Citizens) party, it has ended decades of dominance by the conservative People’s party and the Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE). However, while Ciudadanos has surged over recent months, attracting increasing support over its hardline stance on the Catalan independence crisis, Podemos has fared less well. Predictions that it would overtake the PSOE and become the dominant party of the Spanish left at the last general election in June 2016 did not come to pass and Podemos – a broad ideological church – has suffered splits and disagreements. In February last year, Iglesias tightened his grip on the party after seeing off a challenge from his more moderate deputy, Íñigo Errejón. Iglesias had vowed to step down as leader if his agenda and list of candidates for Podemos’s leadership did not win majority approval."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/21/yes-evs-are-green-and-global-warming-is-raising-sea-levels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T10:00:22Z","webTitle":"Yes, EVs are green and global warming is raising sea levels | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/21/yes-evs-are-green-and-global-warming-is-raising-sea-levels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/21/yes-evs-are-green-and-global-warming-is-raising-sea-levels","fields":{"headline":"Yes, EVs are green and global warming is raising sea levels","bodyText":"Last week, the House Science, Space and Technology Committee held yet another climate science hearing similar to those from April 2017, February 2017, January 2016, May 2015, June 2014, December 2013, and so on. It seems as though disputing established climate science is House Republicans’ favorite hobby. This time, it was Philip Duffy’s turn to spend two hours playing whack-a-mole with the committee Republicans’ endless supply of long-debunked climate myths. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) claimed that sea level rise is due to the White Cliffs of Dover tumbling into the ocean (yes, really), and his colleagues argued that scientists in the 1970s were predicting global cooling, that Earth is just returning to its “normal temperature,” that Antarctic ice is growing, and sea levels are hardly rising. Self-contradictory sea level rise denial Those last two claims originated from a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) editorial entered into the Congressional record by Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX), written by Fred Singer. As the group Ozone Action documented, Singer has been a lifetime contrarian on virtually every scientific subject imaginable - acid rain, nuclear winter, nuclear waste, nuclear war, ozone depletion, secondhand smoke, amphibian population loss, and even minimum wage benefits. In recent decades he’s worked for a plethora of fossil fuel-funded think tanks, denying established climate science. Singer’s WSJ editorial is difficult to follow, largely because it contradicts itself several times, saying: there is also good data showing sea levels are in fact rising at an accelerating rate ... to keep the rate of rise constant, as observed... Obviously if sea level rise is accelerating, it’s not increasing at a constant rate. The WSJ later “corrected” that first sentence, thus removing one of the few accurate statements in the editorial - sea level rise is indeed accelerating. Singer’s explanation for why the accelerating sea level rise isn’t accelerating likewise contradicts itself: the temperature of sea water has no direct effect on sea-level rise … accumulation of ice on the Antarctic continent has been offsetting the steric effect [sea level rise due to warming temperatures] for at least several centuries. Here, Singer first claims that the basic physics of thermal expansion is wrong, or at least somehow doesn’t apply to ocean water, but then argues it is real and is merely being offset by ice growth on Antarctica. The latter claim is of course also wrong – Antarctica has been losing land ice and a recent study found that it’s responsible for 8% of sea level rise since 1993 (thermal expansion is the biggest contributor, at 42%). As one sea level researcher at Climate Feedback described Singer’s editorial, “If this were an essay in one of my undergraduate classes, he would fail.” The whole thing is complete nonsense, denying basic physics, and yet was published in the WSJ and entered into the congressional record. This is the material that House Republicans and their conservative media allies who reject climate science and oppose all climate policies find most compelling. That says a lot about the state of climate denial on the American right today. Clean Electric Vehicles Denial Around the same time, Politico ran a story written by Jonathan Lesser, who’s an energy industry consultant with the Koch-, Mercer-, tobacco industry-, and Exxon-funded Manhattan Institute (which Politico failed to mention). It claims, based on a Manhattan Institute report written by Lesser, that “more electric cars and trucks will mean more pollution.” This conclusion rests upon a number of shaky assumptions. First, it considers not today’s power grid mix, but rather the US Energy Information Administration (EIA)’s projections out to the year 2050. The EIA is notorious for underestimating the growth of clean energy, and projects that coal will continue to supply 22% of US electricity 32 years hence. To put this in perspective, the share of US electricity supplied by coal fell from 51% in 2008 to 31% in 2016. According to an analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists, nearly half of the remaining coal plants will likely retire or convert to natural gas in the near future. In short, the EIA is unrealistically bullish on fossil fuels. Electricity generated by burning coal produces significant air pollution, and so using these assumptions, Lesser concludes that American electric cars will generate more air pollutants that are harmful to human health than gasoline-powered cars. But if the electricity generated to charge electric vehicles is cleaner than in his assumptions – a near-certainty – the conclusions won’t hold. Lesser also admits that even with these conservative assumptions, carbon pollution emissions from electric cars would be at least 70% lower in 2050 than those from gasoline-powered cars. He dismisses this result by claiming “the [carbon pollution] reductions will have no impact on climate” (because it’s a small change relative to the carbon pollution from all American power generation), but this argument could apply to any individual effort to cut carbon pollution (it’s called a ‘Tragedy of the Commons’). In fact, transportation currently accounts for close to 30% of US carbon pollution, so switching to electric cars is a critically important step to tackle America’s large contribution to climate change. The cleanliness of an electric car depends on the source of its electricity, and that varies greatly by region. The Union of Concerned Scientists created an interactive tool to check this based on US zip code. Currently, half of American electric cars are sold in California, where in many areas they achieve an equivalent of 130 miles per gallon. And about one-third of households buying electric cars today also have solar panels to charge them, producing zero-pollution fuel. In short, yes, electric cars are green and global warming is causing sea level rise. It’s not a coincidence that arguments to the contrary are made by individuals whose paychecks and campaign donations are supplied by the fossil fuel industry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/may/20/afl-round-nine-west-coast-eagles-v-richmond-tigers-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T09:22:07Z","webTitle":"AFL: Eagles soar to the top of the ladder after big win over Tigers – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/may/20/afl-round-nine-west-coast-eagles-v-richmond-tigers-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/may/20/afl-round-nine-west-coast-eagles-v-richmond-tigers-live","fields":{"headline":"AFL: Eagles soar to the top of the ladder after big win over Tigers – as it happened","bodyText":"Wow. That was some statement from the Eagles. It’s their eighth-straight victory, and they’re now a game clear on the top of the table, relegating the reigning premiers to second and taking a chunk out of their percentage. Jack Darling had a career-high six goals and 21 disposals, but for me it was Elliot Yeo who stole the show with 29 disposals including 15 contested possessions, 10 clearances and seven inside 50s. He looked like he was out of the game in the first quarter, and came back in electrifying fashion. After the game he admits he might have something to worry about after scans during the week: unbelievable to think he performed like that after some kind of injury. Thanks for joining me for this Sunday liveblog, and I look forward to seeing you back here next weekend. Q4 00:16 West Coast 20.10 (130) v Richmond 12.11 (83) Jack Darling has a shot at his 300th goal and seventh for the day – and can’t convert. He’s as disappointed as the crowd, but it has been all West Coast in the second half. Q4 02:16 West Coast 20.9 (129) v Richmond 12.11 (83) Another consolation for the Tigers – this time bringing up Riewoldt’s fifth goal. He’s been good in a side that has been pretty comprehensively beaten today. A brief shot of the live ladder shows us that the Eagles will finish the round above the Tigers, with their now-superior percentage. Before you know it, the Eagles have hit back through Mark LeCras, who has also had a good day with three goals. Nic Nat giving his midfielders some incredible service. Q4 03:07 West Coast 19.9 (123) v Richmond 11.11 (77) Simply can’t understand why the players keep attempting 45m snaps instead of drop punts. It hasn’t worked all day, and Jack Riewoldt adds his name to a long line who have attempted it and failed today. The Eagles machine have slowed down for a moment, until Grimes gives away the free-kick on Waterman on a sharp angle inside 50. That looked like frustration more than anything, and a small melee ensues. He can’t convert, but it’s a big Eagles lead: 52 points now. Houli drags that back to 46 with a consolation goal with a few minutes remaining. Q4 10:46 West Coast 19.7 (121) v Richmond 10.9 (69) Darling AGAIN! Nic Nat comes back on off the bench and is unstoppable in the ruck – finding Hutchings with the perfect tap. Darling takes a brilliant contested grab and then hits his sixth – a career-best for him. Q4 11:40 West Coast 18.7 (115) v Richmond 10.9 (69) It’s getting ugly for Richmond, and Cripps lets them off the hook by failing to make the distance from outside 50m. It’s rushed over for a behind. Jack Riewoldt eases the pain for Tiger supporters with a major – and that’s his own fourth. He pushed up the wing just before that and hasn’t stopped trying all day. Q4 14:06 West Coast 18.6 (114) v Richmond 9.8 (62) Darling has another chance at a goal – this would be his fifth – and it’s straight through the middle. What a game from the Eagles, and Darling too – he’s on 27 goals for the season and is second in the Coleman behind Ben Brown. Huge game from him and a big statement from West Coast as the rest of the competition watches on. Q4 16:03 West Coast 17.6 (108) v Richmond 9.8 (62) Elliot Yeo again with the successful tackle on Dustin Martin – maybe some other clubs should ask what he’s doing differently? In turn the Richmond defence give away a free for in the back to Conca. Redden then follows up with another goal – they look unstoppable the Eagles. Chant goes up around Optus Stadium. Q4 17:45 West Coast 16.6 (102) v Richmond 9.8 (62) This time it’s Cripps on the lead – the Tigers just have no answers for the Eagles’ fluency of ball movement at the moment which isn’t giving their defenders much of a chance. Beautiful kick puts the Eagles back out to a 40-point lead. Enjoying the replay of Nic Nat’s tackle on Nankervis – not sure how that’s any different to the one that got him suspended. Maybe the size of the opponent? How silly... Q4 19:16 West Coast 15.6 (96) v Richmond 9.8 (62) Guess who? Yeo with another clearance, this time to Jack Darling on the lead. Not sure what happened to him when he went off with injury but he has simply dominated since. Darling kicks it straight through the middle, and things just got a little harder for the Tigers. Well, just as it looked like this would be a blowout win to the Eagles, Riewoldt got one back against the grain (and all the momentum), before Willie Rioli collided into Jayden Short (after he’d marked the ball) and gave away 50m. Not sure what he was doing, really. That was costly, as it gave the Tigers a sniff going into the last quarter. Rance rushed a behind with a second to go, and Richmond will go into the last just close enough to give the Eagles a scare. Q3 01:22 West Coast 14.5 (89) v Richmond 9.8 (62) Against all the momentum, and odds, Jack Riewoldt finds one back for the Tigers. The Eagles’ defenders completely mistimed the spoil and Riewoldt was able to sit back and capitalise with a running goal. He does his best to get his team fired up and back into the contest. Meanwhile, Willie Rioli commits a poor error and gifts Short a 50m penalty from the centre of the ground – and he hits the wobbly-looking goal to bring the Tigers back within (perhaps) striking distance. Q3 03:28 West Coast 14.5 (89) v Richmond 7.8 (50) After looking like he was lost to the game – and potentially for a lot longer – Yeo is now dominating this game. He does the unthinkable – catches Dustin Martin – and wins the holding the ball, before he also wins a 50m penalty as Dusty creeps too close to the mark. He makes him pay the ultimate price with a goal – and it’s now looking almost impossible for the Tigers to get back from here. Just in case you didn’t catch the news earlier, Melbourne delivered Carlton an almighty thumping – the Blues slumping to a 109 point loss and the biggest of Brendan Bolton’s coaching career. The Dees now move into the top four as a result of that massive percentage booster. Bolton says the team won’t sweep the loss under the carpet, and he’ll ensure the team address the loss as an unacceptable step backwards. “Really disappointed with the second half, particularly,” he said. “We won’t sweep it under the carpet. I’ve asked our players to confront this game and reflect on it really strongly. I don’t want them to let go of it until we’ve got through the review. “Coaches will do the same. We want to learn from it. We want to grow from it and we want to challenge it.” “There’s a reality with a young midfield and some injuries. We’ve walked under a ladder in terms of injuries this year but we’re not going to let a young group use that as an out,” he said. “Then you’ve got an easy getaway. We want to lose and grow. “If [the attitude] is ‘we’ll be right when we get others back’ it gives youngsters an out. There’s a reality there but we’re not going to accept that because it’s not high-performance thinking.” Q3 04:52 West Coast 13.5 (83) v Richmond 7.8 (50) Dusty Martin decides to take matters into his own hands, and motors out of the middle but overcooks the pass inside 50. The Eagles rebound with exceptional speed, and Mark LeCras takes the mark 10m out from goal, in front of his own teammate in Darling. It’s another goal – and a 33-point lead. What have the Tigers got from here? Q3 06:00 West Coast 12.5 (77) v Richmond 7.8 (50) Oh boy – McGovern is dominating the Eagles and this time pushes up to the wing and takes a really good contested mark in front of Trent Cotchin, who responds with frustration and punches the ball from his hands. He gives away the 50m, and McGovern will line up from 45m out on a 45 degree angle. It drifts from left to right, and lands right through the middle. That’s some costly ill-discipline from the skipper. Q3 07:55 West Coast 11.5 (71) v Richmond 7.8 (50) Oh no, Darling lets the Tigers off the hook big time with a poor miss – that’s probably his first real blemish for the day. Still, the Eagles are looking really dangerous with some excellent pressure, particularly in their forward half. The Tigers try to run the ball quickly back down the ground, but McGovern is too good for his opponent: Richmond’s attack is breaking down at half-forward. Q3 10:45 West Coast 11.4 (70) v Richmond 7.8 (50) Ouch, Yeo misses the chance to extend the Eagles’ lead, but he’s been on fire to start this third quarter. Just has all the space he wants at the moment. Nic Nat is also exerting his dominance up and down the field – and this time sets up Rioli on the wing, who in turn finds Mark LeCras in the 50. That’s an important goal and sets up a 20-point lead. Q3 12:46 West Coast 10.3 (63) v Richmond 7.8 (50) Guess who? Kennedy. Really fast movement from the Eagles after the turnover inside Richmond’s 50. He can’t convert, however, and lets the Tigers off the hook. Down the other end, Reece Conca has a chance from 50m out to stem some of the bleeding – and it just sneaks in for a goal. Tigers back in it. Q3 14:37 West Coast 10.2 (62) v Richmond 6.8 (44) Score review is called but it’s a clear goal to West Coast – this time via Josh Kennedy. It wasn’t close to being touched, but there’s a fair bit going on behind the ball with Martin and Yeo. Yeo can’t understand how he didn’t get a holding the ball decision, with the ball seeming to come off Dusty’s knee. Reckon that’s one of the worst things for fans – that players aren’t being penalised for incorrect disposal or dropping the ball. Meanwhile Kennedy gets his third after a contested, sandwiched mark deep inside 50. Great squaring ball from Waterman. Last three goals to West Coast and all the momentum with the home side. Q3 18:43 West Coast 8.2 (50) v Richmond 6.8 (44) That was quick: the Eagles with the immediate clearance which finds Kennedy 45m out – and he goes for a Stevie J snap – just like Castagna! This one is off the outside of the boot and out of bounds on the full. What’s with players taking them from much further out this game? Lucky for the Eagles, Nic Nat bangs it back inside 50 and Jack Darling takes a strong contested grab. He’s in scary form, and drills the goal. Big upset from the Gabba, with the Lions finally breaking through for their first win for the season against the Hawks. It was a big win too: 56-points. Eric Hipwood kicked four goals for the home side, while Dayne Beams had 28 disposals and two goals. Zorko also roared back into form with 30 touches. For the Hawks: Gunston kicked four goals while Mitchell had another mammoth bag of possessions: 46 this time. Brisbane now leap over Carlton who have been relegated to last. Here’s a sorry sight for Hawks fans: Castagna involved again – this time he’s on the end of a Dusty chip pass and receives a free-kick much to the distaste of the parochial home crowd. He holds onto it a bit too long and allows the Eagles an intercept grab. Eagles force it forward with a great contested mark to Darling on the wing, but they get stuck at the 50m line, and the Tigers’ defence successfully clears. Tigers will be happy with a dominant second term that really should have them in front. 23 inside 50s to four that quarter! Q2 01:33 West Coast 7.2 (44) v Richmond 6.8 (44) Castagna this time with the goal – again Riewoldt is involved! He looked gone for all money with an inevitable holding the ball, but managed to get a toe to it at the last minute and Castagna was able to snap the goal with all sorts of pressure from the Eagles’ defence. All tied up! Q2 02:00 West Coast 7.2 (44) v Richmond 5.8 (38) 73% time in forward half for Richmond this term, but they just can’t make any meaningful ground on the Eagles. There’s a couple of minutes left to rectify that, but Jack Riewoldt spills his own attempted mark. He’s flown for everything this quarter with little reward, but this time soccers a brilliant goal off the pack after a ruck contest. Finally, reward for effort. Q2 03:34 West Coast 7.2 (44) v Richmond 4.8 (32) Finally the Tigers find some much-needed space inside 50, but Dusty drops a sitter with no pressure to speak of. There’s plenty of Tigers in space to pick up the ball and snap on goal, but the shot goes wide. They’ve botched that one, but have had plenty of chances, the Tigers. This time Castagna takes a contested grab and can finally put six points on the board for Richmond. He goes the round the body snap from 45m out and doesn’t make the distance – it’s rushed through for another behind. No idea why you would do that... Q2 06:44 West Coast 7.2 (44) v Richmond 4.5 (29) Edwards continues a wonderful quarter with another inside 50 entry for the Tigers, but the Eagles’ defence manages to repel another entry. It’s not long, however, before the ball is locked back in the 50 – they’ve had 13 inside 50s to three this quarter, the Tigers, but just can’t seem to find any efficiency with their entries. That trend continues with Waterman taking a contested mark deep inside the 50. Q2 10:30 West Coast 7.2 (44) v Richmond 4.5 (29) Nankervis really making his presence felt at the moment, while Dusty is also getting more of the ball with Yeo off the ground. Speak of the devil – Yeo has made a miraculous recovery and is back on the ground. He has a hand in several forays forward before Jack Darling ends up with the ball on an extremely tight angle, almost 50m out from goal. He goes with a checkside banana....... and it doesn’t come off, but lands in the arms of Jack Redden. That’s a fan killer. It’s another goal to the Eagles. Q2 13:50 West Coast 6.2 (38) v Richmond 4.4 (28) Tigers looking a little more lively this term, and are creating more opportunities on goal but with less reward than they’d like so far. This time, however, Jack Riewoldt’s flying leap over two Eagles rewards another chance: and from 45m out he bends it back, right to left, for another major. Q2 16:34 West Coast 6.2 (38) v Richmond 3.4 (22) Yeo still on the bench – with a towel over his knees and some water. Will bring you an update once we get one. This time a free-kick in the 50 gifts Chris Masten a shot on goal. Didn’t look like there was much in it, and with some justice, he misses. Q2 17:59 West Coast 6.1 (37) v Richmond 3.4 (22) That’s what the Tigers needed - a quick major through Shane Edwards, who creates the goal with some brilliant forward running and evasion skills. He’s then back in the centre square with the clearance, and forward 50 entry, which finds Grigg 45m out. Little to no angle, but his shot is off to the left for a behind. Here go the Eagles with some of their own run through the middle – but the ball is held up in the middle by Jake Waterman, and the bomb long into the 50 is intercepted by Rance. The siren sounds with Caddy about 100m out – who nonetheless attempts a (failed) torp. Q1 01:47 West Coast 6.1 (37) v Richmond 2.3 (15) Uh oh, Elliot Yeo is limping from the ground for the Eagles – that could turn the tide. He looks very unhappy as he walks the boundary line, despondent. Simultaneously, the Tigers have another shot on goal through Grigg - this one 35m out. It’s just wide - that’s a let off for the Eagles. Q1 03:30 West Coast 6.1 (37) v Richmond 2.2 (14) Darling again with the lead-up goal for the Eagles – he’s looking ominous now with two goals int he first quarter. Kennedy has one and the two big men are working very well in tandem, while Darling is also pushing up the ground to help Nic Nat in the ruck. Q1 05:51 West Coast 5.1 (31) v Richmond 2.2 (14) Cotchin has the mark just outside 50, and passes off to Jayden Short, who goals on the run. They need that badly, the Tiges. Here’s that nice hanger by Gaff earlier: Q1 06:29 West Coast 5.1 (31) v Richmond 1.2 (8) This time Dusty gets a snap on goal – but it’s also inaccurate. The Eagles are consistently scoring from turnovers at the moment – four of their five scores have come from turnovers so far. Waterman with the long kick inside 50, and Darling takes a nice grab coming in from the side of the pack. The Richmond defenders were caught minding Kennedy – and the unchecked Darling nails the goal. Q1 08:54 West Coast 4.1 (25) v Richmond 1.1 (7) Mark Hutchings is keeping a close eye on Dustin Martin, who has been unusually quiet thus far. However this time he gets off the leash – and finds Jack Riewoldt on the lead. Riewoldt is booed on approach and then misses to the left to a chorus of cheers. Q1 10:20 West Coast 4.1 (25) v Richmond 1.0 (6) Gaff has drifted forward into the 50, and takes a mark uncontested at 45m out. He can’t make the distance, but the ball comes back in via Hurn. Rioli has a snap for his second but it’s smothered – and the clearing kick by the Tigers is taken by Gaff again! That was some hanger. He’ll get another chance from the same angle - perhaps slightly closer in. No such problems this time – and the crowd are up and about. Q1 12:21 West Coast 3.1 (19) v Richmond 1.0 (6) Darling with the brilliant tap over to Kennedy, who boots the goal. He’s in some form Darling, and that was a very clever touch over the hands of a couple of Tigers defenders. Suddenly it’s the Eagles who look to be charging ahead. Q1 13:36 West Coast 2.1 (13) v Richmond 1.0 (6) Have to agree with this tweet, there’s quite a striking difference between the areas of the ground bathed in sunlight and those in shade. Meanwhile, Rioli with some excellent roving work to snap the goal after Kennedy failed to glove the contested mark. He looks a find. Q1 16:17 West Coast 1.1 (7) v Richmond 1.0 (6) Tigers running in numbers, Cotchin to Caddy to Butler, but Nic Nat with some excellent pressure from behind halts the charge forward. Tigers look hot, the running handball game is on. Eagles win the turnover via Hurn, and Le Cras finds Cripps 45m out. It’s a very nicely struck goal. Q1 17:54 West Coast 0.1 (1) v Richmond 1.0 (6) Gaff with the intercept on the wing, who finds the in-form Darling on the 50m line, who in turn hits up Kennedy. He’s on a tight-ish angle, but if anyone can kick it it’s him. 35m out, he misses to the right. Q1 19:00 West Coast 0.0 (0) v Richmond 1.0 (6) As per usual I’m eating my words as the Tigers go bang, bang. Caddy takes a very nice contested mark (or free kick against Elliot Yeo, however you want to interpret it), after the quick clearance from Cotchin. Tigers looking to silence the crowd early. Welcome Hello there and welcome to this top of the table clash between the West Coast Eagles and the Richmond Tigers at Optus Stadium in Perth. I’ll admit I’m one of those (idiots) who wrote off the Eagles at the start of the season, not even bothering to mention them amongst my main contenders for the Premiership in 2018. I remember one WA reader commenting below the line and saying that the West Aussie teams were used to being written off, and that was just the way they liked it. Well, I’ve learned my lesson and have jumped back on the bandwagon today: I reckon they have every chance of knocking off the ladder-leaders at home. Jack Higgins is the late out for the Tigers with Shaun Grigg his replacement. The Eagles will go in unchanged. p.s. good news AFL fans – comments on the blog are OPEN! You can thank me later. Kate will be here shortly. In the meantime, have a read of Sam Lane’s piece on the problem with no women remaining as AFLW coaches."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/28/halogen-light-bulbs-could-disappear-from-australian-stores-within-two-years","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T18:00:36Z","webTitle":"Halogen light bulbs could disappear from Australian stores within two years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/28/halogen-light-bulbs-could-disappear-from-australian-stores-within-two-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/28/halogen-light-bulbs-could-disappear-from-australian-stores-within-two-years","fields":{"headline":"Halogen light bulbs could disappear from Australian stores within two years","bodyText":"Halogen lights will disappear from Australia within two years, as the industry and federal government pivot towards more efficient and environmentally-friendly LED lighting. A ban on halogen bulbs, which use four times the energy of LED globes, was announced last month at a meeting of state and federal environment ministers. The ban is to come into effect from September 2020 but the bulbs could start disappearing from retail stores in as little as 12 months, according to the industry’s peak body, Lighting Council Australia. The council’s chief executive, Richard Mulcahy, said manufacturers would act early to phase out the bulbs. “Many consumers already prefer LED products and sales volumes of halogen lamps continue to decrease,” he said. “Good quality LED lamps last five to 15 times longer than halogen lamps and at most will consume one-quarter of the energy to produce the same light output.” • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Most domestic halogen lamps could be directly replaced by LED ones, he said. The government estimates the switch will save Australian consumers $1.48bn over 10 years. While exact details of the ban and the phase-out period were yet to be confirmed, Mulcahy said he expected very few exemptions. “Halogen lamps are manufactured overseas and imported into Australia,” he said. “We expect the halogen phase-out will set a date when halogen lamps can no longer be imported into Australia, while specifying a grandfathering period to deal with stock already in the country. “We expect there may be exemptions – for example for oven lights, which are required to operate in high temperature environments. [But] unless the particular product is subject to an exemption, we expect that halogen lamps will not be available on the retail market.” The federal environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, did not respond to a request for comment. A 2016 survey from the department of industry found 32% of households were using halogen lights (mains voltage and low voltage) and 15% LEDs. A further 13% used incandescents, 31% compact fluorescent lamps and 9% linear fluorescents. Overall, 55% of homes were using high-efficiency lighting such as LEDs and fluorescents, while 45% used low-efficiency bulbs such as halogen and incandescents, the report found. In 2010, only 2% of homes used LED and 35% used halogen. The ban on halogen lighting is based on an EU policy that will also come into effect in September 2020. The Australian government will also enforce new minimum standards for LED lights – mirroring the EU policy. Most incandescent lights, which waste 90% of their energy produced as heat, were phased out between 2009 and 2012."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/20/china-and-us-reach-consensus-on-reducing-trade-gap","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T01:33:36Z","webTitle":"China and US reach 'consensus' on reducing trade gap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/20/china-and-us-reach-consensus-on-reducing-trade-gap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/20/china-and-us-reach-consensus-on-reducing-trade-gap","fields":{"headline":"China and US reach 'consensus' on reducing trade gap","bodyText":"The United States and China have reached consensus on measures to “substantially” reduce the US trade deficit with Beijing, but there was no mention of the $200bn target previously touted by the White House. The joint US-China statement on Saturday followed talks in Washington led by US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and China’s state council vice-premier, Liu He, who also met the US president, Donald Trump, on Thursday. “There was a consensus on taking effective measures to substantially reduce the United States trade deficit in goods with China,” the statement said. “To meet the growing consumption needs of the Chinese people and the need for high-quality economic development, China will significantly increase purchases of United States goods and services.” Beijing and Washington agreed they would keep on talking about measures under which China would import more commodities from the US to close a $335bn annual trade gap between the two countries that has threatened to ignite a global trade war. A report by China’s state-run Xinhua news agency described the statement from the two governments as “vowing not to launch a trade war against each other”. A commentary published by Xinhua on Sunday called the statement a “good example of win-win”, noting that it would help America reduce its trade deficit by increasing exports to China and allow China to diversify and raise the quality of its imports. It also argued that China has always resisted any “unreasonable demands” by the US, never compromising or accepting restrictive conditions. Last year, the US had a $375.2bn trade deficit with China, a source of frequent and bitter complaints by Trump. The US reportedly had demanded that the deficit be narrowed by at least $200bn by 2020. The statement said China will “advance relevant amendments to its laws and regulations” to allow for more American imports, including changes to patent laws. It also said both sides had agreed on “meaningful increases” in US agriculture and energy exports. Trump has threatened China with tariffs on up to $150bn of imports, prompting China to threaten US agricultural exports. The White House is wary of hurting largely Republican-voting farm states or damaging the economy before legislative elections this November. But Trump is also keen to appear tough on trade. On Thursday he unleashed a barrage of criticism against former US administrations for allowing Beijing to take advantage of the US. “We have been ripped off by China. And an evacuation of wealth like no country has ever seen before given to another country that’s rebuilt itself based on a lot of the money that they’ve taken out of the United States,” he said. “China has become very spoiled.” The trade talks are complicated by the impending summit meeting in Singapore between Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, who has consulted with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, ahead of the meeting. China is North Korea’s biggest trade partner, and Trump has called on it repeatedly to press Pyongyang to rein in its nuclear and missile programs. The statement made no mention of Chinese telecom giant ZTE, which had suspended operations after US sanctions were imposed to punish it for exporting sensitive materials to Iran and North Korea. Last week, Trump tweeted he and Xi were “working together” to find a way to help ZTE “get back into business, fast”. • Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/19/worthy-bbc-misses-all-the-royal-wedding-glee-windsor","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T21:00:37Z","webTitle":"Kirsty Young lifts a worthy BBC in battle of the wedding broadcasters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/worthy-bbc-misses-all-the-royal-wedding-glee-windsor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/worthy-bbc-misses-all-the-royal-wedding-glee-windsor","fields":{"headline":"Kirsty Young lifts a worthy BBC in battle of the wedding broadcasters","bodyText":"So who won the broadcasting contest? The BBC’s Huw Edwards was sonorous, and not playful enough – but Kirsty Young wholly rescued the morning, commending George Clooney at one stage for walking slowly, having recognised wife Amal was in high heels; you could hear the gratefulness in Kirsty’s tones. The BBC, bizarrely, intercut its privileged coverage with interminable interviews – good causes, the stigma of Aids, the raising of black profiles – but all roughly 10 yawning minutes too long. ITV’s Phillip Schofield and Julie Etchingham rightly kept it light. Good interplay between them, too. After Schofield, watching the gum-chewing Joss Stone, clutched rather desperately at “interestingly, as Harry’s just been confirmed as the second Duke of Sussex, the first duke, who died in 1843, was said to have a very good singing voice”, Etchingham sallied drily: “We’ve got to keep this going until three o’clock. I hope you’ve got some other ‘interesting’ facts on the dukes of Sussex.” Happily, when the Most Rev Michael Curry transfixed us all, this was one of the kind of off-limits sections, televisually speaking: we didn’t want or need jabbering voiceover interpretation. That came soon enough, however, Edwards outdoing even his usual Eeyoreness by damning the sermon as “forceful … uplifting” yet somehow making both words sound as spritzy as a manual for a thermostat. I had come all curmudgeon-ready, determined to not enjoy the coverage, especially as the day before Naga Munchetty, on BBC Breakfast, had reacted grouchily after the wedding hype was given a lukewarm welcome from the vox-popped people of Manchester. “Well,” she sulked, “I suppose everyone’s entitled to their own opinion.” Gracious of you, Naga. And I thought you were one of the good ones. But cynicism fled around the time of Curry’s address, if not long before. A perfect day, an undoubtedly beautiful bride, understated makeup and (I’m told) fabulously suitable dress … and Windsor’s glories, and Elgar’s Chanson de Matin playing as the brothers were revealed, in their Blues and Royals frock-coats. I even (almost) managed to forget Windsor council’s forcible repatriation of rough sleepers – only to have hundreds of royalists sleeping on the streets. The music, and the poetry of the speeches, got me, as I should have known they would: the long-shot from the nave into the quire, through Philippa Craddock flowers, as the choir sang John Rutter’s searingly lovely The Lord Bless You And Keep You; Sheku Kanneh-Mason’s cello; and, in general, the preponderance of gleeful black faces, in the crowds and in the church. Oprah didn’t look that gleeful however, having perhaps turned up a little early. She looked lost, fiddling between pews with her bag and invite, like one of those US “dollar princesses” who married aristocracy in the 1890s and were thence shunned by both society and their servants as déclassé. She was rescued by, of all people, Charles Spencer. And who’da thunk that? Back among the presenters, Sky’s Kay Burley had a whale of a time, forcefully lifting a gorgeous little child over a barrier to show the camera her wedding dress. This was not a day to be worthy. This was a day to be with people, in the sun, and to enjoy the music."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/18/five-quirky-postwar-pubs-recommended-uk-heritage-listings","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T23:01:43Z","webTitle":"Five quirky postwar pubs recommended for heritage listings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/18/five-quirky-postwar-pubs-recommended-uk-heritage-listings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/18/five-quirky-postwar-pubs-recommended-uk-heritage-listings","fields":{"headline":"Five quirky postwar pubs recommended for heritage listings","bodyText":"A 1960s Roman-themed pub with a statue of Julius Caesar and its original patterned Formica intact is among a batch of new heritage listings that celebrate the quirkiness of Britain’s postwar pubs. Historic England announced on Friday that it had recommended listing five unusual pubs, including one designed around a nursery rhyme in Swindon, and another on a 1970s Bovis housing estate in Surrey that aimed to provide as many private drinking corners as possible. The listings have emerged from research carried out into postwar pub design by the heritage organisation. Deborah Mays, its head of listing advice, said post-war pubs had evolved dramatically from those of the 19th century, which had ornate interiors, match strikers, off-sales space and frosted glass for privacy. Many postwar pubs were intended to be an integral part of the new housing estates being built, and had family rooms, and large car parks. As competition from clubs and discos rose in the 1960s, many pubs also began to adopt themes. “It provided escapism,” said Mays. “It is what we like about our social lives, going somewhere that’s different, that has character.” One such place is the Centurion on an estate in Twerton, a suburb of Bath. Built in 1965 it has a large bronze sculpture of a Roman centurion, a statue of Julius Caesar and a framed section of a Roman mosaic floor. The listing report praises the retention of the original Formica veneer in the lounge bar and the slate bar front in its other bar. The Crumpled Horn in Swindon opened in 1975, one of a group of Watney Mann pubs designed around the theme of the nursery rhyme This Is the House that Jack Built. Almost unaltered, it is the only survivor of the group. “It is quite wild,” said Mays. “You would question structurally whether it could stand and that’s the point – the twisted roof looks like it has been thrown up by an unqualified builder but it is incredibly stable and it has been there for many years. It is lovely inside. It is a challenge and a pleasure.” The Wheatsheaf in Camberley, Surrey, is not themed but it is slightly odd. Built in 1970 for a new Bovis housing estate, the architects John and Sylvia Reid – who also designed mass-market furniture – were given a free hand when it came to design, in contrast with other pubs that had to blend in with the housing. Their design features a decagonal ratchet-wheel layout intended to create as many alcoves in the single open bar space as possible. It is based on the theory that pub-goers want to be both among a crowd, and to themselves. The other quirky pubs listed are the flint and cobble-decorated Never Turn Back in Caister, Norfolk, which opened in 1957 as a memorial to the Caister lifeboat disaster of 1901, in which nine crew members died; and the Queen Bess in Scunthorpe, a Samuel Smith pub that opened in 1959 and was named after a blast furnace at the nearby steelworks. Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of Historic England, said all five postwar pubs were fascinating and “among the best surviving examples of a building type which is embedded in English culture”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/20/the-handmaids-tale-recap-season-2-episode-1-offred-discovers-her-fate","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T21:15:07Z","webTitle":"The Handmaid's Tale recap: season 2, episode 1 – Offred discovers her fate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/20/the-handmaids-tale-recap-season-2-episode-1-offred-discovers-her-fate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/20/the-handmaids-tale-recap-season-2-episode-1-offred-discovers-her-fate","fields":{"headline":"The Handmaid's Tale recap: season 2, episode 1 – Offred discovers her fate","bodyText":"Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching series two of The Handmaid’s Tale on Channel 4 in the UK. Please do not add spoilers from later episodes. It has been 10 months since Offred was bundled into the back of a government van, but, for her, no time has passed at all as she drives off to meet her fate. Before we discuss the horrors of the current regime, let’s ease ourselves in with a look at the US before Gilead. The before time In series one, June’s domestic life with Luke provided sunny relief from the oppressive greens of Gilead. Now, while the cinematography still says “a world you recognise”, the timelines are starting to merge; June’s happy family is becoming aware of the changes going on outside their apartment. The happy couple smile as they agree they would like another baby. Optimism for the future is particularly hard to stomach at this juncture. When we see June again, looking out at a vivid street scene from her office window, she is called away to a poorly Hannah, who has been taken to hospital. Her dressing down by the doctor for being a working mum is a hint of what is to come. She is angry, but she brushes it off. It is only when she arrives home to see Luke gawping at the TV that they both begin to understand that everything is going to change. The “before” scenes in future episodes can only start to blend with present-day Gilead. Where will we get our visual relief now? Canada? Gilead It is back to the sludge-green sterility and chilly sunbeams of religious oppression. Free of Margaret Atwood’s direct influence on the plot, the writing focuses heavily on brutality. God, it is horrible. After refusing to stone Janine, the handmaids from Offred’s district are rounded up and forced to endure a fake execution, herded, beaten, bridled and threatened with angry dogs. As Offred joins the throng of crying, shaking women, a leather bridle covering half her face, we are forced again to look into the dehumanised eyes of women who think they are going to be slaughtered. It is more gruelling to watch than any number of ear-slicings or hand-burnings. Gilead rules not with fear, but with the abject terror of the removal of humanity. Those eyes are what I can’t stand. As the executioner declares: “By his hand,” and Offred’s neighbour wets herself, the gibbets fail to drop and I look away for a few beats, snowflake that I am. “Our father who art in heaven, seriously? What the actual fuck?” says Offred in the voicover as the titles announce season two. Welcome back to Gilead. I am glad she said it; the tiny release it provides after 11 minutes of hell is welcome, if brief. The punishment is far from over for the handmaids, who are forced to stand in the rain all day, holding a rock out in front of them in one hand. Only Offred is excused, when Aunt Lydia discovers her pregnancy. The scene between them in the repurposed gymnasium, bowl of soup going cold on the table, demonstrates Offred’s hardening and the one power she still holds – her fecundity. Lydia can burn and subjugate, but she can’t damage the cargo and Offred has clearly decided she can take the pain. Her scar tissue is now rock hard. We get our first sight of Fred and Serena at the doctor’s office as they come to admire the scan of their baby. It is crucial for them to see the tiny white shape wriggle before Offred rips it away from them. There is brutality on both sides, although obviously Gilead’s is 10m times worse. As everyone leaves the room, the medic calls Offred “June” and adrenaline courses through her like electricity. She finds a key in her boot and shoots down a staircase, not knowing where it leads. Even the back of a cold-storage truck full of slaughtered carcasses holds no fear for her as she is shut in and driven away. Icy suffocation is the preferred option over enforced incubation in harness. This series makes me want to be a vegetarian. Finally at her destination, the kindly lorry driver gets a hug for his trouble as June is greeted by Nick, who was on her side after all. She is June again as she burns the handmaid’s dress and cuts the metal tag from her ear, blood splashing down her neck. It is Reservoir Dogs levels of appalling, but necessary. “My name is June Osborne ... I am free,” she tells us, bloodied jaw jutting to the horizon. The sound of music This week’s musical cues kind of worked. Kate Bush singing This Woman’s Work as the noose-wearing women wait for death is particularly effective. I am less sure about Going Back Where I Belong by Sugar Pie DeSanto over the end credits. The music so often sounds like June spinning something from her record collection on her internal jukebox, like a defiant teen. I guess, in this context, anything goes. Blessed be the fruit. May the Lord open. Grimness scale This week’s episode reads a solid 10 on the grimness scale, with one being a bit of shouting and 10 being all-out mental and physical brutality. Under his eye That glimpse of Ofwyatt, chained in a basement and heavily pregnant, bothered me mostly because I couldn’t see anything for her to use as a toilet. Pregnant ladies need to go to the loo a LOT. June’s self-surgery on that ear tag will be talked about for sure. But did we need to see the act itself? Like the burning of Ofrobert’s hand, I think it is better our brains do the work here. Is a post-Atwood story going to rely this heavily on physical and mental hardship as a replacement for narrative complexity? I hope not. But I am more than convinced June’s story has life in it yet. When June torched her red dress, I worried about the plume of smoke being seen by the guards. It looked cool, but so dangerous."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/17/grenfell-review-condemns-race-to-the-bottom-in-building-safety-practices","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T10:58:59Z","webTitle":"Grenfell review condemns 'race to the bottom' in building safety practices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/17/grenfell-review-condemns-race-to-the-bottom-in-building-safety-practices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/17/grenfell-review-condemns-race-to-the-bottom-in-building-safety-practices","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell review condemns 'race to the bottom' in building safety practices","bodyText":"A government review into building regulations in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire has concluded that indifference and ignorance led to a “race to the bottom” in building safety practices, with cost prioritised over safety. But the answer to the key question of whether the government should ban combustible materials, such as those which spread the flames on Grenfell where 72 people died, was left unclear. In a report published on Thursday, Dame Judith Hackitt, the government’s reviewer, said a new standards regulator should be the centrepiece of a reformed system but suggested she did not believe combustible materials should be banned. “Restricting or prohibiting certain practices, will not address the root causes,” she said. Grenfell survivors said they were “disappointed and saddened” that the report rejected their calls for a ban on combustible materials. David Lammy, the MP for Tottenham, described the report as a “betrayal and a whitewash”. Architects, councils and fire experts also condemned the approach. But then Hackitt appeared to contradict her own report and admitted she would in fact support a ban on combustible materials as long as it was alongside the wider reforms she proposed. The housing secretary, James Brokenshire, is due to make a statement on the future of building regulations at around 12.30pm. Flammable insulation and cladding products are currently being stripped from hundreds of high-rise homes in England and Wales. The prime minister said on Wednesday the government would spend £400m to help councils and registered social landlords strip it off, suggesting ministers consider it unacceptable. Lammy said it was “unthinkable” so many people could die in Grenfell Tower and one year on flammable cladding had not been banned. “I will continue to stand with the Grenfell families and will continue to call for an outright ban on any combustible materials,” he said. Shahin Sadafi, chair of Grenfell United, whose family lived at Grenfell, said: “Worrying that a fire like Grenfell could happen again is something that keeps many of us awake at night. When we met Dame Judith Hackitt we asked her for an outright ban on combustible cladding. We are disappointed and saddened that she didn’t listen to us and she didn’t listen to other experts.” Lord Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, said that despite Hackitt’s report the government should nevertheless act without delay to introduce a temporary ban on the use of combustible materials on complex and high-rise buildings ”until we have a regulatory and testing system which is fit for the 21st century”. Hackitt said a new building regulations system should at first focus on buildings of 10 storeys or more. A new regulator called the Joint Competent Authority should be made up of local authority building standards, fire and rescue authorities and Health and Safety Executive officials. It will be independent of the building owner and it will approve designs before construction begins. “What I want to see happen here is we do not want to have to wait for a tragedy like Grenfell before we apply the full criminal sanctions of the law,” she said. “We have to get to a position where people putting lives at risk by what they’re doing gets picked up at the time and there’s sanctions applied there and then, not in the aftermath of a terrible tragedy like Grenfell.” She continued: “If this had been in place prior to Grenfell, I do not believe the cladding that was put on Grenfell would have got through the system in the first place.” At Grenfell Tower, which was owned by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the building regulations were checked by RBKC’s own building officers while works were already under way. The same thing happened on dozens of other buildings clad in combustible material nationwide. There should also be tougher penalties for failures; Hackitt found rates of enforcement action against breaches of building regulations had fallen 75% in the last decade. But she argued there shouldn’t be prescription about what materials could and could not be used; instead the onus should be on the “construction industry to take responsibility for the delivery of safe buildings rather than looking to others to tell them what is or is not acceptable”. She said “it will be important now for industry to show leadership in driving this forward”. Hackitt said people did not bother to read regulations and when they did, they did not understand them. She said concerns were ignored during the building process because “the primary motivation is to do things as quickly and cheaply as possible rather than to deliver quality homes” and that some builders use the ambiguity of the regulations to “game the system”. She also said people in the industry did not know who was in charge, that enforcement was patchy and penalties were so small as to be ineffective. However, she stopped short of banning controversial desktop studies, which can be used to justify using certain materials without a fire test. She said she wanted desktop studies to be carried out only by qualified people, which she said would effectively stop unregulated fire engineers paid by builders of building owners from declaring systems safe. However, the detailed results of those tests should remain commercially confidential, she said. She said the new regulatory framework must also address the fact that “residents often go unheard, even when safety issues are identified”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/21/oneplus-6-review-smartphone-half-cost-iphone-x-screen-camera-dual-sim-support","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T07:48:52Z","webTitle":"OnePlus 6 review: top-end smartphone for half cost of iPhone X","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/21/oneplus-6-review-smartphone-half-cost-iphone-x-screen-camera-dual-sim-support","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/21/oneplus-6-review-smartphone-half-cost-iphone-x-screen-camera-dual-sim-support","fields":{"headline":"OnePlus 6 review: top-end smartphone for half cost of iPhone X","bodyText":"The new OnePlus 6 holds true to a winning formula: a premium smartphone with top-end specs that costs less than half the price of an iPhone X. Seen next to last year’s OnePlus 5 and 5T, the OnePlus 6 looks like a logical extension of the design trend for ever larger screens fitted into the same size bodies. All screen, all glass There’s a relatively small “chin” at the bottom of the screen where it joins the body but the bezels are narrow around the sides and the top. OnePlus has embraced what appears to be the smartphone trend for 2018, the “notch” – where the top of the screen cuts into the display to make room for sensors, the earpiece speaker and a 16-megapixel selfie camera. The 6.28in AMOLED screen is enormous, bright, colourful and crisp, with great viewing angles. Technically it isn’t as pin-sharp as some of Samsung’s top-end displays, which have a higher resolution, but you have to really try to see the difference. Also new for the OnePlus 6 is a curved glass back, available in both mirror and matt finishes, and with smooth, polished metal sides, the phone feels really nice in the hand. In fact the whole device feels like a significant step up in quality, matching that of Apple’s iPhone X and Samsung’s Galaxy S9+. There are downsides to a glass back. While it’s not slippery in the hand, it is on fabric surfaces, and the mirror finish picks up fingerprints like a magnet. Scratches are inevitable too, and it’ll be less robust if you drop it. Thankfully OnePlus is one of the few non-Apple manufacturers that makes really nice cases. There’s no getting over that this is a big phone firmly in the phablet category, but it’s not unmanageably wide or unwieldy, comparing well to Samsung’s Galaxy S9+. Specifications Screen: 6.28in full HD AMOLED (402ppi) Processor: octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 RAM: 6 or 8GB of RAM Storage: 64,128 or 256GB Operating system: OxygenOS based on Android 8.1 Camera: 16MP + 20MP rear dual camera, 16MP front-facing camera Connectivity: LTE, dual sim, Wi-Fiac, NFC, Bluetooth 5 and GPS Dimensions: 155.7 x 75.4 x 7.8mm Weight: 177g Zero lag The OnePlus 6 ticks every box for a top-of-the-range smartphone in 2018: Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 845 processor, at least 6GB of RAM and plenty of storage. But it also feels like a top-end smartphone, absolutely flying along. When OnePlus claims there is “no lag of any kind” it isn’t kidding. The entire system is incredibly snappy all over, from switching apps to launching the camera. It’s delightful. Battery life is good, but not quite class leading. The OnePlus 6 lasted 29 hours between charges, starting up at 7am on day one and lasting until midday on day two. That was while using it as my primary device, with two sims in it, browsing and using apps for five hours while receiving hundreds of push emails and messages, 60 minutes of Amazon Video, around 30 photos and listening to around seven hours of music via Bluetooth headphones. Charging is really fast too via the Dash Charger, hitting 30% from dead in 17 minutes, 70 in 38 minutes and a full charge in just under 90 minutes. OxygenOS 5.1 OnePlus puts a customised version of Android on its phones called OxygenOS, this time based on Android 8.1 Oreo, which is the latest available right now, with Android P due in the summer. OxygenOS is a slightly refined version of so-called “stock” Android with small additions and tools, such as the ability to duplicate certain messaging apps including WhatsApp. OxygenOS 5.1 on the OnePlus 6 is the smoothest and most refined yet, matching that on Google’s Pixel 2 for speed, which is a very good thing. It lacks the Google Feed pane, instead having what OnePlus calls the “shelf” containing widgets, which is a shame. Customisation options include the ability to swap out the traditional Android navigation home, back and overview buttons for gestures similar to those used on the iPhone X and a choice whether or not to hide the notch by a permanently black status bar. Camera OnePlus has long struggled to keep up with the likes of Apple, Google, Samsung and now Huawei when it comes to the camera. The OnePlus 6 has a 16+20-megapixel dual-camera system on the back. It uses both colour cameras to increase detail and low light performance, as well as provide a fairly good portrait mode. The camera is much improved, producing some really nice, well detailed and well coloured images in good lighting. Low light performance is also markedly better than last year’s phone, and the app is simple and easy to use. But the OnePlus 6 isn’t quite on a par with the Huawei P20 Pro or the Google Pixel 2. It may not have any real whiz-bang features, and lacks optical zoom, but most will be very pleased with the images for the money. The selfie camera is pretty good too, preserving a solid amount of detail, even in fairly poor fluorescent lighting. The optional beauty mode also manages to smooth skin without erasing beards, which is better than most. The OnePlus 6 lacks the 960fps slow-motion that 2018’s competitors have, but will record very good 720p slow-mo at 480fps for as long as you want, rather than just in bursts. Observations The phone comes fitted with a screen protector and with a soft plastic case in the box Dash Charge only works with the included cable and charger The OnePlus 6 is included in the Android P beta programme There’s only a single speaker, but it’s fairly loud OnePlus says the phone will survive accidental water spillages on it or rain, but it does not have an IP water resistance rating Face unlock is super fast, but you are trading some security for convenience – the fingerprint scanner on the back is equally snappy The OnePlus alert slider continues to be great, switching between ring, vibrate and silent Price The OnePlus 6 is available in three colours and three storage variants. It starts at £469 with the mirror black finish, 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The version with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage costs £519 in white, gloss or matt black, while an 8GB RAM, 256GB matt black version costs £569. For comparison, the 6.1in Huawei P20 Pro costs £799 with 128GB of storage, the 6in Huawei Mate 10 Pro with 128GB costs £699, the 6.2in Samsung Galaxy S9+ costs £869 with 128GB of storage, the 6in Google Pixel 2 XL with 64GB costs £799, the 6in Honor 10 View with 128GB costs £450, and the 5.8in iPhone X with 64GB costs £999. Verdict The OnePlus 6 is premium device that cuts the right corners in pursuit of a sub-£500 price. Starting at £469, it certainly isn’t a cheap smartphone but it is less than half the cost of Apple’s iPhone X and considerably cheaper than the top-end Android competition. It is as smooth and well made on the outside as it is high performing on the inside, which makes it one of the best smartphone experiences available at any price point right now. And while the camera is good, the screen is great, the battery life is good and it even has a headphone socket, there’s no real killer, stand-out feature to set the OnePlus 6 apart. Instead the OnePlus 6 demonstrates that despite what marketers might say, you really don’t need to pay £700 to £1,000 for a really great phone.

To break down the bones of this catastrophe: the AFLW had eight senior coaches in its opening years. Two of them were women; revolutionary faces and names not only for the Adelaide Crows and Fremantle Dockers, but for the AFL, until a pair of rude severances last month marked a breaking point to problems that – behind a positive public relations veil – had in fact been brewing for over a year. Bec Goddard directed the inaugural AFLW premiership. Michelle Cowan was so highly regarded that she was lured from the Melbourne footy club’s clutches by poacher Fremantle. In recent weeks, both were offered contracts to coach in their respective elite AFL settings into 2019. Cowan, contrary to some reports, was actually offered a two-year deal designed to secure her as top AFLW Docker until 2020. Clearly Adelaide and Fremantle did not doubt the aptitude of these leaders. In an unsentimental caper they were wanted women. Until things fractured to this point of disrepair. Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day These are irrefutable facts: Cowan and Goddard, on independent but parallel paths, wanted nothing more than to progress in elite AFL homes yet both have walked voluntarily. Both have left their AFL clubs emotionally shattered. And as it stands both are lost to the AFL. Alarm bells should not merely be ringing but blaring. This is a stain the likes of which the league has never seen before and it goes to the heart of the AFL’s gender divide – a rarely ventilated coalface reality for so many that’s as stubborn today as it has proved historically damaging to the code. Well before this current crisis hit, concerns and complaints were confided in lofty AFL places in good faith. Warnings were even published in black and white: “I fear we’ve created a women’s competition for women to play in and men to manage”. On a condition of anonymity, which in itself spoke volumes, that worry was shared with me to appear in a book, ROAR, released in February this year. The incisive observation of this still impeccably-placed source raised largely unspoken inequities in the AFL that have since deepened. The decisions of Goddard and Cowan to abandon their unique posts – only ever part-time despite their desires – signals a boil bursting: the AFL’s entire population of senior female coaches is extinct. In an infinitely preferable alternate reality, the AFL would have responded meaningfully to troubles it was privy to in both Cowan and Goddard’s cases – some just teething problems, others more sinister manmade barriers. Had a discreet but targeted league response been effective, Cowan and Goddard might be freshly re-signed rather than regretfully resigned. Beyond AFLW there is a lone, comparable remaining torchbearer: Peta Searle. Yet in 2018 at St Kilda, a club widely lauded four years ago for appointing the first woman to a men’s AFL coaching panel, this pioneer has quietly but progressively been sidelined. This is obvious to anyone who has tracked how Searle has been used at the Saints. There are more bodies than ever in AFL coaches’ boxes come game day nowadays. Haven’t seen Searle in Alan Richardson’s lately? That’s because it hasn’t been happening. Searle has effectively been pushed sideways, limited to the VFL and VFLW, and theoretically heading an AFLW side St Kilda hasn’t even won a licence for yet. It is an inconvenient truth for the AFL that in the case of the code’s top three female coaches, looks have been so deceiving. Forging new ground is rarely easy. Being wholly welcomed into a male dominated football department of an AFL club is something else. AFLW coaches – men and women – have experienced varying degrees of isolation and internal pushback in a brave new landscape that promised, at least in theory, to welcome men and women equally. In seasons one and two some coaches have felt so delicately placed in the AFL food chain that they’ve refrained from tabling grievances formally. Cowan and Goddard are entitled to feel failed by influential AFL advocates that should have realised much faster how much championing – even intervention – was required so that a code diversification so important would be universally embraced and work. Suggestions that Cowan’s resignation was family-related – the departure news story on Fremantle’s website was accompanied by a photograph of her with her two kids – are misleading. It is equally important to record that there is no link between her voluntary exit and Ross Lyon’s involvement in a payment to an aggrieved female former Fremantle employee. Cowan wanted her team to be better resourced and, personally, she wanted more opportunities to develop at the Dockers. She was not satisfied by restricted offerings. A falsehood in Goddard’s circumstances is that in leaving Adelaide she returns to war chest earnings from her job with the Australian Federal Police. Rather, at precisely the point where the 2017 AFLW premiership director was exploring whether genuine professional development in the AFL could see her prioritise that sporting pursuit, the Crows also came up short. Goddard did not demand a role in Adelaide’s Don Pyke-led men’s program, though the missing link was obvious. Now the inaugural AFLW head coach is a goner just as the Western Bulldogs have rewarded Paul Groves for steering the 2018 AFLW flag with upgraded responsibilities – in addition to his AFLW chief coach job he has a new gig as line coach for the Bulldogs in VFL men’s. The professional development desires Goddard and Cowan tabled were separate to their part-time pay and employment terms. The pair has stayed largely silent on this topic publicly, despite its increased discussion on AFLW’s ever-colourful grapevine. As it was, the only two women to hold senior coach titles in AFL club history were in the lowest pay bracket among their AFLW head coach peers. Senior coach pay ranged between $40,000 and $100,000 in season one. Top male AFLW earners with additional roles and full-time positions like Cowan and Goddard wanted earned double the wage of the only two female equivalents. Lured from Melbourne back to her hometown to lead Fremantle, Cowan has paid in more ways than one. Eyes wide open, she took a pay cut to join the Dockers. At Melbourne she was mentored, and had a men’s program role, initially under Paul Roos, then Simon Goodwin. Development opportunities of that kind did not materialise at Fremantle. This was so disheartening that Cowan turned down a two-year contract without anything in footy to move on to. Switch the gender in these AFL coaching experience stories and it’s a mainstream news scandal. Confidantes of Goddard and Cowan have described women left distraught by a landmine of factors that have led to this wipeout of women in senior AFL coaching roles. Goddard has moved back to her native Canberra and is an assistant coach for a NEAFL team, a giant regression from where she was. Cowan has stopped coaching altogether. The response of AFL bosses to the chief protagonists in this has ranged from cursory to tardy to non-existent. It suggests the gravity of the loss has, to this point, eluded the AFL’s most powerful who should already have shown a clear and urgent strategy for remediation. Sometimes for better and sometimes for worse, a defining trait of the AFL is that it rallies around, protects, finds new jobs and softens landings for its own when the chips are down. Unless, it would appear, you’re a female coach. For all the public celebration of Goddard, Cowan and Searle’s trailblazing, not one has been sufficiently supported to soar. Too many things in season two to list here underscored how the AFL does not understand nuances of how delicate the nascent AFLW is without thoughtful, intelligent, sensitive, proactive and deeply strategic leadership. Angry and anxious advocates of women’s football – men and women – are doubting if they can trust the AFL to manage a movement that’s bigger than sport beyond the league launching. Many have formed the view that they can’t. Questions requiring emergency attention when it comes to the cases of Cowan and Goddard concern not only what happened but what did not happen. As those questions dangle in the air Daniel Harford was unveiled as new senior coach of Carlton’s AFLW side, Paul Hood is Geelong’s first AFLW head, and fellow 2019 inclusion to the competition, North Melbourne, will be directed by Scott Gowans. Wayne Siekman has been re-appointed by Collingwood this week and Groves re-boots with the kind of significant career promotion Cowan and Goddard coveted. The existence of the AFLW is assured. When Adelaide won the historic first flag it was actually Crows’ chairman Rob Chapman who declared at a celebratory function: “We have a moral obligation to get this right.” The survival rate of senior female coaches in the AFLW has quickly earned a terrible track record. And it is convenient, lazy and neglectful for the AFL and clubs to say things will improve naturally when AFLW players of today look to become coaches in time. A career transition to AFL coaching for an AFLW-playing woman? The scene now is a story of women being under-utilised, under-resourced, undervalued and underpaid.Some advertisement. Yes, the AFL has a moral obligation to get this right but first things first: people in high places had real insight to issues that eventually rendered two modern luminaries to become so demoralised that they quit. Can the AFL, in this disastrous aftermath, handle the warts and all truth on how it has gone so wrong?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/may/17/youtube-music-new-streaming-service-launch","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T10:26:49Z","webTitle":"YouTube to launch new music streaming service","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/17/youtube-music-new-streaming-service-launch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/17/youtube-music-new-streaming-service-launch","fields":{"headline":"YouTube to launch new music streaming service","bodyText":"YouTube is taking on rivals including Apple, Spotify and Amazon with a new subscription streaming service launching next week.

Despite YouTube’s powerful position as the biggest music site in the world, with 1.3 billion users regularly watching videos, there is scepticism that it will topple the streaming music market leader, Spotify. “YouTube has done this to appease the music labels who like subscription models but it is not going to be a Spotify killer,” Mark Mulligan, an analyst at MIDiA Research, says. “YouTube is all about generating advertising; it has a strategic disincentive to make its music subscription service work because it is an ad-funded business. I doubt we will see it become a leading music subscription service.” YouTube is estimated to be on track to make $10bn in ad revenues this year, according to eMarketer. The Google-owned service paid $856m in royalties to music companies last year – only an estimated 67 cents per user annually. With the aid of Google Assistant and access to a wealth of user data, the app will offer recommendations automatically based on the time of day and the user’s location and listening habits, according to Pitchfork. The YouTube executive T Jay Fowler described the revamped service as a “deeply personalised experience”. YouTube Music will supersede Google Play Music, which will continue to exist as a cloud locker service, to which users can upload their music for portable streaming. Existing subscribers will receive access to the new service. In addition, YouTube Red – the ad-free, paid-for version of YouTube – will be renamed YouTube Premium and include access to YouTube Music. Existing subscribers will continue to pay $9.99 a month, while new subscribers will pay $11.99. Roman said “more than 1 billion music fans come to YouTube each month to be part of music culture and discover new music” – which marks the first time YouTube has revealed data about its music users, Music Ally reported. The launch of YouTube Music and the rebranding of YouTube Red brings cohesion to the streaming strategy of YouTube and its parent company, Google. In 2014, it launched YouTube Music Key, which offered free and offline streaming for a monthly fee of $9.99. A prior mobile app, also called YouTube Music, allowed YouTube Red subscribers to play YouTube videos with the screen off. The standard, ad-supported version of YouTube works only with the screen turned on and the browser or app in the foreground."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/commentisfree/2018/may/17/nly-the-support-of-the-people-can-save-the-abc-now","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T06:48:51Z","webTitle":"Only the support of the people can save the ABC now | Emma Dawson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/2018/may/17/nly-the-support-of-the-people-can-save-the-abc-now","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/commentisfree/2018/may/17/nly-the-support-of-the-people-can-save-the-abc-now","fields":{"headline":"Only the support of the people can save the ABC now","bodyText":"The announcement in last week’s budget that the ABC’s funding indexation will be frozen for three years from July 2019 is the latest in a series of extraordinary attacks by a government that displays an unprecedented level of hostility to the national broadcaster. It represents a real cut to the broadcaster’s operating costs of $84m. Added to the $254m cut over five years announced by then-communications minister Malcolm Turnbull in November 2014, and a $28m cut to the enhanced newsgathering service in the 2016 budget, this brings the money taken out of our national broadcaster since the election of the Coalition government to over a quarter of a billion dollars. Contrast this with the former Labor government’s approach. In 2009, when I worked in the office of communications minister Stephen Conroy, the ABC was awarded the largest funding increase since its incorporation in 1983, with $136.4m in new money to fund the creation of the ABC Kids’ channel and 90 hours of new Australian drama. Four years later, the ABC was given $89.4m to set up the newsgathering service and enhance the digital delivery of ABC programs. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday In addition to record funding boosts, Conroy, arguably the best friend in government the ABC has ever had, also ensured the ABC charters were amended to specifically require them to deliver digital services; overhauled the board appointment process to put it at arm’s length from the government of the day; and, in a move that enraged the Murdoch empire, created legislation that specified that any international broadcasting service funded by the government could only be delivered by the ABC. This came after the government’s refusal to award carriage of the Australia Network to News Corp in 2011, a decision that was regarded both at home and internationally as common sense by everyone other than the owners of Sky News. All this is now under attack. The Turnbull government seems determined not only to undo every measure of financial and legislative support implemented by the last Labor government, but to undermine the ABC’s operations so thoroughly that its ability to provide the services its charter requires will likely be devastated. The legislation passed in early 2013 prevented the incoming Coalition government from reopening the tender process to award the Australia Network to Sky – so they shut it down entirely instead. Five years later, the Lowy Institute laments that “[o]nce a significant player in what the British Council calls the Great Game of the Airwaves, the ABC’s purpose-designed, multiplatform international services have suffered near-terminal decline”. As far as the board appointment process goes, Turnbull as prime minister and his communications minister Mitch Fifield are doing their best to ignore it: two recent appointees, Minerals Council boss Vanessa Guthrie and Sydney Institute Director Joseph Gersh, were not recommended for appointment by the independent selection panel. Fifield is relying on clauses in the legislation governing the appointment process that allow the minister to appoint from outside the recommended list in exceptional circumstances, but has publicly offered no reason why these candidates were more urgently required on the ABC board than those recommended as more qualified by the selection panel. It’s also impossible to discover whether the minister has tabled the statement to parliament giving his reasons for ignoring the advice of the selection panel, as required by the legislation. If he has, perhaps those statements explain why Guthrie and Gersh are the most qualified candidates to provide governance of our most trusted source of news. Despite the selection criteria set out in Conroy’s legislation, the ABC board now includes no one other than the staff-elected director and the managing director, Michelle Guthrie, with media experience and, despite the full board having been appointed by this government, they seem unable to make a case to maintain the ABC’s funding. But the biggest danger to the ABC is the government’s agenda to reduce its digital services, and it’s here where the ABC – and, in this case, SBS as well – face a truly existential threat. The so-called “competitive neutrality inquiry” into the national broadcasters, currently underway, has ostensibly been launched to satisfy Pauline Hanson’s demands for an inquiry into the ABC in return for her support for last year’s appalling package of media “reforms”, which will reduce diversity and local content across the commercial broadcast media. Don’t believe it for a second. While Hanson’s hatred of the ABC will assist any future government moves to neuter the broadcaster’s digital activities, this inquiry is yet another gift to News Corp and the commercial media organisations, who have been baying for the ABC’s blood since it arrived on the airwaves more than three-quarters of a century ago. The $30m of government money given, apparently with few strings attached, to Foxtel last year was really just “compensation” for the fact that the commercial TV operators got a windfall gain with the abolition of their broadcast licence fees and replacement with spectrum fees. This saves the broadcasters around $90m per year (money which is forgone government revenue, by the way) so, of course, Foxtel had to be similarly rewarded for … running a commercial business in a competitive market. It’s not yet clear what Foxtel will spend this money on, although some of it may be earmarked to support the nefarious deal it recently struck with Network Seven and Cricket Australia to do an end-run around the anti-siphoning legislation and put a load of international one day matches behind a paywall. The aggrieved alliance of News Corp, Fairfax and the commercial television broadcasters have now got the government dancing to their tune with an inquiry designed to find justifications to shut down the ABC and SBS’s digital services. As Michael Pascoe has noted, this inquiry is completely unjustified – the Productivity Commission is already equipped to deal with any material breaches of the competitive neutrality principles. It’s happening because the commercial sector can’t fight off Facebook and Google, so they are trying to remove the competitors they can, through government interference, more easily attack. The ABC’s iView is by far the country’s most innovative and successful online streaming service, and SBS OnDemand – which nabbed last year’s surprise smash hit The Handmaid’s Tale out from under an out-of-touch commercial market to the fury of the major networks (or “bunch of sooks” as SBS MD Michael Ebeid described them) – isn’t far behind. The issues paper put out by this absurd inquiry attempts to make the case that the advent of digital broadcasting and the internet have created an unprecedented disruption to media markets. But technological change has been disrupting the media, along with every other industry, for over a 100 years. This latest attempt to nobble the ABC is in the fine tradition set by Australia’s commercial media when the national broadcaster was first formed in 1932. Newspaper proprietors then were outraged that the government would establish a publicly-funded service to provide broadcast radio news, in direct competition to their daily mastheads. For more than a decade, the ABC was prevented from conducting its own newsgathering, with restrictions imposed to keep them reliant on the newspapers. This campaign against the ABC was led by Keith Murdoch, and only came to an end when the immediate provision of news from the front lines of the second world war demonstrated to the Australian public the superior service available through the national broadcaster. It will be only the support of the people that will save the ABC again now. The senate crossbench demonstrated its willingness to prioritise the demands of the commercial media over the public interest when it passed the media “reform” package last year. If we are to protect the ABC’s ability, and that of SBS, to continue to provide digital and online services to Australian audiences, we must rise up against this concerted campaign of funding cuts and attempts to limit the activities of our national broadcasters through regulatory and legislative changes. In the lead up to the next federal election, every Australian who values our ABC must take the fight to their local MP and actively campaign for a restoration of support to one of our most critically important democratic institutions. There is too much at stake, and no time to lose. • Emma Dawson is executive director of thinktank Per Capita.

Tim Steiner, a founder and chief executive of the UK online grocer, said it was a “transformative” deal in which the two firms would build 20 automated warehouses across the US over the next three years. Kroger has nearly 2,800 shops across 35 US states and annual sales of $122bn in 2017. It will take a 5% stake in Ocado as part of the deal. At one point, Ocado shares had jumped 81% to £10 and despite slipping back from that level they closed 245.2p better at 797.2, valuing the business at £5.3bn. This means the company is worth more than Marks &amp; Spencer, which is valued at £4.8bn. The value of Steiner’s personal stake in the company surged in value by more than £60m by the time the stock market closed. His shares are worth nearly £200m. At its current share price, Ocado would surge into the FTSE 100 index of Britain’s biggest companies, which will have its next quarterly reshuffle on 30 May. “Ocado’s unique, proprietary and industry-leading technology is set to transform the shopping experience of consumers around the world,” Steiner said. “As we work through the terms of the services agreement with Kroger in the coming months, we will be preparing the business for a transformative relationship which will reshape the food retailing industry in the US in the years to come.” Rodney McMullen, the chairman and chief executive of Kroger, said the partnership would allow it to “speed up our efforts to redefine the food and grocery customer experience”. Ocado is providing its technology to Kroger in the US on an exclusive basis and the deal is the latest foray into international markets for the UK group. It has struck partnerships with Groupe Casino in France, Sobeys in Canada and ICA Group in Sweden. Ocado also works in partnership with Morrisons in the UK. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that as one of the most shorted stocks in the UK – where investors bet that a firm’s share price will fall – Ocado’s deal with Kroger was a “poke in the eye” for the hedge funds who have bet against it. “Ocado is making great strides in the global grocery market and inflicting serious financial pain on those who have bet against it,” Khalaf said. “The company is known in the UK as an online supermarket but that’s just the tip of the iceberg as Ocado is primarily a technology and logistics firm with the potential to license out its services to grocers around the world. “The short sellers were hoping Ocado wouldn’t deliver on its international expansion plans. That position now looks like a badly busted flush.” Ocado was founded in 2000 by three former Goldman Sachs bankers, including Steiner, but did not report a profit until 2015. The other two founders were Jonathan Faiman, who left the company in 2010, and Jason Gissing, who left in 2014 to work on environmental and social causes. John Lewis was one of the original backers of Ocado, investing £68m and taking a 29% stake. However, the relationship between the two businesses became increasingly fractious. Waitrose – part of the John Lewis Partnership – still sells products through Ocado’s online service but the supermarket chain also operates its own delivery service for orders placed on Waitrose.com. Ocado floated on the stock market in 2010 at 180p a share. The directors had been hoping to sell shares at between 200p and 275p but were forced to slash the asking price for shares as they struggled to find investors. Lee Wild, the head of equity strategy at Interactive Investor, said Ocado was a “marmite stock” for years. “Only last November when it struck a long-awaited international deal in France did attitudes change. This [Kroger] is the big one for Ocado.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/17/burundi-referendum-presidential-powers-tensions-high","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T08:08:18Z","webTitle":"Burundi votes in referendum over president's 2034 'power grab'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/17/burundi-referendum-presidential-powers-tensions-high","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/17/burundi-referendum-presidential-powers-tensions-high","fields":{"headline":"Burundi votes in referendum over president's 2034 'power grab'","bodyText":"Opposition politicians in Burundi have urged voters to peacefully resist an effort by authorities to “steal power” in a referendum that some fear could spark widespread violence. Burundians are being asked to vote yes or no to a proposal to extend the presidential term from five years to seven, which would allow the incumbent, Pierre Nkurunziza, to rule for up to 14 more years after his current term expires in 2020. A yes vote would also boost the president’s powers and allow changes to the distribution of top government posts according to ethnicity. Critics fear this will upset a delicate balance between communities that has preserved peace since the end of a civil war. Tensions have been running high for months amid a wave of alleged detentions and killings of the government’s perceived opponents. At least 26 people were killed in an attack in the north-western province of Cibitoke on Friday. It is unclear whether the massacre was politically motivated. Aimé Magera, a spokesman for the National Liberation Forces (FNL), an opposition party, said campaigners for a no vote had made a “massive breakthrough” in recent days. “The people have overcome their fear and come out in huge numbers. We are going to resist right to the end,” he said. “We will show to the international community that the Burundian people are awake and standing and need help.” On Thursday government officials described long queues of voters waiting “in calm and serenity”. The electoral commission said the vote represented a “historic rendezvous with democracy and the consolidation of national sovereignty”. “It’s for the people of Burundi to decide about their future and nobody else,” said Gen Evariste Ndayishimiye, the ruling party’s secretary general. Opposition officials said ruling party volunteers had systematically accompanied voters into booths while many of their own observers had been ejected. There were no reports of violence, however. Burundi’s government has been under pressure from international institutions and organisations in recent weeks. The UN high commissioner on human rights, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, urged authorities to “assume [their] responsibility in order to ensure Burundi people peace, security and a fully functioning democracy”. The EU and the US have denounced intimidation, repression and harassment of opposition supporters. Magera said: “We have been beaten, threatened, harassed and attacked. So many have been arrested it is impossible to count.” Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have repeatedly documented widespread abuses by security forces and government-sponsored organisations. Burundi’s government has said the charges are malicious propaganda spread by exiles. Last week it suspended BBC broadcasts in the country for six months, accusing the corporation of spreading ideas that discredited the president. Voice of America broadcasts were also suspended. Yves-Lionel Nubwacu, a presidential aide, told the Guardian: “The campaign has been free and contested. All different opinions have been represented on the airwaves … and some of the officials of these international organisations that have been so critical are far from objective.” Nkurunziza, a former teacher and rebel leader who is the son of a Hutu father and a Tutsi mother, has been in power since 2005. A born-again Christian who won some support with public displays of faith, he was re-elected unopposed in 2010 after the opposition boycotted the vote. In 2015 he triggered a crisis by pursuing a third term. More than 1,000 people have died and more than 400,000 have fled the country since. SOS Medias Burundi, a network of independent journalists, reported the arrests of more than 50 members of the opposition coalition Amizero y’Abarundi in a single week last month. Amnesty International has highlighted the case of Germain Rukuki, a human rights activist who was sentenced to 32 years in prison on charges that included rebellion. Richard Moncrieff, a regional specialist with the International Crisis Group, said the government was “unravelling the settlement that ended the civil war, and that does not augur well”. Some opposition figures have called for armed resistance. “We now need ... to remove [Nkurunziza] by use of arms,” said Hussein Radjubu, a former ruling party official who was arrested on treason charges but later escaped from prison. Like many in the fragmented opposition, Radjubu now lives overseas. Ben Shepherd, an expert in the region at London’s Chatham House, said “one big unanswered question” was the level of popularity of Nkurunziza in rural areas. “There’s a sense that the ruling party has been seen as fighting the good fight for Burundi’s rural poor,” Shepherd said. The peace accord that ended the civil war ensured that the national and local government, parliament and the senate are composed of both Hutu and Tutsis, split 60% to 40%. This settlement is now threatened, analysts say. Other proposed constitutional changes include the appointment of a prime minister by the president, which would consolidate the position of the ruling party and could prevent some opposition politicians from running for office. Members of the Imbonerakure, the ruling party’s youth wing, have urged supporters to harass opposition members and even to “impregnate” them, and are alleged to have threatened those who appeared unlikely to vote in the referendum. The ruling party’s secretary general blamed western powers for destabilising Burundi and said those who voted against the proposed changes to the constitution were “enemies of the nation”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/18/australias-cut-to-healthcare-on-manus-island-inexplicable-amnesty-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T18:00:37Z","webTitle":"Australia's cut to healthcare on Manus Island 'inexplicable', Amnesty says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/18/australias-cut-to-healthcare-on-manus-island-inexplicable-amnesty-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/18/australias-cut-to-healthcare-on-manus-island-inexplicable-amnesty-says","fields":{"headline":"Australia's cut to healthcare on Manus Island 'inexplicable', Amnesty says","bodyText":"The Australian government is trying to walk away from the human rights crisis it created on Manus Island, winding back health services while refugees and asylum seekers are still in its care, Amnesty International has said. A report by the organisation, released on Friday, criticised the termination of mental health services despite the 700-strong refugee population on Manus having one of the highest rates of mental illness in the world, according to the UN. “Last year two refugees committed suicide in Manus Island, illustrating the terrible price of confining vulnerable people to remote detention centres,” said Graham Thom, refugee coordinator at Amnesty International Australia. “In the wake of these tragedies Australia has inexplicably cut counselling and trauma services, just one of a raft of changes which will make it even harder for refugees and asylum seekers in Papua New Guinea to access healthcare.” •Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The report is based on an Amnesty investigation conducted in November last year, one month after detainees were moved out of the processing centre and into other accommodation centres in Lorengau. The Manus Island detention centre was closed on 31 October and services – including healthcare – withdrawn. However hundreds of men refused to leave due to fears for their safety in the community following a number of violent incidents. The three-week standoff ended when PNG authorities cleared the centre out with force. Counselling services that were previously available have not been replaced. International Health &amp; Medical Services (IHMS) has operated a smaller-scale clinic at one of the three new accommodation centres for the refugees and asylum seekers, but it was not open after hours and did not provide critical care or outreach services for patients unable to leave their beds. Those who could not be adequately treated in Lorengau are transferred to Port Moresby for treatment, and if appropriate care was not available there they were earmarked for international transfer, but with lengthy waiting periods. “While PIH [Pacific International hospital] is better equipped than public health services in PNG, it remains limited by the availability of specialists and medical equipment,” Amnesty said. “PNG does not have the ability to provide the type of specialist medical care that refugees and asylum seekers require, especially in relation to mental health issues, within the country.” Amnesty toured facilities at the same time as the UNHCR, which found the Lorengau hospital operating at 33% over capacity, with no refugee expertise and an intermittent ambulance service. It also found half of all doctors and 43% of all nurses positions unfilled. “Amnesty International’s own findings were consistent with those of UNHCR – that healthcare for refugees has largely been inadequate and declining because of limitations imposed by the Australian government, and that unless some of the most urgent cases are transferred to Australia, they will not be able to receive necessary treatment, with potentially life-threatening results,” Amnesty said. Thom told Guardian Australia while the situation was less chaotic now than in November, there were still “gaping holes” in health services. Among the case studies presented, one man had a stent inserted in his stomach during an operation and was told it would be removed in six weeks. Eight months later it remained and was pressing against his bladder, causing bleeding. Another man had a broken wrist that was left untreated for more than four years. At the end of last month the Australian government ended its contract with health provider IHMS and engaged the PNG Pacific International hospital. “By shifting healthcare responsibilities to local contractors and the public health system, the Australian government has limited the availability, accessibility and quality of healthcare for refugees and asylum seekers,” Amnesty said. “Refugees and asylum seekers live in accommodation, with security, meals, medication, healthcare all currently provided by the Australian government or its contractors.” Amnesty said the government needs to be transparent about its contract with PIH, and ensure at least the same level of care is available, including reinstating mental healthcare, interpreters and medical evacuations to Australia when necessary."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/may/18/street-child-world-cup-2018-moscow","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T12:33:30Z","webTitle":"Street Child World Cup: 'I lived on a train, surviving on leftover food' | Jo Griffin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/may/18/street-child-world-cup-2018-moscow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/may/18/street-child-world-cup-2018-moscow","fields":{"headline":"Street Child World Cup: 'I lived on a train, surviving on leftover food'","bodyText":"For three boys in the Kenyan team, taking part in the Street Child World Cup in Moscow has meant swapping their prison shirts for football kit. The teenagers were released from a juvenile detention centre to play in the tournament and will serve out the short time left on their sentences back in Mombasa. Their crime: being on the streets. “I had to fight really hard to get permission to bring them, but I wanted to give them a really positive experience,” says the team’s manager, Frederick Achola, from the Glad’s House organisation. Based in Mombasa, Glad’s House campaigns against the criminalisation of street children in Kenya, particularly the practice of sending them to detention centres thousands of miles from the areas in which they have been living, if there is no space nearby. The story of the young Kenyan hopefuls who traded a prison cell in Kenya for a football pitch in Moscow was just one of the many remarkable tales to emerge from the combined tournament and congress on children’s rights, which took place in the run-up to the World Cup in Russia. More than 20 countries were involved, with defending champions Brazil lifting the girls’ trophy and Uzbekistan the boys’. Since its inception in 2010, the competition has acted as a springboard for street children to speak out on rights and work with other vulnerable teenagers. The players are all either homeless, have spent time living on the streets or are considered at risk of doing so. Here, young people from Brazil, the Philippines and India share their experiences. David Santos Silva, 17, Fortaleza I lived on the streets in north-eastern Brazil for two or three years. After my parents got divorced, I went to live with my father. He used to smoke crack, and when I was around 11 I decided to leave his house and live on the [beachside] Beira Mar, near the fish market. We would beg food from the local restaurants and beach kiosks. I made a lot of friends and we’d all look out for each other but it was really dangerous. People would drive by and sometimes shoot kids living on the streets – we never knew if they were bandidos [gangsters] or the police. I lost friends like that. I did drugs every day, marijuana and cocaine, but I never got into crack. You just begged for money and saved up enough to go into the favela and buy drugs. The worst thing was the way people looked at you, unwashed and in dirty clothes. Sometimes they’d call the police. Eventually, my mother’s cousin heard I was on the streets and got in touch with a charity that works with homeless children. [They] persuaded me to go and live at their shelter in the countryside. I stopped doing drugs and went to classes and started taking part in sports events. In 2016 I took part in a mini-Olympics in Rio … I even won medals. But when I got home my friends called me to go train surfing in Fortaleza and I fell off and a train went over my leg. It had to be amputated. But it’s only a leg and I still have my life. Now I am studying and living with my mother again. She is not worried like she used to be when I was on the streets, fearing that I might die at any moment. My dream would be for every child in Brazil to be able to live a dignified life, with protection from violence. Ronalyn Lagata, 20, Manila I grew up in Payatas, one of the poorest areas of Manila. I used to scavenge on the rubbish dump for stuff to sell to support my family. For many families in Payatas, life revolves around the dumpsite. Like a lot of other kids, I would scavenge in the mornings and then go to school in the afternoons. We are 11 siblings and the money we earned from selling things we found in the trash paid for food and school. If the electricity cut out, sometimes the whole family would sleep on the streets because the house was so hot and cramped. It was dangerous because we were always chasing the garbage trucks, and also there were lots of gang fights in the area. I drifted into gangs because my friends were in them. Eventually I was helped by a charity and started to go to their school. They also gave me food so I didn’t have to scavenge. But football opened the doors for me and took me out of the Payatas area. I have a scholarship to study football at university and I coach younger children. Now the dump is closing and I want the kids I am coaching to have an education so they can find other ways to support themselves. Kannados Dasaradhan, 19, Chennai I was six or seven when I ran away from home in Chennai, on the Bay of Bengal in eastern India. I saw a lot of violence at home because my father was an alcoholic and used to beat my mother. If I interfered, I also got a beating. They didn’t really care about us or try to send us to school so I had to get out of that house. In the end I just got on a train without a clue where I was going and stayed on it. I survived by eating leftover food. The people on the train made us clean the floor and toilets and we couldn’t refuse. Eventually I ended up in the railway station. I’d stay there until I was chased off, so I kept moving from place to place. It was a terrifying existence because I never felt secure. I had to steal food and if the shopkeepers caught us they would beat us and sometimes sexually abuse us. If we were caught by police they also abused us, and sometimes pinned cases that they could not solve on us so street kids went to jail for crimes they hadn’t committed. One day, in Chennai, social workers came and started talking to me and took me to the shelter, and I started going to school. Now I coach football and would like to train to become a professional coach. I also rescue other children from the railway station. I set myself a target of rescuing one child a day.

But one thing I did not have was a guaranteed salary. As a result, the pressure to place well in tournaments was overwhelming, taking away from the joy of playing. The best year I had playing professionally, I made close to $45,000. This included tournament earnings, as well as golf outings with corporate sponsors. Then there are the costs to play a full on season on the LPGA – around $60,000, if you’re incredibly tight with your budget. Luckily, I had sponsors who covered most of my expenses, but I was certainly not wealthy. I reflected on this after news broke that former US Open champion Lucas Glover’s wife, Krista, was arrested on domestic violence charges after last weekend’s Players Championship. Allegedly Krista got into an altercation with Glover’s mother after Lucas missed the 54-hole cut at a tournament with the second largest purse of the year. While the reasons behind Krista Glover’s arrest may be more complex than a bad round and a missed payday, it reminded me personally of the pressure I felt as a young pro trying to make it. On tour – apart from a few events such as the Masters – you only make money when you make the cut. One shot can cost you thousands, if not more. Knowing that adds pressure not just to play well so you can pay the bills, but also puts a strain on relationships, including your relationship with yourself. Golf and I always had a rocky relationship, but it became more hostile during my time as a professional. Each shot had a price tag, and any failure on the course led to me berating myself. I would cry after bad rounds and wallow in self-pity, cursing at myself for the shortcomings in my game. With the added anxiety of worrying about how I would pay bills, I was always on edge. As a result, my relationships with friends, family and significant others suffered. I worried that I was letting my parents down after all the sacrifices that they made to help me reach my goal of playing on the LPGA. When they did try to help by showing me golf was literally a game, and that I shouldn’t make it more than that, I would explode. These arguments caused a chasm as it made my parents afraid to say or do anything that could cause emotional upheaval. The anxiety also seeped into my friendships, so much so that I would be too down to see anyone. Finding the emotional energy to invest in others, while worrying whether I would ever amount to anything on the course seemed too taxing. And quite honestly, it was hard for me to see my friends living happy and productive lives with financially stable careers. I envied them. Golf, like other individual sports, is isolating. You don’t have a team or organization to fall back on after a rough game. There’s no safety net, there’s no guaranteed contracts, or anyone else to blame for a loss. It’s all up to you. Studies also show that athletes in non-team sports are more prone to depression. “Individual athletes attribute failure more to themselves than team sports athletes. They take the blame more than team players. On a team there is a diffusion of responsibility ... compared with the performance of an individual athlete,” said Professor Jürgen Beckmann the university chair of sports psychology at Technical University of Munich. So perhaps the question to ask someone who plays an individual sport professionally is: do you have the emotional support you need to deal with the pressure? That question will always be more appreciated than: “Damn! You must be rich!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2018/may/17/alan-jones-tells-defamation-trial-his-comments-were-savage-but-accurate","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T03:00:09Z","webTitle":"Alan Jones tells defamation trial his comments were 'savage' but accurate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/17/alan-jones-tells-defamation-trial-his-comments-were-savage-but-accurate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/17/alan-jones-tells-defamation-trial-his-comments-were-savage-but-accurate","fields":{"headline":"Alan Jones tells defamation trial his comments were 'savage' but accurate","bodyText":"The talkback host Alan Jones has told the Brisbane supreme court he did not put allegations of wrongdoing to the Toowoomba-based Wagner family before he broadcast them because “they would not speak to me”. Jones entered the witness box on Thursday to give evidence in the judge-only defamation trial. The Wagner brothers are suing the outspoken talkback host, Harbour Radio, 4BC and journalist Nick Cater over 32 broadcasts in 2014 and 2015. John, Denis, Neill and Joe Wagner allege they were accused of the deaths of 12 people in the town of Grantham during the 2011 floods, when one of the walls of the Lockyer Valley quarry they owned collapsed. They claim they were also subjected to constant abuse, including accusations of a high-level cover-up with politicians, corruption and intimidation relating to their Wellcamp airport. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Jones raised his voice under cross examination by Tom Blackburn SC, who acts for the Wagner family. Blackburn suggested to Jones he had not sought to put “grave allegations” to the Wagners nor sought a response before broadcasting. Jones said a producer had contacted the Wagner families, through a public relations company, and asked them to appear on his show, but that they had not been confronted with the substance of the allegations. “For goodness sake, I’ve got a lot to do in a day, I won’t waste time making phone calls to people who say ‘you are blackballed, I won’t speak to you’,” Jones said. Jones said his criticisms of the Wagner family were “savage” but were accurate and justified. Jones spent most of the morning giving evidence by retelling emotional stories about many of the people who died at Grantham. He was asked several times by justice Peter Flanagan to return his evidence to the point of the questions. At one point Jones paused and appeared to choke back tears speaking about a mother who lost her grip on her one-year-old daughter when the wall of water gushed through the town. “One of the reasons I have tried to continue to get answers ... is that these people have no answers,” he said. The radio broadcaster said he had contact with two people from the region in the days following the tragedy. Jones said he then put a call out on-air to people who might have similar stories. “There was a whole heap of people who got in touch with me,” he said. Jones gave evidence they all said the same thing: the wall – or bund – around the quarry was man-made. “The Wagners kept on saying there was no bund ... whereas every eyewitness gave evidence that they’d seen this bund going up and up and up,” he told the court. Jones said he became a “pivotal point” for people in the area who did not feel they were being heard. “The one thing that hurt the most was that they weren’t believed,” he said. When asked by his barrister, Robert Anderson QC, if the comments he made about the family on air were “opinions honestly held” by him, Jones said they were.

She asked if everything was OK. “There are a few difficulties at home,” Cynda said. Cynda’s home was her husband, Peter, who was looking for work, and her adult daughter, Katrina, who’d brought her four children back home to live with her parents when her relationship ended. Cynda’s neighbour didn’t push her for details; Cynda did not volunteer them. Days passed, and then the town heard the news – it wasn’t kangaroos that caused a racket at 5am as the locals had presumed, but gunshots. Cynda, Katrina, the four kids and Peter Miles were dead at their family home, the children slaughtered in their beds. It’s the worst mass shooting in Australia since Port Arthur in 1996. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday Peter Miles was found at the scene “slumped in a chair on his verandah ... a rifle rested between his legs”. Investigators are not looking for any other suspects. Reports of the far-away murders broke over my own phone, and I sobbed. The handful of personal details revealed about this family are enough to imagine anyone similar into their unbearable horror. The mind demands: who does this to kids? Who does this to anyone? The answer, according to Australian reporting tradition, is a “good bloke”. This was the description a tabloid applied to the alleged murderer, under the headline “Grandad the killer.” It’s a dangerous frame for reporting domestic homicide we have grown too used to in this country; commentators were quick to call it out. Juanita Phillips remarked that “nobody in the story” had “actually described (Peter Miles) that way”. Reminders came from Georgina Dent and Clementine Ford that the “good bloke” trope is a media habit. It was used to describe wife-murdering Greg Floyd in 2017, and, in 2014, Geoff Hunt – who murdered his wife and three children. Yet, a local journalist covering these events, Robert Ovadia, denounced Dent and Ford as an “Outrage Brigade” in The West Australian. “Nobody is legitimising his actions,” Ovadia wrote of Peter Miles, but he “had a past ... why should we be afraid to report of what people thought of him before?” There’s a single reason and it’s anything but outrageous: prevention. Whatever may have transpired in Margaret River that morning, the narrative of the “good bloke” who “snaps” and kills his family is myth, whether it’s “what people thought of him” or not. And maintaining it as a frame for news reporting provides external validation to potential murderers that their inclinations towards violence are not unconscionable. Indeed, “good bloke” memorialising around suspected killers instructs that you can both murder your family and retain your reputation. We know it provides powerful affirmation, because we know that men who murder their female partners “continue to blame the deceased women after the killing”, “express a lack of remorse or empathy with the victim” and even see themselves as “victims who had been wronged”. We also know that what domestic murderers have mostly in common isn’t the “heartache” that’s been speculated within Peter Miles. It isn’t tragic childhoods, substance abuse problems, persistent criminal behaviour or mental illness, either. What perpetrators overwhelmingly share is the use of violence to enforce rigid stereotypes about gender roles where “being dominant in their relationships with women was central to their sense of manliness”. These men feel “belittled” by a partner’s desire to leave, because their understanding of masculinity is rooted in maintaining a unique power differential against women. We know “homicide is often triggered by a loss of control over the victim”. The intent to control a female partner informs many cases in which men murder their children. We know these things not because we view them through “a kaleidoscope of causes”, but because armies of international researchers have spent years analysing the conditions that foster the violence, unpicking the social fictions of this criminality with study and data. It’s not to suit an agenda. It’s to keep women and children alive. Canadian research discovered that 82.9% of these murders are not “snap” actions, but show elements of planning. A 10-year study in New South Wales that revealed 97% of women killed by their intimate partners “had been the victim of domestic violence during the relationship”. The pattern does not suggest tragic, personalised failure. It illustrates a syndrome in which masculinity, misconceived, asserts itself by scheming to destroy what it fails to control. This brutal reality is what the myths obscure. And it’s this evidence-based framework that must foreground the way we analyse incidents of violence if we as a community are to attune to the nuances of its established patterns, intervene and prevent it. Australia’s police process 657 incidents of family violence every day. One woman in Australia is murdered by her current or former partner every week. We do not owe sympathy to perpetrators. We owe it to the abused, dead and living, to condemn their suffering without equivocation. When we personalise tender excuses for male violence, we don’t, actually, minimise the hateful horrors that curdle beneath it. We do, alas, encourage them.

On Thursday an inquiry examining section 44 of the constitution warned that, without a referendum, elections could be subject to “manipulation” by challenges against candidates with dual citizenship or other disqualifications. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Despite the electoral matters committee’s bipartisan push for a referendum to reform or repeal section 44 of the constitution, the special minister of state, Mathias Cormann, confirmed that the government was “not inclined to pursue a referendum”. Instead the government will pursue steps “to minimise the risk of a recurrence of the eligibility issues” that have plagued the 45th parliament, in which 14 parliamentarians have resigned or been ruled ineligible since mid-2017 owing to dual citizenship. The government set up the inquiry into section 44 by the joint standing committee on electoral matters after the high court ruled five senators and MPs ineligible in October. In a bipartisan report released on Thursday, the committee recommended the government prepare a referendum question to either repeal all the disqualifications for standing for parliament in section 44 or to give parliament the power to set the disqualifications itself. But the committee acknowledged a referendum “will not be positively received by Australians and the outcome ... is uncertain”. It accepted the “preconditions for a successful referendum on this issue will take time” and cannot be achieved before the “Super Saturday” byelections triggered by the high court’s ruling against Katy Gallagher or before the next federal election. The committee suggested a series of measures to “mitigate the impact of section 44” including: a requirement that all candidates reveal their family citizenship history at the time of nomination and information relevant to other disqualifications; an “online self-assessment tool” to be developed by the Australian Electoral Commission; improved education for minor parties and independents; and exploring expedited citizenship renunciation processes with foreign governments. At a press conference in Brisbane Malcolm Turnbull said the government did not have time to deal with a referendum before the next election and the Australian people “expect us to deal with the constitution as it stands”. Even in the longer term, the prime minister said he “very much doubted” whether Australians would support a change to the constitution. Cormann said the government would instead “move to improve the existing candidate nomination process for elections”. In November the government introduced a new citizenship register requiring current and future parliamentarians to reveal their birthplace, that of their parents and grandparents and to produce documents showing renunciation of foreign citizenship 21 days after their election. Cormann announced those requirements would now be applied to “candidates for election to the Australian parliament” who will provide the information to the AEC “as well as information on other potential disqualifications under section 44 of the constitution”. This is likely to require disclosure of criminal convictions, bankruptcies and interests in contracts with the government. The committee warned that section 44 opened the electoral system to “the risk of manipulation, where a successful candidate could have their election challenged on the basis of preference flows from an ineligible candidate”. “This raises the possibility of deliberate manipulation of disqualification rules to overturn an otherwise valid election,” it said. The committee noted that when all the disqualifications in section 44 are considered – including foreign citizenship, employment in the public service and an “indirect pecuniary interest in an agreement with the commonwealth” – more than 50% of the Australian population is ineligible to run for parliament. The report argued that the ban on dual citizens caused numerous problems, including uncertainty for parliamentarians who were unsure of the citizenship of their parents or grandparents, and the possibility that foreign governments could manipulate eligibility by not processing renunciation in a timely manner. “Challenges to sitting members will continue into future elections; disrupting electoral outcomes, causing uncertainty and confusion, and having the potential to undermine the authority of both federal parliament and the constitution itself.” Despite those dire warnings the chair of the electoral committee, the Liberal senator Linda Reynolds, told Guardian Australia she was “not [so] pessimistic” to suggest it will take further disqualifications to convince Australians of the need for a referendum. “We need to start a conversation about whether the rules are the right ones for today’s society,” she said. Reynolds cited the fact that public servants have to give up their jobs to run for parliament, and the citizenship requirements favour “Australians with a long-term unbroken family history” and those who can afford legal advice to remove disqualifications."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/18/climate-change-an-existential-security-risk-to-australia-senate-inquiry-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T18:00:36Z","webTitle":"Climate change an 'existential security risk' to Australia, Senate inquiry says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/18/climate-change-an-existential-security-risk-to-australia-senate-inquiry-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/18/climate-change-an-existential-security-risk-to-australia-senate-inquiry-says","fields":{"headline":"Climate change an 'existential security risk' to Australia, Senate inquiry says","bodyText":"Climate change is a “current and existential national security risk” to Australia, a Senate inquiry has told parliament, one that could inflame regional conflicts over food, water and land, and even imperil life on Earth. The Senate committee inquiry into the implications of climate change for Australia’s national security recommended an increase in foreign aid to be dedicated to climate change mitigation and adaptation in the region, as well as a government white paper on climate security, Department of Defence emissions targets and a dedicated climate security post within the Department of Home Affairs. The inquiry, which released its report on Thursday afternoon, heard that the security risk of climate change was not a possible future threat but one that endangers Australia and its region now. The Asia-Pacific was the region “most vulnerable” to the security and humanitarian impacts of climate change, the committee heard, and faced an “existential threat”. An existential threat was defined as “one that threatens the premature extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life or the permanent and drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future development”. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The committee report said climate change threatened Australians’ health, and the viability of communities, businesses and the economy. Climate change was heightening the severity of natural hazards, increasing the spread of infectious diseases and increasing water insecurity, and threatening agriculture. Sherri Goodman, a former US deputy undersecretary of defence in the Clinton administration and founder of the CNA Military Advisory Board, told the committee climate change was a “threat multiplier”, exacerbating existing conflicts over water and other resources, and that it posed “a direct threat to the national security of Australia”. “The problem also is not a distant one in the future but it’s now. We are experiencing this in regular sunny-day flooding at military bases in the United States and in changes in the Arctic, forcing the first wave of displaced persons from villages in the Arctic.” The Climate Council told the committee climate change was “already contributing to increases in the forced migration of people within and between nations, as well as playing a role in heightening social and political tensions, flowing onto conflict and violence”. The Australian government has recognised the security implications posed by climate change. Its seventh national communication on climate change to the United Nations in December highlighted that Australia was “already experiencing the impacts of a changing climate, particularly changes associated with increases in temperature, the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events, extreme fire weather and drought”. It noted “communities in the Torres Strait are already being impacted by rising sea levels and many of the region’s coral reefs have been severely impacted by increased sea surface temperatures”. And the Department of Defence agreed climate change had the potential to worsen existing conflicts. “When climate impacts are combined with ethnic or other social grievances, they can contribute to increased migration, internal instability or intrastate insurgencies, often over greater competition for natural resources. These developments may foster terrorism or cross-border conflict.” The Senate committee heard that acute climate disruption – in particular long-running and severe droughts – exacerbated conflicts in Mali and Syria, contributing to the destabilisation of fragile states. In Australia’s region, the Australian Council for International Development said: “For Pacific nations such as Tuvalu, Kiribati and Micronesia, climate change is already a genuine existential threat with the capacity to diminish their livelihoods and even erase their states’ territorial footprints.” The Senate committee noted Australia does not have an overarching climate security strategy. Research Director for Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration David Spratt said there was a disconnect between the evidence presented to the inquiry and the recommendations that emerged from it. “Existential risk management requires brutally honest articulation of the risks, opportunities and the response time frame. At the moment we are knowingly locking in an existential disaster without being prepared to articulate that fact … at least this Senate inquiry report is significant for having broken the ice, but it should be so much more.” Greens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson said the defence personnel who appeared before the committee “engaged deeply with climate change science and were in no doubt that a warming world is a more dangerous world”. “What this inquiry has brought home to me is that when people choose to engage with the climate science, without any partisan or ideological blinkers, they quickly understand the seriousness of the challenge and decide to act. We have seen that the Australian Defence Force is changing how it does things because it is taking climate change seriously, but we have a government that is doing nothing to reduce emissions to actually reduce the threat of climate change itself.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/17/new-zealand-finance-minister-in-pre-budget-food-fight-after-opting-for-cheese-roll","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T01:24:58Z","webTitle":"New Zealand finance minister in pre-budget food fight after opting to eat cheese roll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/17/new-zealand-finance-minister-in-pre-budget-food-fight-after-opting-for-cheese-roll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/17/new-zealand-finance-minister-in-pre-budget-food-fight-after-opting-for-cheese-roll","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand finance minister in pre-budget food fight after opting to eat cheese roll","bodyText":"New Zealand’s Labour party is about to reveal its first budget in nearly a decade after last year’s sensational election result but the big news to start the day was: what would the finance minister eat before his speech? Cue the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, with one of her informal but popular Facebook Live videos. Via a greasy iPhone lens, she introduces the finance minister, Grant Robertson, about to tuck into a cheese roll, a gooey cheese mixture melted in a slice of white bread. Scandal? Not so much but it does break with a longstanding tradition of eating a pie instead. Eating a “budget snack” became a tradition under the previous long-serving National government, with finance minister Bill English always going for a pie. This year, Robertson has chosen to snack on cheese rolls, in a nod to his South Island roots. Cheese rolls are a regional dish from the far south, and the cheese mixture grilled into rolled white bread also often features mustard powder, canned cream, dried onion soup mix and red onion. “There’s always this odd tradition of people asking what you eat before the budget,” says Ardern to Robertson in the Facebook video. “I don’t know where that originated from.” “I am not sure either,” says Robertson, smiling as he gestured with his chosen meal. “I think Bill English used to eat a pie, and I think we concluded that I eat too many pies already so we had to come up with a different snack and in a nod to my southern roots: cheese rolls, excellent cheese rolls.” “They are excellent cheese rolls,” agrees Ardern, who is a month away from expecting her first child. “The only thing I am disappointed in is that they weren’t bought here by your mum,” she adds, who later pans around to include the finance minister’s mother in the background. National party supporters tweeted that they would still be eating pies. New Zealanders reacted with amusement to Robertson’s shake-up of the budget snack, though some suggested the choice – sometimes referred to as “southern sushi” – could be healthier. “Did Mr Robertson pay for the cheese rolls? Or the taxpayers?” asked one commenter on Facebook. Another said: “I hope you put enough of those in the budget for everyone Grant.” Other New Zealand traditions on budget day include what tie the finance minister chooses, and getting a haircut before the announcement. Robertson said he had a haircut last week because he didn’t like the fresh haircut look, and the prime minister had given him a tie for budget 2018. “I have gifted Grant a tie to try and release some of the stress of picking a tie on budget day,” said Ardern. “So all judgment on the tie lies squarely with me.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/may/17/british-government-accused-of-funding-human-rights-abuses-in-bahrain-torture-executions","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T12:32:05Z","webTitle":"British government accused of funding human rights abuses in Bahrain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/may/17/british-government-accused-of-funding-human-rights-abuses-in-bahrain-torture-executions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/may/17/british-government-accused-of-funding-human-rights-abuses-in-bahrain-torture-executions","fields":{"headline":"British government accused of funding human rights abuses in Bahrain","bodyText":"Human rights group Reprieve has accused the Foreign Office of being complicit in abuses in Bahrain and failing to be transparent about its £5m security and justice reform programme in the kingdom. Between 2012 and 2017, funding for the programme was largely drawn from the controversial conflict, security and stability fund, a cross-government reserve that supports global security and peace building in conflict zones, according to freedom of information requests. The fund has a budget of £1.2bn a year, split between overseas development assistance, which counts towards Britain’s 0.7% aid target, and other funding. It was set up under the auspices of key government departments, including the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office, and its priorities are dictated by the national security council. The CSSF was recently criticised by the UK aid watchdog for serious shortcomings in the way it operates. It was found to have been insufficiently rigorous in applying safeguards to prevent collaboration with foreign entities with suspect human rights records. In its report, Reprieve said that despite the training of prison officers, police and other officials by British companies in the kingdom since the Arab spring, the number of inmates on death row has tripled, torture in detention has continued, and executions have resumed for the first time since 2010. Three men, Sami Mushaima, 42, Ali al-Singace, 21, and Abbas al-Sameea, 27, were executed in January last year, despite alleging torture and forced confessions, according to Human Rights Watch. Reprieve, said that, by providing training to groups that later backed the executions of dissidents – and because of its failure adequately to investigate torture allegations – the British government was complicit in human rights abuses in Bahrain. The report was co-authored by Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy. The report comes after an aid watchdog criticised the conflict, security and stability fund (CSSF) recently for serious shortcomings in the way it operates, including that it had been insufficiently rigorous in applying safeguards to prevent collaboration with foreign entities with suspect human rights records. Maya Foa, director of Reprieve, called on Britain to require Bahrain to take basic anti-torture steps as a condition of further assistance, and to be more transparent about funding. She said: “A global Britain should be proudly promoting human rights and the rule of law, not undermining them in secret. “The only way for the British public to be confident their money is not leading to abuses abroad is for the government to publish a full and transparent account of projects we are funding and the human rights assessments for each.” Between 2016 and 2017, the FCO spent £1.5m on British expertise to reform Bahrain’s security and justice system, through the CSSF. However, this year, the UK’s contribution to the project will come from two new sources, the Global Britain Fund and the Integrated Activity Fund, which Reprieve say is more opaque. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We regularly raise concerns on specific issues at a senior level with the government of Bahrain, but it is not good enough just to criticise countries from the sidelines. Only by working with Bahrain can we bring about the changes we would like to see in the country.” The spokesman welcomed a recent decision by Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, the king of Bahrain, to commute four death sentences."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/16/katie-ledecky-world-record-pro-series-indianapolis","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T22:53:18Z","webTitle":"Katie Ledecky smashes first world record since Rio in dream pro debut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/16/katie-ledecky-world-record-pro-series-indianapolis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/16/katie-ledecky-world-record-pro-series-indianapolis","fields":{"headline":"Katie Ledecky smashes first world record since Rio in dream pro debut","bodyText":"Katie Ledecky broke her first world record since the Rio Olympics on Wednesday in her professional debut at a Pro Series meet in Indianapolis.

The American emerged as a global star at the 2016 Olympics, completing the first 200-400-800 freestyle treble in 48 years and anchoring the winning 4x200m free relay. Her four gold medals and one silver represented the most successful showing by an American woman in Olympic history, while her jaw-dropping victory in the 800m by 11.38 seconds remains one of the most indelible images of the Rio Games. Afterward she enrolled at Stanford and led the Cardinal to back-to-back national championships while setting a dozen NCAA records, but Wednesday’s performance ended her longest drought between world records since 2013, when she set the first of her 14 marks. Ledecky is no newcomer to the Pro Swim Series after winning last year’s overall points title, but her amateur status had previously kept her from collecting prize money, or cashing in on endorsement opportunities, due to NCAA eligibility rules."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/17/uk-sport-health-check-hockey","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T09:00:25Z","webTitle":"UK Sport’s report suggests penny is dropping that kindness costs little | Sean Ingle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/17/uk-sport-health-check-hockey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/17/uk-sport-health-check-hockey","fields":{"headline":"UK Sport’s report suggests penny is dropping that kindness costs little","bodyText":"“The truth will be uncovered,” promised Dame Katherine Grainger as she revealed UK Sport’s first culture health check. “Whether it is good, bad, or ugly.” The good? The report found that 90% of British athletes are proud to be on the world class programme. The bad? Thirty-one per cent of athletes have witnessed or experienced unacceptable behaviour. And the ugly? Eighteen per cent of athletes feel there are no consequences when people behave inappropriately. The sincerity of Grainger, who took over as chair of UK Sport last year, was obvious and her pledge to lance any lingering pus in the system welcome. But one question hung uneasily in the air: why had it taken so long to confront the ghost in the machine? Remember, after British Cycling’s festering culture of fear was exposed over two years ago, UK Sport insisted it was an isolated case. Then the media revealed similar problems in bobsleigh. And gymnastics. And equestrian. And para-swimming. UK Sport has always vigorously denied that its single-minded pursuit of medals has trumped all over concerns. But it has conducted athlete surveys since 2009, and regularly sent performance advisors scurrying into sports to check up on them. Perhaps there was too much waving of pom-poms, and not enough dispassionate detective work to find and root out some of the problems. As Chelsea Warr, UK Sport’s venerable director of performance, admitted at one point: “We weren’t asking enough robust questions to get an accurate perspective of the experiences of athletes.” Warr insisted that commissioning such as report was “brave and risky – but the right thing to do”. Whatever her organisation’s past faults, that much is certainly true. How many workplaces would come up smelling of roses if subjected to similarly close scrutiny? Pointedly, James Bell, the psychologist behind the report, informed the media that a National Union of Journalists survey had highlighted far worse results for their industry. A second intriguing discovery was that the IY generation of British athletes – those born after 1990 – want to be dealt with differently. As Warr explained: “They want to be spoken to a different way and to be given more feedback. Not only did they want to be part of the process, they wanted to be part of the solution.” That, inevitably, led to questions about whether a softly, softly approach might lead to Britain losing its cutting edge. However, Grainger insisted that it costs little to be kind. “All the coaches in high performance still want to perform and achieve results,” she maintained. “You can have a hard and challenging environment that is still very respectful and safe.” That is something Danny Kerry, the head coach of Britain’s gold-medal winning women’s hockey team in Rio in 2016, knows better than most. As he admitted on Wednesday, he was once an old-fashioned coach, “cold and hard”, and concerned more with tactics than putting an arm round the shoulder. “But as a result I disgruntled a lot of athletes.” British hockey is now widely considered to have one of the best cultures in the UK Sport system, after Kerry understood that he had to develop softer skills. He told the story of how he had been sat down after the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and being given the athlete debrief. “And it pretty much said that while ‘tactically and technically’ I had got it bang on, they hated me and thought I was grumpy and unapproachable,” he said. “Personally I was in a pretty dark place for a long time. But my partner told me: ‘You are not that person – but the way you are coaching makes them think you are.’ [She] told me to make the shift and, slowly, I learned.” Even Jürgen Gröbler, grizzled coach of British rowing’s men, admitted his approach was changing. “I want the athletes to be well looked after and we’re not just using them to win medals and then putting them in the bin,” he insisted. “I cannot stress that enough.” It will take time for others to complete the same journey. But UK Sport insists that, by introducing better whistleblowing procedures and giving action plans to all sports, things will improve. Meanwhile the British Athletes Commission will get over £1m in order to help respond to athlete complaints. On the surface it sounded like a positive step in the right direction. Some, though, will wonder whether UK Sport’s relentless drive for even more medals at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics will put more pressure on funded sports to deliver outcomes – leading some to fall into bad habits again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/16/julian-assange-operation-hotel-rafael-correa-ecuador-responds","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T22:47:47Z","webTitle":"Ecuador's former president defends spy operation to protect Julian Assange","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/16/julian-assange-operation-hotel-rafael-correa-ecuador-responds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/16/julian-assange-operation-hotel-rafael-correa-ecuador-responds","fields":{"headline":"Ecuador's former president defends spy operation to protect Julian Assange","bodyText":"The former president of Ecuador Rafael Correa has defended a multi-million dollar spy operation to protect Julian Assange in the country’s London embassy after an investigation by the Guardian revealed that his government had employed an international security company and undercover agents during much of the Australian’s six-year stay. Correa, who was president of Ecuador between 2007 and 2017, called the Guardian’s “Operation Hotel” story “sensationalistic” and said the embassy security measures were “routine and modest” in an interview with the Intercept . “When we have special security, we hire private security firms to provide it. There is nothing unusual about this. It would have been a violation of our duties if we did not,” he told the website. Correa, who now lives in his wife’s home country of Belgium, claimed Ecuador’s current government was not allowing the WikiLeaks founder to receive visitors, a move he criticised, describing it as a form of “torture” and a violation of the country’s duty to protect Assange’s wellbeing and safety. The Guardian contacted Correa by email prior the publication of the Operation Hotel article but received no response. An adviser to the ex-president said he had not been authorised to “forward” Correa’s responses but confirmed the former leader had received the questions. In his interview with the Intercept, Correa said that did not see the email until after the story was published. The adviser confirmed that the Operation Hotel security operation to protect Assange cost around $60,000 monthly, a similar figure to $66,000 calculated by the Guardian in an investigation with Focus Ecuador. Most of Ecuador’s main newspapers and broadcasters have published stories following up the Guardian’s investigation, which prompted intense debate on social media about the public spending on Julian Assange’s extended stay in the country’s London embassy. The government of Correa’s successor, Lenín Moreno, has made no public comment on the article. But the British ambassador in Ecuador, Katherine Ward, told local journalists that Assange had broken the law and was “more or less a fugitive from justice”. Speaking at a public forum at a university in Quito, she added Assange prevented the UK from “honouring an extradition request from Sweden”. “There’s accumulated indignation about the Assange case,” said Jorge Ortiz, an analyst of international affairs in Quito. “Six years have passed and the people don’t understand why the government has given refuge to Mr Assange,” he said. “Correa handled public funds as if they were his to do with as he pleased. There should be an investigation into these completely unjustified costs.” Last month, prosecutors in Quito opened an investigation into Correa and 10 former officials for alleged mismanagement of public debt during the last five years of his government."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/17/morning-mail-europe-takes-on-trump-ecuadors-assange-headache-life-on-the-breadline","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T20:54:33Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: European council president condemns 'capricious' Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/17/morning-mail-europe-takes-on-trump-ecuadors-assange-headache-life-on-the-breadline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/17/morning-mail-europe-takes-on-trump-ecuadors-assange-headache-life-on-the-breadline","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: European council president condemns 'capricious' Trump","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 17 May. Top stories The threat posed by Donald Trump’s administration has been likened to that of China and Russia by the European council president, Donald Tusk, as he condemned the US’s withdrawal from the Iran deal and the rising threat of a transatlantic trade war. Tusk offered a withering commentary on the chaotic US administration, saying: “We are witnessing today a new phenomenon: the capricious assertiveness of the American administration. Looking at the latest decisions of President Trump, some could even think, ‘With friends like that, who needs enemies?’” Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It was clear, Tusk suggested, that Washington could no longer be relied upon. He called on other European leaders to unite behind the tough line taken by the UK, France and Germany – Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel have resolved to stick with the joint comprehensive plan of action with Iran, despite the threats of US sanctions against European businesses. Julian Assange’s intervention on Catalan independence created a rift between the WikiLeaks founder and the Ecuadorian government, which has hosted Assange for nearly six years in its London embassy, the Guardian has learned. Anonymous sources said Assange’s support for the Catalan separatists led to a backlash from Spain, which in turn angered Ecuador’s government, who responded by cutting Assange’s internet access in March for breaching an agreement not to interfere with other states. Ecuador has been looking to find a solution to what it increasingly sees as an untenable situation: hosting one of the world’s most wanted men. A “lack of interest” in running for office has delayed the Liberal preselection in the Longman byelection, with party insiders shocked such a “winnable, potentially long-term seat” has attracted so few candidates. Meanwhile, Labor is positioning itself to ruin the Liberals’ chances of taking Mayo from the crossbencher Rebekha Sharkie, with plans to run a candidate in the conservative South Australian seat to boost Sharkie’s vote through preferences, a move that will be bolstered by the Greens. The shadow environment minister, Tony Burke, has declared that Labor is not afraid to change the law as 371 local branches endorse a motion calling on the ALP to set up an independent agency responsible for proactive environmental protection. A grassroots campaign leading up to Labor’s national conference in July spearheaded by the activist group the Labor Environment Action Network is building support from rank-and-file members for the creation of a federal environmental protection agency, a regulator that could be the decision maker for approvals rather than the environment minister. Water shortages are likely to be the key environmental challenge of this century, scientists from Nasa have warned, as a groundbreaking study reveals a drying-out of swaths of the globe between the tropics and the high latitudes. Nineteen areas have been identified where water depletion has been dramatic. Australia is among the global hotspots where overuse of resources has caused a serious decline. “What we are witnessing is major hydrologic change,” said James Famiglietti, of the Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. Sport Heather Reid was the chief executive of the ACT football federation for 12 years and the first woman to lead an Australian state football association. At the time, Australian football had 11% women at state and territory leadership levels – one position out of nine. “I don’t like people talking about percentages of gendered representation,” she says. “I like to know the real numbers because they tell the true story.” Today is International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, and for the Australian rules footballer Hannah Mouncey, it offers a good chance to reflect on what the past six months have taught her. Thinking time “Writing about being on Centrelink payments is a frightening prospect,” says Nijole Naujoka in the first piece of a new Guardian Australia series in which we invite brave new writers to share the day-to-day challenges of living on the breadline. “I am very aware of the possible judgment and backlash I may get.” That fear of judgment is the theme of Naujoka’s first reflection on living on welfare in Australia. “Since last week’s budget the treasurer, Scott Morrison, has been telling voters his $140bn income tax plan ‘deals with’ bracket creep,” writes Gareth Hutchens. “It doesn’t. It’s a proposed attempt to provide a temporary solution to the problem, not a permanent one.” Guardian Australia’s politics and economics correspondent argues that “the government could eradicate bracket creep if it wanted to, but it doesn’t. Neither does Labor. Both major parties have exploited it for decades and they don’t intend to stop. Why?” The life coach and bestselling self-help writer Jen Sincero says she can make you a badass – but has it worked for her millions of readers, or is it just a modern twist on positive thinking? Sincero’s You Are a Badass is a bestseller in the US and is making waves in the UK, but her brand of straight-talking tough love aimed at helping you escape your “sucky life” and get rich can rub those in the psychology and wellbeing fields the wrong way. What’s he done now? Donald Trump has acknowledged for the first time that he made a payment of $100,000 to his lawyer Michael Cohen in 2016 – a payment that is understood to have been passed on to the porn star Stormy Daniels as hush money for staying quiet about her liaison with Trump. The information was contained in financial statements submitted by the president to the US Office of Government Ethics, CNN reports. Media roundup The information officer in the new home affairs super ministry ordered staff to delete information relating to a freedom of information request when he was employed at the NSW Transport Agency, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Police in Tasmania say vulnerable, low-level drug addicts are being used and abused by bikie gangs, and are forced to commit crimes and sex acts to repay drug debts, according to the Hobart Mercury.

The top of Christopher Wren’s tallest spire came crashing down - losing the top 2.5 metres (8 ft) of its total 71-metre (234 ft) height. George III, who had an interest in scientific matters, wrote to Benjamin Franklin in America for advice. Franklin, a decade earlier, had invented the lightning conductor after working out that lightning was electricity. The King was advised that a metal rod fastened to the highest point of St Bride’s spire and attached to a thick band of metal would lead the electric charge from any future strikes safely to the ground without harming the building. But there was a dispute between the two men that became a political issue. Franklin favoured a pointed lightning conductor and the King, with advice from the Royal Society, thought a blunt tip would be best. In fact he ordered a cannon ball to top all conductors used anywhere in the British Empire. For the next 250 years American conductors were pointed and British ones blunt until experiments this century finally proved that blunt versions were better at attracting lightning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/16/england-captain-owen-farrell-south-africa-tour-saracens","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T21:00:10Z","webTitle":"Owen Farrell ready for England’s ‘brilliant tour’ to South Africa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/16/england-captain-owen-farrell-south-africa-tour-saracens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/16/england-captain-owen-farrell-south-africa-tour-saracens","fields":{"headline":"Owen Farrell ready for England’s ‘brilliant tour’ to South Africa","bodyText":"Owen Farrell is relishing the prospect of England’s summer trip to South Africa. The tour captain took time out of Saracens’ preparations for Saturday’s Premiership play-off against Wasps to speak for the first time since his appointment. “South Africa is a brilliant tour, a brilliant challenge,” he said of the land that hosted his first England trip, in 2012. “This tour is one we’re going to enjoy. They are a good team that is under new coaching, so we probably don’t know what we’re going to get. The key is to be ready for anything.” Farrell has captained England before but this will be the first time he has led a camp. The appointment seems a natural one. It is not hard to imagine it becoming permanent. Nevertheless, he inherits an unfamiliar run of three consecutive defeats, while Eddie Jones muses, as he did last week, on the lack of unity he sensed developing in England’s disappointing Six Nations campaign. It falls to Farrell to lend new direction, should that be required. Jones rang to tell him of the “massive honour” but they appear not to have discussed the coach’s other concerns. “Lack of unity?” said Farrell, when asked to consider Jones’s assessment of England’s Six Nations, and he paused for a few seconds to gather his thoughts. “I’ll have to see what is being talked about. I can’t really say. I could sit here talking about England but I haven’t thought about it too much yet. I don’t want to start just blabbing. I’ve been concentrating, especially this week, on what’s in front of us.” If England are searching for a way out of the sudden slump they find themselves in, after prolonged and unparalleled success, they could do worse than study the example set by Saracens this season. Their run of seven consecutive defeats in all competitions, either side of Christmas, did not appear to trouble them. They finished the regular season having scored more points than any club since 1999, when the Premiership was a 14-team affair, and with the best points differential ever. “I thought it was a brilliant period for us. We would be a lot worse off if we hadn’t had it,” said Farrell of the seven consecutive defeats. “ It was a bit unfamiliar but we did a lot of figuring out. We have definitely come out the other side the better for it.” England will hope to apply a similar aptitude for problem solving on the tour to South Africa this summer. Farrell may not be thinking about this one just yet, but the puzzles requiring his attention are set to continue well after the end of May. Meanwhile, three men have been fined after they hurled foul-mouthed abuse at Jones the day after Scotland’s Calcutta Cup win in February. Footage released online showed the group approaching the 58-year-old for a photograph as he left Manchester Oxford Road railway station to catch a waiting car. Richie Cleeton, 22, Connor Inglis, 25, and Brett Grant, 23, from Edinburgh, all pleaded guilty to a public order offence of using threatening abusive words and behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress. Sentencing the trio at Manchester magistrates’ court, chair of the bench Joe Bangudu said: “This was a short-lived but disgraceful incident. Your language, although described by your defence as industrial, we think was vile and therefore unacceptable directed to anybody. The location where you chose to display your drunken behaviour was in a public vicinity, with not just Mr Jones in that proximity. “No one should ever have to put up with such language and behaviour. We have not seen any sort of remorse by you. That is a concern.” Cleeton, of Carrick Knowe Avenue, was fined £120, Inglis, of Cornhill Terrace, received a fine of £105 and Grant, of Drum Crescent, was given a financial penalty of £140. All three were also ordered to pay court costs of £115 each. Mr Bangudu said Grant had prolonged the behaviour and language by opening the car door once Mr Jones was inside."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/16/home-office-grants-visa-to-student-in-u-turn-after-distressing-home-visit","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T17:57:14Z","webTitle":"Home Office grants visa to student in U-turn after 'distressing' visit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/16/home-office-grants-visa-to-student-in-u-turn-after-distressing-home-visit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/16/home-office-grants-visa-to-student-in-u-turn-after-distressing-home-visit","fields":{"headline":"Home Office grants visa to student in U-turn after 'distressing' visit","bodyText":"In an unexpected U-turn, the Home Office has granted a visa to a woman it had previously classified as an immigration offender, just 24 hours after video footage of a distressing dawn raid on her home was published by the Guardian. Zixuan Qu, 29, who submitted an application to extend her student visa over four years ago, has been granted leave to remain in the UK for a further five years. For the past four years, the Home Office has been sitting on her application, and has held her passport, preventing her from going back to China to visit her grandparents, who brought her up. She was forced to cancel her wedding because she was unable to register the marriage without a passport. An immigration enforcement team of about six officers visited the home Qu shares with her fiance Duncan Watkinson, 37, at 5.30am on 1 May. Immigration staff told Qu she had “no leave to remain in the UK” and that she had been classified as an “immigration offender”. Qu and Watkinson were surprised to have been visited by immigration officers because they believed they were in the process of finalising Qu’s protracted attempts to extend her student visa. They had already paid over £2,000 for the Home Office “One Day Premium” visa processing service appointment. After 25 minutes in the couple’s home the officers realised that this appointment was pending, acknowledged a mistake had been made, and left the flat, leaving Qu terrified and Watkinson in tears. Qu said she was extremely relieved at the news that her visa had been granted, but expressed incredulity that an application which had been pending for such a long time had been resolved so swiftly. “I immediately called my grandparents in China. The first thing that I’m going to do is book my flight to visit them. They were crying,” Qu said. She said both she and her fiance were in tears in the cafe of Lunar House immigration headquarters in Croydon after receiving the news. The couple said they plan now to reschedule the wedding they were forced to cancel last September. “I felt utter relief and disbelief, mixed ever so slightly with a sense of guilt that there are other so many cases like us still waiting for an answer. We could see other cases there in the waiting room,” Watkinson said. He wondered if the media exposure of the dawn immigration enforcement action had contributed to the speed with which the visa was granted. “I would like to think they would have made the same decisions without the video; we have met all the requirements, but we don’t know,” he said. The immigration adviser, whom they paid to assist them, said it was unusual for a case to be pushed through on one day. Qu said there was no apology for the distressing immigration enforcement action nor any apology for the four-year delay, during which time she has not been allowed to work or study. “I am just really relieved. I’m not an angry person. It could have been done four years ago. It took four years of my life, my money … I couldn’t work; I couldn’t go home to visit my family … but today I just feel happy,” she said. Watkinson said he was angry that the politicians who designed the immigration policies “never see people at Lunar House; it’s not on their radar”. “All these hostile immigration policies, they come from the top. The workers in Lunar House, they have to deal with the human element, they’re the people who have to mop up the mess,” he said. “Why were we put through all this, if this is the end result? There is still that anger – the entire policy, the entire system is broken.” On Tuesday, the Home Office said Qu had overstayed her visa since January 2014, and had been served with a number of removal notices, the last in January 2018. Qu said she had never received a removal notice. A Home Office spokesperson said on Wednesday: “We are pleased to confirm that we met with Ms Qu this morning and she has been granted leave to remain.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/16/man-faces-trial-death-threats-pro-remain-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T17:59:06Z","webTitle":"Man faces trial after 'offensive emails' sent to pro-remain MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/16/man-faces-trial-death-threats-pro-remain-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/16/man-faces-trial-death-threats-pro-remain-mps","fields":{"headline":"Man faces trial after 'offensive emails' sent to pro-remain MPs","bodyText":"A 72-year-old man has been charged with allegedly sending grossly offensive emails to six MPs including Conservative party Brexit rebels Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan.

Infantino, who faces re-election next year, presented the proposal in March for a new summer 24-club World Cup every four years, and a “Global Nations League” with a final eight-country round of matches, also every four years. He has told Fifa’s six confederations, including Uefa, that the investors are promising the projected $25bn for four editions of each competition over 12 years between 2021 and 2033. The investors were described as “among the world’s most solid” but are unnamed, as Infantino said he had signed a non-disclosure agreement. Infantino has held talks with seven top European clubs, including Manchester United and Manchester City, about the plan, which could promise participating clubs an average of $94m each. City and United have not commented publicly but senior representatives of Real Madrid and Barcelona have reacted positively. When the proposal was first presented to a Fifa council meeting in Bogotá, Infantino is reported to have said the investors required an answer within 60 days, a deadline that ran out this week. Fifa’s council members asked for more information and widespread objections have since been made to the plan, regarding the impact the club competition and the windfall to already-rich clubs would have on other clubs and leagues, the playing burden on top players – which Fifa believes will not be onerous – and the anonymity of the investors. The Premier League executive chairman, Richard Scudamore, has criticised the presentation of the proposals as a fait accompli and raised concerns about further pressure on players. After a meeting in Lyon on Wednesday before the Europa League final, Uefa’s professional football strategy council (PFSC) said that its members “unanimously expressed serious reservations about the process … and in particular the hasty timing and lack of concrete information”. The PFSC, chaired by the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, incorporates the European Club Association, the European Professional Football Leagues and the European division of the players’ union, Fifpro. Manchester United’s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, is an ECA representative on the PFSC and was party to the critical statement. EPFL’s president, Lars-Christer Olsson, said after the meeting: “Fifa, the governing body of world football, is selling football at great potential cost to its development, without proper consultation and no transparency. We do not know who the investors are or how they have reached $25bn, which does not add up commercially. To use an expression we have in Sweden, this is a ‘black box’.” Infantino intends to continue discussions and to secure agreement before the World Cup starts on 14 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/16/meghan-markles-family-stir-up-royals-with-tv-appearance-rumours","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T19:02:52Z","webTitle":"Meghan Markle's family stir up royals with TV appearance rumours","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/16/meghan-markles-family-stir-up-royals-with-tv-appearance-rumours","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/16/meghan-markles-family-stir-up-royals-with-tv-appearance-rumours","fields":{"headline":"Meghan Markle's family stir up royals with TV appearance rumours","bodyText":"When Meghan Markle’s sister-in-law Tracy Dooley touched down at Heathrow airport on Monday night, accompanied by her adult sons Tyler and Thomas Dooley, rumours began to fly about the reasons for the family’s visit. With no invitations to the ceremony, their presence was attributed to media opportunities offered by organisations on both sides of the Atlantic. The Dooleys were understood to have been lined up as contributors for Good Morning Britain, with the Daily Mail reporting that they had been recruited as special correspondents for the programme – to which they have already contributed. Tracy – who by her own admission has not seen the future royal in two decades after divorcing Meghan’s half-brother – was expected to report for Good Morning Britain live from Windsor. But if that offer was ever in place, it isn’t now. When the Guardian contacted ITV’s early morning programme to ask whether it would be using the Dooleys as contributors, despite trenchant criticism from its host Piers Morgan of the wider Markle family’s relationship with the media industry, a spokesperson said: “The Dooleys will not be contributing to Good Morning Britain’s coverage of the Royal wedding.” The spokesperson did not respond to further requests asking whether the relatives had been due to appear on the programme at any point. The incident is another example of the uneasy relationship between Kensington Palace, Meghan Markle’s wider family, and a media industry desperate for stories relating to this weekend’s royal wedding. The issue came to a head after the Mail on Sunday’s expose of Meghan’s father for apparently staging photographs, despite pleas from the royal family’s press office for the media to leave the family alone. The family has already proved to be regulars in the media, with Meghan’s half-brother Thomas Jr writing an open letter in a US celebrity magazine urging Prince Harry to call off the wedding, while his brother Tyler promised to launch a strain of cannabis named “Markle Sparkle” to celebrate the nuptials. But despite the blanket news coverage, there is no sign as yet of any of the extended Markle family being signed up for lucrative punditry slots on US TV networks, who have built enormous temporary studios in Windsor for the wedding. Instead they have largely resorted to talking with TMZ, the Los Angeles-based gossip website which has outfoxed the Kensington Palace press office with its stream of stories about the Markle family, including regular updates from Meghan’s father about whether he intends to attend the wedding. This has taken its toll on some of the future royal’s relatives. “Meghan and I do not have a relationship now,” said Markle’s half-sister Samantha Markle in a video defending her right to continue doing media appearances regarding her family and is writing a book entitled The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister. “The last year has been strained because of what tabloids have said.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/may/16/hip-cleavage-new-summer-trend-ridiculous-cleavage-history","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T20:29:06Z","webTitle":"Move aside sideboob, 'hip cleavage' is this year's absurd female body trend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/16/hip-cleavage-new-summer-trend-ridiculous-cleavage-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/may/16/hip-cleavage-new-summer-trend-ridiculous-cleavage-history","fields":{"headline":"Move aside sideboob, 'hip cleavage' is this year's absurd female body trend","bodyText":"The female body truly is remarkable: every few months it seems to sprout a new part. One day you’ve got a simple pair of breasts, for example, and the next day you’re being told you’ve got underboob, sideboobs and overboob. And it’s not just breasts you’ve got to worry about. Apparently our hips are at it too – and we all know hips don’t lie. Yes, I’m sorry to break it to you, but apparently “hip cleavage” is 2018’s hottest new trend. This is according to Page Six , which has figured out that coining a nonsensical new term gives them a great excuse for putting up a slideshow of half-naked women. They have also provided some highbrow analysis to accompany the high-waisted bikini shots, asking: “Are hipbones the new décolletage?” The simple answer to that is: no. However, to be fair, it’s a valid question. Cleavage is confusing. The media seem to announce a random body part is the new décolletage with alarming frequency. As a public service, then, let me get you all caught up with the various cleavages that have appeared (and disappeared) over the years. Toe cleavage Back in 2000, the celebrated shoe designer Manolo Blahnik opined that “the secret of toe cleavage, a very important part of the sexuality of the shoe” is that “you must only show the first two cracks.” A decade later Blahnik decided he was “tired of the whole toe-cleavage thing. One should not even see the beginning of the toes these days.” So there you have it ladies, don’t show too much toe. Leg cleavage The Guardian actually bears responsibility for leg cleavage, I’m afraid, which refers to dresses with an upturned V cut that shows off the inner thigh. Jess Cartner-Morley invented the term in jest, in a 2015 piece about a Victoria’s Secret show but lo and behold, it took on a life of its own. Glamour UK was one of a number of outlets around the world to swiftly declare leg cleavage a new trend. Butt cleavage In 2016 Kylie Jenner was credited with being ahead of the trend on “butt cleavage”. What fresh cleavage hell is this, you may ask? Well, according to Cosmopolitan it’s “like underboob but underbutt”. I know, I know, I lost brain cells just typing that out. Let’s move swiftly on, shall we? However, for the purpose of correcting butt cleavage history, I should point out that Jenner wasn’t ahead of the trend in 2016, she was behind it. Indeed, way back in 2003 the Cincinnati Enquirer called popped-out posteriors “the new cleavage”. Male cleavage Men haven’t entirely been spared from dubious cleavage trends. 2017 was very much the year of male cleavage, with the likes of Harry Styles and Dwyane Wade parading plunging necklines. Nor were men exempted from a little casual body-shaming. The stylist Calyann Barnett told the New York Post that she doesn’t ever want to see dad bods and male cleavage. “Those two trends should never cross paths.” No cleavage In its December 2016 issue Vogue declared that breast cleavage was over. A dearth of décolletage on the catwalks was a clear sign that “the cleavage – those magnificent mounds pushed together to display sexual empowerment … is over, or at least, taking a well-earned break.” Funnily enough, a lot of women were not very keen to hear they ought to put their “magnificent mounds” in storage until breasts were back in fashion, and there was quite the uproar. Side cleavage Back when breasts were fashionable there were various right and wrong ways to wear them. Between about 2010-2012 side cleavage, also known as “sideboob” was all the rage. Today, if you’re going to get all retro and get your breasts out, then it would seem underboob is the new sideboob. Honestly, it really is fun being a woman!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/16/preakness-draw-justify-morning-line-pimlico","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T21:33:05Z","webTitle":"Kentucky Derby winner Justify draws No7 post for Preakness Stakes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/16/preakness-draw-justify-morning-line-pimlico","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/16/preakness-draw-justify-morning-line-pimlico","fields":{"headline":"Kentucky Derby winner Justify draws No7 post for Preakness Stakes","bodyText":"Justify, the undefeated Kentucky Derby winner, will run out of the No7 post in Saturday’s 143rd running of the Preakness Stakes and is a better than even money favorite to win the middle jewel of thoroughbred racing’s Triple Crown. The chestnut colt trained by Bob Baffert was installed as the 1-2 morning-line favorite at Wednesday’s draw at Pimlico Race Course, a short price that elicited a nervous smile from the Hall of Fame trainer. “You’re putting some added pressure on all of us,” Baffert said. The eight-horse field matches the 2015 race, when American Pharoah memorably romped to a seven-length win in the slop, as the smallest since 2000. The last time fewer than eight ran in the Preakness was Show Chief’s win in 1986. Only three of the seven challengers to Justify in Saturday’s $1.5m race also ran a week and a half ago in Louisville. The most likely spoiler is second choice Good Magic, the Kentucky Derby runner-up trained by Chad Brown who opens at 3-1. The rest of the field is 12-1 or longer. Justify ended a 136-year-old hoodoo at the Kentucky Derby with his fourth victory in four starts, also from the seven slot, becoming the first horse to win the Run for the Roses having not raced as a two-year-old since 1882. The son of Scat Daddy is aiming to become the only undefeated Triple Crown winner besides Seattle Slew in 1977 and just the 12th horse overall to sweep the Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes, widely regarded as one of the most difficult feats in sports. Weather forecasts call for rain in the Baltimore area every day from Wednesday through Saturday, increasing the likelihood of a sloppy track not unlike the conditions at Churchill Downs. That didn’t appear to concern the trainer. “He’s run on two wet tracks and he’s won on them,” Baffert said. “Ideally we want a beautiful day so everyone can enjoy what a great spectacle the Preakness is.” Two of Baffert’s six career Preakness winners also started from the seven post: Silver Charm in 1997 and Lookin at Lucky in 2010. The Hall of Fame trainer has never lost the Triple Crown’s middle leg after winning the Derby, going a perfect four-for-four with Silver Charm, Real Quiet (1998), War Emblem (2002) and American Pharoah (2015). Earlier Wednesday, Justify arrived at Pimlico after flying into Thurgood Marshall Baltimore-Washington International Airport from Louisville. “It went really smooth, no hiccups,” Baffert said. “We were a little bit worried last night because the plane was delayed, but the horse shipped well. He was full of himself when he got off the van.” The full slate of post positions and morning-line odds was revealed on Wednesday afternoon: No1 Quip (12-1), No2 Lone Sailor (15-1), No3 Sporting Chance (30-1), No4 Diamond King (30-1), No5 Good Magic (3-1), No6 Tenfold (20-1), No7 Justify (1-2) and No8 Bravazo (20-1). The post time for the 143rd running of the Preakness Stakes is 6.20pm ET."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}
