BT-owned EE, Vodafone, O2 and Three have paid close to double what many City analysts had expected Ofcom’s auction to raise, as the mobile operators seek to open up a world of internet-connected world of driverless cars, smart home appliances, delivery drones and superfast video on the go. City analysts had a wide range of predictions on what the auction would net the government – spanning £630m to £1bn – with the attractiveness of 5G services to consumers and mobile operators proving much more valuable. “Mobile network operators are willing to dig deep to acquire 5G spectrum – evidently seeing it as a strategic necessity,” said Dhananjay Mirchandani, a telecoms analyst at Bernstein. The big four operators have secured broadly the same amount of 5G spectrum to use after the auction. Vodafone won 50MHz of spectrum in the 3.4GHz frequency band auctioned paying £378m, BT-owned EE won 40Mhz paying £303m, Telefónica-owned O2 picked up 40MHz for £318m, and Hutchison-owned Three spent £151m on 20Mhz. Three UK had already secured a 40Mhz of 5G spectrum prior to the auction. 5G is set to be rolled out in the UK in the next decade and the mass connectivity it allows will help expand the so-called internet of things (IoT), in which appliances and devices wirelessly connect to the internet and each other. IoT technology is being used in everything from smart homes to wearables and 5G could be used to enable driverless cars to communicate with each other and other road users, as well as develop “smart manufacturing” – connecting all the various machines involved in a production chain – and the drone delivery networks that companies such as Amazon would like to develop. “This is good news for everyone who uses their mobile phone to access the internet,” said Philip Marnick, spectrum group director at Ofcom. “As a nation we’re using ever more mobile data on smartphones and mobile devices. Releasing these airwaves will make it quicker and easier to get online on the move. It will also allow companies to prepare for 5G mobile, paving the way for a range of smart, connected devices.” Ofcom’s auction also saw O2 win 40MHz of 4G spectrum (2.3Ghz) that was made available paying £206m. The win was considered essential by analysts as O2 had the smallest share of the UK’s usable mobile spectrum. Parent company Telefónica’s plans for a £10bn stock market flotation of O2 have been hampered over the last two years because of Brexit vote and market uncertainty. “The outcome for O2 UK is of particular importance given the potential IPO of this business after the auction,” said Mirchandani. “O2 went into the auction with the smallest spectrum portfolio. Expect news flow on an IPO in the near future, possibly in the summer.” While significantly beating expectations the £1.4bn 5G auction is a far cry from the £22.5bn raised for 3G spectrum two decades ago. The expectation had been for £5bn. Winning bidders subsequently found themselves making multibillion-pound writedowns after revenues and profits failed to match prices paid. Memories of overpaying hampered the auction of 4G spectrum in 2013 which raised £2.3bn about £1.2bn less than the Treasury had forecast – prompting an investigation from the National Audit Office into what went wrong."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/05/john-howard-says-a-change-of-leader-is-not-the-answer-to-liberals-woes","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T10:21:23Z","webTitle":"John Howard says a change of leader is not the answer to Liberals' woes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/05/john-howard-says-a-change-of-leader-is-not-the-answer-to-liberals-woes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/05/john-howard-says-a-change-of-leader-is-not-the-answer-to-liberals-woes","fields":{"headline":"John Howard says a change of leader is not the answer to Liberals' woes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia’s former prime minister John Howard has issued a public warning to his colleagues to get their collective act together, saying a change of leader is not the answer to the Turnbull government’s woes. With the government bracing for the likely loss of its 30th Newspoll early next week, Howard said there wasn’t any evidence that people wanted a change of leader: “We have done that and we still have an electoral challenge.” He said he did not regard the next federal election as unwinnable, “but there are a lot of our supporters who are nervous”. “There’s a collective responsibility to get the act together,” Howard said. “It’s not just the responsibility of the leader.” He said Malcolm Turnbull had to “inspire and encourage” but he also had to understand the balance between his authority as the prime minister and the general tolerance of the Liberal party. The government needed to focus on collective effort rather than the factional differences between small “l” Liberals and social conservatives. “They’ve got to work together in, I think, a far more purposeful way that has been evident over the last few months.” The negative poll metric looms because Turnbull invoked a significant losing streak in Newspoll as one justification for taking the Liberal leadership from Tony Abbott in 2015. Turnbull has sought to get out ahead of the anticipated milestone urging MPs in an interview with the Australian Financial Review to look past the possible 30th Newspoll defeat and claiming he can beat Labor in a contest focused on the economy. Turnbull rejected criticisms by Abbott that the Coalition is “in government but not in power”, claiming to have “got the parliament working” with $34bn in budget savings and 200 bills passed. “When I stood up and nominated to be leader of the Liberal party in 2015, I said that I would deliver economic leadership and I would deliver traditional cabinet government, among other things,” he reportedly said. “Economic leadership: we have demonstrated that, I think, very, very convincingly,” he said, citing the “strongest jobs growth in the nation’s history”. Speaking to Triple M Melbourne on Friday Turnbull said Howard was a “source of very good advice” and claimed he had restored “traditional cabinet government” modelled on Howard’s. Anticipating the milestone, Abbott has been at the forefront of renewed internal mischief by conservatives on coal-fired power, and the government is again at public odds on energy policy. Some government MPs believe the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, is positioning herself as a possible leadership contender, although senior moderates insist that Turnbull’s own faction remains solidly behind the prime minister. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton – regarded internally as a future leadership prospect – has twice this week pledged loyalty to Turnbull. “I accepted an offer from Tony Abbott when he was prime minister to be in his cabinet, and I only did so on the basis of loyalty to the leader,” Dutton said on Thursday. “If I can’t be loyal to the leader, then my judgment is I resign. “Now I’ve accepted the same commission from this prime minister and I do it on the basis of loyalty as well, and I need to work as part of a team to turn [the government’s fortunes] around.” Dutton said if the government worked together as a team, it would defeat Bill Shorten and Labor at the next federal election. The government has not only lagged Labor in Newspoll. The Coalition lost every Guardian Essential poll in 2017 on the two-party-preferred measure, and has now lost lost 77 polls in a row. While the trend against the government appears hard-baked, Turnbull remains consistently ahead of the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, as preferred prime minister. On Friday moderate Liberal and leader in the House, Christopher Pyne, said that “nobody cares about the Newspolls” and dismissing reports Dutton could lead the government. “We have a leader and we will win the next election,” he told Channel Nine. “We are very happy with the leadership of the Liberal party. We are sticking with it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/06/country-wife-review-southwark-playhouse-london-luke-fredericks","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T08:05:10Z","webTitle":"The Country Wife review – Wycherley’s rude classic gets a limp update","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/06/country-wife-review-southwark-playhouse-london-luke-fredericks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/06/country-wife-review-southwark-playhouse-london-luke-fredericks","fields":{"headline":"The Country Wife review – Wycherley’s rude classic gets a limp update","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Luke Fredericks prefaces this production of William Wycherley’s 1675 comedy by saying he wants to blow the cobwebs off something “considered old and outdated”. But considered by whom? This is one of the most popular and most frequently revived plays of its period. By relocating the action to the 1920s world of the bright young things, Fredericks sacrifices common sense to surface energy. Wycherley’s plot revolves around a rake, Horner, who feigns impotence to gain access to other men’s wives, a ploy that succeeds with the rustic Margery Pinchwife and the urban Lady Fidget. But transposing the story to another era is pointless if you are going to preserve most of the local references and original language. A line such as “He’s as jealous of her as a Cheapside husband of a Covent Garden wife” reeks of Caroline London. You also wonder why Horner goes to such trouble if he is living in a world, as this production implies, where anything goes: one point of Wycherley’s play is to expose the hypocrisies of marriage in a supposedly monogamous society. Fredericks and his designer, Stewart Charlesworth, who present the production under the banner of Morphic Graffiti, have certainly cottoned on to the fact that this is a play about sex – but even here they can’t leave well alone. The evening starts with rumpy-pumpy behind a museum exhibit. The first act reaches its climax, in every sense, with the sight of Lady Fidget pleasuring herself in the Savoy tea-room to an aria that sounds like the Jewel Song from Faust. After this, the filthiest and funniest scene in English drama – where Lady Fidget goes to Horner’s bedroom to examine his china, leaving him limp with exhaustion – is a total let-down. Lines that require the silkiest innuendo are shouted and screamed to the rooftops. That is in keeping with a production where more attention is paid to choreography than to text. Heather Douglas, as movement director, has the cast do a range of 1920s dances, including the charleston, the foxtrot and the Lindy hop while changing the furniture. The results are often startling but there is something badly wrong when a scene-change gets the evening’s biggest applause. While Douglas’s contribution is accomplished, it also harks back to old-fashioned West End period revivals where dinky set-changes were done by liveried, applause-seeking footmen. Plus ça change. In keeping with the supposed behaviour of 20s hedonists, much of the acting is frantic and shrill, with two shining exceptions. Nancy Sullivan is fresh and funny as the closeted, rural wife who achieves self-fulfilment when exposed to the temptations of the town; she leaves the impression that the balance of marital power has changed for ever. Richard Clews is also very good as her abusive husband, who menacingly wields a teaspoon as if it were a carving knife. Eddie Eyre makes a decent enough Horner while suggesting the working-class world of EastEnders, in which he recently starred, rather than that of Mayfair salons. But although some cheered at the end (don’t they always?), I felt depressed to see a great comedy turned into a senseless romp. At Southwark Playhouse, London, until 21 April.

But this could be averted if they continue quiet backroom discussions to open up their markets, particularly China’s. The US imposition of tariffs on a range of Chinese imports – which amounts to a tax on imported goods – is the first step in a series of measures announced by the Trump administration. So far, China has responded by announcing tariffs on US imports. The next stage would be for the US to restrict Chinese investment into America. Presumably, if this happens, then China would respond in kind. In other words, the tensions between the US and China could go beyond taxes and directly disrupt global supply chains as investment is targeted. Any disruption to supply and distribution chains, which are a key part of world trade, could have a lasting impact. In the worst-case scenario, companies may have to relocate factories or distribution centres. Investment decisions affect employment and taxes raised, and are in some ways more disruptive than tariffs, which can be reversed more easily. This escalation would be damaging for the US and Chinese economies since global companies, such as Apple, invest in both countries. This would affect not only US businesses but also American consumers. Retailers such as Walmart import goods from China, so prices would go up and living standards would be squeezed. And since US goods are sold worldwide, if they are reliant on parts from China, consumers here in the UK and in the rest of the world would also be affected. The same applies to Chinese consumers and producers, particularly since about half of Chinese exports are made by enterprises with foreign investors. The US is targeting hi-tech manufacturers to disrupt President Xi’s flagship industrial strategy, the Made in China 2025 plan, which seeks to make Chinese manufacturing globally competitive by introducing more artificial intelligence and automation. The ability of emerging economies such as China to “catch up” with rich economies depends on their being able to access and adapt the best technology in the world. This lies at the heart of the problem. The US has launched these trade measures in retaliation for China’s poor record on intellectual property rights protection, which includes requiring foreign companies to transfer their technology as a condition of investing in China. So, there is a lot at stake for both countries. But a trade war wouldn’t result in better protection of US technology or give American firms better access to Chinese markets. Nor would it help China invest in America. A perennial Chinese complaint is that its companies are blocked, particularly in the technology sector, which is crucial for its economic growth. After an initial round of tariffs on steel and aluminium was unveiled, US and Chinese officials met to discuss ways to open markets wider and create a more level playing field. Opening up China would improve the US trade position. After all, its huge trade deficit could be reduced either by cutting back on imports – or, a much better option, expanding exports. China may be reluctant to open up its relatively closed markets to foreign competition. It firmly believes its industries need protection against the dominance of multinational companies. But it has some of the biggest companies in the world, such as Alibaba, Huawei, and Tencent. And more competition may well improve China’s growth prospects by increasing productivity, especially in sectors where there are less efficient state-owned enterprises. But far from the US and China coming to the table and forging an agreement to open up trade, more rounds of trade barriers could be announced with growing economic damage and no resolution in sight. President Trump may even show his dissatisfaction with the body that oversees international trade, the World Trade Organisation, which he has described as a “disaster”, and pull America out. That would potentially overturn the whole worldwide trading system with dire consequences. So it’s critical that a US-China trade war is avoided at all costs. • Linda Yueh is an economist, broadcaster and writer.

Everything was going to plan as they emerged from the swim and cycle in the leading pack. “About three quarters of it went all right,” Alistair said. “My swim went well, it was probably the only time in my career I’ve led a swim out and I was just trying to pull that gap out as much as possible.” But they went into meltdown mode on the run with the Olympic champion, Alistair, finishing 10th and Jonny faring only slightly better in seventh. Both later said they had been laid low by injury over the past month and realised part way into the 5km run that they would be unable to keep up with the eventual winner, Henri Schoeman, of South Africa and the silver medallist, Jacob Birtwhistle of Australia. Scotland’s Marc Austin won a surprise bronze. Alistair had been the England flag bearer at the Carrara Stadium at the opening ceremony on Wednesday evening but insisted it was the after effects of an achilles injury rather than the late night that damaged his chances. “I’ve probably run a handful of times in the last month or so and I knew that was going to be tough,” he said. “My main priority in the last two weeks has been making sure my calf held up so I could get round OK. I knew I hadn’t run very fast for more than a minute or two at a time so when you’ve got to do it for 15 it’s not going to go very well for you.” A deluge minutes before the start of the triathlon left the men shivering on the pontoon. The waters of the Broadwater Parklands lagoon had turned a murky shade of grey but Alistair, 29, emerged from the swim in first place with Jonny close behind. Both held their own on the bike and went into the run with every chance of winning a medal. It immediately became apparent that Alistair was not fit enough to keep pace but Jonny was poised on the shoulder of Schoeman until he could hold on no longer. “It was pretty terrible today,” said Jonny. “I’ve had ups and downs coming into this race. I was injured at the start of January so missed a lot of training but I thought I’d be a lot better than that today. “I dived in and I felt pretty weak on the swim. I started riding and had to work really hard to catch Alistair up. I’m normally one of the strongest on the bike but I didn’t feel great. I started running and thought: ‘Oh dear.’ I tried to give it everything to stay in the medals as long as I could but it just wasn’t good enough.” There was better news for England’s Jess Learmonth, who finished second in the women’s race behind the world champion, Flora Duffy. The 29-year-old Learmonth has had a swift rise to prominence over the last year and said she was surprised to win a medal. “I’m delighted,” she said. “I tried to enjoy it as much as I can. It wasn’t that enjoyable on the last lap of the run, with them just behind me, but I can try and enjoy it now. We don’t really set out any plan to be honest, but I was kind of lucky that Flora Duffy and I started together and she got on to my feet and she did a lot of work on the bike, so we just did a bit each and it kind of worked out well.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/06/agl-hits-back-at-barnaby-joyce-claim-it-is-shorting-the-energy-market","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T18:00:10Z","webTitle":"AGL hits back at Barnaby Joyce claim it is 'shorting' the energy market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/06/agl-hits-back-at-barnaby-joyce-claim-it-is-shorting-the-energy-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/06/agl-hits-back-at-barnaby-joyce-claim-it-is-shorting-the-energy-market","fields":{"headline":"AGL hits back at Barnaby Joyce claim it is 'shorting' the energy market","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"AGL Energy has categorically rejected arguments from the Turnbull government that it is abusing its market power, saying if it wanted to benefit commercially from the closure of the Liddell power plant it would have shuttered the facility with no warning. An AGL spokesman hit back at an accusation from the former deputy prime minister and Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce that it was “shorting” the market by hanging on to the ageing coal-fired power plant. “It is not possible to short a market by giving seven years’ notice of closure,” the spokesman said. “If AGL’s intent was to benefit from the closure of Liddell, AGL would have provided no notice of closure.” Pushback from the energy company that once again finds itself at the centre of a political storm about energy policy comes as the chief executive of the Australian Energy Market Operator, Audrey Zibelman, says the electricity market in New South Wales would benefit from more competition. In an interview with Guardian Australia, the Aemo chief said a signal from the Hong-Kong owned Alinta Energy that it would like to buy the Liddell facility and extend its operating life beyond 2022 was positive, and a sign the energy market was working. The Turnbull government has been attempting to ratchet up public pressure on AGL for months to extend the life of the NSW coal plant until an expansion of the Snowy Hydro scheme is completed – but AGL has its own plans for the site. The company wants to shut down Liddell in 2022 and replace it with renewables, batteries, gas power, upgraded coal power and demand response. In an effort to push past AGL’s hard-baked resistance, the government has over the past few days brokered a potential offer by Alinta, a company which has ready access to capital, and is looking to expand its market share. In a further sign AGL does not plan to change course, its chief executive, Andy Vesey, told Fairfax Media interference in the market would raise issues of ‘‘sovereign risk’’ that could deter investment in new energy assets. When approached by Alinta, Vesey told it AGL was “not in the process of selling, so there is no process’’, although has since said publicly it would take any offer to its board for consideration. Zibelman said it was not the role of the energy market operator to determine which company should deliver the capacity required in the market, but to ensure sufficient capacity was available in the event the Liddell plant was retired. “We are agnostic. Our concern is making sure the kit is there.” But echoing a similar observation from the head of Australia’s competition watchdog, Rod Sims, prompted by the potential Alinta bid for Liddell, Zibelman said the energy market in NSW would benefit from more competition. “I think that any market benefits from more competition. I think about it from the perspective of what’s the value of competition – multiple players looking to drive value to consumers,” the Aemo chief said. “When you have more players doing that, then consumers benefit”. She said Aemo had given advice to the Turnbull government last month that an environment needed to be created encouraging multiple competitors to bring forward options to supply the market in order to prevent a shortfall occurring if Liddell exited the system, and if AGL failed to deliver all the elements of its transition plan. “The market is open now and the fact is anyone could come in. Aemo has identified a gap, we don’t need a government process of any type to allow anyone to come in and say, ‘I’d like to fill that gap,’ to put up their hand, and put their money at risk,” Zibelman said. “When Aemo is talking about competition and the benefit of competition, it’s to say we need someone, various parties, to put their hand up and come in and be willing to essentially offer to meet the supply need in the market. “One way that could be met of course is for someone to come in and say they are happy to purchase the Liddell plant and keep it open. That’s one way the gap could be met. “That’s good, that’s the market working. I don’t think it precludes anyone at this point from doing other things, it’s just the process of the market responding to an identified gap.” While the Turnbull government focuses on extending the life of Liddell, the Monash group of Coalition MPs has called for consideration of a new coal power plant. The chief executive of Snowy Hydro, Paul Broad, has warned the government would “do their dough” if they bowed to this pressure, backing treasurer Scott Morrison’s view that the economics of a new coal power plant do not stack up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/05/spy-poisoning-ben-wallace-jeremy-corbyn-intelligence","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T10:16:38Z","webTitle":"Spy poisoning: minister defends not sharing full intelligence with Corbyn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/05/spy-poisoning-ben-wallace-jeremy-corbyn-intelligence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/05/spy-poisoning-ben-wallace-jeremy-corbyn-intelligence","fields":{"headline":"Spy poisoning: minister defends not sharing full intelligence with Corbyn","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The government has defended its decision not to share the full intelligence on the Salisbury nerve agent attack with Jeremy Corbyn, insisting the “circle” of those with access to highly sensitive information should be restricted. Ben Wallace, the security minister, said the number of people entrusted with the most sensitive details of the case should be deliberately kept small so intelligence agents’ lives were not put at risk. The Labour party leader has received an intelligence briefing on privy council terms, but was not given the same access to highly classified information as David Cameron provided to Ed Miliband over Syria in 2013. “This is serious stuff and the circle of who gets to see very sensitive information is very small, because if you leak it or it gets out, people’s lives are put at risk,” Wallace said. “The best example is Mr Skripal; that’s what happens to people if other countries to decide to take actions or they have enemies.” Wallace insisted it was “beyond reasonable doubt” that the Russian state was behind the attempted murder of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, despite chemical weapons experts saying they were unable to confirm where the novichok nerve agent was made. Labour reacted angrily to the implication that Corbyn might leak intelligence, accusing Wallace of “playing party politics” over the level of briefing granted in order to distract from a row over comments by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. “This is completely irresponsible and another attempt by the Tories to deflect criticism from Boris Johnson’s blatant attempt to mislead the public. The foreign secretary has still failed to account for himself and still has serious questions to answer,” a party spokesman said. “Ben Wallace should be acting in the national interest, not playing party politics with the country’s security.” However, the minister defended the decision to restrict the intelligence Corbyn was given access to, saying foreign allies had agreed Russia was behind the attack on the basis of the information they had seen. “He is the leader of the opposition; he is not the government. He doesn’t have the duty or the responsibility of protecting at the moment – and I hope he never does – the security of this country,” he told BBC radio. “He would already have seen more than the average backbench MP because he had a privy council briefing, but at the end of the day, this government is responsible for the security of the people, and the United Kingdom’s interests, and as a result, we have to take the judgement based on the result we get from our professionals. “The decision of what to share was made and I wasn’t privy to what he was allowed to see, but it would have been made in a reasoned environment where people wanted to show him evidence. “He can always dispute that; it’s not about him being helpful, he doesn’t have to be helpful, he can be critical and say whatever he likes, he is leader of the opposition and has a perfect right [to] – and he should – question the government”. Later on Thursday one of Corbyn’s strongest backbench allies, Derby North MP Chris Williamson, said Johnson and other ministers had sought to use the Salisbury incident “as a way of diverting attention away from their own difficulties over Brexit and economic policy”. Speaking on the Russian news station RT – which the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said last month Labour MPs should shun – Williamson said some Tiry MPs were “not just interested in moving it into a cold war situation but many of them were looking as if they were in favour of a hot war”. Reports on Thursday suggested the British security services believe they have pinpointed the location of the covert Russian laboratory that manufactured the weapons-grade nerve agent used in Salisbury. Ministers and security officials were apparently able to identify the source using scientific analysis and intelligence in the days after the attack, adding to Britain’s intelligence case against Russia. The Times claimed Britain knew about the existence of the facility where the novichok was made before the attack on 4 March, and had a high degree of certainty that the nerve agent was manufactured there. Wallace said the government would resist a “Dutch auction” on releasing further intelligence to prove its case in the face of Russian denials. “Intelligence is often gained by people rising their lives and the security of their lives being put at risk. It’s not just routine evidence that you can just bring up in court,” he said. He rejected comparisons between the Salisbury investigation and British intelligence failings in Iraq. “Let’s be absolutely clear, nerve agent was used in Salisbury, there’s no missing nerve agent that no one can find,” he said. Counter-terrorism police have been guarded in what they have said about their investigation, and have not commented at all for a week. But Wallace suggested elements of what the police had found pointed to Russian culpability. “We have found nerve agent. That nerve agent has been identified to be manufactured, we believe, in Russia. We believe the novichok type of nerve agent is only capable of being produced by a nation state,” he said. “We add that to intelligence we hold, we add that to some of the police investigation going on and we can say roads lead to Russia. We are beyond reasonable doubt of the view that the Russian state is behind this.” Dozens of US diplomats declared personae non gratae headed for airports in Moscow on Thursday morning, Russian state news agencies reported.

For the first time, the 2018 festival will extend to a third “prelude” weekend from 7-10 June, which will feature a masked costume ball, two major exhibition openings – Zero at Mona, and A Journey to Freedom at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery – and the Dark and Dangerous Thoughts symposium, co-presented by Guardian Australia and Vice. The festival proper, which runs from 13-24 June, features a typically eclectic mix of music, including work from the avant-garde artist and musician Laurie Anderson; a “sound bath” installation created by Anderson’s late husband, Lou Reed, titled Drones; a performance from art-pop artist St Vincent; Archie Roach and Tiddas’ collaboration Dancing with my Spirit; the Canadian singer-songwriter Alice Glass, formerly of Crystal Castles; and the return of the industrial noise collective Einstürzende Neubauten, who will be performing Lament in an Australian exclusive. Anderson will bring her multimedia performance All the Things I Lost in the Flood to the Odeon theatre, which is linked to her recent book of essays of the same name. Her virtual reality “library of stories” and collaboration with artist Hsin-Chien Huang, Chalkroom, will also be showing during the festival. The Canadian Inuk throat singer, punk and activist Tanya Tagaq will perform a live score to the 1922 silent film Nanook of the North, which follows the life of an Inuit family in the Arctic. She will also be performing her most recent record, Retribution, which was nominated for a Juno award. The festival’s creative director, Leigh Carmichael, said this year’s festival is its “most expansive” to date. “It’s always difficult to know exactly how the festival will unfold for the audience,” he said. “We just strive to try and find new ways to experience the darkness.” In 2017, that darkness came with controversy and death threats. The Austrian artist Hermann Nitsch’s 3.5-hour performance piece involved 500 litres of animal blood and the guts and carcass of a slaughtered bull. Twenty-thousand people signed a petition demanding the work be cancelled and Carmichael and the Mona boss, David Walsh, claimed to have received more than 100 threats in its lead-up and aftermath. As part of the 2018 festival’s film program, the Australian video art duo Soda_Jerk will screen their “political revenge fable” Terror Nullius, which is currently showing at Acmi in Melbourne. The film, which remixes and revises Australian screen history to satirise the country and its politics, made headlines upon its release in March when the Ian Potter Cultural Trust, which had funded the film, withdrew its promotional support on the eve of its release. The talks and ideas festival, Dark and Dangerous Thoughts, will explore the “complex moral and ethical issues evoked by contemporary culture”. While the full program is yet to be announced, Carmichael told the Australian Financial Review that the key themes will be “killing and fucking” – he said one event would feature a panel of “killers”, including a sniper, a sharia law advocate and an ex-jihadi. Zero, the major new exhibition at the Museum of Old and New Art, traverses the artistic terrain of a radical collective of artists from post-war Germany – including Heinz Mack, Otto Piene, Günther Uecker and Adolf Luther – and Italy – including Lucio Fontana, Nanda Vigo, Grazia Varisco, Enrico Castellani and Gianni Colombo. These works will be accompanied by pieces from Marcel Duchamp, Yves Klein, Yayoi Kusama and more. A Journey to Freedom will interrogate the history of incarceration and liberation from around the world, with a focus on spatially oriented works such as installations, videos, sculptures and virtual reality. The festival continues its focus on metal, doom and noise music with a night of “metal mayhem” taking over the Odeon on 20 June, featuring Blasphemy, Portal and Batushka. A two-day festival of experimental music, performance and art will be curated by Berlin Atonal, and a night of “transcendent music and experimental sounds”, Borderlands, will bring the Haxan Cloak and Merzbow to Hobart in Australian exclusive performances. A new David Lynch tribute venue, Bang Bang Bar, will run throughout the festival, featuring sets from Marlon Williams, Brutal Measures, Laura Jean, Tiny Ruins and Lynch collaborator Rebekah Del Rio. In other highlights, Ryoji Ikeda is bringing his dazzling tower of light back, after it debuted at the first Dark Mofo in 2013; and Victorian Opera will be joined by the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra for Benjamin Britten’s the Rape of Lucretia. The late night party precinct will return, this year titled Night Mass, as will the interactive sculpture and installation venue Dark Park; the nightly food festival Winter Feast; and the ogoh-ogoh, a giant effigy that is burned on the final night. The nude solstice swim will also make a comeback – hopefully with enough towels this time. • Dark Mofo takes place from 7 June in venues around Hobart, Tasmania"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/05/malaysian-prime-minister-accused-of-dirty-tricks-as-election-looms","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T03:54:37Z","webTitle":"Malaysian prime minister accused of ‘dirty tricks’ as election looms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/05/malaysian-prime-minister-accused-of-dirty-tricks-as-election-looms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/05/malaysian-prime-minister-accused-of-dirty-tricks-as-election-looms","fields":{"headline":"Malaysian prime minister accused of ‘dirty tricks’ as election looms","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak has been accused of resorting to “dirty tricks” and “downright cheating” in the run up to the general election, after he pushed through a series of laws which allegedly favour his party and target his critics. Over the past week, two pieces of legislation – one which has redrawn the electoral map and the other which cracks down on so-called “fake news” – have been hurriedly pushed through parliament, bypassing widespread objections. With parliament due to be dissolved on Friday and the election held soon after, regional experts described the legislation as “desperate measures” by Najib, whose election success is now far from assured. “Najib is using the executive power and legislation to strengthen his hand,” said Bridget Welsh, a professor of political science at John Cabot University who specialises in Malaysian politics. Welsh described a “a reservoir of discontent with Najib“, and said the “excessive laws show insecurity and weakness going into this election”. Najib has been prime minister since 2009, but in recent years his popularity has plummeted, due both to the international shame of the 1MDB corruption scandal and the handling of the still-missing MH370 plane, but also thanks to the rising cost of living in Malaysia. His election chances have also not been improved by former prime minister Mahathir Mohamed, who was once Najib’s mentor, re-entering the political fray at 92-years-old to lead the opposition coalition with a single-minded goal of toppling his former protege. Gerrymandering and biased reorganisation of the electoral map have long been a tactic of ruling governments in Malaysia prior to an election, but the extent of the recent changes – up to 40% in some parliamentary constituencies – and the surreptitious manner in which it was pushed through has left many reeling. The electoral commission, which is under Najib’s control, has been accused of vastly increasing mal-apportionment – when a system is skewed to prevent a large section of society being represented – to disenfranchise groups who traditionally vote for the opposition. Welsh said Malaysia now had one of the “worst cases of mal-apportionment in the world”. Parliamentary constitutiencies usually won by parties in Najib’s ruling Barisa Nasional coalition have been made smaller, with an average of 48,000 voters – making it far easier to win the popular vote – while the seats usually held by the opposition now have an average of 79,000 voters. Nine out of the top ten largest constituencies are those usually held by the opposition. Shahrul Aman, chair of BERSIH, an organistaion pushing for electoral reform, said they had identified seven major constitutional violations in the new delineation law. “It is covertly giving the upper hand to Barisa Nasional by downplaying the popular votes. The terrible fact that Malaysians have to face is that with only 16.5% of the popular vote, the current government can rule the country.” The Malaysian constitution stipulates time must be given in the delineation process for voters to object, but Aman said they “bulldozed” the law through, calling on barely any of the tens of thousands who registered objections. A revised version of the delineation bill was put forward to appease objectors, with only 4% changes to constituencies, but many were shocked to find that when the legislation was tabled in parliament, the government simply went back to the first version. “It is an attempt to steal the election,” said Aman. “Delineation has always been abused by the ruling government but this is definitely a progression, the downright cheating has been aggravated.” Najib’s “fake news” bill, which was passed on Tuesday has been seen as equally alarming. It allows prison sentences of up to six years for spreading “fake news”, but many are concerned it will simply be used to crack down on critics of Najib, with the government given the power to decide what counts as fake news. The US State department expressed concern at its possible infringement on freedom of speech. Meredith Weiss, professor of political science at the University of Albany, specialising in south-east Asia, agreed “Full stop, this anti-fake news law is not business as usual – this is extreme even for Malaysia,” she said. The law, which was given minimal scrutiny in parliament, also gave the government power to go after alleged fake news spread on popular messenger app Whatsapp. Whilst Whatsapp is encrypted and so virtually impossible for a government to monitor, it is still likely to create a climate of fear and self-censorship in Malaysia, said Weiss. Many in Malaysia have already reported a quietening down of outspoken voices on social media. “It does seem like a pretty stark tightening of the reins,” said Weiss. “It’s going to be a nasty campaign.” • This article was amended on 13 April 2018 to include the university where Meredith Weiss works."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/05/killer-robots-south-korea-university-boycott-artifical-intelligence-hanwha","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T08:20:48Z","webTitle":"'Killer robots': AI experts call for boycott over lab at South Korea university","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/05/killer-robots-south-korea-university-boycott-artifical-intelligence-hanwha","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/05/killer-robots-south-korea-university-boycott-artifical-intelligence-hanwha","fields":{"headline":"'Killer robots': AI experts call for boycott over lab at South Korea university","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Artificial intelligence researchers from nearly 30 countries are boycotting a South Korean university over concerns a new lab in partnership with a leading defence company could lead to “killer robots”. More than 50 leading academics signed the letter calling for a boycott of Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and its partner, defence manufacturer Hanwha Systems. The researchers said they would not collaborate with the university or host visitors from KAIST over fears it sought to “accelerate the arms race to develop” autonomous weapons. “There are plenty of great things you can do with AI that save lives, including in a military context, but to openly declare the goal is to develop autonomous weapons and have a partner like this sparks huge concern,” said Toby Walsh, the organiser of the boycott and a professor at the University of New South Wales. “This is a very respected university partnering with a very ethically dubious partner that continues to violate international norms.” The boycott comes ahead of a United Nations meeting in Geneva next week on autonomous weapons, and more than 20 countries have already called for a total ban on killer robots. The use of AI in militaries around the world has sparked fears of a Terminator-like situation and questions have been raised about the accuracy of such weapons and their ability to distinguish friend from foe. Hanwha is one of South Korea’s largest weapons manufacturers, and makes cluster munitions which are banned in 120 countries under an international treaty. South Korea, along with the US, Russia and China, are not signatories to the convention. Walsh was initially concerned when a Korea Times article described KAIST as “joining the global competition to develop autonomous arms” and promptly wrote to the university asking questions but did not receive a response. KAIST’s president, Sung-Chul Shin, said he was saddened to hear of the boycott. “I would like to reaffirm that KAIST does not have any intention to engage in development of lethal autonomous weapons systems and killer robots,” Shin said in a statement. “As an academic institution, we value human rights and ethical standards to a very high degree,” he added. “I reaffirm once again that KAIST will not conduct any research activities counter to human dignity including autonomous weapons lacking meaningful human control.” KAIST opened the research centre for the convergence of national defence and artificial intelligence on 20 February, with Shin saying at the time it would “provide a strong foundation for developing national defence technology”. The centre will focus on “AI-based command and decision systems, composite navigation algorithms for mega-scale unmanned undersea vehicles, AI-based smart aircraft training systems, and AI-based smart object tracking and recognition technology”, the since-deleted announcement said. South Korea’s Dodaam Systems already manufactures a fully autonomous “combat robot”, a stationary turret, capable of detecting targets up to 3km away. Customers include the United Arab Emirates and Qatar and it has been tested on the highly militarised border with North Korea, but company executives told the BBC in 2015 there were “self-imposed restrictions” that required a human to deliver a lethal attack. The Taranis military drone built by the UK’s BAE Systems can technically operate entirely autonomously, according to Walsh, who said killer robots made everyone less safe, even in a dangerous neighbourhood. “Developing autonomous weapons would make the security situation on the Korean peninsula worse, not better,” he said. “If these weapons get made anywhere, eventually they would certainly turn up in North Korea and they would have no qualms about using them against the South.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/radical-conservation/2018/apr/09/little-dodo-manumea-tooth-billed-pigeon-samoa-critically-endangered-hunting","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T07:40:52Z","webTitle":"Caught in the crossfire: little dodo nears extinction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2018/apr/09/little-dodo-manumea-tooth-billed-pigeon-samoa-critically-endangered-hunting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/radical-conservation/2018/apr/09/little-dodo-manumea-tooth-billed-pigeon-samoa-critically-endangered-hunting","fields":{"headline":"Caught in the crossfire: little dodo nears extinction","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nearly two hundred years after the extinction of the dodo, Sir William Jardin – a Scottish naturalist and bird-aficionado – described another odd, bulky, island pigeon. From the island of Samoa, this one was distinguished by a massive, curving bill that sported tooth-like serrations on its lower mandible. Given the strangeness of the creature, Jardine set it in its own genus and dubbed it Didunculus – the little dodo. Genetic evidence has since confirmed that the tooth-billed pigeon – or little dodo – is one of the closest living relatives of its long-deceased namesake. Today, the little dodo is at the very precipice of extinction, but it remains nearly as cryptic and little known as it did when Jardin gave it a scientific name in 1845. The little dodo “is the last surviving species in its genus,” Rebecca Stirnemann said. “The Fijian and Tongan species [of the little dodo] are both extinct. It is the national bird of Samoa and appears in many of the stories often in association with chiefs.” Stirnemann, a New Zealand biologist and conservationist, has spent the last eight years working in Samoa to safeguard the nearly extinct bird, which is known locally as the manumea. Stirnemann, currently with conservation New Zealand NGO Forest and Bird, says there are three threats to the manumea or little dodo: destruction of forest on the island, invasive mammals (especially cats) and pigeon hunting. As to the latter, it’s not that local Samoans are hunting the little dodo itself, but in shooting the Pacific imperial and other pigeon species they sometimes kill the little dodo as “bycatch.” “Action is urgently needed to stop [the pigeon hunting] if the manumea is not to be lost,” said Stirnemann, who recently detailed the crisis in a paper in Biodiversity and Conservation. The pigeon trade has been banned in Samoa since 1993, but is widely flouted. Stirnemann saw her first manumea when she was working on conserving another local bird, the mao. “It is a beautiful species with a giant red hooked beak,” Stirnemann said of the little dodo. “I have been hooked ever since.” There are few quality photos of the species in existence. Often, it’s either a photo of a dead animal or a gloomy shot that makes the animal look almost vulture-like. In reality, the species is quite colorful: with a blue-gray head and breast and rufous-coloured wings. The genetic evidence shows that the little dodo was the first of its of its relatives to branch off, making it the most ancient of the dodo’s cousins. It’s so strange and rare, the Zoological Society of London’s Edge of Existence programme has placed the little dodo as number 16 pn their list of the 100 most evolutionary distinct and globally endangered birds. Stirnemann and her team have conducted numerous surveys for the bird only to discover that it is even more at risk than first believed. The best estimate is that less than 250 birds survive; the real number could be considerably lower. However, conservationists got a piece of good news in 2013 when they were able to confirm the bird is still breeding. “Our research to date shows that the lowland forests are critical for this species. Unfortunately that is also the area where most people live and where hunting pressure is the greatest,” Stirnemann said. Conducting interviews with 30 hunters, the team found that nearly a third had accidentally killed more than one manumea during their career. Two birds were shot as recently as 2016. Using a government database the scientists estimate that the illegal pigeon hunting trade on Samoa kills a staggering 22,000-33,000 pigeons a year. “The government is currently undertaking a campaign to build awareness of the problem in the villages,” Stirnemann said. “They are doing a good job, but still more needs to be done if the manumea is to be saved. The consumers of pigeons are a really pig problem. If you are eating pigeon you are affecting the likelihood that manumea will continue to exist.” The pigeon trade isn’t driven by hungry islanders looking for cheap meat, according to the scientist. Instead, pigeon proved to the most expensive meat on the island – nine times costlier than chicken. “People often think that forest meat is consumed by poor people who have to hunt in the forest to survive,” Stirnemann said. “But across the world patterns…are emerging that rich people are driving wildlife trade. They are often unaware of the impacts they are having since they often do not enter the forest.” According to the study the richest 10 percent of Samoans ate nearly half of the killed pigeons on the island. The total trade is worth less than £100,000. Stirnemann said that an awareness campaign is needed to shift Samoan behavior before its too late. “The Samoan government and local NGOs are talking with villages to reduce hunting and to educate people. We are also producing a children’s book which will raise awareness of the issue and educate children to love the forest,” Stirnemann said. “My worry is that time is…running out for the manumea and hunting is still occurring.” A number of organisations have been involved in little dodo conservation efforts including the Rufford Foundation, the Falease’ela Environment Protection Society (a local NGO), the Auckland Zoo, the Darwin Initiative and the Samoan government. But more funds and efforts from the international community are urgently required, according to Stirnemann, if the species is to be pulled back from the brink. “There are many pressures on Samoa’s funding with the climate change crisis,” she said. “However, there are some amazing people in Samoa with the passion to save the forest and the native birds.” The decline of the little dodo and of pigeons in general on the island – Stirnemann says that the Pacific imperial pigeon population has fallen dramatically in Samoa – is likely having a large impact on the diversity and health of the island’s forests. “[The manumea] is an extremely important species in Samoa because it is a critical seed disperser or forest gardener,” Stirnemann said. “Other animals and birds cannot do the same job because they have smaller mouths and therefore eat smaller seeds. The large beak and mouth of the manumea allows it to feed and swallow large native trees seeds whole...replanting and maintaining the forest.” It took only a century for humans – and the animals they brought with them – to wipe the dodo off Earth’s stage. Somehow, though it’s cousin – the little dodo, tooth-billed pigeon or manumea – has managed to live alongside humans for over three millennia. That may be about to change: without rapid, decisive action, the little dodo will very likely follow its cousin into oblivion. And humanity will have another species’ extinction hanging around our necks – our collective millstone. “When you lose the manumea you lose the natural farmer of Samoa,” Stirnemann said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/05/ending-melbournes-toxic-culture-sally-warhaft-on-why-shes-vying-for-mayor","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T03:57:14Z","webTitle":"Ending Melbourne's 'toxic culture': Sally Warhaft on why she wants to be mayor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/05/ending-melbournes-toxic-culture-sally-warhaft-on-why-shes-vying-for-mayor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/05/ending-melbournes-toxic-culture-sally-warhaft-on-why-shes-vying-for-mayor","fields":{"headline":"Ending Melbourne's 'toxic culture': Sally Warhaft on why she wants to be mayor","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The election to choose a new lord mayor of Melbourne is emerging as one of the most intriguing in a generation, with high-profile broadcaster Sally Warhaft announcing she will stand as an independent to clean up the “toxic culture” at town hall. Warhaft, 48, has never been a member of a political party nor stood for political office. She was the editor of the Monthly magazine before quitting in 2009 after falling out with board members. She has a PhD in anthropology and works regularly for the Wheeler Centre in Melbourne and as an ABC radio host. The byelection for lord mayor is being held via postal ballots and concludes on 12 May. It is being held to replace Robert Doyle, who resigned after two councillors accused him of sexual harassment and assault. Doyle continues to deny the allegations. Warhaft acknowledged the special circumstances surrounding the election. She said it was time for women to stand because it is almost 30 years since Melbourne had a female lord mayor. “Disrespect to women has been found to have existed [at town hall] at a moment where there are increasing calls for women to stand up,” she said. “I felt that I wanted maybe eight or 10 independent women to put their hand up to really contest this run and you can’t keep wanting that and not do it yourself. “The idea that we can have any leadership position in public office in 2018 that hasn’t been occupied by a woman in three decades is unfathomable.” Warhaft said she would not be standing if she did not think she could win, but she acknowledged she had little money so far to run her campaign. Frontrunners are Sally Capp, the executive director of the Property Council of Victoria, a lobby group for developers, and Greens councillor Rohan Leppert. Other candidates so far are former independent federal MP and anti-violence campaigner Phil Cleary, businessman Gary Morgan, Liberal member and former city councillor Ken Ong and Labor’s Jennifer Yang. The Greens believe they have their best chance to wrest the mayoral position for the first time, as the council’s boundaries include progressive inner-city suburbs as well as the CBD. Its vote at previous council elections has been steadily increasing, particularly due to high numbers of students living in the city. Leppert is 33 and would be the first openly gay mayor if elected. Warhaft said Capp was a “remarkable, accomplished woman”, but now was not the time to elect someone with close ties to the property industry. Capp has had a long career in business, was the chief executive of the Committee for Melbourne and the first female board member of the Collingwood football club. She has stood aside from her position at the Property Council and announced she would be taking no donations from developers. “The idea that the keys to town hall could be handed over to somebody so closely connected to the developers … the Property Council, if they could pave the Yarra in concrete and build apartments on it I think they would,” Warhaft said. “What town hall needs right now is a break from all connections of influence.” Warhaft said her main priority would be affordable housing at a time of rapid population growth and frenzied development. “If we keep going with city rents and prices the way we are, we’ll end up in a city where only the very rich will be able to live,” she said. “The people who make the city tick will be forced further and further away.” Warhaft also wants a “complete review” of the $250m Victoria Market development project championed by Doyle but recently rejected by Heritage Victoria. She said improving the council’s culture was as long-term project and would not be fixed simply by banning alcohol at town hall, which some candidates have floated. An inquiry into the sexual harassment allegations found a boozy culture under Doyle. “Councillors are not children,” Warhaft said. “I think the staff and councillors have every right to enjoy a drink after work as much as any other workgroup. The problem is deeper than that. It’s about the character and the tone that you bring to the office. It’s about revising all the policies that we know now were lacking in terms of structures.” The journalist and former councillor Stephen Mayne said Warhaft was a strong candidate because “anyone who can fill in for Jon Faine [on ABC radio] can be lord mayor of Melbourne, because it’s a similar strategy, where you have to be quick, you have to be across multiple issues, you have to be a good communicator and people have to be prepared to talk to you”. But he said the favourite at this stage was Leppert, whom he described as “the hardest-working, most intelligent and scrupulously honest councillor”. Mayne said Capp had a distinguished career before joining the Property Council and “she commands respect from both sides of politics – you need a lord mayor that everyone will talk to”. “There’s a unified ‘Stop the Greens’ campaign,” he said. “It’s everyone against the Greens – Liberal, Labor, they all want to stop the Greens. Labor is very focused on stopping the Greens in the inner city.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2018/apr/05/making-the-rba-the-peoples-bank-would-shake-up-the-big-four-so-its-worth-a-try","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T02:46:33Z","webTitle":"Making the RBA the People's Bank would shake up the big four – so it's worth a try | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/apr/05/making-the-rba-the-peoples-bank-would-shake-up-the-big-four-so-its-worth-a-try","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2018/apr/05/making-the-rba-the-peoples-bank-would-shake-up-the-big-four-so-its-worth-a-try","fields":{"headline":"Making the RBA the People's Bank would shake up the big four – so it's worth a try","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On Wednesday the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, proposed the creation of a People’s Bank in which customers were able to borrow from the Reserve Bank. The proposal is being pitched as a housing affordability measure, but in reality the impact would be limited. And yet the possible wider economic benefits make it a policy worth considering. The idea of a People’s Bank is not a new one. In 2009 a group of economists, including Joshua Gans, Nicholas Gruen and John Quiggin, argued for a public entity – operated through Australia Post – that would offer basic savings, payments and wealth management products. Last year Gruen argued for the Reserve Bank to compete for home loans and superannuation. He argued that we don’t really have a private banking sector – it is a “public-private partnership” given the RBA operates in effect as the wholesale supplier to the banks and is “effectively guaranteeing their debts if they can’t meet them”. The banks then “upsell” RBA services back to us. His analogy is that while the internet has meant consumers are able to deal directly with the wholesaler and get great benefits (such as buying a plane ticket from the airline’s site rather than a travel agent), in banking we still operate as though the split between wholesaler and retailer is set in stone. And that split is, to say the least, quite profitable for the retailers. Consider that the cash rate is now 1.5% points below the 3% bottom that occurred during the GFC. But the current average mortgage rate for owner occupiers is just 0.55% points below the bottom reached in 2009: Prior to the GFC, the average standard variable mortgage rate was just 1.8% points above the cash rate; now it is 3.7% points. For small businesses it is even worse – the average small-business overdraft loan has shifted from 3.85% points above the cash rate to now 7.15%points: Yes, the cost of financing has increased since the pre-GFC times of cheap money, but it has not continually become more expensive for banks to raise finance, despite the increasing margin between the cash rate and their loans. The Greens proposal – which follows that advocated by Gruen – is for the RBA to lend up to 60% of the value of a home loan to owner occupiers at the cash rate plus 0.5% points. The rest of the loan would be covered by having a 40% deposit or by borrowing from a commercial bank. Now clearly, this would distort the market. Gruen suggested last year that such a proposal would see “blood on the streets” as the banks would fight hard to protect their businesses. The reality is the current home loan market doesn’t have much competition. In February, the big four banks accounted for 81% of owner-occupier home loans and 85% of investor loans: Now this in itself is not a great concern. Certainly our top five banks account for an above-average slice of the market compared with other nations, but other nations have a bigger share controlled by the top three banks than does Australia: But just because the system is not out of the ordinary doesn’t mean it is not in need of a shake-up. The concern is the impact of the policy. The Greens propose limits the loan size to $500,000 – which is currently just above the $450,000 average owner-occupier mortgage in New South Wales, and well above the $400,000 average mortgage size in Victoria – and also offers it only to those with no other property holdings. This would limit its impact on housing prices – especially if combined with the removal of first-home buyer grants. Given as well such loans would not be available for investors, it would involve owner occupiers being able to operate more equally with those who are valuing their ability to purchase on the basis of using negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts. But while the Greens are pitching it as a housing affordability measure, as a demand side measure it would see an increase in prices of houses to account for the ability to borrow more. Also, given the 60% cap it would benefit most those who could raise a 40% deposit and not have to go to a commercial bank for the other 30% to 40%, which would likely be at a higher rate than is currently offered. Overall, the amount repaid on the loan might be smaller but the initial affordability improvement would likely be minimal. And the issue at the moment with housing affordability is not the loan repayments but the initial hurdle of the deposit and the price of the house. Nicholas Gruen does not really pitch this as a housing affordability measure but an economic reform that would put the money supply more in the hands of government, make the bank system more efficient and more akin to a public utility, and which would raise revenue – possibly around $10bn a year at the current cash rate level. He suggests such a change could lift our GDP by up to 3% due to this increased revenue not actually being a tax increase but just shifting money from banks to the government, and it then also being able to allow other tax cuts. But it would also mean the RBA would be the major player in a system in which the central bank itself is the lender of last resort and regulator. How would this affect the stability of the system – because surely the commercial banks would face higher lending costs given the most stable side of their business has just been sliced away? Would the RBA’s lending standards be maintained – and who would ensure that they are maintained? How would it affect Australia’s credit AAA rating? All of these questions, coupled with the extreme level of banking lobbying that would occur, do make it a politically toxic proposal. But just because it might upset the status quo of the financial system and anger the hell out of the big four banks, does not mean the policy should be dismissed out of hand. Indeed that very anger alone possibly makes it worth considering."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/06/sports-quiz-week-masters-commonwealth-games-football-golf","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T10:51:55Z","webTitle":"Sports quiz of the week: Masters, Neighbours and an Expendable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/06/sports-quiz-week-masters-commonwealth-games-football-golf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/06/sports-quiz-week-masters-commonwealth-games-football-golf","fields":{"headline":"Sports quiz of the week: Masters, Neighbours and an Expendable","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/04/nasim-najafi-aghdam-youtube-shooting-demonetisation-payments-father","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T17:34:17Z","webTitle":"YouTube shooting suspect was angry site stopped paying her, father says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/04/nasim-najafi-aghdam-youtube-shooting-demonetisation-payments-father","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/04/nasim-najafi-aghdam-youtube-shooting-demonetisation-payments-father","fields":{"headline":"YouTube shooting suspect was angry site stopped paying her, father says","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The woman who allegedly opened fire at YouTube’s headquarters in a suburb of San Francisco, injuring three before killing herself, was apparently furious with the video website because it had stopped paying her for her clips. Police in California named the shooter as Nasim Najafi Aghdam. Aghdam was “upset with the policies and practices of YouTube”, San Bruno police chief Ed Barberini said at a press conference on Wednesday. “This appears to be the motive for this incident.” No evidence had been found linking her to any individuals at the company where she allegedly opened fire on Tuesday, he said. Police gave her age as 39 but her brother said she would have turned 38 on Wednesday. Two of the three shooting victims from the incident were released from the Zuckerberg San Francisco general hospital on Tuesday night. A third, a male in his 30s, is currently in “serious condition”, a hospital spokeswoman said Wednesday morning. A fourth victim had been injured, but not shot, in the incident, police said. Aghdam had visited a local gun range on Tuesday morning before going to YouTube’s headquarters, Barberini said. A Smith &amp; Wesson 9mm semiautomatic handgun, legally registered to Aghdam, was found at the scene. The alleged shooter parked at a nearby business and appeared to have entered YouTube’s campus through a parking garage. Local law enforcement agencies are facing questions about a warning her father gave police before the shooting, including that he was concerned she was headed to YouTube’s headquarters, which is more than 500 miles from San Diego, where she lived. Police in Mountain View, where Google is headquartered, confirmed that they interviewed Aghdam early in the morning before the shooting, after they found her sleeping in her car. The department described her as “calm and cooperative”, and said that “at no point during our roughly 20-minute interaction with her did she mention anything about YouTube, if she was upset with them, or that she had planned to harm herself or others.” While her father told police later that morning that Aghdam was upset with YouTube over her videos, and might have come to the area as a result, he did not “mention anything about potential acts of violence or a possibility of Aghdam lashing out as a result of her issues with her videos,” the department said in a statement. The Mountain View department had not passed on any information about Aghdam to police in San Bruno, where YouTube’s headquarters is located, before the shooting, the San Bruno police chief said. Aghdam’s online profile shows she was a vegan activist who ran a website called NasimeSabz.com, meaning “Green Breeze” in Persian, where she posted about Persian culture and veganism, as well as long passages critical of YouTube. Her father, Ismail Aghdam, told the Bay Area News Group from his San Diego home on Tuesday that she was angry with the Google-owned site because it had stopped paying her for videos she posted on the platform, and that he had warned the police that she might be going to the company’s headquarters. Ismail Aghdam said he reported his daughter missing on Monday after she did not answer her phone for two days. He said the family received a call from Mountain View police at about 2am on Tuesday saying they had found her sleeping in a car. He said he warned them she might be heading to YouTube because she “hated” the company. In a statement, the Mountain View police department said officers had found Aghdam asleep in her car around 2am on Tuesday morning, and that they had asked her a series of questions, including “if she was a danger to herself or others.” Agdham told the officers that she was currently living out of her vehicle while she was looking for the job, a common occurrence in the Bay Area, which has struggled with a homelessness crisis that has left even working families with jobs living out of cars and RVs in quiet areas of Mountain View and Palo Alto. Aghdam had been reported missing on 21 March, the San Bruno police chief said. Questions about whether a better law enforcement response to tips might have preventing an attack have emerged repeatedly in the wake of high-profile gun attacks. The Federal Bureau of Investigation admitted that it failed to properly follow up on two separate tips that the gunman in the Parkland, Florida, massacre in February was planning on attacking a school, including a call from a person close to suspect Nikolas Cruz, who noted that he was armed. The incident also raised questions about security measures at Sillicon Valley’s lavish tech campuses. Law enforcement officials are “always looking for opportunities to harden targets or making environments as safe as possible for people who work there”, Barberini said. A female shooter is a rarity: an FBI study of 160 “active shooter” incidents between 2000 and 2013 found only six incidents, or 3.8%, were perpetrated by a female shooter. Five of those six shootings were incidents of workplace violence, where women attacked current or former co-workers at the places they had worked. All of these female shooters used handguns. One recent mass shooting, the 2014 San Bernardino attack, had a joint male and female perpetrator. Married couple Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik opened fire on a holiday party of Farook’s co-workers in 2014 with military-style rifles, leaving 14 people dead. Aghdam’s social media posts highlighted pro-vegan views and criticised animal cruelty. She was also quoted in a 2009 story in the San Diego Union-Tribune about a protest by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals against the use of pigs in military trauma training. “For me, animal rights equal human rights,” Aghdam told the Union-Tribune at the time. Many video creators on YouTube have spoken publicly in recent months about their frustrations with YouTube’s new restrictions on which videos can earn ad revenue, a change that many said hurt smaller video producers. YouTube’s policy changes were announced following corporate outrage last year when an investigation found that ads for mainstream brands were being shown on YouTube videos advocating racist and extremist views. But video creators have said that YouTube’s response to this problem, including having some channels “demonetized”, ended up hurting small, independent video producers who tackled serious topics, not just videos propagating extremist content. “She was always complaining that YouTube ruined her life,” Nasim’s brother, Shahran Aghdam, told the Bay Area News Group on Tuesday night. YouTube terminated Aghdam’s account following the shooting. Her Instagram and Facebook accounts have also been removed. A screenshot of a video posted on Aghnam’s YouTube channel before it was taken down showed her complaining that “YouTube filtered my channels to keep them from getting views”.

Arsène Wenger believes Lacazette played through a knee problem for several weeks earlier in the season, affecting his performance. That problem has been corrected by surgery and Lacazette is fully fit but Wenger may yet choose to keep his former record signing on the bench once more in a quarter-final he believes is “50/50”. “I think we are [ready to see the best of Lacazette] because I realise now that he was not himself for a while,” Wenger said. “That explains why his goals dried out. He was always adamant – ‘I’m OK, I’m OK’ – but players are like that. “It was not traumatic, he was a good player but I think in the last seven, eight games he played he was not completely free with his knee. Unfortunately in our job you need your body and that’s why when you are not 100% you cannot play well.” Wenger has been questioned previously over his approach to the French forward after dropping him from the starting XI in several fixtures, including the trip to Manchester City. Lacazette was also substituted regularly, a fact Wenger put down to the player being “a bit less sharp” than necessary. With Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang cup-tied, Lacazette will be competing with Danny Welbeck for the centre‑forward role against CSKA, with the first leg at home on Thursday night. “Lacazette is ready to start,” Wenger said. “I have not decided whether he will but he is available and ready to start.” A substantial crowd is expected at the Emirates Stadium as Wenger hunts for his first European trophy since becoming Arsenal manager in 1996, a triumph that would also mean qualification for the Champions League. Against Stoke on Sunday there were empty seats across the 60,000-capacity ground. Wenger says his team now have to win back the fans through performances. “I don’t think Arsenal has a support problem,” he said. “It’s just that our fans are disappointed that we don’t go for anything strong in the Premier League. The target for us is not to count the fans in the stand. Our target is to focus on our performance, win the games and accept the public judgment. It’s as simple as that.” CSKA arrive in good form, standing third in the Russian Premier League. A side full of Russia internationals, they scored three goals away from home on the way to defeating Lyon in the last round. “Russian teams always have good technical level,” Wenger said. “Personally I have always had difficult games against Russian teams and CSKA are a strong side. I watched the match they played in Lyon and they played extremely well and created many chances. For me this tie is 50-50.” Arsenal (4-2-3-1, probable): Cech; Bellerín, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Ramsey, Xhaka; Özil, Wilshere, Mkhitaryan; Welbeck. CSKA Moscow (3-5-2, probable): Akinfeev; V Berezutski, Ignashevich, A Berezutski; Schennikov, Natcho, Dzagoev, Golovin, Nababkin; Musa, Wernbloom. Referee P Kralovec (Cz).

It feels as if TV land, in its infinite sexism, has decided she is too old to host one of the big singing competitions but too young to do cosy Sunday evening documentaries about trains or sparrows. In the interim period, she’s become Take a Break magazine incarnate, churning out exercise tips and heartfelt reactions to nearby sad things. So, in one sense, This Time Next Year (10 April, 8pm, ITV) is the perfect format for her, a real-lives sobfest where people show up and say how they want their life to change, then “through the magic of TV” we immediately see them a year later. Well, what we actually see is Davina walking across the studio to be replaced by one-year-older-Davina, wearing the same dress and the same haircut but with the weight of her own mortality resting a few pounds more heavily on her shoulders. It is an appealing conceit on paper: who wouldn’t like to press a button and see whether they’ll be thinner, happier and loved? But the idea faces some obvious issues in execution. Firstly, the stories picked are too soppy: we get a baby who is deaf but is going to hear; a mother and daughter who want to shed 15st; a couple who are trying IVF; a woman who wants to win Miss World; and a woman who needs reconstructive face surgery. Each one comes with a heart-wrenching film about their struggle and a maudlin piano accompaniment. It’s like Comic Relief without the relief. For a show like this to work, there needs to be light and shade. I want to see a woman come out with her tub-of-trash boyfriend who’s eating Cheerios from the packet while they’re being interviewed. She’ll say to Davina: “I’m going to dump him, move to Lisbon and start writing my screenplay,” and then they come back a year later and he’s moved in, isn’t paying any rent and she’s the social media intern for Southern Rail. Otherwise, it just doesn’t feel real. The other issue is that as soon as they come through the “NEXT YEAR” door you can normally see whether they’ve achieved their goal or not (spoiler: they all have). Once Davina has cackled and told them how amazing they look, they go back to show their journey. But by that point who cares? You know how things pan out. They should call the show We Spoiled the Ending. ITV tries about 40 of these weird, shiny-floor formats a year and they nearly all get cancelled after one series, yet there is a clever failsafe mechanism that could mean that this show runs for ever. For there to even be the option of a third series, the producers would have to have already recorded the “this year” segments for 2019. And lo and behold, the production company has confirmed that the next series is already commissioned – pretty unusual for this kind of format. Using this strategy the show could stay on television indefinitely, lest producers have to tell a bloke in a wheelchair that the footage of him walking for the first time won’t air because ITV has chosen to replace it with, oh, I don’t know, a Keith Lemon-hosted live version of Tinder where people pick a sexual partner by swiping through 100 people on a giant human merry-go-round."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/shortcuts/2018/apr/04/the-wedding-singer-adele-and-the-rise-of-celebrity-ministers","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T15:50:00Z","webTitle":"The wedding singer: Adele and the rise of celebrity ministers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2018/apr/04/the-wedding-singer-adele-and-the-rise-of-celebrity-ministers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/shortcuts/2018/apr/04/the-wedding-singer-adele-and-the-rise-of-celebrity-ministers","fields":{"headline":"The wedding singer: Adele and the rise of celebrity ministers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It has been revealed that Adele took on the role of best man, wedding planner and minister at her best mate Alan Carr’s wedding earlier this year. According to Carr, she offered her Los Angeles home for the ceremony, was the performer for the first dance, organised the honeymoon and even got ordained so she could marry him to his long-term partner Paul Drayton. Sadly, no footage of the ceremony exists, but, at a guess, it included a few more expletives than the average Church of England sermon. Adele is not the only celebrity to have been ordained. At getordained.org, the Universal Life Church has made it easy for anyone to become a minister in minutes – and, according to its website, more than 20 million people have taken up the offer. Now, it seems, no showbiz wedding can do without a star-turn in a dog collar: Jonah Hill officiated the wedding of Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine; the Ibiza wedding of Judge Rinder was led by Benedict Cumberbatch; Tom Hanks paid $35 so he was able to preside over the wedding of Allison – Marnie from Girls – Williams; Sir Ian McKellen officiated at the wedding of Patrick Stewart; and Stevie Nicks married the singer Vanessa Carlton. I know most of us like to sniff at modern celebrity trends such as crystals and vagina steaming, but, honestly, those weddings sound way more fun than sitting in a church for an hour while a vicar the couple has only met twice recites the same old spiel, or, worse, tries to jazz things up with some off-the-shelf jokes: “(Groom’s name)’s passion for (lame hobby) has had to take a backseat in the run-up to the wedding ceremony. But don’t worry, (Bride’s name), you’ve now got a lifetime to put up with it! (Pause for polite laughter).” Unless you are capital-R religious, why wouldn’t you want a celebrity there, roasting the best man and posing for selfies with the kids? Of course, most of us don’t have an A-list celebrity friend, but that isn’t necessarily a problem. Both Joan Rivers and Kathy Griffin have officiated weddings for fans who asked nicely – one can only imagine the things they said about the bridesmaid dresses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/08/wonderstruck-review-elegantly-interwoven-stories-todd-haynes","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T07:00:25Z","webTitle":"Wonderstruck review – enchanting interwoven stories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/08/wonderstruck-review-elegantly-interwoven-stories-todd-haynes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/08/wonderstruck-review-elegantly-interwoven-stories-todd-haynes","fields":{"headline":"Wonderstruck review – enchanting interwoven stories","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In Wonderstruck, Todd Haynes weaves together two stories that are not just parallel, but effectively mirror images of each other. It’s a device that many have found contrived, but I enjoyed the unconventional structure, plus the unfussy approach to disability in a film that is aimed at younger audiences. Millicent Simmonds, who also appears in the newly released A Quiet Place, stars as Rose, a deaf girl, in a black-and-white segment set in the 1920s. Haynes uses deaf actors for many of the key roles in this strand, which nods, through score and design, to the tradition and techniques of silent cinema. The second story features Oakes Fegley as Ben, a boy from the 70s midwest who has lost his hearing as a result of an accident. In contrast to Rose’s story, Ben’s is colour-saturated and almost hyperreal. There’s an elegant symmetry to these intertwined tales, which started life as a semi-graphic novel by Brian Selznick. Both children are without mothers; both set out on a solo quest to New York; both end up in the Museum of Natural History. And while the film’s conclusion is needlessly dragged out, gorgeous work by cinematographer Edward Lachman, costume designer Sandy Powell, production designer Mark Friedberg and, particularly, composer Carter Burwell all help to carry the film."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/08/dont-blame-facebook-taking-data-most-pubishers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T06:00:21Z","webTitle":"Don’t just blame Facebook for taking your data – most online publishers are at it too | John Naughton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/08/dont-blame-facebook-taking-data-most-pubishers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/08/dont-blame-facebook-taking-data-most-pubishers","fields":{"headline":"Don’t just blame Facebook for taking your data – most online publishers are at it too","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a good metaphor must be worth a million. In an insightful blog post published on 23 March, Doc Searls, one of the elder statesman of the web, managed to get both for the price of one. His post was headed by one of those illustrations of an iceberg showing that only the tip is the visible part, while the great bulk of the object lies underwater. In this case, the tip was adorned with the Facebook logo while the submerged mass represented “Every other website making money from tracking-based advertising”. The moral: “Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica problems are nothing compared to what’s coming for all of online publishing.” The proximate cause of Searls’s essay was encountering a New York Times op-ed piece entitled Facebook’s Surveillance Machine by Zeynep Tufekci. It wasn’t the (unexceptional) content of the article that interested Searls, however, but what his ad-blocking software told him about the Times page in which the essay appeared. The software had detected no fewer than 13 hidden trackers on the page. (I’ve just checked and my Ghostery plug-in has detected 19.) And the point of this? The NYT is just doing what every other publication that lives off “adtech” does: tracker-based advertising. These publications, Searls wrote, “don’t just open the kimonos of their readers. They bring readers’ bare digital necks to vampires ravenous for the blood of personal data, all for the purpose of aiming ‘interest-based’ advertising at those same readers.” This is what security guru Bruce Schneier meant when he observed that “surveillance is the business model of the internet”. (Pedantic columnists – like this one – might object that he meant the web rather than the internet, but since many people cannot distinguish between the two, we’ll let that pass.) The fundamental truth highlighted by Schneier’s aphorism is that the vast majority of internet users have entered into a Faustian bargain in which they exchange control of their personal data in return for “free” services (such as social networking and search) and/or easy access to the websites of online publications, YouTube and the like. The big question for those of us who study this stuff is whether internet users really appreciate the nature of that pact. And if they don’t, what would it take to alert them to it? At the moment, the omens don’t look too promising. The huge fuss caused by the Cambridge Analytica revelations, for example, has generated a predictable #deletefacebook frenzy in liberal echo-chambers, but outside of those it’s not clear that everyday Facebook users are much affected by the controversy. Granted, recent opinion polls cast doubt over the level of trust people have in Facebook over privacy, despite advertisements the firm ran in British and US newspapers apologising to users. But I doubt that that scepticism will translate into people actually boycotting Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger. And although the company’s share price has tumbled, investment analysts are still unsure about whether this is a temporary blip or a real crisis. It might just turn out to be like the VW “Dieselgate” fiasco, in which the share price plummeted but eventually stabilised. Big though Facebook is, however, it’s only the tip of the web iceberg. And it’s there that change will have to come if the data vampires are to be vanquished. The good news is that we already have some useful tools available – most of them free – to every internet user; and some potentially heavy artillery is arriving in May. On the tools front, there are browser plug-ins such as Disconnect Private Browsing, Privacy Badger and Ghostery. Installing any one of these tends to administer a salutary shock, because they instantly reveal (and enable you to block) the startling number of snoopers who are covertly tracking your online activity. And anyone who uses public wifi in cafes, airports and other places really ought to fork out for some VPN (Virtual Private Network) software to protect them from tracking and preserve their anonymity. In our current online world, only the paranoid thrive. The heavy weaponry is the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which becomes law in May. It says that people must be able to easily learn who has their personal data, and what they are doing with it. And it mandates that people must have confidence that no other parties receive these data. If it’s rigorously enforced (which could be a big “if” unless data protection authorities are properly resourced) it could blow a massive hole in the covert ad-tracking racket – and oblige us to find less abusive and dysfunctional business models to support our online addiction. So let’s resolve not to allow the coming crisis to go to waste. What I’m reading Photon opportunity If you want to put our current squabbles into perspective, ponder Icarus, the furthest star from Earth seen so far by the Hubble space telescope. The photons that hit Hubble’s image sensor left Icarus 9bn years ago, which means we’re looking at it as it was when the universe was a third of its current age. There’s a wonderful account by Katyanna Quach in the Register of why we’re able to see it now. Trash talk Mark Zuckerberg’s enthusiasm for “helping people become more open” stands in contrast to his obsession with protecting his privacy.

The problem of the posthumous album","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“After much consideration we have decided to finish what we started,” the remaining members of the Cranberries wrote on their website this month, announcing their first new album since 2012. Dolores O’Riordan, who died earlier this year, had already finished recording her vocals: there’s no sense her parts would have needed to be imagineered. However, the ouija board of what dead musicians “would have wanted” is a faint and often baffling instrument. Posthumous albums come in two forms: the Cobble and the Legacy. The former is the least lovable. Michael Jackson’s first posthumous release, 2010’s Michael, was so threadbare that his family strongly questioned whether it was him singing on three of its tracks – the so-called Cascio Tapes. “I immediately said it wasn’t his voice,” mused brother Randy on Twitter when he heard them. Artistically, Cobbles are normally justified on grounds of completism: that they “tell us something new” about the artist, and occasionally turf up the odd gem that “deserves to see the light of day”. On that score, something like Jackson’s Do You Know Where Your Children Are, from his second posthumous album, Xscape (2014), ticks all boxes: both a solid jam and a jarring lyrical premise. Cobbles can also offer Stalinesque revisionism: some of Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes’s verses on TLC’s 3D – released seven months after her death in 2002 – were spliced together from old solo album cast-offs. There was even a delayed ouija conjure from obsessively private, label-hating control freak Kurt Cobain; his 2015 soundtrack Montage of Heck – a series of solo sonic doodles and Beatles covers – only saw light of day when the Nirvana well had run dry. But the Legacy form of posthumous album brings its own issues. The artist is aware the end is near and, as they face the final curtain, they’ll state their case, of which they’re certain. Johnny Cash did it best on his American Recordings series. But after 1991’s Innuendo – a convincing effort for a band in their third decade – Queen went to Switzerland to make Made in Heaven, the lurid fever dream of a man trying to transcend his failing body; a sentimental Freddie crooned that “this could be heaven for everyone”. Its message for the ages: the unnerving sense that when we rub up against the Reaper, there is often no great clarifying insight to make sense of our tangled lives. Which is why perhaps the best kind of posthumous record is another category altogether: the Null, ie the one that stays in the can for ever. When Universal Music CEO David Joseph destroyed the demos for Amy Winehouse’s third album, it was a long-term investment. He may have lost a sack of cash but he won the loyalty of every artist on his roster.

A high-school romance with a thematic nod to Lubitsch’s The Shop Around the Corner, it ticks all the beats and boxes of the genre. Except that the central character, Simon (Nick Robinson), is a closeted gay teen who strikes up an anonymous email exchange with another boy on the brink of coming out. And just like that, an alternative gay narrative is written, one that doesn’t end in inevitable heartbreak and suffering. It’s highly unlikely you’ll read a review of this film that doesn’t contain the word “adorable”. It’s equally unlikely that you’ll be able to watch it without grinning from ear to ear. Directed by Greg Berlanti, the powerhouse TV producer of The Flash, Green Lantern and Political Animals, this is mainstream cinema with mass appeal. As such, it lacks the edge and angry energy of, say, 120 Beats Per Minute, also out this week . This is, after all, gay cinema dressed in jeans and hoodies rather than tutus and tiaras. It’s also gay cinema that tiptoes coyly around any actual sex. But Love, Simon is warm, reassuring and relatable to a whole new generation of viewers. Perhaps that makes it, in its mild-mannered way, almost as important a work as 120 Beats Per Minute."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/12/all-women-rallye-aicha-des-gazelles-du-maroc","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T08:00:26Z","webTitle":"'No phones, no GPS, no men': The all-female off-road rally like no other","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/12/all-women-rallye-aicha-des-gazelles-du-maroc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/12/all-women-rallye-aicha-des-gazelles-du-maroc","fields":{"headline":"'No phones, no GPS, no men': The all-female off-road rally like no other","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Over the course of an average year, the Sahara desert plays host to a wide variety of automotive sporting events, but none like the Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles du Maroc. The off-road rallies typically held in this vast, desolate automotive playground utilize modern GPS and mapping technology, last only a couple of days and predominantly, if not entirely, consist of male competitors. Every year during the last week of March, however, 330 adventurous women from nearly every corner of the planet gather in Morocco for one full week of competition designed by women, for women. For the rally’s competitors, referred to as ‘Gazelles,’ points are deducted for requesting mechanical assistance or diverging from the most direct route between checkpoints, meaning they are penalized for sidestepping any of the obstacles the desert throws their way. Those who have never been to the Sahara might imagine a relatively consistent landscape – endless miles of flat, sandy terrain – but in the desert’s northwestern edge the scenery can change dramatically from one mile to the next. From behind the wheel of an off-road vehicle drivers will witness the diversity of the terrain in rapid succession, the rocky ground below their tires switching from slippery sand to bumpy pebbles to jagged rocks to towering mountains and back again with little indication of what challenge lies around the next bend. One moment they’re driving through herds of wild camel grazing in the flat grasslands, the next they’re climbing wave after wave of tsunami-sized sand dunes that give little traction even to tires built specially for desert driving. “I wanted to make an intelligent rally, rather than an adrenaline rally; something that went beyond just putting your foot on the accelerator and advancing along in a straight line,” said the event’s founder, Dominique Serra, speaking through a French translator in her mobile office one evening midway through the competition. “I had to come up with a concept that would prevent people from driving fast.” Serra first conceived of the rally, now in its 28th year, as a member of France’s largest employer association, MEDEF. “Women were not being represented in the automotive industry, and I was asked to find a way to empower these women,” she explained. The first Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles was held in 1990, and consisted of nine French teams of two. In its 2018 iteration the rally welcomed 165 teams from 16 countries in four different vehicle classes, with a majority competing in the 4x4/truck category. In addition, nine teams competed this year in dune buggies, five teams raced each other in crossovers and five more drove fully electric cars through a modified course that allowed for sufficient charging time between legs. The world’s most responsible rally Even with a modified course those driving electric vehicles had to overcome the significant challenges associated with traversing off road terrain in vehicles designed primarily for urban driving, but Serra says their incorporation last year was a natural next step for what she labels a “responsible rally.” In 2010, the Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles became the first automotive competition to obtain the international environmental certification in accordance with the ISO 14001 (2004) standard, and those painstaking efforts are plainly visible at the ‘bivouac’ or base camp where competitors mingle, eat and set up camp each night. All garbage produced there is either recycled or incinerated, with food waste donated to local farmers as animal feed and plastic water bottles converted into building material in local villages. “They take the empty water bottles and fill them with sand to use as building blocks,” said Serra. “All of the C02 emissions are offset. Even the mechanic’s area, which is a potential source of pollution, every measure is taken so that not a drop of oil hits the ground.” The medical teams that support the rally also provide free consultations and assistance to villagers in this remote region of Morocco, many of who have no other access to health services of any kind. The organization is also involved in local initiatives that help build schools, daycare services, provide job training to women, donate wheelchairs and glasses and much more. As a direct result of these efforts the Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles is the only event of its kind to bear the Moroccan royal coat of arms, which can be found on the left shoulder of each competitor’s uniform vest. “There are a huge number of motor sports that go on in Morocco – this is the world’s playground for off road races – but this is the only one that has that level of respect from the host country,” said Serra, who was awarded the Order of Ouissam Alaouite, the country’s equivalent to America’s Legion of Merit or France’s Legion of Honour, by Morocco’s King Mohammed VI in 2013. “He follows the rally every year, and he appreciates the efforts we’ve made for Morocco.” A rally to the starting line While the event officially kicked off with an inspection and opening ceremony celebration in Nice, France, on 16 March, competitors have been preparing themselves and their cars for months. “The first part of the job, which is the biggest one, is to find sponsors,” French racer Julie Kohlman said. “You meet people, you talk to them about the event, you try to get money to register for the event, so that’s the first part.” While the event is primarily comprised of amateur drivers Kohlmann explains that they need to think and act like professionals in order to raise the nearly €15,000 (approximately $18,000) entry fee on top of the significant investments that needs to be put into their vehicles. “You need to have a good car, you need to prepare the car, and you need to know exactly what you want to do with the car,” she said, adding that each team is really comprised of three competitors, “the third being the car”. The view from mission control While the competitors are left to old-school navigation techniques behind the scenes a complex machine is plotting and tracking their every move. “From here we can know the position of each Gazelle team on the terrain, and we receive their position on a radar screen, like the ones used in aviation traffic control,” said Serge Barbieux, the rally’s assistant sport director, sitting behind a radar screen inside a trailer at basecamp. “A system installed in each of the cars, called Aerotrack, sends us the position of the car every five minutes.” While the onboard GPS system doesn’t reveal any information to the Gazelles about their position, it can be used to call for mechanical or medical assistance if needed. Barbieux explains that there’s only one situation when the system is used to communicate with drivers unprompted. “If we see a car getting close to the Algerian border we phone them through the Aerotrack satellite box and we tell them just to check their navigation again,” he said. An air traffic controller in Lyon, France, the rest of the year, Barbieux sees a lot of similarities between his day job and his work at the rally. “It’s very similar to watch vehicles moving on a radar screen, taking care of them like I do with aircrafts, just without being able to help them,” he said. Barbieux also assists in testing the course before the competitors arrive, and helps conduct the day and a half long navigation training program that each Gazelle must complete in order to participate. “I train them before they come, but when I’m here I’m just on mute,” he said. When designing the course Barbieux explains that organizers need to set up multiple checkpoints and plot multiple paths for each of the six legs of the competition, which includes two marathon legs that span two days each. The variation in routes ensures that competitors are not unable to follow tracks or other cars to the next checkpoint, nor can they practice their designated route in advance. In fact, competitors are only provided the coordinates of their checkpoints at the daily 5am roll call. “A leg is around 50 to 180 kilometers, and these marathon legs are 290 kilometers as the crow flies, but the best [performances] will be around 320 kilometers,” he explained. While speed and timing is not a factor in the scoring checkpoints close at 7pm each day, providing some level of urgency to an otherwise unhurried competition. “It’s hard slowing down, because we’re used to speeding up,” said Keanna Erickson-Chang, a 23-year-old American professional rally competitor who is more accustomed to racing the clock. Though speed is less of a factor Erickson-Chang says it does provide an advantage. “We still want to keep our time up because as the sun gets higher the sand gets looser,” she explained, while releasing air from her tires to help increase traction in preparation for the slippery patch of sand dunes that sit between her and the next checkpoint. The all-female event welcomes men for the first time Since its inception Serra says there has been interest from men wanting to compete in a compass-and-map style rally, and this past November they finally got that opportunity when first annual Gazelles and Men rally welcomed mixed-gender and all male teams for the first time. “It’s exactly like the Gazelles, and you have a lot of former Gazelles that want to compete with their husbands,” said former competitor and current Gazelle and Men project manager, Maud Garnier. “It’s very funny because we were thinking wow, woman and husband in the same car, it will be very difficult, maybe we should have a ‘divorce’ button on the dashboard.” All jokes aside Garnier says the event was a success, and she’s proud to report that no divorce filings directly resulted. “It’s the first time a women’s rally has served as an example to a men’s event; usually it’s the other way around,” adds Serra. Towards an all-electric future While there is a designated E-Gazelles category with five competitors the rally actually included six electric vehicles this year. Car number 313 competed in the crossover section, and the vehicle – a modified Renault Zoe, Europe’s most popular electric vehicle – was piloted by two of the car manufacturer’s engineers. “We wanted to show that Zoe can do more than the electric cars, so we are with the crossovers [category], and we’re currently first,” said Carine Poisson, a power train control engineer for Renault. Team 313 ultimately placed second amongst the five crossover competitors. The team was followed throughout the competition by a support truck carrying emergency batteries, but the team would have been penalized for charging the vehicle more than once per day. As a result Poisson says she and her teammate had to consider not only the most direct path between checkpoints, but also the most battery conserving. “We’re not thinking in kilometers, we’re thinking in kilowatts,” she said. Car 313 was an ambitious experiment for Renault as well as for Serra, who hopes to host a rally that is 30% comprised of electric vehicles during its 30th anniversary in two years. “The direction the rally is going is becoming increasingly environmentally friendly, so that’s the focus right now,” she said. Serra hopes to see the event become entirely electric one day, adding another point to the laundry list of reasons why the Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles is unlike anything else in the sport."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"social-care-network/2018/apr/23/are-social-care-services-improving-peoples-wellbeing","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T09:28:19Z","webTitle":"Are social care services improving people's wellbeing?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2018/apr/23/are-social-care-services-improving-peoples-wellbeing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2018/apr/23/are-social-care-services-improving-peoples-wellbeing","fields":{"headline":"Are social care services improving people's wellbeing?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If the 2014 Care Act has one widely known ambition, it is that individuals’ wellbeing should be the over-arching consideration in all that councils do. Social care should focus on what makes the lives of each older or disabled person better. So, if promoting wellbeing is the acid test of the personalisation programme, how are councils doing? In 2016-17, a new measure was introduced. Councils had been required to survey service users annually. But how people rate their wellbeing is affected by many factors beyond a council’s control, such as the nature and severity of their condition, so NHS Digital devised a sophisticated method to control these factors, creating a measure of what it calls “the impact of adult social care”. The scale goes from zero (“no better than being dead”) to one (“full quality of life”). The national average score was 0.4. The lowest-scoring council was Kensington and Chelsea in London at 0.29 and the highest Sandwell in the West Midlands at 0.48. It is hardly encouraging that social care is leaving people closer to feeling “no better than being dead” than having a “full quality of life”, with no council getting past the halfway point. But the “postcode lottery” in provision enables us to know more about whether the Care Act is working. If it is, we can expect councils that spend more to be improving well-being most. Changes to the annual returns councils provide to NHS Digital mean we now know how many people each authority provides ongoing support to during the year and how much in total is spent supporting them. In 2016-17, Southend in Essex supported 3,260 people at home spending £19.1m, an average of £5,800 a person. At the other end of the scale, Wokingham in Berkshire supported 1,240 people at a cost of £24.1m, an average of £19,435 a person, almost four times as much. But Southend achieved a higher wellbeing score (0.41) than Wokingham (0.38). The 10% of highest spending councils averaged £15,930 a person and scored an average 0.4 for wellbeing; the 10% of lowest spenders spent £7,270 per person and averaged 0.39. The figures we used relate only to those in receipt of long-term support. There are separate returns showing numbers of people getting short term support and the amount spent on them. We excluded those. This significantly reduces any anomalies that might arise from “turnover” of service users. The good news if you live in Wokingham and are eligible for public support is that you will get a far higher level of support than someone in Southend with the same level of need. The bad news is that it won’t make much difference. These figures resonate powerfully with findings by Ipsos Mori last year. The pollsters studied data from the Health Survey for England and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Researchers found that the extent to which needs were met had little impact on people’s sense of wellbeing. The problem is the conventional understanding of “need”. People are typically asked about difficulties, the routines of daily living and what they can’t do. This creates a narrow focus based on weaknesses. This has two negative consequences for wellbeing: services address deficits in a way that undermines the autonomy and resourcefulness that people treasure, and overlook needs that are more important to the person’s sense of wellbeing, such as social contact. Given a choice, people may prefer to struggle on meeting their daily living needs and get support to meet the needs that will make their life better. In 2014 we noted that the legislature, through the Care Act, had created the legal framework for real change. However, we warned that the government’s strategy for implementing the act would undermine its ambitions. Our advice was unheeded. It is no surprise that Jeremy Hunt, now secretary of state for care as well as health, made no mention of the Care Act in his recent overview of what needs to happen in social care. But it can still be done. Government must divest itself of the belief that personal budgets will transform social care. We have set out how that belief is illusory. Eligibility of need must be replaced with affordability of need as the means to control spending. The things that really matter to people must be the foundation of all that happens. While the system may fall short because of resources, there will be two important changes. First is that what support is provided will be targeted on what really matters to the person. Second, the system will know the true gap between needs and resources. As the Local Government Association noted in its submission to the joint parliamentary committee inquiry into the future of social care, estimates of the funding gap fail to address needs either completely unmet or undermet. Hunt says he wants a system that addresses the “whole person” and gives them control. Neither can happen under a system where “need” is standardised and rooted in personal deficits. It can only occur if the lived experience of need becomes the foundation of all that happens. Hunt will then have the bonus of what any progressive secretary of state for health and social care needs: knowledge of the true cost of enabling all older and disabled people to have the level of wellbeing right for them.

But there can be a lot at stake – the auditions themselves aren’t cheap as most schools ask you to cough up between £35 and £85 just for the pleasure of applying, unless you qualify for a fee waiver. Then there’s travel and accommodation costs to consider. With all this in mind you’ll want to ace your auditions and give them your best shot. We asked students who’ve successfully auditioned to let us in on the unexpected things that can go wrong, the cringeworthy mistakes they wish they hadn’t made, and their top tips for getting noticed on the day. Jak Malone, 24, studying acting at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts What can go wrong: Looking back at my first auditions, I definitely wasn’t ready. I thought all Shakespeare had to be done in a posh voice. I’m mortified admitting this now, but I put on a received pronunciation (RP) accent for it, which is not what they want at all. They want to hear you. I also didn’t talk to anyone about my audition choices, I just went straight ahead and did them. It was a pride issue. I wanted to get in on my own merit and didn’t want anyone to help me. It wasn’t until I got onto a foundation course and took an audition technique class that I realised my mistakes. What Malone says you should do: If I were to do it again, I’d talk to people about my monologue choices. And remember, an audition panel is just trying to find your rhythm, so don’t go in there and present what you think they want, present yourself. I also catch other people’s nerves, so on audition days I like to keep to myself and be with my thoughts. If you want to go along the corridor to work on your pieces, or take a moment to reflect, breathe, or shut your eyes for a minute, then do it. Don’t feel pressured into doing what other people are doing. Michaela Blackburn, 20, studying acting at the London College of Music What can go wrong: In one singing audition, I showed the pianist the wrong tempo. I was nervous and went too fast. So when he started playing, I got really behind; it was a nightmare. I also didn’t prepare for some auditions as well as I should have, and woke up in the middle of the night feeling sick. Nerves can affect my voice, too. What Blackburn says you should do: The best way to beat nerves is to prepare. I eat or drink pineapple before an audition. It sounds odd, but it works for me because it clears my throat. It’s good to know what you do when you’re nervous, and what works for you to combat it. You also need to stand up to the little person in your head that’s saying you’re not going to do well. Ellie Ruiz, 19, studying musical theatre at Royal Central School of Speech and Drama What can go wrong: Looking back at my first (unsuccessful) auditions, I didn’t have a clue. Picking monologues should take a lot of consideration – but I didn’t know that then, so I just used Google, which was my biggest mistake. If you Google “female monologues”, you get a lot of random American plays, and I just picked one, hoping it would be good. Later, at my Central audition they asked me to do my monologue to a person and I blanked. I didn’t know her and I was looking into her eyes, trying to remember my words. I was connecting with her and reading her emotions, so I completely forgot my lines. I thought, oh God this is it, it’s over, but I remembered them in the end. What Ruiz says you should do: To pick a monologue, find a playwright you like and then look at all the different plays they’ve written. It’s best to stick with something close to you. Don’t worry if you forget your lines on the day. A lot of the time the panel will be impressed if you can recover from it. In fact, it can almost be good to mess up, so you can show them that. Obviously don’t do it on purpose, though. Griffin Mosson, 22, studying acting at Royal Central School of Speech and Drama What can go wrong: Occasionally an audition panel will throw quite a ridiculous direction at you, just to see if you can do it. For example, I’ve been asked to redo a monologue as a particular colour, like the colour red. I’ve also been asked to do a monologue as an animal, like a bear. That kind of redirection threw me completely in my first year of auditioning. I would do the same thing, just a tiny bit differently, so I didn’t feel like I was putting myself out there too much – but you need to stand out. In the beginning I also thought I could get noticed using my clothes. I wore a ridiculous Hawaiian shirt to some auditions, which makes me cringe. I found it in my cupboard and thought it made me look “studenty”. But I don’t think it made any difference – in fact it probably made an adverse difference. What Mosson says you should do: You might get a direction that you don’t fully understand. Often it’s just about throwing yourself into it and being brave. They want to see what kind of person you are and that you are willing to try. And wear what you want. Don’t overthink it. Follow Guardian Students on Twitter: @GdnStudents.

Into this growing gap between social housing and home ownership the build-to-rent model has given property developers a new way to profit from Generation Rent. In 2017, the burgeoning build-to-rent market, comprising purpose-built blocks of rental homes, attracted £2.4bn in investment and is forecast to grow by a further 180% over the next six years. The attraction for large pension and insurance funds, such as Legal &amp; General, is clear. They have the capital to develop large blocks of flats, which are let out and managed long term by a single company rather than being sold to individual landlords. This provides institutional investors with a fairly stable, long-term income stream. And for tenants, there’s a promise of a more streamlined experience, with bespoke, high-quality management rather than an unreliable, individual private landlord. Build-to-rent company Fizzy Living, for example, boasts of providing a five-star service and promises to complement the “hectic lifestyles of work-hard, play-hard professionals”. Tenants are typically offered longer tenancies than for standard rental accommodation, with contracts of up to three years or more, and other amenities, such as gyms, communal lounges and cinema rooms. Because build-to-rent has the potential to increase the supply of homes and improve conditions for renters, many in the property world, such as investment firm Venn Partners and consultancy Lichfields, have touted it as a way to solve the UK housing crisis. It has also received considerable government support, including a £1bn build-to-rent fund. But the benefits of build-to-rent come at a premium. One study found that London’s new private rental “communities” were, on average, 11% more expensive than rental properties nearby. In the Get Living development at Elephant and Castle in south London, renting a one-bedroom flat costs £1,841 a month. As the company requires a household income of 30 times the rent, you’d need to earn almost £60,000 a year to qualify as a tenant. As the government latches on to the promise of build-to-rent in accelerating housing supply, it seems likely that these schemes will be subject to less stringent requirements to provide affordable housing. So, despite suggestions that build-to-rent will empower Generation Rent, these high-spec products only really seem to be an answer for affluent young professionals. Meanwhile, a Shelter report in January found that half of families in UK social housing are being ignored or refused help when they report poor or unsafe conditions. Driven by the market for the market, build-to-rent is just another so-called solution that continues to allocate housing on the basis of wealth rather than social need.

Roberto Carlos had surged up the left but his cross was hooked high and when it began its descent, there did not appear to be an obvious opportunity. Zidane had other ideas. The speed with which he set his feet on the edge of the penalty area was the first feature of the goal, followed by the instinctive adjustment of his body. Then, it was all about the purity of the technique; the talent that marked him out as one of the greats. It was possible to see the parallel to Cristiano Ronaldo’s show‑stopping overhead kick for Real in Tuesday’s Champions League quarter-final, first-leg win against Juventus in Turin. In a heartbeat, Ronaldo had made the calculations and he seemed to levitate rather than leap. The balletic beauty was overtaken by the ruthlessness of the execution. “Mine was better,” Zidane, the Real manager, said with a grin, and he could afford to smile. Beforehand, his team had been doubted, as had he himself. It has been an underwhelming season on the domestic front, which has been scarred by the chasm that has separated Real from the league leaders, Barcelona – it stands at 13 points – and the Copa del Rey defeat by Leganés. It does not feel too long ago that Zidane was being discussed as a soon-to-be-ex Real manager. That was in November, after the Champions League group phase loss at Tottenham, which had come on the back of a league defeat at Girona. The alarm bells screeched. Juventus had not lost since 19 November. They had lost only once at home in the previous 75 matches in all competitions. They had conceded just twice in 17 Serie A games. Max Allegri’s team also had a score to settle from last season’s Champions League final, when Real had beaten them 4-1. At kick-off time, the atmosphere was feverish. Ronaldo helped to draw the sting with a third minute opener before he scored his ludicrously spectacular second on 64 minutes. He laid on the third for Marcelo and, at 3-0, the tie feels over. The acclaim for Ronaldo’s golazo began immediately, in the shape of a standing ovation from the Juventus support. It continued long into the night and the morning after. Corriere dello Sport described it as a “work of art.” Tuttosport said it was from “another planet”. “Cristiano made up the second goal,” Andrea Barzagli, the Juventus defender, said. “It’s a PlayStation goal. It will go down in history.” Gianluigi Buffon, the Juventus goalkeeper, said that Ronaldo ought to be compared to Diego Maradona and Pelé. The goal killed Juventus on every level and the concession to Marcelo was the consequence of their demoralisation, as was Paulo Dybala’s sending-off moments earlier. Ronaldo lifted himself and his team to a higher plane and, in the process, he forced Juventus to their knees. Yet Zidane’s happiness was rooted in something deeper, more fundamental. This was a team triumph and from one that was supposed to have been the underdog. A symbol of it was Isco, the attacking midfielder, whose position was difficult to define. He floated from side to side and in front of the midfield and, with Ronaldo and Karim Benzema adjusting in front of him, Real shifted from 4-3-3 to 4-4-2 to a diamond formation. He brought the options and the fluency, together with an injection of swagger. There was one jaw-dropping moment in the first half when he controlled an awkward high ball in deep midfield and, in one graceful movement, cushioned a pass out to Marcelo. It dropped on to the left‑back’s toe. It did not lead to much but it helped to set a tone for Real. They were here to play; to impose their class. Allegri noted how Real were “devastating with their final ball” and Isco was prominent in this area, setting up Ronaldo’s first goal. So was Luka Modric. With the early advantage, Real could punch on the counterattack and when they had the space, they bristled with menace. “Isco was very important between the lines,” Zidane said. “Everyone played great but Isco was excellent.” Real’s midfield was beautifully balanced, with the holding player, Casemiro, sometimes pressing as the most advanced out of himself, Modric and Toni Kroos, while at the back, Sergio Ramos and Raphaël Varane made a clutch of important first-half interventions. When Juventus thought they had got through, on 22 minutes, Keylor Navas made a wonderful reflex save to deny Gonzalo Higuaín. In the end, though, one man stood above the collective. No player has scored more Champions League goals than Ronaldo (119) and no player has won the competition in its current branding more times than him (four). “This is our competition,” the 33-year-old said. He and Real want more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/11/happy-brain-dean-burnett-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T15:47:17Z","webTitle":"The Happy Brain by Dean Burnett review – the science of happiness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/11/happy-brain-dean-burnett-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/11/happy-brain-dean-burnett-review","fields":{"headline":"The Happy Brain by Dean Burnett review – the science of happiness","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As a neuroscientist, comedian and Guardian science blogger, Dean Burnett knows that science communication is both important and hard to get right. Early in this book he expresses his frustration with the way that the media often sensationalise research to sell a story. In one newspaper, the following headlines all purported to reveal the latest scientific truth about how to be happy: “Forget cash – how sex and sleep are the key to happiness”; “Key to happiness? Start with £50k a year salary”; “Why the secret to happiness is having 37 things to wear”… Readers would be forgiven for thinking that it’s all nonsense. So how does a responsible scientist condense all of the relevant research and make it accessible? The Burnett method is to combine a chatty style with hundreds of academic endnotes, interviews with “experts” (including Charlotte Church on fame and Rhod Gilbert on comedy) and personal anecdotes, and on the whole it is very effective. He begins by describing the parts of the brain – and why none of them is solely “responsible” for processing any emotion. He runs through some chemical neurotransmitters and what we know about their roles, such as dopamine (reward and pleasure), endorphins (a response to pain and stress) and oxytocin (the “cuddle” hormone). He rattles through studies, building a picture of what exactly tickles the human brain and why. Including tickling. Laughter, it turns out, may originate among the temporal, occipital and parietal lobes, whose role is to “detect and resolve incongruity”. This really is explaining the joke on a minute scale, but who better qualified to do so? The first chapter, about “home”, deftly explains why our brains need stability, privacy and access to nature. Others cover the importance of love, sex, work and friendships. But Burnett repeatedly thwarts any attempts at neat hypotheses. “Personality and individual differences,” he writes, “risk undermining much of my argument so far.” He knows that the human brain loves a narrative, and he stitches together his findings with stories from his own past and his current quest. Scanning the brain is very expensive, he tells us, so studies that use it tend to be small and rarely repeated, making their results not very scientifically sound. Nevertheless, he asks a friendly professor if he can strap himself into a local fMRI machine. “After about five minutes, he finally stopped laughing.” There are also some comedy footnotes: “Just to be clear, at no point should you literally attempt to physically break a brain down into its components.” Writing about neuroscience is a burgeoning field, and often controversial – see Cordelia Fine’s books about the “science” of gender, or Susan Greenfield’s on the damaging effects of new technologies. But (apart from one small quip about Brexit) Burnett stops short of getting political about what’s in our heads. Money “triggers the reward pathway in the brain somewhat like a drug”. A lack of control over our work lives “can be psychologically harmful, sometimes even clinically so”. The workings of the insula and somatosensory cortex could explain why some people think rape victims or poor people deserve their lot. And our social status is so critical to humans that mocking or criticising others can give us pleasure. The brain can be ugly. Sometimes, Burnett seems to go too far, such as when he claims that oxytocin causes racism. The study he cites, “Oxytocin Promotes Human Ethnocentrism”, by KW De Dreu et al, makes fascinating reading – but it only claims very slight evidence that oxytocin motivates “out-group derogation” – hardly enough to justify “oxytocin makes you racist”. But it would not be scientific of this review to draw any disparaging conclusions from this sample size of one exaggerated comment among several hundred painstakingly referenced observations. Burnett is himself reluctant to suggest easy answers. “What makes an adult brain happy? That can’t be answered in any succinct way, sorry”, he writes. Yet he also points out that in a world that causes such stress to our brains, “experiencing happiness may well be more of a necessity, rather than an indulgence”. So, at the risk of over-simplifying: to be happy you should have a home that is safe, big enough and near green spaces; work at a rewarding job that offers autonomy and novelty; earn enough money and find love – but don’t focus on pursuing money or love; do things you enjoy; laugh a lot, but don’t be a comedian … Oh, and benefit from consistent and loving parenting. First, though, you should read this funny, stimulating and rewarding book. You’ll be happy you did. • The Happy Brain: The Science of Where Happiness Comes From, and Why is published by Guardian Faber.

The joke? Announcing that a new Ikea superstore was coming to town, creating 4,000 much-needed jobs in a region plagued by unemployment. “This is the culmination of a long struggle with other cities in the North of France! I fought and I congratulate myself!” she tweeted. But guess what? April fool! Ikea wouldn’t dream of opening a store in a weird little backwater that suffers the indignity of being twinned with Maidstone! It was all a joke! Everyone has to stay unemployed! LOL! You might be tempted to call Cayeux’s prank the worst April fool of all time, but that would be to discount every other April fool in the history of the world. Listen, April Fools’ Day is terrible. It is a sweatbead on a blister on a pimple on the anus of humanity. It is the uncontested low point of every year. It’s where humour goes to die a million agonising deaths. Do not doubt my sincerity when I say this: April Fools’ Day should be banned. At least Cayeux’s prank was an actual prank. At least people initially fell for it, before they realised that it was just a cruel trick designed to play on their deepest fears. That’s rare these days. Increasingly, April Fools’ Day is becoming little more than an opportunity for brands to demonstrate their catastrophic Photoshop skills. Such as Lego, which this year announced a vacuum cleaner that sorts bricks by colour and size. Or Virgin Australia, which last year said it was replacing human cabin crews with dogs. In 2015, during a liveblog for this publication, I discovered that House of Fraser had uploaded a picture of a woman standing next to a horse and written “Horse of Fraser” on it, and that was its April fool. That was it. That was literally it. A picture of a horse with the word “horse” written on it. Ha! You sure tricked us into thinking that, what, horses exist? Was that what you were trying to achieve? You cheeky pranksters. Some people have said that, in an era where terms such as “fake news” and “post-truth” are prevalent enough to corrode our trust in government and the media, April Fools’ Day has become little more than a painful reminder that all institutions are ultimately fallible. Others have said that the whole day is a sad indictment of the sort of harmful banter culture that stems from centuries of toxic hegemonic masculinity. But that’s not why I want to ban April Fools’ Day. I want to ban it because it’s rubbish. At the very least, it has strayed far from its intended purpose. There was a time when April Fools’ Day was a bucket of water balanced on a door, or clingfilm stretched across a toilet. It was a doughnut filled with mayonnaise, or a stock cube in a shower head. It was a day when you were allowed to irreparably damage your relationship with people you care about by being truly horrible to them. Sure, it was still terrible – maybe even more so because you would end up covered in urine and gravy – but at least you could focus your hate on the perpetrator. You can’t do that with a picture of a horse. Who has the energy? Robots can’t take my job – I’m irreplaceable At first glance, the automation revolution sounds terrifying. It has just been reported that 66 million workers are likely to be replaced by robots in the coming years, potentially robbing them of their money and identity. But I’m an optimist. The world has time to prepare for this seismic change, and if governments couple the rise of robotic workers with something like universal basic income, it could usher in what one writer has called “the greatest thing to ever happen to human culture”. Crawling out from beneath the tyranny of work, humanity could flourish like never before. The ideas we could have. The dreams we could chase. As a species, we would become unrecognisable. We would spiral upwards, endlessly, in a soaring dance of progress unprecedented in the entire history of life on Earth. At last, we would know true freedom. Except for me. Because robots can’t do my job yet. Sure, they can build cars and process logistics and calculate tax and diagnose illnesses. But, so far, no program exists that can sufficiently offer a pithy sideways look at the world. You could argue that this is because it is a totally unnecessary job that adds nothing whatsoever to the human condition, and the world would roll on completely unchanged if it disappeared tomorrow. And I would agree. But, still, here I am. So laugh it up, replaceable proles. Two decades from now, you will be living in a glittering new Renaissance era that values high-minded leisure pursuits above all else. But I will still be stuck down here in the mines, glumly tapping out a succession of fitfully amusing and lightly satirical articles, scraping in a commensurate wage as your ancestors did before they knew any better. Google, if you are reading: please invent an opinionbot to put me out of my misery. If only quokkas could take selfies Quokkas are our only true source of joy. They are like great big guinea pigs who love humans and perpetually look as if they are having their tummies tickled. This is why Instagram is full of quokka selfies. But no more. Search #quokkaselfie and you’re shown a pop-up cautioning you about potential animal abuse. It’s a sensible precaution, but who wants to live in a world without quokka pictures? Google, scrap that opinionbot idea and start making quokka-sized smartphones. After all, upload a quokka selfie and we’ll be happy for a day, but teach a quokka how to upload selfies and we’ll all be happy for ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/06/bilal-zafar-heckled-by-fireworks-display-standup-actor","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T13:00:34Z","webTitle":"Bilal Zafar: ‘I was heckled by a fireworks display’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/06/bilal-zafar-heckled-by-fireworks-display-standup-actor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/06/bilal-zafar-heckled-by-fireworks-display-standup-actor","fields":{"headline":"Bilal Zafar: ‘I was heckled by a fireworks display’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen … Dinner Party Conspiracy from The Armando Iannucci Show.

Only if it’s served cold","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I hadn’t thought about peanut milk before now. I imagine few people have – it doesn’t exist in the UK – but then the US company Elmhurst Dairy, which recently swapped cows for nuts, started making it, and suddenly peanut milk became a bit like that scene in Call Me By Your Name involving Timothée Chalamet and a peach. One of those things you haven’t much thought about until you do, and then can’t undo that thought until you’ve had a go. So, I did – with peanuts, not peaches, that is. Peanut milk is the latest addition to the canon of nut milks that includes coconut, cashew, hazelnut and almond. I made my own over Easter weekend, when the shops were shut. Luckily, the pub up the road was open so, after the lamb, I headed to the White Horse, ordered half a cider and four bags of salted peanuts, gave a false story about why I needed so many and went home. Following the simplest recipe I could find, I rinsed the salt off 200g of nuts, and put them in water to soak overnight. The next morning, the nuts visibly swollen, I blended them with half a litre of clean water and added vanilla essence and two prunes. (The recipe called for dates but this time the White Swan couldn’t deliver.) I blended it for about a minute, poured the liquid through an Eve Lom muslin cloth and ta-dah! Peanut milk. I can’t emphasise enough how weird room-temperature peanut milk tastes. Chilled, however, it tasted nicer than any nut milk I’ve bought: a thick water with a fleshed-out peanut flavour. The global market for dairy alternative drinks is expected to surpass £11.4bn this year. Almond milk has long been king of the game but almonds love water, which is far from ideal for the environment. (There’s a whole subplot in Netflix’s The Good Place in which a character thinks he’s been sent to hell for using almond milk, despite knowing this.) So maybe this is peanuts’ big chance. My version had almost as much protein as dairy milk – more than is found in almond alternatives – so it could prove popular with gym types, too. One problem with non-dairy milks is semantics. We have to call it something, but can we call it milk? Palm Things, which is about to launch drinks made from cashew and coconut, has opted for the increasingly popular moniker “Mylk”. In homage, possibly, to the cows they used to milk before they switched to nuts, Elmhurst Dairy call its drink “Milked Peanuts”. Do nut milks have a responsibility to mimic their dairy equivalents? Unless you have to eschew milk for dietary reasons, should ditching dairy mean accepting that there are some things you can no longer enjoy in the same way? As with most things in life, I’m unsure – but what I do know is that peanut milk is good served cold, in a smoothie, and gross with cereal. And, Oscar-wise, Chalamet was robbed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/04/the-2018-bafta-nominations-from-love-island-to-king-charles-iii","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T11:49:27Z","webTitle":"The 2018 Bafta nominations: from Love Island to King Charles III","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/04/the-2018-bafta-nominations-from-love-island-to-king-charles-iii","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/04/the-2018-bafta-nominations-from-love-island-to-king-charles-iii","fields":{"headline":"The 2018 Bafta nominations: from Love Island to King Charles III","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The 2018 Bafta nominations certainly cover the full spectrum of contemporary television. Honouring both a high-end product – two nominations for the BBC’s mock-Shakespearean drama, King Charles III – and one of the lowest: a nod for the summer shag-fest Love Island. There’s a similar range in the best actor category, where the late Tim Pigott-Smith is properly remembered for his career-crowning portrayal of King Charles III in Mike Bartlett’s play, alongside another personal-best performance by a veteran: Sean Bean as a Catholic priest who can bring peace to everyone except himself, in Jimmy McGovern’s Broken. But those famous faces are competing with two actors just either side of 30: Jack Rowan and Joe Cole, both alumni of Peaky Blinders, but noticed by Bafta for work in the dramas Born to Kill and Hang the DJ (Black Mirror) respectively. Diversity of a different kind is shown, in a continuation of the Academy’s deliberate and necessary drive to recognise a wider range of performing talent, with welcome success for two inventive comedy shows with majority black casts: BBC2’s sketch show Famalam, and ITV2’s time-slip sitcom, Timewasters. Another progression is that, for the first time, all the shows listed in the scripted comedy section include a woman in the writing team. Sharon Horgan is nominated for Catastrophe along with Rob Delaney, who are up against Daisy May Cooper, whose This Country (co-written by and co-starring her brother, Charlie Cooper) continues the impressive awards season performances of BBC Three, two years after the network became an online-only service. It also has three of the nominations in a new category, Short Form Programme, that sensibly recognises the way in which streaming has released programming from the tyranny of a grid of 30 to 90-minute slots. Jed Mercurio’s supreme police procedural Line of Duty, with three nominations, achieves sensible redress for being oddly sidelined last year. Among those who might reasonably feel peeved to have been overlooked in 2018 are Peter Kay (although Car Share co-star Sian Gibson is included), ITV’s classy crime-drama Unforgotten, and The Great British Bake-Off, which can claim to be the most successful transfer from one network to another. The multiple documentaries about Diana, Princess of Wales, 20 years after her death, seem to have cancelled each other out. In a culture concerned about fake news, fiction that looks like fact has become the dominant genre: the most successful comedies (including Detectorists, This Country, Car Share) are shot like documentaries, while many of the most-noticed dramas are fact-based: the BBC’s The Moorside and Three Little Girls and ITV’s Little Boy Blue dramatised respectively: the disappearance of Shannon Matthews in Yorkshire, the Rochdale sex abuse scandal, and the murder of 11-year-old Rhys Jones in Liverpool. As the BBC’s journalistic service is one of its licence-fee selling points, it must concern director general Tony Hall that the BBC has no nominations at all for News (where Sky, Channel 4 and ITV share the podium), and only one for Current Affairs. BBC producers and unions may cite budget cuts to help pay for the broadcaster’s vast layers of management, but the increasing tendency of that torrent of bosses towards editorial caution must also be a factor. The UK’s oldest broadcaster had a clean-sweep, though, in single documentary, where the suspicion that some Bafta juries favour emotive content may be shown by nods for the Rio Ferdinand documentary about his bereavement, Chris Packham on his Asperger’s, and Louis Theroux meeting anorexics. All traditional British broadcasters, though, will be unnerved by the awesome firepower of the shortlisted quartet in the International section. Very few homemade dramas come near the swagger and expansiveness of the dramas Big Little Lies (Netflix), Feud: Bette and Joan (FX), and The Handmaid’s Tale (Hulu). And no recent UK factual series begins to compete with the authority and elegance of Ken Burns’s and Lynn Novick’s 10-part, 17-hour The Vietnam War (PBS). In 2017, all those shows were screened here, by Sky, Channel 4 or BBC4. But, in a likely future in which such material disappears entirely behind a subscription pay wall, traditional British schedules could start to look very thin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/04/russian-counter-propaganda-exploiting-uk-weaknesses-over-spy-poisoning","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T13:19:53Z","webTitle":"Russian counter-propaganda exploiting UK weaknesses over spy poisoning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/04/russian-counter-propaganda-exploiting-uk-weaknesses-over-spy-poisoning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/04/russian-counter-propaganda-exploiting-uk-weaknesses-over-spy-poisoning","fields":{"headline":"Russian counter-propaganda exploiting UK weaknesses over spy poisoning","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A diplomatic drive in the UK to corner Russia for the Sergei Skripal poisoning has been set back in the past 24 hours, due in part to self-inflicted wounds – notably Boris Johnson’s loose language – but also to Russia’s ability to keep up a relentless counter-propaganda assault that British ministers seem unable to match. The controversy underlines how rapidly UK intelligence material becomes shop soiled in heated political debates. The chief executive of the UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory issued a statement saying samples taken from Skripal and his home had been identified as the military-grade nerve agent novichok. This could have come across as an affirmation of the British position. After all, no country other than Russia is known to have novichok. The idea was to solidify the UK’s case before a meeting of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) on Wednesday, convened at the request of Russia. Instead the story emerged as a negative – that UK scientists could not state unequivocally that Russia had been the source of the nerve agent. Arguably, it was never the expectation that scientists could reach such a level of certainty. The best British position had been always to say that there was no other plausible explanation for the attack other than Russian involvement, either directly or by their failing to control stocks of nerve agent. Unfortunately for the UK government ministers began to say that overwhelmingly the only explanation was Russian state involvement. In an interview with a German broadcaster, Johnson went further, saying he had personally spoken to scientists at Porton Down and that they had been unequivocal about Russian responsibility. It is possible the government scientists have now backtracked, at least in public, but Johnson has form in making unforced errors in sensitive foreign policy fields, notably in implying that the British-Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was working as a journalist in Iran, rather than on holiday, before she was detained. In the case of Skripal it seems likely the foreign secretary overstated or misremembered what Porton Down had told him. But in a battle for world opinion, precision matters. Many EU governments, notably Germany, have gone out on a limb with their own public opinion to back Britain’s case against Russia, so it is critical that the British case is coherent and coherently stated. Russia will also be delighted that on Wednesday morning it spotted a now deleted Foreign Office tweet from last month that attributed responsibility, saying Porton Down had found that the novichok used in the Salisbury attack was definitely “produced in Russia”. The Foreign Office admitted that the tweet had truncated remarks by the UK ambassador to Russia, Laurie Bristow, and had left a misleading impression. At one level this episode is trivial but anything that discredits the UK on social media is gold for Moscow. There has been a second, wider, problem for the UK. Ministers have been forced to wait on the painstaking criminal inquiry in which police, scientists and intelligence agencies cannot produce evidence to order. The OPCW laboratories to which the nerve agent samples were sent need at least another week to complete their work. Scientific research and political rhetoric operate at different velocities. That has left a vacuum in which Russia, a master of counter-propaganda and sowing doubt, has been relentless. Jean Pascal Zanders, a former chemical weapons project leader at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, claims Russia is testing its arguments through social media pickup and has managed to “turn the tables on London”. On Wednesday Sergei Naryshkin, the director of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, suggested that the Skripal poisoning was a “grotesque provocation rudely staged by the British and US intelligence agencies”. Even though many of the arguments have been ludicrous, Zanders said they had a cumulative impact designed to depict Russia as a victim. Much of this was for domestic consumption, but was also designed to isolate the UK. Britain has made something of contradictory Russian explanations, calling them a diversion and saying they are apiece with the way Russia rebutted charges of doping by its athletes and how it denied that the Assad regime was using chemical weapons in Syria. With a bluntness not normally associated with the diplomatic service, UK diplomats attended a broadcast Russian government briefing on Skripal, effectively challenging the briefer’s bluster on live TV. It may yet be that the OPCW, as opposed to British scientists, puts Russia back on the defensive by declaring the Salisbury nerve agent was novichok of a kind produced by the Russian state. But the OPCW works cautiously and by consensus. It may also be the case that police work tracks down passenger records that identify a Russian likely to be responsible for delivering the nerve agent. But there is a ready audience on the left and the right across Europe, including in the UK, willing to disbelieve the intelligence services in the wake of the Iraq war fiasco or to view the services merely as tools of government. What seemed like a rapid diplomatic triumph for the UK is emerging over time to be an uphill struggle. For Russia and now the UK, too much of their mutual reputations are at stake to ever concede defeat. This may yet be a long, bruising, struggle in which the evidence gives neither side the vindication they crave."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/06/leaked-minutes-show-labour-at-odds-over-antisemitism-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T18:10:26Z","webTitle":"Leaked minutes show Labour at odds over antisemitism claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/06/leaked-minutes-show-labour-at-odds-over-antisemitism-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/06/leaked-minutes-show-labour-at-odds-over-antisemitism-claims","fields":{"headline":"Leaked minutes show Labour at odds over antisemitism claims","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The depth of the split in the Labour party’s ruling body over antisemitism and racism has been laid bare in leaked minutes that show fierce disagreements over disciplinary action. Key supporters of Jeremy Corbyn attempted to block action against Labour members facing complaints, according to the minutes obtained by the Guardian. Momentum’s founder, Jon Lansman, and the MP Jon Trickett were two prominent figures who voted to limit disciplinary action in the three contentious cases that went to a vote, multiple sources said. Lansman has been outspoken in recent days on the need for Labour to take antisemitism cases in the party seriously. The minutes of the meeting in early March show how fractured the disciplinary body has become. Sources said cases involving Corbyn supporters were regularly automatically viewed as being politically motivated. Among the cases which allies of the Labour leader pushed to rule out the possibility of expulsion were: A member who allegedly made threats when another raised concern about antisemitism and blamed Zionists for causing his problems in the party. A member accused of making antisemitic remarks on social media. A member accused of using a racial slur against a black candidate. Almost all members of the national executive committee (NEC) elected on the leftwing slate acted as a block vote to try to minimise disciplinary action against several members at the committee’s disputes panel meeting in March, according to the minutes and sources at the meeting. Multiple sources have alleged that suspended members who were perceived as being sympathetic to Corbyn were defended, even when the evidence against them was overwhelming. “People were generally outraged at the scale of the defence of just anything. It’s all about control: control of the party and control of the processes,” one source close to the NEC said. Euan Phillips, who runs the campaign Labour Against Antisemitism, said he was losing faith in the management of complaints. “We have been reporting this anti-Jewish racism for months and months now assuming that the party and the ‘quasi-judicial’ disputes panel would take it seriously,” he said. “Anyone defending antisemitism should be off the NEC and out of the Labour party.” The panel in March was chaired by Christine Shawcroft, who was later forced to resign from the NEC after it emerged she had sent an email defending a Labour councillor accused of Holocaust denial. Among cases discussed included a member who is alleged to have blamed Zionists for causing his problems with the party after he was suspended over a confrontation with another member who had raised fears about antisemitism and Holocaust denial. Sources said Lansman and Darren Williams, one of the constituency party representatives, both argued the man’s case should not be referred for possible expulsion, but were overruled. The case did not go to a vote. Williams moved an amendment to defend another case where a woman is reported to have made antisemitic remarks on social media, as well as supporting George Galloway in Manchester Gorton against Labour. In both cases, trade union members and others on the NEC including MPs and councillors intervened and blocked attempts to just give the members a warning and training, instead referring them to Labour’s highest disciplinary body, the national constitutional committee (NCC), which can recommend expulsion. In a Facebook post after the meeting, Williams expressed anger that so many party members were facing possible expulsion. “It’s deeply disappointing to see party members put on a path to likely expulsion when the evidence of their supposed wrongdoing is far from compelling,” he wrote. The minutes also reveal Shawcroft refused to recuse herself as chair when the panel heard the case of a Labour councillor who has been accused of using a racist term to describe a black council candidate and co-ordinating with the party of the disgraced Tower Hamlets former mayor Lutfur Rahman against Labour. Shawcroft, an active member in Tower Hamlets who was once herself suspended for defending Rahman, was asked to recuse herself after other NEC members said she had acted as a “silent friend” of the councillor during his investigatory interview, but refused, the minutes said. Seven members of the NEC then voted to limit further disciplinary action, with several arguing the case was based on factional divides, but again they were defeated by other members. The case will now be heard by the NCC. Tower Hamlets councillor Rachael Saunders welcomed the decision by the NEC to refer the councillor for disciplinary action. “It has taken us a while to sort out Tower Hamlets politics, it is a good thing that we are now able to move forward and that there are consequences,” she said. All members of the NEC, including the leader and deputy leader, can attend NEC disputes panel meetings but Corbyn and Tom Watson were not at the meeting. Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, was the only one of the three shadow cabinet representatives who were at the meeting, with Kate Osamor and Rebecca Long-Bailey absent. Sources close to the NEC said disputes panel meetings now regularly go on for three hours. The body reviews the most serious cases, referred to them by party staff who make a recommendation for further action. The majority of cases discussed at the March meeting saw disciplinary recommendations accepted without a vote, though some after heated debate. Williams declined to comment, while Shawcroft said that she could not discuss individual cases but that members of the NEC were behaving in an appropriate manner. “Cases are presented for discussion, not for rubber-stamping,” she said. Saying that the discussions were in line with the recommendations of the report by Shami Chakrabarti into antisemitism, she added: “All complaints must be taken extremely seriously and looked at carefully. It’s therefore right that the panel fully consider each case and the different sanctions that can be applied. That’s what the meetings are for.” Lansman and Trickett did not respond to a request for comment. Richard Angell, director of Labour’s centrist pressure group Progress, said the votes at the meeting showed complaints were still treated as being politically motivated. “The new establishment may say one thing in public but in private they are using their political muscle to defend their friends and allies,” he said. “Training on antisemitism is for those who show remorse and want to change – like Naz Shah MP – not for those who double down and think they have done no wrong.” A Labour source said that the NEC panel was simply doing its job. “The role of the NEC disputes panel is to review and discuss cases to decide what disciplinary action should be taken, as happened in this meeting,” the source said. “Most decisions were unanimous, the few votes that took place were to decide what type of sanction should be applied, not whether action should be taken.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/04/paymetoo-women-earn-gender-pay-gap-action","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T12:22:37Z","webTitle":"We’ve set up #PayMeToo to ensure women earn what they deserve | Stella Creasy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/04/paymetoo-women-earn-gender-pay-gap-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/04/paymetoo-women-earn-gender-pay-gap-action","fields":{"headline":"We’ve set up #PayMeToo to ensure women earn what they deserve","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Women. Like men, only cheaper. And in 2018 we are discovering by just how much. The introduction of mandatory reporting has transformed the debate about the gender pay gap from a little-discussed dry set of statistics directly into staffrooms and workplaces across Britain, with explosive effect. The data shows in black and white just how few women are progressing within organisations across every area of the economy – whether in the public or private sector, gender still too often predicts pay. Yet even before all these reports have been made public, the backlash against any such scrutiny has begun. Angry voices decry the gender pay gap, saying it doesn’t exist, or that we’ve got it muddled with equal pay – something entirely different. Commentators such as Jordan Peterson, invited on to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme to discuss the gender pay gap on the day of the deadline for companies to report their results, claim women don’t have the skills to be top executives and don’t work the long hours men do, so the data is meaningless. Others say the gap just reflects life choices women have made; the “mummy pay penalty” for women who take breaks to have children or want to work part-time. Women, know your limits – and be paid accordingly. It’s telling that these pundits provide no evidence themselves to back up their prejudices – because the data there is proves their analysis is opinion, not objective fact. As the Office for National Statistics points out, women taking time out for childcare only explains some of the variation in pay. Only 36% of the gender pay gap could be attributed to specific characteristics such as differences in average age, job tenure, company size and occupation. Talk of the lack of women in comparable roles also misses the point that women aren’t in those roles to compare – it’s not that women are incapable of being top executives or working all the hours in the day, it’s that still too often they don’t get appointed to do so. These ideologically suspect attacks confuse causation with correlation; they reinforce social preconceptions that it is women who should sacrifice their careers if they start a family. It’s a view that dominates discussions about flexible pay, and in turn the persistent undervaluing of part-time work – because that’s for those who have “given up” ambitions for promotion and are earning pin money. Patriarchy has held us all back for too long with such rhetoric – tired old notions that there are boys’ jobs and girls’ jobs, and that gender dictates ability. Ryanair defends having a gender pay gap of 72% by pointing out how few women are pilots and how many are cabin crew. Their chief executive claims it is a “feature” of the airline industry, , as though a penis is required to be able to fly a plane. Yet even such biologically determinate arguments are blown apart by this data. In the NHS where 77% of the workforce is female, women still only account for a minority of senior leaders. It also doesn’t explain why even in companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer, where there is a smaller pay gap, the bonuses paid to women are still substantially lower. What these arguments do prove is that tackling the gender pay gap isn’t just about ensuring that access to shared leave, flexible working and job sharing is standard and used by both parents. It’s also about employers and their responsibilities when it comes to recruiting, retaining and promoting women in the first place. Responsibilities that, if ignored, manifest themselves in pay. Research shows women ask as often as men for a pay rise – yet men are four times more likely to get one. That women exhibiting the same leadership skills as men are judged completely differently. Responsibilities that start early too: a year after graduation women already earn on average £1,600 a year less than their male counterparts. In the fight for equality we must not let such voices gaslight women that the gender pay gap is a natural phenomenon. Instead we must use the data to drive action to bust open such stereotypes about what women are capable of and what kind of work/life balance every employee needs. Yet there are worrying reports already of women being told to “raise a grievance with HR” if they ask their managers about this data, or that talking about it could make them be seen as troublemakers. That’s why we started the “#PayMeToo” campaign – to give practical advice on how to talk about it at work and what rights employees have to do so, and show that MPs are ready to act if this conversation gets shut down. We know that this is not the full story on inequality in the workplace – with some companies not including partnership data, which is not mandatory, and the sole focus being gender and not ethnicity, class or disability. But we also know this data is telling us what James Brown sang – that it’s still a man’s world. #PayMeToo is about reminding us that it would be nothing without a woman or a girl. • Stella Creasy is Labour MP for Walthamstow"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/04/salisbury-poisoning-england-world-cup-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T11:36:37Z","webTitle":"Salisbury poisoning’s role in England’s World Cup downfall?

There isn’t one","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"To stress-test any theory properly you have to take it to extremes. We can now be confident England’s agonised relationship with the World Cup is a tractor beam into which everything gets sucked eventually. And I mean everything. The poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury is the latest event to be subsumed in the much bigger story of England’s mystifying decades of tournament underperformance. Over here the sports pages have earnestly contemplated what the fallout from the deployment of nerve agent on British soil means for Gareth Southgate’s squad as Russia 2018 looms into view, with much made of an intervention last month by one security expert. The Russians could insert contamination into the England side’s doping samples, Edward Lucas told the Jeremy Vine show, and they could nobble the referees and linesmen. They could also drug England players to “slow them down”. (Leave it – it’s too easy.) Over there the Kremlin’s troll hameau joined in the fun this weekend, with a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, declaring that all roads lead back to the decision to deny England hosting rights for the 2018 tournament. “It’s my impression that all they care about is taking the World Cup out of Russia,” Zakharova explained. “They will use any means. Their minds are only on that football, and God forbid it should touch a Russian football field.” If we are to understand this “any means” thesis, England are so bitter about losing out in the World Cup bidding that the state – or possibly just the FA chief executive, Martin Glenn – sanctioned a false-flag extrajudicial murder attempt in a bid to sabotage the bid that beat them to it. I mean … it comes to something when you realise you’ve seen less desperate excuses for England over the years. Naturally Ms Zakharova is far from the first politician to find herself irresistibly drawn to viewing the event via the prism of the Three Lions. Boris Johnson initially hinted that England might have to withdraw from the tournament, later clarifying his remarks to suggest he had simply meant the usual show of so-called dignitaries and officials might boycott. He later hopped back into the shit by agreeing that Vladimir Putin meant to use the World Cup much as Hitler had used the 1936 Olympics. This is the sort of argument that could be floated only by a foreign secretary who has no clue that Putin is far from engaged with the World Cup, as he was – intensely – with the Sochi Olympics, a circumstance not unrelated to the fact that Russia’s football team are currently ranked 63 in the world by Fifa. Then, of course, there was the culture secretary, Matt Hancock. “Actually the best response frankly to all of this would be for England to go to the World Cup in Russia and win it,” he said last month, apparently under the impression that Southgate has at least 11 Jesse Owenses on his hands. “If we won it,” Hancock continued, “we would be demonstrating that we have got the best football team in the world and it should be about that.” Thank you, secretary of state. None of this shows any signs of abating as the tournament grows closer and the Skripal investigation and related diplomatic manoeuvring continue to dominate the headlines. Indeed, it will only get worse. At some level you have to howl with laughter at the new layers of psychological pressure that are being added to players due to pull on the England shirt in Russia this summer. Over a series of recent tournaments England have shown themselves incapable of withstanding pressures such as being able to handle boredom, being exposed to the wrong sort of ball and being expected to beat Iceland. They will now journey to Russia with the added task of avenging an attempted assassination in which a nerve agent was deployed. It is difficult not to sympathise. Primarily you have to remark at the chronic arse-about-tittery of it all, with the Skripal poisoning joining a long list of momentous events that for some become only properly resonant insofar as they relate to footballers. You know the sorts of things. The morning after any Olympics has finished, for instance, there is a strong sense that the entire Games have actually happened only in order that the triumphant athletes who took part in them can be used as a stick with which to beat “pampered, preening” footballers. Much more darkly, I often get the impression that the horrors of the first and second world wars are relevant only as a test of England footballers. Did they visit the memorials or death camps when they played nearby or did they “shamefully snub” them? Did they visit but somehow not wear the right clothes when they did so? And so with the Skripal affair, which will ultimately come to be seen as one of the acutely destabilising factors that prevented England from reaching their true potential in the tournament. Despite all that has happened, despite all the tournament exits you can never unsee, despite their decades-long status as the biggest little football team in the world, you really have to marvel at certain people’s ability to make something – anything – feel like a very long and complex setup to a joke of which England will be the butt."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/04/construction-industry-frozen-by-beast-from-the-east","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T11:46:17Z","webTitle":"Construction industry frozen by 'beast from the east'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/04/construction-industry-frozen-by-beast-from-the-east","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/04/construction-industry-frozen-by-beast-from-the-east","fields":{"headline":"Construction industry frozen by 'beast from the east'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Heavy snowfall from the “beast from the east” caused Britain’s construction industry to grind to a halt last month, according to an industry survey showing the biggest fall in activity since immediately after the Brexit vote. Confirming fears that freezing weather across the country last month would harm the economy by forcing diggers and cranes to fall idle, the closely watched Markit/Cips UK construction purchasing managers index showed the industry contracted in March. The barometer of economic activity slumped to 47.0 last month from 51.4 in February, placing the industry below the 50-point mark separating growth from contraction, missing a forecast of 50.8 by economists in a Reuters poll. Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply said: “It’s a few years since the UK experienced such bad weather in March and it’s obvious that supply chains were woefully unprepared to deal with the disruption.” The troubles caused by the snow had a particularly heavy impact on civil engineering projects, according to the survey of more than 170 construction firms, which is watched by the Bank of England for hard facts on what is happening at grass roots level in the economy. The fall in civil engineering activity, which includes work on roads and bridges, suffered the biggest monthly downturn in five years. Commercial activity also declined, although there was better news from housebuilders, who reported a marginal increase in activity last month. Still, the overall deterioration in new orders was the sharpest since July 2016, just after the EU referendum. Despite the downturn, employment growth accelerated to a three-month high as builders take on more staff for forthcoming projects. The latest reading from the construction industry also comes after the manufacturing sector shrugged off the worst of the bad weather with an unexpected increase in activity last month. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said there were potentially greater problems ahead as significant Brexit uncertainty meant firms had become more averse to taking risks, as well as weighing down on the willingness of some firms to commit to new work."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/04/us-and-china-playing-a-gigantic-game-of-chicken-tariffs","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T11:47:58Z","webTitle":"US and China playing a gigantic game of chicken | Larry Elliott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/04/us-and-china-playing-a-gigantic-game-of-chicken-tariffs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/04/us-and-china-playing-a-gigantic-game-of-chicken-tariffs","fields":{"headline":"US and China playing a gigantic game of chicken over trade","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When Donald Trump tweeted that “trade wars are good and easy to win” most commentators thought the US president was merely sabre-rattling. The prospect of a return to full-scale 1930s protectionism was thought to be minimal. Cooler heads would prevail. A month on, the chances of a trade war between the US and China have significantly increased. Trump has said he will slap a 25% tariff on $50bn of Chinese goods and Beijing has now responded in kind. It has drawn up a list of US goods also worth $50bn which it will target if the White House goes ahead with its action. For the moment, this is simply a gigantic game of chicken. If Trump withdraws his threatened tariffs, the Chinese have said they will do the same. A trade war is not inevitable, but the risk of sleepwalking into a damaging conflict that nobody really wants is there. While Trump spread his tariffs over a broad range of Chinese products, Beijing opted to target a small number of products including aerospace and chemicals. By putting soya beans on its hit list, China also served notice on Trump that it is willing to inflict economic pain on his supporters in swing states. China’s tough approach has come as something of a surprise, and reflects a growing global self-confidence. The economic consequences of this spat still look far less serious than they were in the 1930s, when protectionism was a response to a deep slump. The global economy is growing more quickly than at any time since the financial meltdown of a decade ago, and it will take more than a 25% levy on a combined $100bn of imports to change that. But this state of affairs may not last. First, there is a risk that the conflict will escalate. Given that the US’s annual trade deficit with China is close to $400bn, Trump thinks Xi Jinping has more to lose than he does, which is true. Larry Kudlow, Trump’s chief economic adviser, was doing his best to lower the temperature, saying the US action was part of a negotiating strategy. But his boss is unpredictable. He could target a wider range of Chinese imports or include the EU and the US’s Nafta partners, Mexico and Canada, on his hit list. Second, even the threat of a trade war has sent tremors through the world’s financial markets. The real thing will do even more serious damage to share prices and to business confidence. Finally, tariffs are the equivalent of a tax on consumers. They protect some industries but only at the cost of raising prices and reducing spending power. Trump says his action is a response to China’s unfair trading practices, including widespread industrial piracy, and he has a point. Back in the 1990s, the US was instrumental in creating the World Trade Organisation to deal with issues of this sort, but the current administration has little time for the WTO, preferring unilateral rather than multilateral solutions. How this ends is now up to Trump. It may or may not be true that trade wars are easy to win, but they are certainly easier to start than they are to stop.

Perhaps Marvel was inspired by the move in 2015 when it cancelled the original comic book series just as rival film studio 20th Century Fox was set to release its doomed Fantastic Four reboot on the big screen. The cancellation, you might say, effectively blocked any much-needed publicity Fox’s film-makers had hoped for. Marvel’s move was sparked, according to more recent reports, by Fox’s determination to retain rights to Fantastic Four (and the X-Men) provided it continued to release new films. But Marvel was getting nowhere in its negotiations to try to bring the titles back into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As retaliation against Fox, it allegedly decided to write Reed Richards and his team out of the picture in print. To the casual onlooker, it appeared as if the Fantastic Four were simply unworthy of retaining their own title (a sense confirmed by anyone who has had to sit through Josh Trank’s insipid movie – or indeed any of its Fox-produced predecessors). Fast forward to 2018: the picture looks very different. Marvel’s parent company Disney is in the process of buying 21st Century Fox, which will likely bring the latter studio’s superhero movie rights back into the fold. If the Fantastic Four are finally introduced into the MCU, where will Marvel chief Kevin Feige and his team take the quartet? Given how much fun writers are having in the cosmic corners of the Marvel universe with episodes such as Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy 2, it would make sense to reimagine Reed and his team as the connection between mankind and alien races such as the Kree and the Skrull, just as they have been in the comics for decades. This is an area the Fox movies have barely touched upon, beyond the inclusion of the Silver Surfer and (briefly) Galactus in 2007’s Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. We know that Marvel is at long last introducing the shapeshifting Skrull in next year’s Captain Marvel, which will begin setting up the comics’ famous Kree-Skrull war storyline. That arc saw the Earth become a battleground for the two alien races, with the Fantastic Four and the Avengers charged with defending mankind from the extraterrestrial threat. As the MCU heads into its fourth phase, following the events of this year’s Avengers: Infinity War and its untitled sequel, Reed’s team could find themselves right at the centre of the Marvel universe. Casting could be key if the Fantastic Four do finally return to the MCU. There has been wild speculation by fans this week that actor-spouses John Krasinski and Emily Blunt might end up playing Reed Richards and Sue Storm, AKA the Invisible Woman. While Blunt’s appointment would be a coup, Krasinski is a long way from the kind of marquee movie star to mark Mister Fantastic’s arrival in the MCU as momentous. In addition to being stretchy as all hell, Reed is one of the world’s brightest mind and needs to be played by an actor with gravitas, one who can stand with Robert Downey Jr’s Tony Stark and Benedict Cumberbatch’s Doctor Strange atop the central plinths of the Marvel pantheon. At least by the time Reed et al do come home, it looks as if they will also have regained their place in the comics. Last week, Marvel confirmed that the Fantastic Four are going back into print with a new ongoing series being published from August. After a long time out in the cold, it’s as if the famed quartet have finally taken the first step to getting their powers back."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/07/howard-jacobson-jews-know-what-antisemitism-is-and-what-it-isnt-to-invent-it-would-be-a-sacrilege","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T07:00:54Z","webTitle":"Howard Jacobson: ‘Jews know what antisemitism is and what it isn’t.

The first time was in Port Said in the 1960s and I was able to put that down to heightened regional tensions. The second time was 25 years later in Clapham, south London where there were no heightened regional tensions. I knew that I was being spat at for being Jewish in Clapham because my assailant followed the spit with the words, “Now get yourself a shower, and you know what sort of shower I mean.” I did. I suspect that any Jew over the age of 10 would have known what sort of shower she meant. She. Why her sex surprised me, I can’t say. Maybe I automatically think of antisemites as men. Is that insulting to women? Again, I can’t say. But because she was a woman, the sense of physical danger I might have experienced had she been a man was supplanted by a sort of sadness. I am a mother’s boy and expect a woman to nurture, not abuse me. My sadness encompassed both of us. It was as though, in the act of aspersing me, she was violating her own nature. And in the act of being aspersed I was somehow, not to blame, but implicated. What had I done to be so hateful to her? What I did next increased my dissatisfaction with myself. I did nothing. That’s not quite true. I mouthed some such ineffectuality as “How dare you?” or “You should be ashamed of yourself”, at which she laughed. And there I left it. What else could I do? Call the police? Make a citizen’s arrest? Buy her coffee? If I am looking to report the pains of being Jewish, these are small pickings. But I am touching wood as I say that, for there is no knowing who might do or say what to me next. My superstition, which I don’t think is uniquely Jewish, but certainly has marked Jewish components, warns against tempting fate. It’s not for nothing that there are security men positioned outside synagogues and Jewish schools. We live in a rage-filled, hate-stoked world. And where the hate precedes the cause of hate and only later looks for reasons, the Jew will always do as pretext. I wasn’t left long distressed by the spitting incident. There is such a thing as Jewish self-hatred, though it is considered unacceptable to say so. As in all instances of abuse – and antisemitism is abuse – you introject the ill-treatment and disparagement. But in my experience the disparagement you introject is the remote, historical or even Biblical sort. Am I the stiff-necked Israelite who made God wonder whether Creation had been such a good idea? Am I the pitiless, legalistic Jew the Venetians saw in Shylock? Anything closer to home and I rally my resources. The one-to-one contact of a living antisemite makes me strong. What poisonous propaganda has my assailant been reading, I ask. What can I write to counter its effect? This is a pretty literary, chair-bound version of strength, I grant you, but we can fight only with the weapons we possess. My father wasn’t averse to using his fists. I don’t have a Jewish chip on my shoulder. My parents didn’t arm me against a hostile world. A few things might be said in my hearing that I might not like, they warned, but I wasn’t to go looking for them. My father attended Oswald Mosley’s rallies and was once arrested, he claimed, for knocking out the horse the fascist leader was riding. He’d aimed his punch at Mosley and missed. Whatever had or hadn’t happened, I was not to go out and do something similar. “Stay stumm,” was my father’s advice, no matter that he didn’t heed it himself. “Keep your head down.” It’s not impossible he thought he was talking to the horse. Among my Jewish friends, the person who saw an antisemite under every bush was a stock comic figure. For all the care they took to bring us up as citizens of this country, proud of our inheritance but free of ancient perturbation, our parents were still inclined, for themselves, to see enemies everywhere. This was hardly surprising. If they didn’t have their own memories of pogroms and similar acts of anti-Jewish violence in eastern Europe, they remembered hearing their parents relate their memories of them. We forget how many thousands of Jews were slaughtered in that part of the world long before the Holocaust. So antisemitism was bound to be more real to our mothers and fathers than it could ever be to us. Yes, a few of our teachers made derogatory remarks; ascribed our cleverness in some areas to a diabolically smart Jewish gene, and our ineptitude in others to a hopelessly defective one. Occasionally, we were angry, sometimes we were hurt, but mainly we laughed. None of it halted our running gag against the unenlightened shtetl Jew who thought antisemites were the sole authors of our misfortunes. “Antisemitism?” we’d ask darkly when one of us got a bad mark at school, or failed to win a prize, or lost a girlfriend. We particularly enjoyed this joke if the organisation awarding prizes, or indeed the girlfriend, was Jewish. At a time when Jews are being accused of faking antisemitism, it is important to stress that our default position is to make light of it. This country must take some credit for our civilised amusement. Mosley aside – and my father knew how to fix him – there was little in the national discourse to upset us. But then came Israel. Or rather, as Israel had been there throughout our childhoods, the systematic anathematising of Israel to the point where it became an abomination. I was not brought up a Zionist. For a long time, I never really knew what a Zionist was. Some of my friends went to summer camps that were a sort of trial run for life on a kibbutz, but I never fancied them. They involved too much dancing with people of one’s own sex. But it was a respectful ignorance. As a rule, our families subscribed to the lifeboat argument for Israel. We would, in all likelihood, need a place to run to again one day. I subscribe to that argument still. Generally, there was great sympathy for Israel among the general population in the 1950s and 1960s. The left gave its support, seeing in the kibbutz a fine example of socialism in action. Winning the six-day war changed that. I recall my father-in-law celebrating the victory but saying it would return to haunt us. Us? Yes. You didn’t have to be a Zionist to feel that the victory belonged to you. Jews hadn’t won anything for a long time. Many peeled off again, of course, as Israel became an occupying force, whether or not it wanted to be. Disillusion was understandable; more bewildering was how quickly an old affection turned into a new and peculiarly virulent hatred, and how it wasn’t just the Israeli politics of the hour that people decried, but Zionism itself. That made no sense to me. If the left, in particular, could have understood the necessity and sung the praises of Zionism once, why did they have to junk it completely now? A thing doesn’t all at once become evil because it loses its way. The Israel-loathing that began to consume the left altered my sense of being Jewish in this country. Past slights – the odd teacher wondering if Jews controlled the Nobel prize committee, my tutor at university calling me Finklebaum one day and Goldfinger the next – had been as nothing. A panto. But suddenly no one was laughing. I didn’t walk the streets in fear. I didn’t think of emigrating. And I didn’t consider becoming less conspicuously Jewish. Thirteen years ago, my wife and I chose to be married in a religious Jewish ceremony, and I continue to proclaim my brand of otherwise largely non-observant Jewishness as zestfully as I ever have. I still think Britain is a fine country to be a Jew of any complexion in. But it is as though I now live in the shadow of an unseen enemy. There are people not far away who hate beyond reason an enterprise to which I am only tenuously connected, but connected nonetheless. If I think back to moments of Jew-related tension I’ve experienced in the second half of my life, they have almost all been to do with Israel. There is no point in citing instances. They aren’t personal to me. And they are more to do with a changed atmosphere than deeds. You can say I’m the lucky one. Post the emergence of anti-Zionism as a faith, Jews have been attacked and, in some European countries, killed. So far, I have had only to tolerate the vituperation that trails my articles. But the atmosphere of which I speak is of a sort to which no group should be subjected. It manifests itself in habitual abuse on social media, the drowning out of any speech considered dissonant in universities, local councils and debating chambers, that cold-eyed contempt of which Jeremy Corbyn is master, and the undisguised assumption, within leftist politics, that when a Jew complains of antisemitism, he is lying. Most Jews know what antisemitism is and what it isn’t. Its history is written on the Jewish character in blood. To invent it where it is not would be a sacrilege. The incantatory repetition of the charge that Jews cry antisemitism only in order to subvert criticism of Israel or discredit Corbyn is more than fatuous and lazy, and it is more than painful to those many Jews who own an old allegiance to the Labour party and who are not strangers to criticising Israel. It is the deepest imaginable insult. I cannot speak for all Jews, but a profound depression has taken hold of those I know. For myself, I feel I am back in that lightless swamp of medieval ignorance where the Jew who is the author of all humanity’s ills lies, cheats, cringes and dissembles. And this time there is no horse to punch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/apr/09/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T14:00:01Z","webTitle":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/apr/09/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/apr/09/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Welcome to this week’s blog. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. First, an intriguing provocation from pubbore, who has been reading The Last Days of New Paris by China Miéville: I have very little to add to the comment here a couple of weeks ago that it’s ‘batshit crazy’, but while reading it struck me that Miéville might be the closest thing we now have to Umberto Eco, in his unashamedly intellectual approach to fundamentally low-brow subjects. Let’s welcome holtby26 who has been reading TLS “with great pleasure for ages” but hasn’t contributed until now. This review of Miss Garnet’s Angel by Sally Vickers is a fine start: Some beautiful and very evocative descriptions of Venice, its churches and religious art. I found I truly cared about Julia Garnet and loved seeing her slowly unfold and blossom, as well as learn to look more honestly at her own life. It could have been very easy for a book about an elderly women going on holiday and experiencing a second chance at life to be sentimental and cliched but I think Sally Vickers managed to almost completely avoid that. A lovely moment from roadwaterlady taken from An Artist of The Floating World by Kazuo Ishiguro: I sat and read ... and marvelled at the seeming simplicity of story and writing which gives such satisfaction and sets one thinking. At one point Ono sits on a hillside and contemplates his achievements and has a moment of profound happiness that his hard work was not in vain. This was at a time before the war, before he feels he has to apologise for his work at his daughter’s betrothal evening; does he really believe he was wrong? I don’t think so. But I recognised that moment; a moment of pride ... Mostly we remember the mistakes and wish we had not made them. Here’s a fine weekend, as described by Gretsch83: Enjoyed a weekend in the country sprinting through the 103 pages of JL Carr’s A Month In The Country. I could get used to these perfectly written short novels you can get through in an afternoon and have no complaints. Elsewhere, John Preston’s A Very English Scandal has fascinated oonatsat: The story of Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe and his dalliances and then bungled attempts at having male model and emotionally troubled former lover Norman Scott bumped off. I know I shouldn’t be shocked at hearing how Thorpe and Bessel sat in the Houses of Parliament and planned the murder of Scott - “it’s no worse than putting a dog down” and “you can throw his body down an abandoned tin mine” - but I am. I wonder sometimes if very much has changed. Finally, julian6 has been fascinated by The Glass Bead Game by Hermann Hesse: Its discussion of elitism - its tribulations and rewards does seem astonishingly timely - given how much this topic seems to recur again and again in present day discussions and current affairs. I am only just over half way. The translation must have been an immense task - however it seems to me to come over remarkably well in English. The flow of thought is profoundly impressive. The writing seems to convey a constantly evolving and searching consciousness, turning inwards, losing itself then once again finding an unexpected opening towards the light of some new insight, some unsuspected knowledge. Opening outwards, then obscured by the mist again. And so we too fade out for the week... Interesting links about books and reading The Times Literary Supplement has produced a list of the best British and Irish novelists today. “It is less a correspondence than a story, one co-written by two extraordinary figures.” Robert Zaretsky on the “dazzling” letters of Albert Camus and Maria Casarès. In 1995 a film of JD Salinger’s Franny and Zooey was made in Iran. Another triumph for humanity! Walden pond is being destroyed.

In an episode of the monthly Young Quaker Podcast, called the Silence Special, you can hear a clock ticking, pages being turned and the rain falling, as the group meets and sits in silence at the Friend’s Meeting House in Nottingham. Quakerism was founded in the 17th century by the dissenter George Fox during the years of Puritan England. The group’s meetings are characterised by silence, which is occasionally broken when someone present feels the urge to speak, say a prayer or offer a reading. The idea for the silent podcast first came from Tim Gee, a Quaker living in London, who was inspired by the BBC’s season of “slow” radio, which treated audiences to – among other things – the sounds of birds singing, mountain climbing and monks chatting. Gee said he had wanted to “share a small oasis of calm, and a way to provide a moment of stillness, for people on the move”. Jessica Hubbard-Bailey, 25, from the Nottingham Young Quakers, who recorded the podcast, said they had jumped at the opportunity to broadcast something “immersive and unusual”. She added: “We have very different ways of worship to most people of faith and we thought this was a really unique opportunity to give people a little slice of what the Quakers do. Also, we are really good at being quiet because we’ve made a practice of it and I think that is of value. These days everyone is so busy, everyone is working all the time, so it’s really valuable to have the opportunity to sit down once a week and just be quiet and listen.” Hubbard-Bailey, who was brought up as an atheist but became attracted to Quakerism for its egalitarian principles, said that the podcast had had a good reception, with nearly 400 uses of it. “I think that makes it the biggest Quaker meeting this year technically,” she said. “I’ve had one couple say that they’ve listened to the silence episode and are going to go to a Quaker meeting for the first time this Sunday. We’ve also had some people saying ‘oh, I’m not sure about this, seems like a bit of a waste of time’. But I think that’s really indicative of how we as a society view silence and stillness.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/08/revolutionary-musical-hamilton-takes-home-seven-olivier-awards","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T20:25:53Z","webTitle":"Revolutionary musical Hamilton takes home seven Olivier awards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/08/revolutionary-musical-hamilton-takes-home-seven-olivier-awards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/08/revolutionary-musical-hamilton-takes-home-seven-olivier-awards","fields":{"headline":"Revolutionary musical Hamilton takes home seven Olivier awards","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hamilton, the stage juggernaut that is arguably the most popular and influential musical for a generation, has won big at the UK’s most prestigious theatre awards, taking seven Oliviers. While the show did not quite set records – Harry Potter and the Cursed Child did that last year, with nine – Hamilton was the dominant force at a ceremony on Sunday night. which also proved rewarding for Jez Butterworth’s play The Ferryman, the National Theatre and Bryan Cranston, who was named best actor in a play. Hamilton won awards including best new musical, choreography, lighting and sound, while its creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and orchestrator, Alex Lacamoire, were given an outstanding achievement in music prize. One of the most intriguing categories was best actor in a musical, which pitted Jamael Westman, the young actor not long out of drama school who plays Alexander Hamilton, against Giles Terera, who plays Hamilton’s nemesis Aaron Burr. Terera won. Terera said it had been the joy of his life and career to be part of such a diverse company. “It’s not a box-ticking exercise, it is the best way to tell the story … Diversity is not a policy, it is life, diversity is life. So theatre makers, there’s no excuse.” Hamilton, which tells the story of one of the least well-known founding fathers of the US, took Broadway by storm when it opened in 2015. The question was: would such an American story be quite as successful in the UK? It has proved to be just as popular. If someone tried to book tickets for the show today, the next available seats would be for a Thursday matinee in November. Critics, too, have praised the show. The Guardian’s Michael Billington was one of many to give it five stars, praising Miranda for creating “an invigorating and original musical that, at a time of national crisis, celebrates America’s overwhelming debt to the immigrant”. One dissenting voice was the Daily Mail’s critic Quentin Letts, who judged the musical score “so-so, with harmonies seldom rising above the level of ad-land jingles” and complained that the “mad publicity hoopla” was not justified. But Letts’s is a minority view. Most have hailed the show, which uses hip-hop, rap and R&amp;B music and a diverse cast, as a game-changer. Hamilton dominated the musical categories at the Royal Albert Hall ceremony, though not every one. Two stars of the Bob Dylan musical Girl From the North Country, Shirley Henderson and Sheila Atim, won, respectively, best actress and best supporting actress in a musical. The Troubles-set The Ferryman, which began at the Royal Court before its West End and now Broadway transfer, won three Oliviers, including best new play, beating Ink, Oslo and Network. Sam Mendes won best director and Laura Donnelly won best actress, from a shortlist that also featured Imelda Staunton, Lesley Manville and Audra McDonald. Mendes dedicated his award to the theatre director Howard Davies, who died in 2016. “We stand on the shoulders of masters,” he said. “I lost count of the number of times while I was directing this, I thought, ‘How would Howard do it?’” It was also a pleasing night for the National Theatre and its artistic director, Rufus Norris, who received something of a critical drubbing over his production of Macbeth. The company had garnered 22 nominations and won five, including best revival for Angels in America, best supporting actress for Denise Gough, best musical revival for Follies and for Cranston as best actor. Cranston, best known for Malcolm in the Middle and Breaking Bad, won for his startling portrayal of the news anchor Howard Beale, who flips live on air with the memorable line: “I’m as mad as hell and I’m not going to take this any more!” The actor, making his London stage debut, won from a shortlist that also included Andrew Scott, Paddy Considine and Andrew Garfield. Cranston said he was grateful to be working in a country with a government that realised culture was an essential element in society to “achieve health and happiness … hopefully that will carry over across the seas.” Other winners included Bertie Carvel, who won best supporting actor in a play for his portrayal of Rupert Murdoch in Ink by James Graham. Graham also wrote Labour of Love, which won best comedy. The Royal Court play Killology was named winner of outstanding achievement in an affiliate theatre. The Royal Opera won best new opera for Semiramide, while its two stars, Joyce DiDonato and Daniela Barcellona, won outstanding achievement in opera. It was a grey, rainy night, but the ceremony, hosted by Catherine Tate, was a proper show, with performances from the nominated musicals and a celebration of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat featuring stars from its past. As with other recent awards ceremonies, the sexual harassment scandal and resulting Time’s Up movement was marked by a number of actors who brought activists to the ceremony as their guest. Meera Syal, for example, was accompanied by Anjum Mouj, chair of the London Black Women’s Project; Pearl Mackie came with Andrea Simon, a campaigner for the End Violence Against Women Coalition; and Atim was accompanied by Marchu Girma, grassroots director for Women for Refugee Women. There was no repeat of the Oscars and film Baftas where women wore black – a relief, joked Tate: “When you’re ginger and over 40, it is very draining on the complexion.” The recipient of the Olivier special award was David Lan, who recently stepped down as artistic director of the Young Vic after 18 years in charge.

Predictions are that, in summer, most European cities could become as much as 10C hotter by the end of this century, testing the old and very young who both have trouble regulating body temperature. Cities across the world that are already too hot in the summer are taking a variety of measures from insisting new buildings have gardens on their roofs, painting existing roofs white, colouring roads light grey and planting trees in streets and open spaces. The good news is that all these measures work, reducing land surface temperatures by 2C to 3C in the areas where they are applied. Another rather surprising finding is that solar panels, although black, also reduce the heat island effect by absorbing the sunlight (and turning it into electricity). Even in rural areas, the type of crops chosen by farmers has an influence – barley reflects 23% of sunlight back into space and sugar beet 26%. Sadly, none of this halts global warming but it does slow it down and buys a little more time. • Paul Brown will be one of the panel of Weatherwatch contributors taking part in Freak Weather in History at the British Library on Wednesday 2 May, at 7pm"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/08/grandad-ive-got-this-homework-essay-on-the-first-world-war","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T16:51:22Z","webTitle":"'Grandad, I’ve got this homework essay on the ​first world ​war'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/08/grandad-ive-got-this-homework-essay-on-the-first-world-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/08/grandad-ive-got-this-homework-essay-on-the-first-world-war","fields":{"headline":"'Grandad, I’ve got this homework essay on the ​first world ​war'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It was a schoolboy history assignment half a century ago that led Clifford Williams to first ask his grandfather about “the war”. Albert Williams, then 84 and a retired builder, had joined the Royal Engineers in 1914 and transferred to the Tank corps in 1918 where in France in August he took part in fighting around Querrieu Wood on the first day of the Battle of Amiens. A century later, his grandson Clifford, a retired police officer, has dug out his school essay and will retrace Albert’s steps by attending a remembrance service with hundreds of others in Amiens cathedral on 8 August to mark the centenary of the battle and the start of the Allied offensive that ended the first world war. Six hundred tickets are available for UK descendants and those with an “emotional connection” who wish to attend the service, to be chosen from a ballot that closes on 9 April. The event is being held in partnership with France, Australia, Canada and the United States. Clifford, now 60, got top marks for his essay. It engendered in the young boy a love of history, which he read at university, later taking an MA and PhD in criminology and joining the police. He retired as a chief inspector and volunteers as Hampshire police force’s historian, writing books and collating oral histories. “I can still picture it vividly,” he said, recalling how, in 1972, aged 14, he knocked on the bedroom door of his grandfather, who was living with him and his family in their south London flat, saying, ‘Grandad, I’ve got this homework, doing an essay on the first world war.’” In the essay, a young Clifford writes how Albert operated the gears in a gun-carrying tank: “On one trip his gear mate left his hatch door open and was blown to bits, but my grandad always kept his door shut. The noise was terrible and signals were made by hand. My grandad used to sing at the top of his voice and still couldn’t hear himself,” he wrote. His teacher gave him top marks and commented “at this rate you may well turn out a historian, Clifford”. The Battle of Amiens marked the start of the hundred days offensive, a series of battles that culminated in Germany seeking an armistice in November. Albert and his two brothers all signed up to fight. All three survived, and Albert, who had three sons, returned to life as a builder, rarely speaking of the war. Clifford’s other grandfather suffered shellshock. Williams said visiting Amiens all these years later, “will, I think, just strengthen my feeling of affinity with both grandfathers”. “I think it is very important that we remember the suffering that people went through during the first world war and how it affected nearly every family in the UK. Very few families didn’t lose somebody or know somebody who was seriously injured. So I think it is very important that we reflect on that, and that it is something we wouldn’t want to go through the trauma of again.” Not too many children of those at Amiens will still be alive. But Clifford expects to meet grandchildren, like himself. Albert, who died aged 97, had recounted his experience in “a very matter of fact way”. “He thought the war was a folly. My father became pacifist later on and was an anti-war campaigner,” said Clifford. The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “The Battle of Amiens marked a turning point in the first world war and this anniversary gives us a chance to reflect on how the war in Europe moved from entrenched conflict to the signing of the armistice in 1918. We have a duty to tell the stories of those who lived and fought in the first world war to keep their memories alive.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/08/bernsteins-mass-review-leonard-royal-festival-hall-marin-alsop-national-youth-orchestra","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T15:01:03Z","webTitle":"Bernstein's Mass review – meticulous take on a fascinating failure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/08/bernsteins-mass-review-leonard-royal-festival-hall-marin-alsop-national-youth-orchestra","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/08/bernsteins-mass-review-leonard-royal-festival-hall-marin-alsop-national-youth-orchestra","fields":{"headline":"Bernstein's Mass review – meticulous take on a fascinating failure","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Leonard Bernstein’s Mass was neglected for many years after its 1971 premiere, when it opened Washington’s Kennedy Center. The neglect is now a thing of the past. This performance was at least its third professional outing in London in the last decade. The revival of interest tells us something about this ambitious piece’s enduring capacity to fascinate. But so does the earlier neglect. Mass is a problem piece for a reason. Actually, it’s for several reasons. There is the vast challenge of staging the unruly “theatre piece for singers, players and dancers”, which dramatises the crisis of faith in anguished times in music of many genres, all woven around the Latin mass. Nearly 500 are involved in Jude Kelly’s reworked 2010 production in the Festival Hall, with Marin Alsop again holding everything together. But Mass requires more than the enthusiasm of its performers. It is very episodic, uneven in musical quality and, culturally and politically, a period piece. Kelly’s attempt to draw modern political parallels overstretches it, and the relentless positivity of the evening cannot disguise the fact that Mass is a failure, though a heroic one. But it’s a blast, that’s for sure. And intermittently something more. Alsop’s meticulous commitment ensured utterly engaged playing and singing from the National Youth Orchestra, the Chineke! Junior orchestra and an array of far-flung young and adult performers, including a marching band. The Brazilian baritone Paulo Szot was tireless in the role of the Celebrant, who abandons his faith at the climax of the evening’s most dramatic scene. Mass is essential listening for anyone interested in Bernstein’s lifelong attempts to weave the popular and art music traditions together. One just wishes it was a more persuasive achievement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/09/holes-review-nottingham-playhouse","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T11:49:57Z","webTitle":"Holes review – deeply felt drama brings landmark novel to life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/09/holes-review-nottingham-playhouse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/09/holes-review-nottingham-playhouse","fields":{"headline":"Holes review – deeply felt drama brings landmark novel to life","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Adam Penford’s tenure as artistic director at Nottingham Playhouse got off to an impressive start with a fine production of Beth Steel’s Nottingham mining story, Wonderland. His staging of Louis Sachar’s compelling 1998 children’s novel, set in a boys’ detention centre called Camp Green Lake in the Texan desert, is just as much a statement of intent. It begins with a display of puppetry that nods towards family hits such as The Lion King and War Horse. Except the snakes, spiders and lizards that slide and scuttle across the vast desert floor are venomous rather than cute and loveable. It’s a neat joke, in harmony with the comic tone of Sachar’s novel, and announces Penford’s determination to programme quality family theatre. His instincts are correct. The Playhouse has long delivered a much admired and well-loved annual pantomime, so why not also serve that audience at other points in the year? Just to make absolutely sure of the connection, John Elkington, best known as the Playhouse’s regular panto dame, pops up here to good effect as the rather less likable Mr Sir, an adult who bullies the boys at the camp and who is also a victim of bullying. Holes is a novel that, like Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials trilogy and Malorie Blackman’s Noughts and Crosses, is a rite of passage for many children, providing a vital bridge between primary and secondary school reading. It is both deliciously improbable, with its stories of outlaws, curses and a lost fortune, and also thematically grown-up in its handling of racial intolerance, oppression and accountability. As well as being a rollicking good story of injustice righted, its appeal lies in its 14-year-old antihero, the unfortunate Stanley, wrongly accused of stealing a pair of trainers – who blames his ill luck on a curse brought down on his family by his “no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather”. Chris Ashby is engagingly doleful in the role. His Stanley, initially under the misapprehension that Camp Green Lake will be like one of those summer camps that his family could never afford to send him to, is caught by surprise at this hard-knock world, a regime that demands he dig a five-foot hole every single day in the blazing heat. Like the novel, Penford’s production gets the balance between gritty realism and wild fantasy just right, and like his Watership Down at the Watermill, the show has a pleasingly fluid quality enhanced by Simon Kenny’s spare design. If the flashbacks, which tell the story of the 19th-century outlaw Kissin’ Kate Barlow, are less compelling, that is in part due to the occasional awkwardness of Sachar’s own adaptation. But the harshness of life in Camp Green Lake is always vividly drawn, the horrors cut with comedy, and the ensemble play multiple roles with relish. Pepter Lunkuse is particularly engaging as the outsider orphan, Zero, whose history is entwined with Stanley’s, and the camp’s warden, a woman infinitely more poisonous than any of the snakes and spiders, is played with gleeful nastiness by Kacey Ainsworth. At the Nottingham Playhouse until 22 April.

Forsaking linear narrative, Emson filters events through the memory of his four characters, who speak in jagged, colloquial rhyme, but while the result is weirdly fascinating I never felt the climactic violence was wholly believable. We are, however, gradually drawn into Emson’s world, in which past traumas are re-enacted. They involve Kev, a teenage football hero eagerly anticipating a decisive date with the 15-year-old Lisa. But on the day of the date, Lisa bunks off school for the afternoon with Ben and Jack, two kids she has grown up with but who are regarded as freaky outsiders by their classmates. The threat of violence hangs in the air, not least as Ben solemnly intones a litany of notorious American schoolroom slaughters, and you know something fearful might happen. But while Emson is good at conveying the impotent anger of the bullied and abused, I found it hard to credit his resolution: he seems to suggest that the “shitty little town” in which all the characters have been reared is the ultimate source of their troubles. Josh Roche directs well, Sophie Thomas and Peter Small are jointly responsible for an ingenious design in which light-bulbs whizz through the air on overhead cables, and Mark Weinman, Madison Clare, Thomas Coombes and Louis Greatorex all give good performances. I suspect the play will lodge in the mind even if I question its fatalistic assumption that to be born in small-town Essex is to be deprived of all hope. At the Old Red Lion, London, until 21 April.

She is also visually impaired and a member of New Zealand’s “Blind Jacks” lawn bowls team. Despite her age, however, Curran claims she is the “youngest” bowler in the team. “The youngest bowler by age is 22, but she has been playing for about 10 years,” she clarifies. “So I’m the youngest, or least experienced member of the team.” The Hamilton resident played netball and tennis in her youth, but didn’t take up bowling until 65, after becoming a widow. Her eyesight had deteriorated badly, and after being on her own for several years, she says, lawn bowls was “something to do”. Just 18 months into her bowling career, Curran was representing her country at the Glasgow Games, where she competed in the paired competition for an impressive fourth. Four years on, she says she could never have predicted she would be on the Gold Coast at her second Commonwealth Games, having also taken part in two blind world championships. Visually impaired bowlers such as Curran are entitled to what is known as a “director”, someone who can instruct them on the composition of the green – and help with tactical manoeuvring. Curran’s director is Ann Muir, who also happens to be 71, and is a sighted, provincial-level bowler back home. “I am Sue’s eyes,” explains Muir, who has coached Curran since 2015. “I set her up on the line where I think she should be for taking the shot. I tell her the length, but she has to have the feel [for how fast or slow to bowl]. For para athletes, it’s all about the feel, because they can’t see very far up the green.” Muir’s guidance is essential for Curran, who has no depth perception. “I might see a black bowl, yellow bowl, blue bowl, but I can’t tell where they are,” she says. “I might just know that one is on the left of the other, but I can’t see distance at all.” To compensate, Muir and Curran have developed a routine where Muir coaches Curran from behind, and tries to help her “visualise” the green. “I stay behind her, talking to her about keeping a long lever [swing], staying down and following it through,” Muir says. “Then, when the bowl comes to rest, I use a clock [to explain where the bowls are]. So 12 o’clock is behind the jack, and I’ll tell Ann that it’s so many mats [away] – because they [a para bowler] can feel the length of a mat, or the width of a mat from the jack.” Muir says she does her best to “paint a picture” for Curran, even if she’s not sure Curran “visualises” in the way she imagines. For her part, Curran tries to picture the green, using a monocular between turns to help. She is allowed the monocular during competition, so long as she does not use it on the mat where she sets herself to bowl. Instead, she relies on Muir to help her position herself effectively. “I walk onto the mat with her and figure out the line we’re going to take,” Muir says. “Then sometimes I’ll move her heel around to give her a bit more angle, or cut the angle down.” A particularly difficult challenge for the team, Muir says, is when she thinks Curran should bowl a draw shot (typically executed with a lighter touch, and more of an arc than a faster bowl). Muir finds it difficult to explain how much further or shorter she wants Curran to bowl because, as a sighted person, she focuses on how many more or less rotations of the bowl she thinks they need – something Curran can’t see. “Sue might have played a shorter bowl, and I’ll say ‘a little bit more’ speed [is needed], but instead she’ll send one firing down,” she laughs. “But how much is a ‘little bit more’? I know we need two more rotations and we’d be there, but she can’t see that. So I might say [instead] ‘beat your last bowl, remember what it felt like.’” Muir admits she can find the experience of coaching a visually impaired athlete “frustrating”. “The hard part is, I play at top level [in a sighted competition] and I expect her to do the same things [as a sighted athlete],” she says. “So I’ve learned tolerance, and that I can’t expect the same standards.” Another challenge of working in such an intimate team, both women admit, is success often depends on the level of trust they have, such that Curran must constantly place her faith in Muir’s judgement. “Yesterday for example, I decided I didn’t want to play the hand that Ann wanted me to play,” Curran says. “And it didn’t work; there was a reason Ann wanted me to play a particular shot. But I thought I knew better; I judged it on what I could see, and thought there was a better way to go. I was wrong.” Despite these hiccups, Curran says she couldn’t ask for a better coach. “She’s brilliant. I’ll never have her knowledge, not unless I live to about 150 years,” she laughs. “She understands the game inside out. She thinks I don’t listen to her, but I do try and take everything in.” Muir reciprocates the appreciation, saying she is “never” disappointed in her charge, even after Curran’s pair lost Sunday’s round four clash against Scotland 5-23. “She never lets me down,” says Muir, adding she is in awe of what para athletes like Curran achieve. “You imagine being blindfolded. Number one you don’t have any balance at all. Then you’ve got no idea where you are.” Curran adds: “It’s a lot of hard work, and a lot of practice. We spend a lot of time on fitness as well. People don’t think that comes into it, but it does. You’re on your feet for two-and-a-half hours [at least].” Despite Sunday’s loss, Curran still has a chance to go one better than Glasgow and win bronze if her pair can triumph over England on Monday morning. And, thanks to this Games having a fully integrated schedule where para and non-para events are mixed throughout the day’s programming, there should be a healthy crowd. This is a first for the Gold Coast, with the 2018 Games featuring 23 para-athlete medal events across seven sports: a 73 per cent increase on medals and 45 per cent increase on athletes than the Glasgow Games. Curran says the change has been “brilliant”, and notes how “loud” the Australian crowds have been. “Last Commonwealth Games, we played all the para sports first,” Curran says. “That meant the stands filled up for the fully sighted players, but not for us. Here, where it’s mixed, the stands were filled the last couple of nights. It didn’t matter [to the crowd] whether they were watching para or able-bodied sport. “I think it’s brilliant. I’d like to see the Olympics do it too, because you’re really part of a team, not separated, or second level, backwards.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/08/perth-man-in-critical-condition-after-moped-crash-in-thailand","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T02:04:10Z","webTitle":"Perth man in critical condition after moped crash in Thailand","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/08/perth-man-in-critical-condition-after-moped-crash-in-thailand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/08/perth-man-in-critical-condition-after-moped-crash-in-thailand","fields":{"headline":"Perth man in critical condition after moped crash in Thailand","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Fremantle man is in a critical condition in Royal Perth hospital after crashing his moped last month in Thailand on the resort island of Koh Samui. Benjamin French, 34, was flown into Perth on an emergency medical flight on Friday night after his friends and family set up a crowdfunding page to fund his return home and to pay for his hospital treatment in Thailand, which was costing up to $20,000 per day. French’s travel insurance did not cover the medical expenses because he did not have an Australian bike license. It is not yet clear how the crash occurred. French, who runs a food truck business in Perth, was in Thailand to cater for a wedding when he crashed the scooter on 28 March. He was left with severe brain injuries which needed to stabilise before he could be flown back to Australia, as well as punctured lungs, broken ribs and severe skull damage. While in Thailand he underwent several brain surgeries and blood transfusions, and was placed in a coma. His brother, Kyle Malkus, posted an update to the fundraising page early on Saturday stating French’s condition had seriously deteriorated since arriving back in Perth. “Last night Ben experienced some complications and it is with extreme sadness we need to say goodbye,” he wrote. “Nobody had seen this coming when it was starting to look so positive, it’s still hard to grasp.” But on Sunday morning he posted again, saying: “The fight is still on. We are still hoping for a miracle, regardless of the extent of his injuries and the complications which are continuing to arise,” he wrote. “Please keep your thoughts and prayers with Benjamin.

Rory McIlroy brought the course, and the crowd, alive with some daydream golf, the kind of stuff the rest of us play when we close our eyes and drift away. Augusta’s placements were designed to be kind, with all that rain in mind, but in the end all that came was a little sprinkling in the morning and a heavy shower in the afternoon, which meant McIlroy, and the other leaders, were able to take every advantage of it in between. Of course anyone who wants to win around here needs a little good luck somewhere along the way. And McIlroy got his on the 1st tee. His drive was flying wide left towards the 9th fairway when it hit a tall pine and bounced back down into the second cut. He made par with a chip in to four feet. In those early holes it seemed almost as if he had become carried away with trying to make the most of the damp conditions, which suited him just fine since he hits it so far. And at the 2nd hole he smashed his drive 348 yards, so far that it fetched up in the gallery way beyond the bunker. It was here that McIlroy performed his first bit of wizardry. His ball was in the pine needles, right up against a little cherry tree. He punched it out all of 250 yards, scattering blossoms with his follow-through. The ball rolled right to the back left corner of the green, right by the hole. So that was two fine par saves in a row. Then the birdies started – one on the 3rd hole and another on the 4th – both made with snaking putts from 20ft or so. He could have had another on the 5th, after a preposterous second shot from the fairway bunker, but he left a 13ft putt just short. McIlroy’s partner, Henrik Stenson, was playing a fine round himself, steady par bar a bogey at the 2nd. But that left him drifting in McIlroy’s slipstream as he shot up the leaderboard. At the par-three 6th McIlroy’s tee-shot could scarcely have been better if he had moved it by telekinesis. It left him a two-foot tap-in for birdie. McIlroy was so happy with the stroke that he was bobbing up and down on his toes like Tigger. A little boy behind the tee-box shouted out “Oh my god! That was AMAZING!” This was the stuff that makes kids fall in love. If the boy admired that, he should have been at the 8th green, where McIlroy rattled in a chip from 25 yards. It bounced on the ridge of the green and would have flown right off the other side of the green if it had not hit the flag stick on the way through. That eagle took him to nine under. Stenson, meanwhile, got his birdie game going on the 7th. He got a lucky break of his own when his drive hit a Swedish journalist in the ribs and the ball bounced back on to the fairway. He made a birdie there, with his splash out of the front bunker, and another at the 8th, with a pin-point pitch in. It has been a long while since Stenson has played so well at Augusta, where his best finish is tied-14th in 2014. McIlroy, too, was playing with rare flair and confidence – until he got to Amen Corner, where he left a birdie putt up at the 11th and had to play out of the bunker at the 12th. Then the rain came, a heavy shower that started and stopped with equal suddenness, as if someone was working it with a switch. It was at its worst when McIlroy was on the 13th fairway and he missed his approach wide right. But he managed to scramble out of an azalea bush to save par. Exactly how McIlroy made birdie at the 15th, where he pulled his drive so wide, only he knows. His tee shot got him in trouble at the 17th too, and the par he made there, with a dinky chip, was just as impressive. His birdie at the 18th was the icing on top. It meant he finished in 65, his best round here since 2011. He was smiling all the while, having a grand old time out there. His only problem was that Patrick Reed was enjoying himself so much too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/08/hungary-goes-to-polls-amid-escalating-anti-migrant-rhetoric","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T17:44:32Z","webTitle":"Hungary goes to polls amid escalating anti-migrant rhetoric","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/08/hungary-goes-to-polls-amid-escalating-anti-migrant-rhetoric","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/08/hungary-goes-to-polls-amid-escalating-anti-migrant-rhetoric","fields":{"headline":"Hungary goes to polls amid escalating anti-migrant rhetoric","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Voting is over in Hungary, where the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, is seeking to win a third consecutive term. After running a campaign almost exclusively focused on the threat posed by migration, Orbán’s Fidesz party is expected to win a majority in parliament. However, a late push for coordination among the opposition, as well a string of corruption scandals around the government has given Orbán’s foes a glimmer of hope. The opposition was also buoyed by a surprisingly high turnout. Two hours before the polls closed, turnout was at 63% of eligible voters, up 9% on the last election in 2014. With no reliable exit polls, it could be some time before a clear idea of the results emerges. Gergely Karacsony, the leading left-wing candidate for prime minster, claimed the high turnout was good news for those in favour of preventing Prime Minister Victor Orban from winning his third consecutive term. Orbán voted at a Budapest polling station on Sunday morning, and afterwards said his campaign had focussed on migration because “this is the main question of the future”. There were long queues at some Budapest polling stations, as well as at Hungarian embassies abroad. During recent weeks, activists have worked to mobilise the hundreds of thousands of Hungarians living outside the country to register to vote, on the assumption that the majority of them are likely to be anti-Orbán. A video posted online from London showed a queue stretching for hundreds of metres, and the waiting time was reportedly over two hours. Orbán, who rose to prominence in the late 1980s as a young liberal calling for Soviet troops to withdraw from Hungary, has morphed into a rightwing nationalist over the years. He served one term as prime minister between 1998 and 2002, and was then in opposition for eight years until his Fidesz party won a two-thirds majority in parliament in 2010 and 2014. Since the refugee crisis of 2015, Orbán’s rhetoric on migration has become increasingly sharp. His government has built a fence along the country’s southern border to keep out migrants and Orbán has claimed he is fighting a conspiracy to destroy Hungary led by the Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros. “On Sunday the future of Hungary will be irreparably determined for many decades to come,” Orbán said in his final campaign speech on Friday. “If the levy breaks, if they open the borders, if migrants enter the country, there is no way back.” Opinion polls suggest more people support a change of government than another Orbán term, but the Hungarian electoral system can deliver a strong parliamentary majority to the biggest party even if it does not win an outright majority of the votes. At a Budapest polling station across the Danube from the Hungarian parliament, many voters said they were voting tactically in an attempt to unseat the Fidesz candidate. “I would really like a change of government,” said 78-year-old Ildiko Nagy after voting for Karacsony’s party. “Everything about this government is awful. They have abused patriotism and created wartime hysteria in a time of peace.” Analysts say despite a number of corruption scandals in which top Fidesz officials are implicated, the anti-migrant rhetoric has worked well enough to shore up the core Fidesz voter base. Added to this are a number of changes to the electoral system made in recent years, most of which are likely to benefit Fidesz, and the fractured opposition, which has struggled to put on a united front against Orbán. Across town, in the poorer Eighth District of Budapest, more voters said they had supported Fidesz. András, a 20-year-old Roma musician, said he supported the government because they had funded his orchestra. “Everything is good, I have no complaints,” he said. The strongest opposition force is Jobbik, a far-right party that has rebranded itself as a centre-right anti-corruption force in recent years. As Orbán has moved further and further to the right, Jobbik has moved to the centre, though much of its campaigning in the regions still focuses on an anti-migrant and anti-Roma platform. The liberal opposition is made up of a number of smaller parties, who have taken part in talks aimed at cooperation to maximise their chances. However, with a few exceptions, parties have not been able to agree on strategic withdrawals to present a single liberal candidate on the ballot. A number of citizen groupings have been offering tactical voting advice to people on the best choice in each constituency for voters who want anyone but Orbán. At a minimum, the opposition hopes to deprive Fidesz of its two-thirds majority, which allows changes to the constitution. At best, there is hope that a high turnout could strip Orbán of his majority completely, but Fidesz would still be the largest party and a chaotic period of coalition negotiations would then begin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/08/sugar-drinks-tax-only-partly-effective-institute-fiscal-studies","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T23:04:13Z","webTitle":"Tax on sugary drinks will only be partly effective, claims study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/08/sugar-drinks-tax-only-partly-effective-institute-fiscal-studies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/08/sugar-drinks-tax-only-partly-effective-institute-fiscal-studies","fields":{"headline":"Tax on sugary drinks will only be partly effective, claims study","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The new sugar tax on soft drinks may see young people switch to healthier beverages, but it is unlikely to help those who have a high-sugar diet, a new study finds. Three economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies – Pierre Dubois, Rachel Griffith and Martin O’Connell – have raised questions about the efficacy of the government’s soft drinks industry levy. Drinks makers who do not cut sugar levels will have to pay 18p a litre on drinks that have more than 5g of sugar per 100ml and 24p a litre on those that have 8g or more of sugar per 100ml. Already about half of makers have reduced sugar content. According to the economists’ modelling, recently presented at the Royal Economic Society’s annual conference at the University of Sussex and which simulates the effects of a 25p per litre tax, the tax will lead young people to reduce the amount of sugar they buy via soft drinks by about 80% more than the average consumer. “Our results show that young consumers would lower their sugar consumption by more than older individuals in response to a soda tax. The tax, therefore, succeeds in achieving relatively large reductions in sugar among one group,” the study notes. However, the research also suggests that “those with high-sugar diets are relatively price inelastic and therefore fail to lower their sugar consumption in response to the tax by more than more moderate sugar consumers.” The findings have implications for Britain and beyond. A growing number of cities and countries have adopted taxes on sugary drinks to help combat sugar consumption, which is blamed for rising obesity levels. The World Health Organisation recommends that no more than 5% of calories should come from added sugar. However, using data drawn from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey, the economists estimate that 94% of individuals in Britain exceed the WHO recommendation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/08/trump-official-football-fans-russia-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T21:00:39Z","webTitle":"Trump official: football fans should 'think twice' about Russia World Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/08/trump-official-football-fans-russia-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/08/trump-official-football-fans-russia-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Trump official: football fans should 'think twice' about Russia World Cup","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Football fans should “think twice” about travelling to the World Cup in Russia this summer as consular services are threatened by the diplomatic crisis between Vladimir Putin and the west, a senior White House official has warned. The tournament kicks off on 14 June under the shadow of tit-for-tat expulsions and what some describe as a new cold war. Boris Johnson, the British foreign secretary, has suggested Putin will seek to exploit the showpiece in the way Adolf Hitler milked the Olympic Games in Berlin in 1936. The White House official warned anyone planning to attend: “I would think twice because we won’t have the same ability to protect our citizens or even just dealing with the regular consular affairs when we’re there. And the other countries too. You would have that concern in any country about having the lack of consular support.” England have qualified for the finals but the USA have not. The UK Foreign Office says consular teams were available around the clock to assist the 20,000 England fans who visited Brazil for the last World Cup in 2014. The provision of such support will be more difficult in Russia in the present climate, the senior Trump administration official said. “If you get into any kind of difficulty there, we just won’t have the wherewithal. People have accidents. They get ill, they need to be medevacked out. We’re not suggesting that there are going to be some major sets of incidents but it’s just those larger concerns. “We’re trying to work with the Russians on counter-terrorism as well. Any large sporting event, no matter what country now, is a target. And so we’ve now got less ability to be able to do that with the Russians than before because they’ve decimated the counterparts who would be dealing with this kind of thing, for the UK and the US.” The official made clear that the US shares the UK conclusion that Russia was behind the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who were found poisoned on 4 March. A former army colonel sentenced to jail in Russia for spying for Britain, Skripal arrived in the UK as part of a spy swap in 2010. The official said: “I think for our colleagues who work on intelligence, that was a definite rupture of the rules of the game. When you do a spy swap, you don’t expect then that they will be bumped off later.” The official believes Moscow was trying to send a “very big signal, [a] chilling effect for anyone who might be contemplating similar action … or thinking about… criticising the government”. The Trump administration reacted to the Skripal affair by expelling 60 Russians it accused of being spies under diplomatic cover; Moscow retaliated with diplomatic expulsions. Washington struck Putin’s inner circle on Friday, imposing sanctions on seven oligarchs. The White House also singled out Russia’s attempts to subvert western democracies. November’s midterm elections loom as another potential target. The official said: “We’re extremely worried about the potential for their interfering, just like we’re finding out in Britain that perhaps they had some role in the Brexit campaign. The Spanish have already covered all kinds of evidence of how the Russians interfered [in the independence referendum in Catalonia]. We haven’t seen any diminution of attempts. The Department of Homeland Security has a very robust programme now working with state and local governments.” Another official said: “If you look back at 2016, around this time was when a lot of the initial penetrations occurred but the releases of John Podesta’s emails didn’t happen until later. So lack of any sort of overt activity now doesn’t mean that they’re not preparing the battleground for the months ahead.” Donald Trump, however, has consistently and conspicuously declined to condemn Putin while deriding as a “hoax” and “witch-hunt” special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and links between Trump aides and Moscow. The senior official said: “In the case of Russia, this is a very hierarchical society. If you’re going to get anything done with the Russians you have to talk to the guy on top and the president clearly – as we see with China and North Korea – understands that you have to be able to talk to the person on the very top.” Whereas Trump has taken a hard line with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, the official said, he has “always been extraordinarily careful and very respectful in the way that he’s talked about President Xi [Jinping] and he’s taken that approach with Putin. Putin is somebody who is quick to take an insult. He is the leader of a major nuclear superpower. “If you look at that in the past, back to Reagan and Gorbachev and other leaders, there’s always been a lot of care and attention paid to treating with due respect the leader on the other side, to be able to have that chance to sit down across the table. Now, we can criticise that approach. But this is a president who has actually adopted that really in his business dealings as well.” Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said on Monday Trump and Putin had discussed meeting in the “not-too-distant future” at potential venues including the White House. The official continued: “Right now, the relationship between the US and Russia isn’t at rock bottom actually … but we’re in the midst of a forest fire so, sweeping things away, we may have to be starting from scratch. “The UK government, as we understand, is going to go down pretty hard and heavy in some of the ways that we have as well, and we’re going to have to at some point sit down … and just thrash this out and figure out where we’re going to go from here. Theresa May’s going to have to do that too.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/07/hundreds-funeral-palestinian-journalist-gaza","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T16:53:22Z","webTitle":"Hundreds attend funeral of Palestinian journalist shot in Gaza","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/07/hundreds-funeral-palestinian-journalist-gaza","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/07/hundreds-funeral-palestinian-journalist-gaza","fields":{"headline":"Hundreds attend funeral of Palestinian journalist shot in Gaza","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hundreds of colleagues and friends have attended the funeral of a popular and widely respected Palestinian video journalist who was killed as he covered Friday’s mass border protests in the Gaza Strip.

He was one of at least nine Palestinians killed by Israeli fire at various points along the border during the day. Friday’s deaths brought to 31 the total of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in the past week.

Murtaja’s body, draped in a Palestinian flag, was carried from the principal al-Omari mosque in Gaza City to the cemetery. After the burial, freelance photojournalist Shadi al-Assar, described how his friend – who was married with a two-year-old son – had been standing with him about 100 metres from the border fence when he decided to go into the smoke to get a better shot. “Some time later I saw some of the young guys carrying him out on a stretcher. I wanted to take a picture of it and then I realised it was Yasser, my friend.” He and others had removed the jacket and uncovered a small entry wound in his left side. “I thought it was a light injury,” said Assar. But Murtaja, who was taken by ambulance to Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis, died in the early hours of Saturday. Assar, 35, added: “He was a good guy, always smiling and loved by everybody. He was very ambitious, always looking for a better shot.” Like many Gazans of his generation, Murtaja had never been out of the Strip. One of the first journalists to use camera drones in Gaza, Murtaja founded Ain Media, a TV production company that has done work for foreign clients including the BBC and Al Jazeera English. Under a drone image of the Gaza port that he posted on Facebook, he wrote: “I wished I could take this photo from the sky, not from land. My name is Yasser Murtaja, I am 30 years old. I live in Gaza City. I have never travelled.” Although Murtaja is understood to have been independent of all political factions, the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh attended his funeral. He said the weekly protests – described as the “Return March” – represented a “battle of truth and awareness. Yasser held his camera to direct the arrows of truth to convey the image of the besieged people.” The 31 deaths in the past eight days include 19 Palestinians who were killed in the previous mass demonstrations on March or died subsequently of their wounds, along with two armed militants shot dead by Israeli troops in a separate border incident. Hamas has admitted that five of those killed on 30 March were members of its military wing, while Israel has said that 10 of the 19 dead were identified as belonging to Hamas or other factions. The protests are expected to continue over the next month and scheduled to reach their climax in mid-May, when Palestinians commemorate the 70th anniversary of the nakba, or catastrophe, when more than 700,000 were driven out or fled their homes in what is now Israel during the war of 1948."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/07/wayne-rooney-sam-allardyce-substituted-reaction-everton-liverpool-derby","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T15:24:02Z","webTitle":"Sam Allardyce tells Wayne Rooney to keep frustrations behind closed doors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/07/wayne-rooney-sam-allardyce-substituted-reaction-everton-liverpool-derby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/07/wayne-rooney-sam-allardyce-substituted-reaction-everton-liverpool-derby","fields":{"headline":"Sam Allardyce tells Wayne Rooney to keep frustrations behind closed doors","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Sam Allardyce has told Wayne Rooney to vent his frustrations within the confines of the Everton manager’s office after the forward reacted furiously to his early substitution against Liverpool. Rooney was withdrawn in the 57th minute at Goodison Park for the second game in succession as Allardyce sought “more legs” in midfield and an improvement to a passing game he described as “a bit woeful”. The former England captain did not disguise his anger at the decision and responded angrily, appearing to snub his manager’s offer of a handshake as he was replaced by Idrissa Gana Gueye and being caught on camera shouting “bullshit”. The 32-year-old had also been replaced in the 57th minute of last weekend’s comprehensive home defeat by Manchester City. “He can say whatever he wants to me in the office but it has to be done between the four walls of the office between me and him,” the Everton manager said. “He’s an Evertonian through and through and he’s been brought off in a derby game. I’d expect a reaction because that’s how much he cares. That’s fine by me. I wouldn’t expect him to smile and say, ‘All right gaffer, well done’. “The three substitutions, no matter how disappointed anyone is when they are substituted, made a big impact and almost helped us win the game. I understand the ones who get brought off are disappointed but I made those decisions for the benefit of the team and they benefited the team today. Nobody is too big to be hooked.” Everton were on the back foot for the majority of the derby but finished the 0-0 draw strongly and should have recorded their first win over Liverpool in eight years when both Cenk Tosun and Dominic Calvert-Lewin missed excellent chances in the final minutes. Allardyce explained: “Our passing sometimes got a bit woeful and that is why we made the changes. Once we sat back in the first part of the second half, it was time for change. We changed Dominic and Gana and then Beni [Baningime] and that gave us the legs and that bit more quality for everyone else to join in with. We started getting Séamus [Coleman] and Leighton [Baines] forward. I think everyone would agree Liverpool were much more pleased when the final whistle went.” ”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/08/terrorists-plot-shadows-dark-net-report","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"Terrorists ‘plot in shadows of the dark net’, report warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/08/terrorists-plot-shadows-dark-net-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/08/terrorists-plot-shadows-dark-net-report","fields":{"headline":"Terrorists ‘plot in shadows of the dark net’, report warns","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Terrorists and extremists are creating growing numbers of safe havens on the “dark net” to plot future attacks, raise funds and recruit new followers, new research reveals. Terrorist organisations and individuals are evading security services and intelligence agencies by “hiding in the shadows” of the darknet, using encrypted messaging services, to communicate and anonymous cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to generate funds. Researchers for the Henry Jackson Society, a foreign policy thinktank, say that groups have also been able to create a reservoir of extremist propaganda, saving it from deletion by the security services or tech companies. Following the five terror attacks on British soil in 2017, the UK government has dedicated more time and funds to tackling online extremism, yet the report argues that more attention should be paid to the dark net because extremists are still able to operate unchallenged on the anarchic platform. Researchers said that the current encrypted communication app of choice is Telegram, which Islamic State has encouraged members to use, with messages including explanations on how to access new dark net sites linked to the group. In November 2017, an al-Qaida-linked organisation called al-Sadaqah used a public channel on Telegram to campaign for bitcoin funding. The report’s author, Nikita Malik, director of the centre for the response to radicalisation and terrorism at the Henry Jackson Society, said: “We have denied Islamic State territory in the real world, but it has a whole new safe haven in cyberspace which we need first to understand and then to close down. “The authorities must move urgently to increase their knowledge of terrorists’ activities in cyberspace and their use of technologies such as bitcoin. Regulation in this area has to move carefully if we are to balance liberties with guarding against threats to our security – but the time has come to deny extremists the space they need online to plan fresh atrocities.” Malik identified numerous sites on the dark net that explain how to make TATP – triacetone triperoxide – which can be made from household chemicals and was used in the jihadist attacks in Paris in November 2015, Brussels in March 2016, Manchester in May 2017 and Parsons Green, London, in September 2017. One study last year found that of 811 arms-related listings on 24 darknet cryptomarkets, 208 were ebooks with instructions for the manufacture of explosives or firearms at home. A preliminary search on the dark net on 18 January by Malik found 1,101 results for instructional material related to “security”, including guides on drugs, fraud, hacking, and firearms. The Anarchist Cookbook, which contains bomb-making instructions, was available for sale for 0.0003 bitcoin – around £1.45. Other focal points for discussion on darknet forums included “how to make bombs, plan lone-actor terrorist attacks … how to use vehicles as weapons, where to stab people for maximum effect, and how to create a fake suicide vest or mask their activity, with the aim of convincing potential recruits to undertake their own attacks.” Lord Trimble, a current member of Parliament’s joint committee on the national security strategy and former first minister of Northern Ireland, said: “While the first decade of the century was defined by the battle against jihadist ‘safe havens’ – physically located in Afghanistan, north-west Pakistan, Yemen and so on – this report draws attention to the possible rise of ‘virtual safe havens’: encrypted communication channels, hidden portions of the internet, cryptocurrency accounts that are not registered with any banks and more.” Labour’s shadow spokesperson for digital, culture, media and sport, Lord Griffiths of Burry Port, said: “This is a deeply disturbing report, illustrating how extremist content and instructional terrorist material, as well as funding campaigns to raise money for terrorist groups, can be found on the internet – with varying degrees of accessibility.” The report’s recommendations include a new internet regulatory body with the role of scrutinising tech companies’ efforts to remove extremist content, along with extra resources for the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre to accrue darknet intelligence. It also advocates that social media firms should ensure extremist material is not lost when it is deleted, but is archived to help develop a better understanding of extremists’ online behaviour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/08/fernando-alonso-no-regrets-id-make-the-same-decisions-100-times","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T08:00:25Z","webTitle":"Fernando Alonso: ‘No regrets – I’d make the same decisions 100 times’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/08/fernando-alonso-no-regrets-id-make-the-same-decisions-100-times","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/08/fernando-alonso-no-regrets-id-make-the-same-decisions-100-times","fields":{"headline":"Fernando Alonso: ‘No regrets – I’d make the same decisions 100 times’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Fernando Alonso has so often presented a stern grimace for the past three years that it is hugely pleasing to meet him relaxed and buoyant and now sporting a broad grin. He is one of the greatest talents of this generation but the latter part of his career has been almost as torturous to watch as it must have been for him to endure. This season, sitting in the paddock, the Spaniard exudes optimism as well as the familiar determination that has brought him two world championships and kept him fighting through a rollercoaster career in Formula One. Times may have been hard but the passion that drives Alonso has never left him. After wrestling with a woefully underpowered McLaren-Honda for those three years the negativity became so all-encompassing that he tired even of talking about it. Now McLaren are allied with Renault and looking to return to the front of the grid Alonso is happier to open up on what kept him going. “I am a very competitive person in everything,” he says. “Not only F1 but in everyday life. That has helped me to continue for so long. Every day, every year, every new season is a reset from the last and you are still hungry for success, to do things better and better. “I always had that, even when I was a kid in a go-kart or when I was playing soccer or tennis, that need of winning. It was there all my life and it’s still there now.” It drove him to those two titles for Renault, in 2005 and 2006, when he became the then youngest double world champion, aged 25, both times beating Michael Schumacher, who already had his seven championships. Such was Alonso’s talent that more seemed inevitable. However, now 36, he has yet to repeat the feat, while Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel have gone on to take four apiece. The Spaniard’s career since leaving Renault has been one of huge expectation that has remained unfulfilled. A torrid year alongside Hamilton at McLaren followed before he returned to Renault for two years, during which time he might have joined Brawn or Red Bull – both of whom proved to have title-winning cars – but he opted to join Ferrari in 2010. By the end of 2014 his relationship with the Scuderia had broken down and he returned to the bright hope, and then disappointment, of McLaren’s renewed partnership with Honda. His relationships with teams have been known to be difficult, doubtless fuelled by the frustration he has felt at not quite being in the right place at the right time. But now in his 17th season in F1, there is no interest in dwelling on the past. “I don’t regret any decisions,” he says. “Obviously if you can see the future with a crystal ball, you would make different decisions because the performance in the following years were very different. But I don’t regret it because at the moment I took those decisions, I would make the same decision 100 times again. For me at that point it was black and white. “I don’t look back but I understand the questions. The fans would like to see me winning.” He is understandably popular. Winning or not, Alonso is compelling, with an ability to extract more from a car than almost any other driver. His defence against Schumacher at Imola in 2005 was a masterclass. A year later he qualified his Renault in fifth place at Monza while missing part of the rear bodywork, a performance that the team’s data suggested should have been impossible. In 2010, despite his Ferrari not being as quick as the Red Bull, it was only a strategic error by his team that cost him the title at the last round. In 2012 he fought back again. Ferrari opened with the fifth fastest car but Alonso’s skill manhandled it to a lead in the championship and then to a deciding final race only to be denied once again by Vettel. He acknowledges the German and Hamilton as great talents but insists it is still Schumacher that commands his greatest respect. “Michael was a competitor, a driver that never gave up, he never stopped believing in the win,” he says. “It was difficult to open a gap in terms of points because he was always there delivering something special. Michael didn’t need the perfect car – he was always delivering the result.” To beat Schumacher Alonso had to show extraordinary resolve, a trait informed by his love of cycling. “That effort, that mental strength when you have a long climb. You are like the iPhone – you have 70% of your battery and you need to have zero at the top,” he explains. “So how you manage that with the bike it is always quite challenging and attractive. It is physical and mental strength you need to have in road biking.” He admits to becoming frustrated (which is often made public in exasperated radio messages) but insists that he has taken positives from every experience, particularly with British teams. “Maybe the British culture is that way,” he says. “For us more Latin characters maybe we get very high and they will always calm things. When things are bad they are very united, they are very proactive to change things. This has influenced me a lot in my career.” Alonso’s fifth place in Melbourne flattered McLaren’s real position in this season’s pecking order and he has warned that a successful upgrade of the car over the next two months is crucial to the season ahead. To qualify 13th for Sunday’s race in Bahrain proves there is work still to be done and he will be busy. He will also compete at Le Mans as part of a full season of the World Endurance Championship with Toyota. With two victories in the Monaco Grand Prix, winning the 24-hour race would leave Alonso missing only the Indianapolis 500 in his pursuit of motor racing’s triple crown. But at McLaren the mood is already palpably more upbeat and they need to deliver to keep him on board. He is the team’s greatest asset and still capable of making a difference beyond the machinery he is given. Last season the recurring question was whether he would call it a day in F1; for now, happy behind the wheel, his passion for the sport is as strong as ever and once again the only season that matters is this one. “In 2007-08 I thought: ‘Maybe I will race a couple more years,’ but then situations change, your career changes,” he says. “It is difficult to take in how long you have been doing one thing when you compete at the highest level and always with the highest intensity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/08/turnbull-defensive-after-coalition-30th-straight-newspoll-loss-tony-abbott-2015","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T18:00:36Z","webTitle":"Turnbull on defensive after Coalition's 30th straight Newspoll loss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/08/turnbull-defensive-after-coalition-30th-straight-newspoll-loss-tony-abbott-2015","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/08/turnbull-defensive-after-coalition-30th-straight-newspoll-loss-tony-abbott-2015","fields":{"headline":"Turnbull on defensive after Coalition's 30th straight Newspoll loss","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Coalition has notched up its 30th straight Newspoll loss, prompting the prime minister to urge his dispirited colleagues to keep their focus on Labor and the next federal election contest. The latest survey published by the Australian on Sunday night has Labor ahead of the Coalition on the two-party preferred measure 52% to 48%. Malcolm Turnbull is now only two points ahead of his opposite number, Bill Shorten, as preferred prime minister, leading 38% to 36%, and the Coalition’s primary vote is on 38%. This week’s Newspoll – while just another bad poll in a long, negative trend – has loomed as a milestone because Turnbull had used Tony Abbott’s sustained poor showing in the survey as one justification for launching a successful leadership coup in 2015. Turnbull cited Abbott losing 30 Newspolls in a row as a reason to move against him as leader. Turnbull now says he “certainly regrets referring to polling back in 2015” but insists the bulk of the case he made against Abbott when he challenged for the leadership was about economic management and the then government’s lack of a coherent policy narrative. The prime minister said he had made his case to take the take the top job with “a commitment to provide strong economic leadership and restore traditional cabinet government” and claims to have delivered both. Turnbull said the government under his leadership had delivered employment growth, with 420,000 jobs created during 2017. “Those are the types of numbers I’m focused on,” he said. “As we get closer to the election, Australians will be presented with a stark contrast – one of the starkest choices in decades,” the prime minister said in a statement timed to coincide with the poll result. “My government will keep delivering on a plan to lower taxes, generate jobs and reduce energy prices. Bill Shorten is promising higher taxes, fewer jobs and a higher cost of living. Australians have so much to lose, and so much at risk, from a Labor government.” The man Turnbull vanquished in 2015 will mark Monday’s milestone by cycling through coal communities in regional Victoria. Abbott told reporters on Sunday his interest was not the deliberate destabilisation of the prime minister or the government, but securing good policy. Abbott, who maintains himself resolutely in the spotlight, said while he might challenge the government periodically to rethink its policy direction or priorities, “the last thing I want to see is instability in government”. He said: “Our challenge is to be the best possible government we can – that’s the important thing. None of us should live in the past or dwell on things. We’re getting on with our job.” Before the publication of the poll, Turnbull – painfully aware of the own goal of his remarks in 2015 – conducted several interviews to try to insulate himself from the result and senior government figures closed ranks. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, the communications minister, Mitch Fifield, and the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, all fronted the cameras on Sunday to declare Turnbull had the support of his colleagues. Morrison told reporters too much was being made of one survey. “Monday, whatever the result is, will come and go, like every poll,” the treasurer said. “And guess what the government will keep doing? The work we’ve been elected to do.” Over the weekend, an Ipsos poll published by Fairfax put Labor ahead of the Coalition 52% to 48% based on preference flows from the last election, but when voters were asked to allocate their own preferences the federal political contest was a dead heat on 50/50. The last Guardian Essential poll had Labor ahead on the two-party-preferred measure 52% to 48%, an improvement on the previous survey, which had Labor ahead 54% to 46%. A new survey in that series is due to be published on Tuesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/08/shocking-live-export-conditions-not-uncommon-say-animal-rights-groups","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T20:47:12Z","webTitle":"Shocking live export conditions not uncommon, animal rights groups say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/08/shocking-live-export-conditions-not-uncommon-say-animal-rights-groups","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/08/shocking-live-export-conditions-not-uncommon-say-animal-rights-groups","fields":{"headline":"Shocking live export conditions not uncommon, animal rights groups say","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Animal welfare groups say shocking conditions shown in footage of the Australian live export ship Awassi Express in which more than 2,000 sheep died are not uncommon and have been repeatedly reported to the federal regulator. The ship was due to leave Fremantle with 65,000 sheep and 250 cattle on Monday, the ABC has reported, but it failed to satisfy an inspection by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) on Sunday and will not be allowed to sail unless it provides evidence of improvements to airflow. The television footage, filmed covertly by trainee navigator Faisal Ullah and released to 60 Minutes and Animals Australia, shows sheep crammed into dirty pens, panting from heat stress and leaping over each other to access food. It also shows carcasses piled up and in one case thrown overboard, as well as footage of newborn lambs being caught in the bog, despite the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock (ASEL) banning the transport of lambs and pregnant ewes on export ships to the Middle East between the warm months of May to October. Ullah said crew members also slit the throats of lambs and threw them overboard. It is the first time footage from onboard an Australian live export ship has been published. Industry groups, the federal Department of Agriculture, and the agriculture minister, David Littleproud, said that conditions on the voyage were shocking and unacceptable. But livestock veterinarian Dr Sue Foster, a spokeswoman for Vets Against Live Export, said the cramped conditions, severe heat stress, and boggy pens “happens every time one of these ships go the Middle East in summer,” and have been reported by whistleblowers in the past. “If we look at the footage that everyone’s all carrying on about … that ship is stocked according to Australian law,” Foster told Guardian Australia. “That is how every ship goes out of Fremantle.” The voyage of the Awassi shown in Ullah’s footage left Fremantle on 1 August with 63,804 sheep on board for Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. About 2,400 sheep, or 3.76% of the total load, died on route, above the mandatory reportable mortality rate of 2%. A routine investigation by the department found the main cause of death was heat stress. Foster said heat stress was “unavoidable” on voyages to the Middle East in summer, because high humidity frequently pushes the wet bulb temperatures inside the pens to the mid 30s, above the ASEL threshold of 30.6C. Littleproud called for the department to conduct an urgent investigation after being shown the footage on Wednesday, but has not barred the Awassi from sailing again provided it meets a range of new stricter conditions. He told 60 Minutes the footage was “quite harrowing; to be honest it shocked me to the core.” The ship was due to leave Fremantle with 65,000 sheep and 250 cattle on Monday but failed an inspection by Amsa on Sunday. “Amsa has advised the master and ship operator that they will have to arrange a third party air flow verification report to prove compliance with air flow standards before an Australian Certificate for the Carriage of Livestock can be issued,” an Amsa statement reads. The department wrote to Emanuel Exports on Friday saying it would not sail unless it reduced its stocking density by more than 15%, submitted a proposal to increase ventilation, explained how it would improve access to food and water, and allowed an independent observer on board to provide daily reports and images. “So the line in the sand has to be drawn now,” Littleproud told 60 Minutes. “And I’m committed to making sure we do that and put those sheep, if we do go on Monday morning, in the safest possible hands I possibly can.” The Emanuel Exports director Nicholas Daws said “failures” such as the Awassi voyage were “heartbreaking for our company and the producers whose livestock we export.” In a statement after the program aired, Daws said the company had reduced its livestock load for Monday’s shipment by 17.5% to 57,000 sheep and agreed to have a government observer on board. “The footage televised by 60 Minutes is simply devastating and Emanuel Exports apologises to farmers and the broader community for these absolutely unacceptable outcomes,” he said. Daws said Emanuel had to put in place “substantial risk mitigation measures” for the upcoming northern hemisphere summer. The Australian Live Exporters Council, which is managing media responses for Emanuel, has defended the overall conduct of the industry but said there had been “clear breaches of standards” in this case. “Clearly there’s no walking away from this footage,” chief executive Simon Westaway told 60 Minutes. “I mean, there’s clear breaches of standards there.” Westaway added that Australia had the best live export standards in the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/09/the-fight-never-left-stolenwealth-games-protesters-draw-on-long-tradition","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T18:00:37Z","webTitle":"'The fight never left': Stolenwealth Games protesters draw on long tradition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/09/the-fight-never-left-stolenwealth-games-protesters-draw-on-long-tradition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/09/the-fight-never-left-stolenwealth-games-protesters-draw-on-long-tradition","fields":{"headline":"'The fight never left': Stolenwealth Games protesters draw on long tradition","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Aboriginal camp protesting the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games sits at the very end of a slender finger of land known as The Spit. It’s roughly 10km north of Surfers Paradise and past the opulent Gold Coast marina, the Palazzo Versace and Sheraton resorts, and the Sea World amusement park. Within the camp at Doug Jennings park there is a kitchen, toilets and showers, and more than 100 caravans, tents and swags scattered around, but clearly delineated by cyclone-wire fencing installed at the expense of the games’ organising committee. After midday, a speaker system blasts music by Indigenous artists whenever it is not being used for speeches. The mood is subdued. Fishing rods and surfboards lean against trees. Small sitting circles dot the open ground. In a cheeky nod to the constant police patrols and the entrance gate which is locked around dark, the protest mob call it Camp Freedom. Talk to members of the camp and you quickly come to realise they consider their protest a continuation of demonstrations during the Melbourne Commonwealth Games in 2006 and the notorious rallies that occurred around the hosting of the 1982 Games in Brisbane. But they will just as quickly remind you there is a much longer, deeper legacy of resistance in play here too. Dale Ruska is a Goenpul Goorie from Stradbroke Island. As an original owner he is one of many nominated spokespeople for the protest group which has formed under a coalition banner of “Stolenwealth Games”, a slogan initiated 12 years earlier for the Melbourne games. He says the current protest is a continuation of First Nations resistance to British colonisation of the continent. “Ever since that time, Aboriginal people have been striving to get fair and equitable justice for our people. The protests that occurred during the Commonwealth Games in 1982 was just another point of resistance in our justice endeavours. This protest in 2018 is one more.” Another local, Pat Leavy, the president of the Yallburru community organisation, says the camp of around 150 people consists of representatives from First Nations and clan groups across Australia. She says the mob has come to join in protest because they feel governments and the general public are not listening to their diverse concerns as Indigenous disadvantage grows. “Every protest we have, we hope to make a difference,” she says. “Sometimes there are people in the community that might not agree with what we are doing, but at every major event that has come to Australia we have held a protest. It’s not just about us, it’s about the broader community too.” The mob’s protests have drawn criticism from both white and black Australia. On day one, a sit-in blockade of the road beside the campsite delayed the games baton relay for several hours. Later that day, at Wednesday evening’s opening ceremony, an action outside the stadium resulted in three of the demonstrators being arrested and charged. The action happened after a representative group of 10 were initially informed they had been provided with gratis tickets by the games committee and then were refused entry. Games officials and police liaison officers remain confused about what happened and have pledged to look into it. The three protesters charged must front the local magistrates court in late April and May. Within the Indigenous social media sphere, long comment threads ensued throughout Wednesday and Thursday. “This is why I hate saying I’m Aboriginal because they give us good ones a bad name and it makes it harder for us to get the things in life,” posted one. In response, another Indigenous user posted: “Be proud of who you are don’t think your nothing because you are something and someone. Protests like that won’t get anywhere in talks with government.” Meanwhile, some groups within the protest coalition condemned those taking part in the games, issuing an early statement calling “for all participating nations, athletes, artists and fans to boycott the games and to end colonial occupation and oppression in Australia as well the systemic abuse against our communities”. Some were also sceptical about the involvement of local Aboriginal people in the development of the opening ceremony and questioned the cultural consultation process involved. The opening ceremony became controversial after rightwing non-Indigenous politicians and commentators took exception to what they perceived as too heavy an Indigenous focus. Leader of the One Nation party, Pauline Hanson, described the 20 minutes dedicated to celebrating Australia’s Indigenous heritage as “absolutely disgusting”. This followed comments by conservative radio jock Alan Jones’ on Thursday morning in which he tweeted that the ceremony was a “disgrace” and later, while on air, described the Indigenous segments as “rubbish and an insult”. Aboriginal man and director of the Sydney Festival, Wesley Enoch, was a segment director involved with many of the Indigenous aspects of the opening ceremony. He says multiple clans within the local Yugambeh language group were closely involved in the conceptual and creative process. “The bulk of it was local Yugambeh groups,” he says. “There were also groups from Yarrabah [northern Queensland] and Woorabinda [central Queensland]. There were the Kaurna plains mob [South Australia], Nyoongar groups from around Perth, and Larrakia mob [western tip of the Northern Territory].” Enoch says an an all-Indigenous working group guided proper cultural consultation for at least five years prior to the staging of the opening ceremony. “I haven’t yet found a process that suited everyone uniformly in any of the things I’ve done, but the feedback I got from elders was that they were happy with it and the Indigenous working group was fantastic in supporting all the ideas,” he says. He also argues the Indigenous presence within the stadium during the opening ceremony reflected the same resistance that was occurring outside the gates on the night. “We were talking about cultural sovereignty, we were talking treaty discussions, we were talking visibility of our issues – these same things, just manifested in different ways,” he says. “I go back to this idea that when we think about the 1994 Commonwealth Games, when Cathy Freeman won her 400m race and then wore the Aboriginal flag around the track in her victory lap, whitefullas were saying that was terrible.” Back in Camp Freedom, Ruby Wharton sits on a rock beside her father Wayne, who was closely involved in the 1982 Brisbane protests which led to a feverish sense of civil unrest at the time. On the paddock opposite, Indigenous police liaison officers are kicking a football with a big mob of cheerful kids. It feels far removed from the state’s brutal social oppression of the early 80s. But equally as removed from the clash at the entry gates of the arena only a couple nights before. “It just feels like it’s my responsibility,” Ruby says when asked why she is protesting. “It’s like me upholding the family tradition, and standing strong not only for myself but other young blackfullas from all around the place. The fight has never left. We’ve always been a people that is always resisting.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/09/warriors-nrl-kearney-cowboys-cleary","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T18:00:37Z","webTitle":"Simple reasons behind Warriors' surprise rise to top of NRL ladder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/09/warriors-nrl-kearney-cowboys-cleary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/09/warriors-nrl-kearney-cowboys-cleary","fields":{"headline":"Simple reasons behind the Warriors' surprise rise to the top of the NRL ladder","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There are more nuances in rugby league than those outside looking in might give it credit for. Playmakers throw soft, short balls and spiralling long ones. Large men run fine lines at “soft”, “inside” shoulders. Defenders pile in like elite-level bouncers, like secret service guys man-handling a dangerous drunk away from the President. And coaches sit in their box and rage and scheme in a language almost cricket-esque in its clubbie complexity. Yet often the game-play can be broken down to its simplest, brassiest tack: big man run fast and straight. And repeat. Step forward your competition co-leaders, the surprising New Zealand Warriors, who on Saturday night at Auckland’s Mount Smart Stadium coupled a staunch defensive effort with an offloading game that set free a series of diamond-hard charges into the ragged, back-peddling meat of the Cowboys’ D-line. In one set in the middle of the second half, the Warriors went 70 metres by simply scooping up the ball at dummy-half and charging hard. Solomone Kata is purpose-built for this action. Isaac Luke has done it for 236 NRL games. Buoyed by a bumper home crowd – who’d spent the previous few hours watching the also-surprising Wests Tigers knock over the premiers, and drinking beer – the Warriors won 22-12. The noise in the joint was thick, finals-esque. You could see the Warriors lift on the back of it. And an old adage was resurrected: the Warriors would win the premiership if the grand final were played in Auckland. There’s always been adages about the Warriors. There’s been group-think, accepted truths, furphies, stereotypes. There are many predicting their fall as just a matter of time. For the moment, they are the destructor of tipping comps. The bester of Titans, Rabbitohs, Roosters, Raiders and now Cows. The Warriors are the hottest little league team west of a Tahitian time zone. And they are five-and-oh-how-did-that-happen? How did it happen? Sounds simple – but it’s the players, stupid. Coach Stephen Kearney has instituted a game plan utilising the talents of his players. Shaun Johnson is running, stepping and firing balls wide. Blake Green is driving the team “shape”, doing simple “boring” things well. Adam Blair has been bopping about annoying people since 2006; on Saturday he made 47 tackles. Tohu Harris is a Craig Bellamy creation. Peta Hiku has been at more clubs than Shane Warne. Experience is key. The Warriors have a fine storm of games played and maturity reached. Blair has played 270 NRL games. Luke has played 236 games. Shaun Johnson is now 27, a good age for a footy player. He’s still got all the zip but he’s now in his eighth season in the NRL. Johnson knows what he can do and when he can do it. At training they talk of “accountability”. There are honesty sessions. If blokes don’t aim up, they admit it. And if they don’t, they’re told. Green, Blair and Harris have brought calmness to a squad that could lean to the fractious. Example: The Warriors led 18-0 after 36 minutes through tries to impressive wingers David Fusiitu’a and Ken Maumolo. In previous years, such a lead may have meant party time. But after each try, the Warriors huddled, breathed in (literally) and continued to do what got them there. They ran hard, tackled hard and, mostly, hung onto the bloody ball. It’s not that simple, of course. The Warriors completed at 80 per cent. A pass mark, perhaps. But their “shape” looked good. Their big bodies ran convincing angles. Post-contact, they offloaded 14 times. It’s a telling number. An offload means the next guy is running in “broken” play, against a defensive line going backwards, that’s not set. And into something like that “Bully” Luke (who notched 64 “fantasy points”, whatever they are) will prosper. They defended like Spartans, missing just 25 tackles of 376 attempted. So the Warriors took the points, and took the points. They landed penalty goals in the 53rd and 75th minutes. Previous years, 20 metres out in front, the Warriors, again, might’ve entertained us all with a try or a ridiculous stuff-up. There was rarely anything in between. Repeat set? What? In 2018 they take the points. And they breathe. Yes, the breathing. After tries, the Warriors gather in a group and “reset” by filling their lungs and becalming themselves. It looks almost spiritual. Always among the most talented of footy sides, it seems they’re grasping for inner peace. It was All Blacks captain Kieran Read’s idea. Warriors captain Roger Tuivasa-Sheck is all over it. “Scoring tries, you know, we tend to get a bit excited as a group,” Tuivasa-Sheck said. “And in previous years … we’ve been ahead then lost in the last 10 minutes. “The breathing is just about coming together to reset, re-focus and get ready to go again. Focus on the next task.” Next task? Brisbane in Auckland. Be no surprise if there’s a surfeit of side-steps."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/08/russell-crowe-divorce-auction-nets-37m-sydney","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T09:06:19Z","webTitle":"'Something for the man cave': rich pickings as Russell Crowe's divorce auction nets $3.7m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/08/russell-crowe-divorce-auction-nets-37m-sydney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/08/russell-crowe-divorce-auction-nets-37m-sydney","fields":{"headline":"'Something for the man cave': rich pickings as Russell Crowe's divorce auction nets $3.7m","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Perhaps be slightly wary of using your paddle as a fan this evening,” cautions Sotheby’s Australia auctioneer Martin Gallon. The illustrious auction house has taken over the Elston Room in Redfern’s Carriageworks to preside over The Art of Divorce, Russell Crowe’s bizarre and well-publicised auction to finance the dissolution of his marriage to Danielle Spencer. On a hot and muggy Sydney Saturday evening, the auction staff somehow keep themselves from sweating through their tuxedos, but the climate is not the only thing that doesn’t quite match the host’s unflappable primness. As tables of immaculately dressed assistants to the seriously rich prepare to take phone and internet bids, 30 Odd Foot of Grunts hits warble through the room’s speakers. Chris, a middle-aged bloke with a blond mustache and puffy vest, has given up hope of winning the prop sword from Gladiator – apparently Ed Sheeran has expressed an interest. He’s willing to settle for the wooden training sword instead, but he dreams of taking the full-size replica chariot home. “I’d put it in the driveway”, he deadpans. “Take it down to Roads and Maritime, get it registered.” Things kick off with a series of collectibles from Crowe’s movies. Lot 1, a shirt and other items from the 1991 movie Proof, sells for an internet bid of $650. Things escalate quickly. The next item, the brown Doc Marten boots from 1992 film Romper Stomper, net $10,000. The buyer? National Museum of Australia, which also hands over $2,000 for Crowe’s costume from 1993 movie The Silver Brumby. But the first big-ticket item up for grabs is the famous Gladiator breastplate. Starting at $20,000, the asking price doubles in seconds. Triples. Quadruples. “Someone’s keen!” Gallon enthuses. Eventually the bidding tops out at $125,000, sparking a small squall of Gladiator fever. The breastplate’s matching wrist cuffs go for $32,000. The wooden sword gets $20,000. The metal one, $70,000. Owen, in black jeans and a crisp blue formal shirt, takes the chariot home for $65,000. “Something for the man cave,” he grins. His impeccable Oxbridge accent echoing off the stained factory walls, Gallon is delightfully chipper, as only someone who gets paid to coax rich people out of their money could be. When the first full-size, unsettlingly lifelike Gladiator prop horse comes up on screen behind him, Gallon does a double-take. “Look at that! Something for everyone!” From nowhere, a woman takes the stage and begins to sing Happy Birthday. Besides being his erstwhile wedding anniversary, Crowe has scheduled The Art of Divorce on his own 54th birthday, perhaps to gift himself an almighty pile of money. A mildly befuddled audience joins in the “hip hip hoorays” at her urgings, which seem odd on behalf of someone who is not here. Only, he is. Bearded and beaming, Crowe bounces onstage to talk up Lot 31, an 1890 Milanese violin crafted by master luthier Leandro Bisiach Sr and used in the 2003 drama Master and Commander. “This is just a suggestion,” Crowe says, but the buyer “might want to lend it to a young musician so it carries on and starts to play in the concert halls around the world”. Gesturing to a woman in a cocktail dress below him, he suggests: “This young lady, standing right here, may be the young musician that you may want to give the violin to.” Bridget O’Donnell, a member of the Australian Youth Orchestra, takes the stage to play two pieces from Master and Commander, accompanied on the cello by Hanna Oblikov. As you would hope from a violin that ends up going for $135,000, it sounds pretty bloody nice. Besides the Gladiator paraphernalia, many of Crowe’s movie costumes are in high demand. His Royal Navy dress blues from Master and Commander goes for $115,000. The blue sleeveless vest he wore as Javert in Les Miserables fetches $12,000. The primeval leather jockstrap from Cinderella Man was expected to go for between $500 and $600, but a handful of disquietingly eager phone bidders push it up to $7,000. As the crowd thins down to the serious bidders, things begin to get truly baroque. The mosasaur skull Russell picked up from Leonardo DiCaprio via the late Cretaceous period, fetches $65,000. A 17th century Flemish tapestry the size of a billboard goes for $24,000, presumably to adorn someone’s private aircraft hangar. A pair of 18th century duelling pistols go for $26,000 and a bronze warship cannon sells straight after for $20,000. But it’s Crowe’s stunning collection of Australian artwork that fetches the highest prices. The aficionados checking out the Sydney Biennale at the other end of the complex would have nosebleeds if they realised what they were missing out on. The first artwork to go under the hammer, the exquisite still life Bush Flowers by Margaret Olley, takes $70,000. Sidney Nolan’s Abundance does one better, fetching $100,000. Brett Whiteley’s Moreton Bay Fig and Palms goes for $190,000; Charles Blackman’s The Suitor for $360,000. The selling prices don’t include the 22% tax Sotheby’s places on each item. The night ends, more than five hours after it started, with a brisk trade in jewellery and no fewer than 28 watches. The mysterious potentates on the other end of the phone bids go berserk. As the bids creep north of $10,000, solemn-looking men in the audience duel with their paddles. An Armani watch that doesn’t work sells for $1,100. A Rolex that does nets $40,000. In a late-night Tweet after everyone’s gone home, Crowe tallies up his winnings. “$3.7m at the coal face and around $350k of conversations ongoing,” he says. “Not a bad hourly rate for a 5 hour shift.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/07/trump-tower-fire-50th-floor","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T12:41:50Z","webTitle":"Trump Tower fire: man dies in blaze on 50th floor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/07/trump-tower-fire-50th-floor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/07/trump-tower-fire-50th-floor","fields":{"headline":"Trump Tower fire: man dies in blaze on 50th floor","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A man was killed and six firefighters injured after an apartment caught fire on the 50th floor of Trump Tower in New York on Saturday. The victim, Todd Brassner, was found unresponsive in his apartment and was pronounced dead in the hospital, police said. The 67-year-old was an art dealer who was friends with Andy Warhol, according to reports. Officials did not immediately release information about the cause of the fire. Donald Trump, who has an office and private residence in the Manhattan premises, his wife Melania and son Barron were not in the building at the time. The fire broke out shortly before 6pm on Saturday. About 45 minutes later the president, who was in Washington, tweeted: “Fire at Trump Tower is out. Very confined (well built building). Firemen (and women) did a great job. THANK YOU!” Trump’s son Eric tweeted: “Thank you to the amazing men and women of the NYFD [sic] who extinguished a fire in a residential apartment.” Brassner, who sold a number of Warhol prints, is mentioned several times in the artist’s autobiography, the Andy Warhol Diaries, according to the New York Daily News. The paper also reported that Brassner had filed for bankruptcy in 2015 after “limited support from his family coupled with his medical problems” caused him to fall behind on his bills. The fire commissioner, Daniel Nigro, told reporters outside the building: “This was a very difficult fire. As you can imagine, the apartment is quite large, we are 50 stories up. The rest of the building had a considerable amount of smoke. We had many floors to search, and stairways.” He also said: “The upper floors, which are residence floors, are not sprinklered, but the building sure stood up quite well.” Fire sprinklers were not required in New York City high-rises when Trump Tower was completed in 1983. Updates to the building code required commercial skyscrapers to install sprinklers, but owners of older residential high-rises are not required to install sprinklers unless the building undergoes major renovations. Some fire-safety advocates pushed for a requirement that older apartment buildings be fitted with sprinklers when the city passed a law requiring them in new residential high-rises in 1999. Officials under then mayor Rudy Giuliani said that would be too expensive. About 200 firefighters responded to Saturday’s incident, which was steadily upgraded in severity. Video on social media showed flames outside a few windows and black smoke billowing up from the building. The New York police department closed 5th Avenue between West 55th Street and West 57th Street, and West 56th Street between Madison Avenue and 5th Avenue. Some residents said they did not get any notification from building management to evacuate. Lalitha Masson, 76, said she had “a very, very terrifying experience”, telling the New York Times she did not receive any announcement about leaving, and that when she called the front desk no one answered. “When I saw the television, I thought we were finished,” said Masson, who lives on the 36th floor with her husband, Narinder, who is 79 and has Parkinson’s disease. Masson started praying, she said, because she felt it was the end. “I called my oldest son and said goodbye to him because the way it looked everything was falling out of the window, and it reminded me of 9/11,” she said. Three people were injured in an early-morning fire at the top of Trump Tower in January. A firefighter was taken to hospital and two people were treated at the scene for minor injuries. In addition to the president’s 66th-floor penthouse, Trump Tower houses the headquarters of the Trump Organization on the 26th floor and other residences, offices and stores. The building actually has 58 floors. In a marketing practice he has extended to other properties, Trump bills it as having 68. Nigro said firefighters had gone up “with the secret service to check the president’s residence. Some smoke reached the rest of the building, whether it’s in the [president’s] apartment I don’t know right now.” Often the scene of demonstrations and counter-demonstrations against or in support of the president, Trump Tower is guarded each day by extra security personnel. Nigro said extra firefighting resources are only in place when the president is in residence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/07/violent-youths-crime-wave-uk-social-media-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T20:00:10Z","webTitle":"Violent youths ‘should face social media ban’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/07/violent-youths-crime-wave-uk-social-media-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/07/violent-youths-crime-wave-uk-social-media-ban","fields":{"headline":"Violent youths ‘should face social media ban’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Young people who commit violence offences should be banned from using social media such as YouTube, Snapchat and Instagram, according to the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on knife crime. Speaking before the launch of the government’s new serious violence strategy, the MP Sarah Jones urged the extension of criminal behaviour orders (CBOs) to give courts the power to ban individuals from using social media. Senior officers are concerned that online content on YouTube and other sites is helping fuel the current knife crime and gun epidemic – last month was the bloodiest in London for nearly a decade. Yet tech companies are refusing to remove some content despite requests from the police. On Sunday the Home Office will move to tighten up other online loopholes by announcing tough restrictions on knives bought through the internet. The new offensive weapons bill, which will be published within weeks, aims to prevent knives that are bought online being sent to residential addresses, as well as making it illegal to possess certain offensive weapons, such as “zombie” knives and knuckledusters. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, will tomorrow unveil the serious violence strategy to combat a rising toll that includes more than 50 people murdered in London so far this year. It will place renewed emphasis on early intervention and prevention, along with increased support for community groups working with young people, a package of measures that confirm the Home Office’s acceptance that the killings cannot be halted through increased convictions and tougher sentencing. “It’s about stopping people before they become involved in gangs, before they pick up a knife, and if they have become involved in such activity, stopping them before they get any further,” said a Home Office source. The strategy also contains measures to tackle so-called “county lines” drug trading, where urban gangs force children as young as 12 to traffic drugs in suburban or rural areas using dedicated mobile phones, along with fresh demands for social media companies to take action against video sites that glorify violence. Jones hopes that the Home Office will back the broader use of CBOs, which replaced Asbos in 2014, and revealed that Rudd had described their potential effectiveness in tackling youth violence as “compelling”. “We know the causes of knife crime and violence are multiple, but one factor impacting the scale of the problem is social media, because it is fuelling a cycle of violence,” Jones said. Meanwhile, a number of senior parliamentary figures are calling on Rudd to incorporate an “ambitious target” to halve deaths from serious youth violence over the next decade as part of her strategy. A letter, signed by 11 chairs and commissioners from cross-party campaign groups, and David Blunkett, the former home secretary, urges the government to “put children and young people at [the] heart” of the strategy and treat the epidemic of violence as a “public health” issue. It states: “Knife crime is an epidemic, spreading through our communities and we know that violence breeds violence. “A truly new and multi-agency approach will recognise this as a public health crisis, tackling the problem at source while immunising future generations against violence.” More immediate actions were evident on Saturday with an extra 300 Metropolitan Police officers deployed in the areas of London worst affected by a spate of violent crime. Sunday’s Home Office announcement of new legislation also includes measures to make prosecutions easier by changing the legal definition for threatening someone with an offensive weapon and banning the possession of a knife on a further education premises, following data that shows knife-carrying in schools has soared by 42% over the last two years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/10/disabled-housing-broken-lift-prisoner-home-disability-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T13:00:27Z","webTitle":"A broken lift made me a prisoner in my home.

But I fought for my disability rights","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Many years ago, aged 16, I broke the law and was remanded in custody to await my trial. I was confined to my cell for up to 22 hours a day and only occasionally got to break the monotony of it all, strolling with my fellow inmates around the prison courtyard. Although my incarceration was short – I got a community service order and a fine – my loss of independence hurt. I vowed I would never return to jail. I never did, but the onset of multiple sclerosis, and severe disability, meant I went back to that waiting cell, metaphorically speaking. I’ve still got a room with a view, but this time it’s with a life tariff. Doing this type of “bird”, for me and countless others living with a chronic disease, can be hard labour. I count myself lucky, though. Soon after diagnosis I became homeless and went to the local council for help. A few months later they awarded me a flat. My mobility was manageable to start with but over the decade I lived there, the steps up to my flat became too much. My special needs elevated me to the highest band on the transfer list. When a self-contained adapted apartment became available nearby under the management of a housing association, I moved in. I’ve lived there for eight years now. My disease has continued, confining me to a wheelchair and now affecting my whole body. I can still get out, thankfully, if my energy levels allow. It’s a bit of a lifeline, a chance to share a conversation, an opportunity to feel part of something. However, living on the first floor of a housing block, I have a new incarcerator, whose reliability is often very poor – the lift. Recently it broke down – again. It was motionless for 10 days. The landlord and lift engineers were quick to blame each other – no one was prepared to take responsibility, leaving me reliant on the goodwill of my neighbour. My problem, though, does not appear isolated. A quick search on Google reveals many others marooned in their flats because of sub-standard services. A chronic shortage of accessible housing in the UK means that an estimated 1.8 million people with disabilities – 56% of whom are homeowners – are often unable to leave their homes, and many are desperate for alternative accommodation. The case of Richard Chrimes, who has to crawl through his front door because his wheelchair does not fit through the front door of his two-storey house, was recently featured by the BBC. He has to drag himself along the ground to get to his car. After several years he’s still waiting for a home that both he and the council agree is appropriate. I could have sat there and taken the broken-down lift, but why should I? I’ve done enough time already! As far as I’m concerned, the broken lift infringed my human rights. It stripped me of my independence. So I refused to pay my rent for the period it was out of order and sought compensation for the inconvenience caused. I also made a local councillor aware of my predicament, including him in the “round robin” email correspondence with the housing association. He informed the landlord and me that the lift’s inaction may have broken the 2010 Equality Act. The news seemed to tip the balance. Soon after the lift was fixed, both myself and my neighbour (who is also disabled), received compensation of more than £500 as settlement. Everyone in the same predicament should think about taking a similar stand. We all have a voice and it is there to be heard. When those voices are amplified, they make a difference – otherwise nothing changes. This was a point of principle, a line I was prepared to hold, whatever the cost. The lift has worked fine since, fingers crossed. Hopefully the payment means a lesson has been learned and any future malfunction will be treated with more urgency. Future building forecasts and an ageing population mean many more people who become less mobile could be forced to live in properties that ultimately imprison them - little provision is being made for their long-term needs. It should be enshrined in law that new developments have more accessible housing. It makes sense. More of us are reaching our twilight years and none of us knows what lies ahead.

But the nature of the link to the level of serious violent crime has proven to be more difficult to pin down. As a result, it has become the focal point of a fierce debate between the Conservatives and Labour, as well as between police forces and ministers – but possibly to the detriment of a more nuanced and broader understanding of the spike in violence. Home Office statistics show the number of police officers fell from their peak of 144,353 in 2009 to 123,142 in March 2017. Some serious violent offences have been rising since 2014, including homicide, knife crime and gun crime. The Police Federation, which represents tens of thousands of rank-and-file officers, has repeatedly warned that any rises in crime can be closely linked to a decline in the number of officers. Former police officers, including those writing for the Guardian, have asserted that the reduced availability of officers is putting national security at risk. Last year, the Police Foundation, an independent policing thinktank, published a study on neighbourhood policing – in essence bobbies on the beat – that concluded: “It is clear that the cuts imposed in the years of austerity have substantially diminished the effectiveness of neighbourhood policing in many areas.” And now research commissioned by the Home Office, and seen by the Guardian, found that falling officer numbers is likely to be “an underlying driver that has allowed the rise [in violent crime] to continue”. So how can the argument that a drop of police officers is linked to a rise in violence be challenged – including by the current home secretary, Amber Rudd? Looking further back, the statistics create room for doubt. Violent crime as recorded by police has been increasing since 2014, but it was falling between 2009 and 2014 – as police officer numbers were being cut. There are also different measures, which can complicate the picture. The Office for National Statistics said that the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW), an alternative measure to police-recorded offences, is the best source for assessing long-term trends in violent crime as the survey’s methodology has remained consistent over time. According to that survey, violence peaked in 1995 and has fallen by more than two-thirds – 68% – since. And from 2007-2008, when police numbers were at a high, violent crimes continued to decrease by 41%. The Home Office research also states that – on a force by force breakdown of violent crime offences – not all forces with falling officer numbers are experiencing rises in violent crime. For these reasons, the home secretary has argued that it is too “simplistic” to focus solely on police numbers. What is clear is that omitting any discussion or research on police numbers in what is supposed to be a landmark serious violence strategy – regardless of the views or conclusions drawn – leaves the home secretary and her department wide open to criticism. The documents, leaked to the Guardian, were laid out and written in similar language to that which appeared in the final strategy. One of the graphs in the research document was used in the final paper. But the impact of reduced police numbers was nowhere to be found. The debate over the decline of police officer numbers prevents other possible causes behind the rise in violent crime being given much attention, such as the impact of austerity. According to the research, falling officer numbers are “unlikely” to have triggered the shift in violent crime – rather, they allowed it to continue to rise. It acknowledges that falling officer numbers are “not the main driver but likely to have contributed”. Chapter 2 of the serious violence strategy is titled “risk and protective factors and interventions”. Behind this dry headline, there is complex research into the drivers at “an individual level” that could make for equally as uncomfortable reading for the government as any criticism over falling police numbers. It states that, like other types of crime and antisocial behaviour, violent crime has a clear link to “poor life outcomes” such as low educational attainment, poor health and unemployment. “Consequently socioeconomic improvements, strengthening ties to family, school and non-violent norms are key areas for reducing violence,” it concludes. Elsewhere in the strategy, great focus is placed on illegal drug markets and the link with violent crime. It mentions that there is evidence to suggest use of crack cocaine, one of the most additive illegal substances, is on the rise in England and Wales without any further explanation why its use is increasing. It seems to suggest that, along with falling police numbers, another reason for the rise in police-recorded violent crime could be an increase in people from disadvantaged backgrounds. If crime can act as a barometer for the health of a country, then this report flags up broad and complex factors behind the rise in violence including, but not limited to, the number of police officers on the streets of England and Wales."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/apr/23/population-how-many-people-can-the-earth-sustain-lucy-lamble","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T05:00:02Z","webTitle":"With 250 babies born each minute, how many people can the Earth sustain? | Lucy Lamble","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/23/population-how-many-people-can-the-earth-sustain-lucy-lamble","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/apr/23/population-how-many-people-can-the-earth-sustain-lucy-lamble","fields":{"headline":"With 250 babies born each minute, how many people can the Earth sustain?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"How many people are there in the world? We don’t know for sure as all figures are estimates, but UN data suggests there were about a billion people in 1800, 2 billion in 1927, 5 billion in 1987 and just over 7.5 billion today. There are on average about 250 babies born every minute – more than 130 million in a year. It is projected that there will be 11 billion people by 2100. New UN figures are due out in June. Most national governments make their own population projections. The United Nations and the World Bank figures are the most widely used globally. Since the 1960s, more boys than girls have been born every year. About 117 million women are believed to be “missing” in Asia and eastern Europe – due to discriminatory son preference and gender-biased sex selection. Over the last 30 years, some regions have seen up to 25% more male births than female births, reflecting the persistent low status of women and girls. The consequent gender imbalance can have damaging social effects such as increased sexual violence and trafficking. Where is the population rising fastest – and slowest? Broadly speaking, the fastest population rises are being recorded in Africa and Asia, which will have 15 of the 20 most populous nations by 2050. By that year, there will be more Nigerians than Americans. By 2100, it is projected that as many as one-third of all people – almost 4 billion – will be African. At the other end of the scale, population growth has stalled – or even gone into reverse – in parts of western Europe, Japan and Russia. Are these numbers sustainable? A nuanced question. Experts like Paul Ehrlich argue that the population of the world has long since surpassed optimal levels, though critics counter that consumption is as important as population levels. Some believe the very argument about overpopulation is controversial as it tends to point the finger at poorer parts of the world with large growth rates, and not at richer regions, which use disproportionately high amounts of resources. What influences fertility? The fertility rate is the number of children born for every woman of childbearing age in a population. The things that tend to affect it include female empowerment, wellbeing and the status of children, technological and economic changes, and opportunities for family planning. The level of education in a society – of women in particular – is one of the most important predictors for the number of children families have. The global average fertility rate is just below 2.5 children per woman today. Over the last 50 years the global fertility rate has halved, as some of these factors bore down on family sizes. In the pre-modern era, fertility rates of 4.5 to 7 children per woman were common. At that time, high mortality rates of young people kept population growth low. As health improved, the population growth rate began to soar, only flattening out as the fertility rate declined towards 2 children per woman. A record number of women now use contraception. Figures from the UN’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs show 64% of married and cohabiting women used modern or traditional methods of contraception in 2015 – a significant rise from 36% in 1970. But the figures show wide disparities between and within regions and countries. Africa has the lowest percentage of women using contraceptives, and the highest unmet need in the world. Despite this, some African countries have made the biggest leaps in contraception use over the past 40 years and are projected to make the greatest gains in the next 15. In Mauritius, rapid population growth in the early 60s led the government to launch a family planning programme, and the country now boasts the highest rates (75.5%) on the continent. If birthrates have fallen so far, why is the population still rising fast? Of course, fertility rates are just half the story. People are living longer – far longer in some parts of the world. About 55m people die every year, which is less than half the number who are born. The number of children who die before reaching their fifth birthday has fallen to an all-time low: it is currently less than half what it was in 1990. A child’s chance of survival is still vastly different depending on where they are born. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest under-five mortality rate – 79 deaths for every 1,000 births, which means that one child in 13 die before their fifth birthday. This compares with six for every 1,000 in Europe and northern America and four for every 1,000 in Australia and New Zealand. At the same time, life expectancy is higher than 80 in 30 countries and higher than 70 in more than 100 countries. So what is the demographic dividend? Countries that do succeed in reducing fertility rates can benefit from a demographic dividend, where there are more people in work than children to support. Where you have a rapid decline in fertility, the younger population is no longer growing as fast and the economy should receive a boost because the number of workers per child increases, and that should provide a period of rapid economic growth. This was the experience in the east Asian “tiger” countries like South Korea and Taiwan in the 70s. Now countries such as China and India are benefiting from a demographic dividend. A consequence of falling child mortality but continuing high fertility is a “youth bulge” – a high population of young people. In Africa, because rising numbers of increasingly educated people have not been matched by jobs, this has led to significant youth unemployment. A young population offers a lot of potential for the development of a country, but only if their talents are realised through investment. If there is little support given to young people to develop the skills they need as they enter the labour market, then the economy misses out. Isn’t it problematic that western populations are declining? Another global demographic shift is ageing populations in developed countries such as Japan and Germany, and also in advanced developing countries. In nations as diverse as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Mongolia and Vietnam, the population aged over 60 will triple by 2050. This year, the number of people worldwide who are over 60 will rise above 1 billion for the first time. By 2050, it is forecast to be 2 billion. This raises the question: who will pay for them? Falling birth rates can mean fewer young workers entering the labour force at a time when the healthcare and social support costs associated with ageing are likely to rise. But ageing populations can be a cause for celebration. It means development has taken place. If countries plan for the shift they can see gains. In Japan, for example, the introduction of universal health coverage meant more treatment for high blood pressure, and therefore fewer strokes, extending worker productivity. If countries consider redesigning pension systems and offering flexible work in retirement, seeing older volunteers as a potential resource, then many more mature members of society can have not just greater life expectancy but also be healthier for longer. Later retirement does not have to mean fewer jobs for the young. More older people working can increase GDP and generate more demand for young workers. What next? The funding battles over international family planning are ongoing. US Congress rejected the 2018 budget. The debates will continue in 2019. Family planning organisations are learning that to survive political shifts and budget cuts, they need to diversify their sources of funding. This means seeing family planning as not just a public health concern but also about development and a clear return on investment. Where women have control over their own fertility, there are gains well beyond their own families.

On the south side of the palm-lined road, on a spring lunchtime, the Fattoush restaurant is packed with customers chatting noisily in Arabic and Hebrew over Levantine and fusion salads, cardamom-flavoured coffee and exquisite Palestinian knafeh desserts. Fashionable eateries like Fattoush are one reason why Israel’s third largest city and its biggest “mixed” one, as officially classified, is held up as a model of Jewish-Arab coexistence. Not everyone agrees with the concept, of course, and the “c” word is often qualified, placed in inverted commas, or simply dismissed as propaganda. Official figures say Arabs make up 14% of Haifa’s 280,000-strong population; unofficial estimates are closer to 18%, swelled by students and commuters from nearby Galilee. Public spaces, at least, are open to all. And the ever-present Israeli-Palestinian conflict is, usually, softer-edged than elsewhere in the country. “I prefer to talk of shared existence rather than coexistence,” says Yona Yahav, the veteran Jewish mayor. “Haifa’s Jews and Arabs are the same Jews and Arabs as in Jerusalem, but here things work in a stable way.” Yahav’s office is lined with portraits of his predecessors, the first two wearing Ottoman tarbooshes. The street outside bears the name of one of them, Hassan Bey Shukri. Yahav flourishes a copy of a Hebrew newspaper notice mourning Shukri’s death in 1940. “I can promise you that this won’t happen if I die,” he jokes. He is also keen to point out that his secretary, Reem, is an Arab. “I can’t tell you that all Jews love Arabs and vice versa, but people do feel safe here.” No one questions that the city is special. “If all of Israel and Palestine could be like Haifa, I’d be happy,” muses Amjad Iraqi, a twentysomething Palestinian intellectual. “It’s not lovey-dovey. Life is essentially segregated but every community accepts that you can do your own thing. It’s not perfect, but it’s still better than everywhere else.” Asaf Ron, who runs the municipally funded Beit Ha’Gefen cultural centre, argues that it is all about promoting empathy. “Many Israeli Jews don’t know any Arabs. We need to break down stereotyping and fear.” Ayman Odeh, Israel’s most prominent Arab politician, lives in the Kababir neighbourhood, with its handsome mosque and stunning views over an azure sea. He also believes his home town is different. He served on the city council before being elected to the Knesset in 2015. “The situation between Jews and Arabs has always been better in Haifa than anywhere else in Israel, but it is far from equal,” he insists. “The mood is good and there is a sense of sanity. But it is not an island.” The local HQ of Odeh’s party, the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality, is on Ben-Gurion Boulevard opposite Fattoush. It is ironic that the street is named after David Ben-Gurion, the Jewish state’s founder and first prime minister. But there are many similar examples: the Istiqlal (“Independence”) mosque is at the junction of Shavei Zion (“Returnees to Zion”) and Kibbutz Galuyot (“the Ingathering of the Exiles”) streets. Zionism Avenue snakes across the Carmel to the downtown Arab quarter of Wadi Nisnas. Identity issues will be in the air in Haifa this month and next when Israel celebrates the 70th anniversary of its independence and Palestinians mourn the Nakba, or “catastrophe”, that the 1948 war represented for them. “Arabs don’t take part in Independence Day celebrations,” says Yahav. “They don’t feel it is their holiday.” Johnny Mansour, a historian from the Greek Catholic community, will be joining a “march of return” to some of the hundreds of Arab villages destroyed after the war – the same symbolic commemoration that has triggered the recent deadly upsurge of violence on the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip. Fattoush, proudly flaunting its Palestinian nationalist credentials, will be closed to mark the occasion. 1948: a fateful year Haifa once represented modernity and progress but feels less dynamic these days. In the twilight years of the Ottoman empire it was the terminus for a branch line of the Damascus-Hejaz railway. Allenby Street is named for the British general who freed the town in 1918, soon after the Balfour declaration backed the establishment of a “Jewish national home” in Palestine. The port opened in 1933, followed by an oil pipeline starting in Iraq. At that time, explains historian Motti Golani, half the Jewish population spoke Arabic. During the second world war, when Italian aircraft bombed the city, Jews and Arabs huddled together in basements. By 1948, the population was 70,000 Jews and 65,000 Arabs. But war changed that. In April, as fighting raged and the British prepared to leave, all but 3,000 Arabs were expelled or fled to Lebanon or the West Bank. The history of that fateful year remains bitterly contested: the Jewish mayor – unaware of military planning – urged Arab leaders to stay but they felt unable to comply with the terms for a truce. Newly arrived Jewish immigrants moved into abandoned homes in Wadi Salib. Many houses, defined as “absentee property”, are now in a state of advanced decline. The city’s flea market is held in the shadow of a crumbling Turkish bathhouse, Hammam al-Pasha. Impressive new glass and steel towers, housing the city’s courts, loom over the ruins. Haifa occupies an important place in Palestinian collective memory thanks to local luminaries such as Emile Habibi and Toufik Toubi. Habibi wrote the best-known novel by a Palestinian in Israel: The Secret Life of Saeed: The Pessoptimist. Etched on his grave are the words: “I remain in Haifa.” Acre-born Ghassan Kanafani, assassinated by the Mossad, captured the essence of the conflict in his novella Return to Haifa, in which a visiting Palestinian refugee encounters an Israeli woman who survived Auschwitz. Palmer Gate, the entrance to the port, is where Holocaust survivors came ashore and terrified Palestinians fled by boat to Acre or Beirut, mostly never to return. ‘Coexistence is not equality’ Emile’s shawarma restaurant – Haifa’s legendary best – is always crowded. Abu Shaker, near the port, serves superb hummus. Both are no-frills Arab-run establishments with large Hebrew signs outside and a majority of Jewish customers. But the city’s reputation for inter-communal harmony can be illustrated by even more impressive – if non-culinary – achievements: 32% of the doctors at the Rambam hospital are Arabs. Arabic is heard in Haifa’s shops and on its streets and buses in a way that it rarely is in West Jerusalem or Tel Aviv. The offices and clinics of Arab lawyers and dentists line the streets of overwhelmingly Jewish and upmarket residential areas. In other “mixed” Israeli cities like Jaffa, Ramle and Lod, Arabs are poorer and less socially mobile. Hadar HaCarmel, up the hill from Wadi Salib, is Haifa’s most diverse neighbourhood. In its western quarter, 60% of the population is Arab. On Masada Street, a hipster cafe culture has blurred ethnic differences that are normally easy to spot. “Coexistence!” shrugs Arik, a Jewish antiques dealer. “In Haifa there’s no choice.” Yossi, who runs a nearby record shop, lives in Kababir; Walid, an Arab architect, in the largely Jewish area of Merkaz HaCarmel. Haifa’s tolerance is tested at regular intervals. In October 2000, at the start of the second intifada, 13 Arab citizens were shot dead by police while demonstrating in solidarity with their kinfolk in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Yahav’s predecessor ensured the city remained calm. It was harder three years later when a woman suicide bomber from Jenin blew herself up and killed 21 others in Maxim’s restaurant – jointly owned by Jews and Arabs. In the Lebanon war of 2006, a missile fired by Hezbollah killed two elderly Arabs. Successive Israeli wars against Hamas in Gaza – in 2008-9, 2012 and again in 2014 – saw anger flare. “In Haifa, Arabs and Jews live alongside each other, but when there is tension they move apart,” argues Amjad Shbita of Sikkuy, the Association for the Advancement of Civic Equality. “Haifa’s coexistence is the best in Israel, but it can still be easily damaged.” Palestinians in Haifa and across Israel have grown closer to relatives and friends beyond the pre-1967 “green line” border with the West Bank, but their lives are very different and they have their own issues close to home. In 2013, protests erupted over a government plan to demolish the homes of“unrecognised” Bedouin communities in the Negev and build a Jewish town. Two years ago, after an unusually hot autumn, fires consumed large areas of the Carmel, triggering accusations by rightwing Jewish politicians of an “arson intifada” – though no one was ever charged. Haifa-based NGOs have their work cut out tackling discrimination in social services and budget allocations. The worst poverty is in Halissa, a mainly Arab neighbourhood where violence is blamed on rivalry between Bedouin clans and relocated collaborators from the West Bank. “The Israeli idea of coexistence is about a majority and a minority – the strong and the weak,” observes Tom Mehager of Adalah (Justice), which is devoted to securing the rights of Israel’s Arab citizens – and has vocally condemned the army’s killing of Palestinians in Gaza. “Coexistence is not equality. Speaking the same language and eating hummus together doesn’t mean Jews and Arabs are equal.” Jafar Farah, who runs the Mossawa (Equality) centre, compares the relationship between the two peoples to one between “a rider and a horse”. And that, he insists, “is how Yona Yahav deals with the Arab community in Haifa.” ‘In Haifa it’s not hate, but not love either’ Education provides important insights. In Haifa, as elsewhere, Jewish and Arab children mostly attend separate schools. Many Arab children (the majority are Christians), study in fee-paying church schools, and a few dozen in Jewish ones. There are no Jews in Arab public schools, where standards are poor. The curricula are different too. “People want to stay within their own communities to speak in their native languages, have days off on their own holidays, and learn about their own history, culture and religion,” says Asaf Ron. “Assimilation through attending the other community’s schools is a free choice that almost no one chooses.” The Yad beyad (“Hand in Hand”) network of bilingual schools complains about long waiting lists and a struggle to secure municipal support. In its kindergarten in Hadar, Arab and Jewish six-year-olds sing songs and are captivated by nursery rhymes that interchange Hebrew and Arabic – a heartwarming but highly unusual sight. “The whole country is based on separation in a very profound way,” says Merav Ben-Nun, its community organiser. Higher education is a different story. Haifa University is 40% Arab, and the Technion, the Israeli Institute of Technology, 23%, though Arab graduates are unlikely to find jobs in security-related industries. Arab students are younger than Jewish ones, who mostly spend up to three years from the age of 18 doing the compulsory military service from which the vast majority of Arabs are exempt. “Arab and Jewish students sit in the same classes but barely speak to each other,” notes Golani. National holidays – Holocaust Day, Memorial Day and Independence Day – feel especially awkward on campus. Independence Day is celebrated in Haifa with concerts, folk-dancing and firework displays, but the highly polished jewel in the crown of the city’s coexistence narrative is the annual “Festival of Festivals”, held in December to mark Hanukah, Christmas and the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. Tens of thousands of Jewish visitors throng the narrow streets of Wadi Nisnas, marvelling at the feeling that they have gone abroad for the weekend. Yahav is especially keen to promote the month-long event. Older Palestinians tend to be relaxed about this, but younger activists can be contemptuous about condescension or racism towards “colourful” natives. Many are keen to assert their growing self-confidence in the face of what they condemn as Israeli “apartheid and settler colonialism” – in the words of a strategy paper that was drawn up in the cafe Fattoush last December. The closure of Haifa’s Arab theatre, al-Midan (“The Square”), is cited as an example: state funding was withdrawn after it staged a play about a Palestinian security prisoner. The defiant response was to create an autonomous crowdfunded alternative – al-Khashabi (“The Stage”). Its Arabic-language performances are translated into English, but conspicuously not into Hebrew. “Independent Palestinian institutions do not believe in coexistence,” explains Al-Khashabi’s director, Bashar Murkus. “We believe in dialogue from a position of strength and independence.” His colleague Khoulood Tannous flatly refuses even to use the “c” word. “No one is shelling us here,” she adds. “It’s no Gaza, nor the West Bank. It’s mind games.” Politician Ayman Odeh’s disapproving view is that influence should matter more than identity to Israel’s Palestinian minority, in Haifa and beyond, and that joint struggle is the key to a more equal future. “Arabs are developing autonomy at the expense of Arab-Jewish cooperation,” warns Sikkuy’s Shbita. Neither side harbours illusions about the other. “In Haifa it’s not hate, but there’s not too much love either,” is the stark conclusion of Omer Shaffer, a Jewish Technion postgraduate who was both moved and surprised when an Arab colleague told him to “take care” when he went off to do a stint of reserve army duty at a checkpoint in the West Bank. “It’s pretty indifferent. We’ve found a way to ignore each other without killing each other.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/28/mud-mosque-djenne-tubeway-army-southern-elephants","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"The mud mosque of Djenné is in which country?

To the right are necklaces of islands in a dazzling turquoise sea and sudden sweet coves with antique shuttered houses, their front porches shaded by vines, a fishing boat at the front door. This is the Croatia most visitors come to see. On the other side are mountains capped in threatening cloud. That is the Croatia most people do not bother with, the one I have been persuaded to try. In the little town of Starigrad we abandon the sea and take a narrow lane towards the mountains. I’ve come with a friend who visited the area as a teenager and has never forgotten the adventure. Behind the narrow entrance to the Velika Paklenica gorge, he assures me, is a magical world that few people see. I’m hoping he is right. We make base camp in a cottage near the gorge mouth (from €80 a night, sleeps 4) and next morning set out into Paklenica national park. The lane leads us into the jaws of the first spectacular 14km-long canyon. Crowds of climbers are already tackling the crags but we press on to where the canyon opens out a little and the rock walls become stupendously high. On the right is Anića Kuk, one of the most famous climbing sites in the world, its north-west face a 400-metre wall of limestone, Europe’s answer to Yosemite’s El Capitan. Over a late picnic lunch we watch the climbers on it. The park is 95 sq km embedded in a far more extensive mountain wilderness. We hike onwards, always by the tumbling river and in the shade of forest. A smooth snake whips across in front of us, its body as thick as my wrist. There are emerald green lizards too, blinking at us from the bushes. Eventually, as the sun is about to set, we reach our goal: Paklenica mountain hut, a neat wooden chalet with deep gables over red shutters and a balcony. There is one silent old man in sunglasses, sitting impassively at a table with a chequered cloth. And nearby, paintbrush in hand, is the caretaker, Dalibor, the polar opposite: irrepressibly loud and cheerful. “That’s Vuke, the Wolf,” he says, introducing his elderly friend. “He knows every inch of this national park. There’s only him, me and my girlfriend, Korana, living here. We are the gatekeepers to the upper world.” We are just digesting this pronouncement when a pair of young hikers arrive. Has Dalibor got a wifi code and a place to charge phones? “My friends,” he tells them, “you come here to charge your own batteries, not those in your phone. And there is no wifi. You have left all that behind you.” The pair look around uneasily. Does he sell bottled water? “Mountain water is free.” He points to the pipe that comes from a spring. Dalibor, I quickly realise, is no ordinary caretaker. He serves us shots of local liquor and tells us his family story: “In the days of emperor Franz Josef my grandmother used to smuggle salt through these mountains.” He himself was born on the coast, in Zadar, where he became a DJ. Then in 1991 the war came, a conflict that has left deep psychological scars in this area. For Dalibor, the only redeeming thing was that it led him back to the family origins: the mountains. “I live on the edge of civilisation,” he says. “People ask for hot showers and I point them to the river. A lot of people turn back when they find there’s no bottled water or ice-cream. This place is a filter for what lies beyond.” We keep our phones hidden. Can he help us? We spread the map. “Spend the night here,” he advises. “Tomorrow, take this path …” His finger describes a long arc. “Up here at Struge there is a refuge hut. Take food, sleeping bags, compass and down jackets. From there you reach the summit of the Velebit mountains, then come down here – there’s another refuge hut. We’ve got 11 across the park. First come, first served, all free.” That night we eat wild boar stew, washed down with rough red wine – homemade and very affordable – and get a brief botanical lesson from Korana. The park has 79 endemic species and is regarded as a world-class location for wild flowers. We start next day along a fine footpath through the forest. There are wolves and lynx up here but all we spot is a hare. Forty years ago there was a substantial human presence but the last shepherd retired to Zadar in 2016 at the age of 94. Without the sheep, the forest has rebounded and along with it, bears. Dalibor spotted a mother and cubs on the track only a couple of weeks before. The resurgent forest suits them, a forest that is now the largest in Dalmatia. As we climb, the orchids and oaks give way to primroses and beech which then defer to bellflowers and pines, the latter rapidly dwindling in size. We emerge on a high pass that is spangled with gentians of perfect blue. Further along, golden crocuses are forcing their way through patches of snow and we find the refuge, a gnarled cabin with a wood fire for cooking and bunk beds hewn from logs. At the height of summer I imagine you would want to arrive early to guarantee a bed, or carry a tent, but not in spring – the place is empty. All the various refuges were built by the 600 members of the Paklenica Mountain Association and they have done a sterling job: not too much comfort, but plenty of homespun charm. Water is in the well half a mile away through a dwarf birch forest. “It never dries up – even in high summer,” Dalibor had told us. We eat hunks of local air-dried ham tenderised with slivowitz, a fruit brandy. The water is like chilled nectar. At dawn we meander off through the dwarf forest and by the well find a sign pointing south, up the slope towards the summit of the range, Mount Vaganski (1,757 metres). The map shows some ominous pink blotches nearby: minefields. During the Balkan wars of independence in 1991-95, Serbian forces pushed up to this ridge, hoping to establish a permanent grip on Croatian territory. By the time they were defeated, some 20,000 people had died and the Croatian economy was in ruins. For the Mountain Association the challenge has been to rebuild footpaths away from those danger areas, much of the pioneering trail work being done by Dalibor’s inscrutable companion, the Wolf. There are now around 150km of trails. Heading for the summit we enter a whirlwind of cloud and mist. In the hollows are deep drifts of snow, on the ridges a knee-high forest of stunted twisted pines. Everything is dripping with icy water. The summit is marked by a cross and a tin box containing a visitors’ book. No one, we note, has signed it for some time. The descent is tricky: long steep snow glides that later become vast scree slopes. Ours is a rapid weekend visit but we both feel like we have spent weeks in the wilderness. By the end of the afternoon we are back at the main hut. The Wolf is still sitting, immobile and silent, by the door. A group of hikers is leaving after a night in Dalibor’s cabin. I ask Dalibor what the Wolf makes of the visitors? “He says they need to stop looking at their phones and learn to sit for a whole day doing nothing. That is the forgotten art of the shepherd.” We eat more superb home cooking. Does the hut ever get full? “We have 50 proper beds, but one time we coped with 250.” We are fortunate to have it almost to ourselves. In the dining room Dalibor reveals a television set. We are shocked. “You have electricity? For emergencies?” He laughs. “Yes, absolutely: I think there’s a Champions League match on tonight.” Way to go The trip was provided by Croatia Tourism.

Ministers have argued that Britain’s biggest airport will affect fewer people with noise in future, due to quieter planes. But government calculations suggest a new runway would still have a negative impact on nearly a million households, or 2.2 million people. Department for Transport documents, released by the Civil Aviation Authority after a freedom of information request, show the government expects 973,000 households around Heathrow to experience increased daytime noise by 2050 after a third runway is built. It said 673,800 households affected by Heathrow’s two runways will experience less noise once expansion takes place, making a net 300,000 worse off. The DfT work was carried out for a revised national policy statement published last year, which gives the green light to Heathrow expansion if approved by a parliamentary vote expected this summer. Campaigners and parliamentary opponents of expansion accused the government of attempting to bury the figures. Paul McGuinness, the chair of the No 3rd Runway Coalition, said: “It has long been clear that the DfT have understated the numbers who will be impacted by an expanded Heathrow’s noise. “So it’s hardly surprising to learn that these calculations were not presented to the public and parliament. The DfT wish to conceal the true impact of expanding this highly disruptive airport.” According to the Heathrow anti-noise group Hacan, households in Heston, Osterley Park, Brentford and parts of Chiswick and Hammersmith would be brought directly under a new flight path. When announcing the government’s backing for a third runway in 2016, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, told the House of Commons: “Even with expansion, fewer people will be affected by aircraft noise than today.” In February, he told the transport select committee: “If you look ahead 20 years, I expect an expanded Heathrow airport to be quieter than the existing two-runway airport.” The policy statement acknowledged that 92,700 more people around Heathrow would by 2030 be affected by noise at levels recognised as causing disturbance, although it said the numbers would diminish as plane technology improved. The DfT said increased noise would be addressed by home insulation and compensation. “We have been clear that expansion at Heathrow would not be allowed to proceed without a world-class package of compensation and mitigation measures for local communities,” a spokesperson said. “This includes noise insulation for homes and community buildings and a community compensation fund worth up to £50m per year. We have consulted extensively on the options for airport expansion and will continue to engage with MPs and their communities as the proposals develop.” Heathrow insisted fewer people would be affected by noise than at present, even with another runway. “We stand by our commitment to expand Heathrow while reducing the number of people affected by noise, compared to today. We are currently consulting with our local communities on airspace modernisation, which will redesign how planes fly over Heathrow in coming years,” a spokesperson said. “Any future modelling of noise impacts must take into account these changes, as well as the stringent mitigation and insulation plans Heathrow will put in place, which will continue to reduce the number of people affected by our operations.” The airport has managed to double passenger numbers and decrease its noise footprint in recent decades, as the oldest and loudest planes have been phased out. It expects to be held to a 6.5-hour night flight ban as a condition of building a third runway. Airspace around Heathrow is also to be redesigned, which could see fewer newly affected households, although with 50% more flights, taking the total number to up to 740,000 a year, limiting additional flightpaths would concentrate the burden on areas that are already overflown."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/09/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-liverpool-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T17:46:00Z","webTitle":"Pep Guardiola asks Manchester City for ‘perfect game’ against Liverpool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/09/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-liverpool-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/09/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-liverpool-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Pep Guardiola asks Manchester City for ‘perfect game’ against Liverpool","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Pep Guardiola has challenged his Manchester City side to play “the perfect game” to defeat Liverpool in the Champions League quarter‑final second leg at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night. City trail Jürgen Klopp’s side 3-0 and they followed defeat in the first match at Anfield last Wednesday by losing at home against Manchester United 3-2 on Saturday, after surrendering a two-goal lead and missing the chance to clinch the Premier League title. Guardiola is conscious that his players may be affected mentally by these reverses and, while striking a positive note by saying his side can use the challenge as inspiration, he understands how difficult the task is. “Of course to go through you have to make the perfect game, create chances, be clinical and concede few chances,” he said. “All the conditions have to be perfect. The aim is tough but we have 90 minutes and in football everything can happen. “What we are going to do is try. We have to score the first one, then make the second one. The perfect scenario is to go through. At the end we cannot forget that it is a simple game [of football] and focus on every single minute. If we concede, don’t give up – it’s more than 90 minutes [with added time]. Many times we have created a lot of chances in a short period. We have to be clinical and if we are not then move on to the next [chance].” If Liverpool score once City would need five goals to progress to the semi-finals because of the away-goal rule but Guardiola believes that the dream of giving City a historic night in the competition and elevating the club’s standing can inspire his players. “We need titles in Europe – it’s complicated [to achieve] but you need nights that make you understand it. Beating Barça [3-1, last season] was so special because we know they’re the best team in the world.” City can win the Champions League in the near future, he said. “It will happen sooner or later – what this club has done in the last 10 years in terms of creating facilities and making it bigger means it will happen. Hopefully we can do it. Maybe it is next year but soon it will happen. “To reach the semi-final would be for the second time in our beautiful history. I don’t have to talk about how beautiful it is. They show every single game what they [my side] want to do. I know you judge results, but performance? My team is extraordinary. Exceptional. It is a joy to be manager of the team, I am so delighted.” Guardiola is confident City can match anyone in Europe but is unsure if they are ready to claim the Champions League this season. “This team is ready to fight with all the teams but the other teams are so good, it is difficult – a mountain – but we can compete, especially at home. For the next step maybe we need more time. Next season we will be better.” Regarding the potential mental damage done by back-to-back defeats, Guardiola said: “I don’t know but if we are not able to do it, it will be a good lesson for the future. A good test. Football is a challenge like life. We are happy to handle it. We have 90 minutes plus extra time and what we’ve shown this year – even in the last game we created a lot of chances in a few minutes and the opponents know that.” The referee will be Antonio Mateu Lahoz, who Guardiola criticised recently, saying: “I remember what happened last year. It was 1-1 at home to Monaco when there was a clear penalty on [Sergio] Agüero and what should have been a red card, but the Spanish referee didn’t call it. We went from a possible 2-1 lead to 2-1 deficit. These types of situations are very important.” Lahoz has twice before officiated at the Etihad, awarding two penalties to Napoli in October’s group game, and one to Monaco in that home leg. Meanwhile, City are confident that Liverpool’s team coach will arrive safely at the Etihad Stadium, and not be attacked as theirs was at Anfield before last week’s first leg. There will be an increased security presence. Chief Inspector Dean Howard, Greater Manchester police’s match commander, said: “We will have an increased number of officers around the stadium as well as in the city. As with all high-profile games such as this, we have also carried out intelligence gathering beforehand and will continue to work with both clubs and supporter groups to ensure all fans can enjoy the match in a competitive but safe environment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2018/apr/10/glossy-magazine-covers-too-white-models-black-ethnic-minority","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T05:00:18Z","webTitle":"Glossies so white: the data that reveals the problem with British magazine covers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/10/glossy-magazine-covers-too-white-models-black-ethnic-minority","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/apr/10/glossy-magazine-covers-too-white-models-black-ethnic-minority","fields":{"headline":"Glossies so white: the data that reveals the problem with British magazine covers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Women’s magazine editors have always understood the importance of a good cover. An illustration of Queen Victoria’s bust, surrounded by stylish women behaving as domestic role models, was credited with propelling Mrs Beeton’s The Englishwoman’s Domestic Magazine to bestseller status in 1857, earning it “more patrons than any other magazine in the Empire”, one newspaper said. As a mixed-race girl growing up in Britain in the 1990s, I might have still been in the era of empire, as far as my relationship with popular magazines was concerned. Yes, I bought Just Seventeen, More, Marie Claire, Elle and Vogue, but the fact that I – and thousands of other women and girls of colour like me – spent our money on glossies did not mean they catered for us. Through ignorance and indifference, they frequently featured no one of black, Asian, mixed or any other ethnic minority heritage from cover to cover, while advice on makeup, skin care, hair styles and products was unfailingly irrelevant to us. New research by the Guardian’s data team shows how little has changed. The covers of some the UK’s most popular monthlies remain overwhelmingly white. Of 214 covers published by the 19 bestselling glossies last year, only 20 featured a person of colour. That’s only 9.3%, although 13.7% of the UK are BAME, according to the Office for National Statistics’ latest estimate, published in June 2016. The most diverse month was October, when two magazines showed a black model and one featured an Asian model on the cover. But in two months in 2017, March and May, the front covers of every single title we analysed featured images of white people exclusively. The covers of four magazines – Marie Claire, HomeStyle, Your Home and Prima – did not feature a single person of colour throughout 2017. For our study, we looked only at publications whose covers mostly featured people and based our calculations on covers that show only one person. The picture is similar if “multi-person” covers are included. The representation problem is not confined to women’s magazines. While GQ featured two black cover models over the year, the other men’s magazine in our study, Men’s Health, had just one. Neither publication featured men from any other minority background. Children’s magazine covers also lacked diversity. For the five children’s publications we looked at (in addition to the 19 other monthly magazines), 95% of the cover models were white. One of the most popular – Mr Tumble Something Special – was based on the children’s TV personality Justin Fletcher, who is white, but others depended heavily on the young, white YouTube star Zoella, who appeared on eight covers in 2017, while black models appeared on only two. None of the bestselling children’s magazines featured Asian or Latino models. The inclusion of children’s and men’s titles in the Guardian’s research shines a greater light on the state of diversity in magazines, a debate that usually centres on a smaller number of women’s glossy magazines and especially British Vogue. During its former editor Alexandra Shulman’s 25 years at the helm, only two black women were given solo covers. Shulman said in 2012 that, “in a society where the mass of the consumers are white and where, on the whole, mainstream ideas sell, it’s unlikely there will be a huge rise in the number of leading black models”. When Shulman stepped down in 2017, making way for UK Vogue’s first black editor, Edward Enninful, her leaving photo depicted an all-white editorial staff at the magazine. Enninful rebooted interest in the magazine, with a much-celebrated first cover featuring British Ghanaian model Adwoa Aboah – a confident decision that may have stemmed from Enninful’s time at Italian Vogue, where the first ever “black issue” sold so well that an extra 60,000 copies had to be printed. The magazine’s most recent cover headlined “New Frontiers”, was also praised for featuring a diverse range of models including Halima Aden, the first woman to wear a hijab on the magazine’s cover. Vanity Fair in the US, meanwhile, has repeatedly come in for criticism for its Hollywood covers – Annie Leibowitz photo shoots depicting an array of A-list actors in a spread that is intended to depict the state of the movie industry. “Young Hollywood is thin, white,” ran one critical headline in response to the magazine’s 2010 cover, which did not feature a single person of colour. Recent years have seen a push for diversity, with the 2017 cover featuring mixed-heritage Irish actor Ruth Negga, Lupita Nyong’o and Janelle Monáe. The magazine’s new editor, Radhika Jones, signalled a further change of intent by putting Lena Waithe, the black (and gay) actor and writer, on the April edition. But the Guardian’s data suggests focus on changes at Vogue and Vanity Fair has obscured failings elsewhere. “The industry is still overwhelmingly homogenous,” says a senior figure from an ethnic minority background working at another UK magazine, who did not want to be named. “Obviously, the appointment of Edward at Vogue is amazing, but that doesn’t change the fact that magazines are still incredibly white and middle class.” One obvious indicator of the historic failure of the biggest glossy titles to cater for black and Asian women has been the mushrooming of magazines aimed directly at them. From long-established magazines such as Pride and Black Beauty and Hair to new black platforms such as Black Ballad, Gal-Dem, Glam Africa, and Skin Deep, and Asian titles such as Asian Woman, DesiMag and Burnt Roti, women of colour have been reaching for magazines that normalise their look and the issues facing their communities. “Growing up, I would pick up magazines, and I never saw anybody who looked like me,” says Afua Adom, former editor of Pride. “I was really into music, so I used to read Smash Hits and magazines like that; I never saw a person who looked like me. And where I lived in Scotland there was no one who looked like me anywhere. My mum subscribed to Pride, and that’s why I wanted to work there all those years ago – because it was the only magazine I saw full of women who looked like me.” The mainstream magazines are little better than they used to be. “You flick through any title and there’s a page that’s got shampoos and stuff and there’s nothing for afro hair, or there are no beauty solutions for darker skins, or there’s no skincare for darker skin,” Adom says. “It’s like that all the time. And you just think: ‘The way that you’ve alienated so many women who pick up this magazine so quickly, there’s no thought process there at all.’” One of the magazines I read while growing up was Marie Claire, which remains one of the UK’s bestselling women’s monthlies. Although its content is more diverse than it was, its covers did not feature a single non-white model in 2017. I tell Trish Halpin, Marie Claire’s editor in chief, of my surprise that the magazine is still failing to speak to women like me on its covers. Halpin agrees that the magazine’s record is problematic, but she says editors lack control over the timing of their cover stars. “We changed from model covers about 15, 20 years ago,” she says. “It’s now very much about that A-list star on the cover that’s going to sell the magazine on the newsstand. We start with a wishlist of essentially very recognisable stars, within a particular demographic of the age of women we are speaking to – early 20s, to late 30s, early 40s. Within that wishlist, there are definitely a good number of black women and women of colour. But it’s not that easy to get them. We are experiencing the trickle effect – there still isn’t a big enough pool. We had two black actresses lined up for 2017, but their publicist decided to go with other titles. We are hoping we are going to secure one of those for our summer covers next year.” I approached three other editors, who didn’t wish to go on the record. But other senior figures in the industry say the Guardian’s research reflects a relatively small pool of BAME A-list stars, linked to a wider inability in the film and fashion industries to recognise BAME talent. Yet over the decades magazine editors have proved their ability to shape perceptions as much as to reflect them. They are the ones who decide who is “cover-worthy”. All of the magazine industry figures I spoke to, while admitting shortcomings in cover diversity, pointed to significant change inside magazines. Halpin said that, in relation to Marie Claire, it was important to judge the magazine by its content as well. “You’ll see a very different story there,” she says. “At Marie Claire, we used 17 models of colour – which is probably about a third to a quarter of all of the models that we shoot.” The change inside magazines is one I have noticed, and one that would have gone a long way towards alleviating my own anxiety of otherness, had it been the case when I was a young magazine reader. Greater use of models of colour on inside pages reflects the progress being made across the fashion industry. The website Fashion Spot reported a rise in diversity in global fashion in 2017, with the big fashion capitals of New York, Milan, Paris and London all featuring more women of colour than in previous years. And of the 266 major shows and 8,258 catwalk appearances across the four cities in 2017, an average of 30.2% of castings were women of colour. While New York fashion week was the most racially diverse, diversity at London’s rose by 4.9%. But covers matter. Those who appear on them are the ambassadors of beauty, success and commercial appeal. For those who scan magazine racks, the impression of whose faces are projected out on to a shop floor has a visceral impact – and the choices of whose faces those are reverberate, influencing others. There’s a danger, too, that diversifying the models inside magazines while the covers remain white sends a new message of hierarchical beauty standards – suggesting women of colour have their place, and it’s not on the cover. Internationally, according to the Fashion Spot, cover stars are becoming more racially diverse. Six of the 10 most booked cover stars in 2017 were women of colour, such as Dutch-Egyptian-Moroccan model Imaan Hammam. Adwoa Aboah graced eight international covers; Rihanna featured on seven. This makes the tendency of some editors – who have historically passed the buck elsewhere within the fashion industry – seem harder to sustain. “Black models don’t sell magazines,” Jourdan Dunn, one of the most recognisable fashion faces in the UK, was told when she inquired about the absence of other black women from a high-end fashion magazine in 2013. Yet their current popularity on the catwalk suggests that they could. The magazine industry’s reluctance to put BAME women on its covers is not the only way it is failing the public. The situation is even worse regarding larger, older and transgender models. But there are numerous firsthand accounts of the way in which representation of race has a particularly negative effect on black women. Nyong’o, for example, has spoken candidly about the impact black supermodel Alek Wek had on her shortly before she won her first Oscar. “She was dark as night, she was on all of the runways and in every magazine, and everyone was talking about how beautiful she was,” Nyong’o has said. “My complexion had always been an obstacle to overcome … When I saw Alek … I had a spring in my step because I felt more seen, more appreciated by the far away gatekeepers of beauty.” Nyong’o – and the other members of the tiny group of women of colour who do feature on magazine covers – are still overcoming these obstacles. In 2017, two magazines – the Evening Standard magazine and Grazia – infuriated black women in particular when they airbrushed out the more visible elements of black hairstyles from cover models’ looks. “I remember the Lupita Nyong’o cover where Grazia just airbrushed her afro out,” says Adom. “I was so disappointed, because I really love that title – I buy it all the time. And they took such a long a long time to apologise … I just thought: ‘You guys just don’t get it.’” As the country becomes increasingly diverse – more than a quarter of schoolchildren in England are from ethnic minority groups – it is of special concern that this is not being reflected in magazine covers. Corinna Shaffer, editorial director of Immediate Media, which publishes 21 children’s magazine titles, including all but one of those featured in the Guardian study, acknowledges more needs to be done. “The children who read our magazines deserve the best – that’s our starting point,” she says. “We are not about tokenism: [who we put on the cover] has to be right for the title. But we do need to be aware that we are reflecting a cross-section of the audience, whether it’s on the cover or inside.” It’s interesting that Shaffer mentions tokenism. Across the industry, there’s a concern that crude attempts to remedy a lack of diversity in magazine covers will do more harm than good. “I have sat in meetings at some publications where someone has said, ‘Oh, we haven’t got a black person in the May edition – we need to figure that out,’” says one source at a women’s magazine. “When I hear that, it tells me you are not getting it right – that is just tokenistic. We need to talk about the underlying reasons why black women are not finding themselves on the covers, as they undeniably should, through the normal process.” “You don’t have to have a diverse team to have diverse magazine covers, but when you do, diversity is a natural outflow of that. You have people who have different points of view and opinion – a more well-rounded mix,” the source adds. “We are not even getting people from a diverse range of backgrounds applying for positions at a senior level.” The lack of diversity among staff working within magazines is symptomatic of inequality in the media as a whole. A report last November found that 94% of journalists are white, compared with 91% of the working population as whole, a figure that does not take into account the fact that many publications are based in London, where only 60% of the population is white. There is also evidence that black journalism students suffer a particular ethnic penalty in the workplace. Figures from 2014-15 on the likelihood of journalism students being employed as a journalist six months after graduation suggest that white students have a 26% chance and Asian students a 33% chance, while black students have only an 8% chance of finding employment. The failure of magazines to recruit from a wide pool of journalists – particularly in diverse cities such as London – creates a vicious cycle in which unreflective newsrooms continue to produce unreflective editorial and cover content, further alienating readers from different backgrounds. “The erasure of black and brown people from magazine covers is part of a much broader process of “othering” – it reinforces the idea that people of colour are not the norm,” says writer and critic Maya Goodfellow. “What should concern us all is the multifaceted impact this has on notions of race in the UK and the idea it creates that people of colour don’t belong.” It is also bad business. In these challenging economic times, neither publishers nor the advertisers on whom they rely can afford to turn away ethnic minority women who, figures show, spend a disproportionate amount on beauty and cosmetic products. If my teenage experience is anything to go by, the images magazines choose to place on their covers are incredibly influential, not just reflecting trends and celebrity in other industries, but setting them. When it comes to representation of people of colour, it is a responsibility, and an opportunity, that they could do much more to harness. This article was amended on 11 April 2018.

Michael Braithwaite, who arrived in Britain from Barbados in 1961, had worked at a north London primary school for over 15 years when a routine check on his immigration status revealed he did not have an up-to-date identity document. The personnel department got in touch to tell him that without a biometric card he could not continue to be employed. The 66-year-old lost his full-time job in 2017 after the local authority ruled he needed to submit documentary proof that he had the right to live in the UK. He has been trying for two years without success to get the Home Office to acknowledge that he is in Britain legally. The unexpected immigration difficulties have pushed him close to a mental breakdown. “It made me feel like I was an alien. I almost fell apart with the stress,” he said. Braithwaite arrived in London with his family when he was nine, when his father moved to work for the Post Office, and he has lived in the UK since. He had always assumed he was British, having attended primary school and secondary school here, and having worked continuously since leaving school. He married in London and has three British children and five grandchildren. “I never applied for a British passport. We thought we were British,” he said. Because he arrived in the UK before 1973 he has an automatic permanent right to remain, but the introduction of the “hostile environment” policy by Theresa May as home secretary in 2013 has required employers, the NHS, Jobcentre staff and landlords to run checks for papers, causing problems for people who do not have documentary proof of their right to live in the UK. Braithwaite is one of an emerging group of people who were born in Commonwealth countries and arrived in the UK as children who have discovered half a century later that they have serious and hard to fix immigration problems. Lawyers working for people in this situation say the level of documentary proof required by the Home Office is extremely high, with officials requesting to see a minimum of one, but preferably four, pieces of documentary evidence for every year spent in the UK. Often GP surgeries and schools that might have been able to provide documentary proof of their residence have since closed, and records destroyed. Public anger over the emerging problem is rising. Patrick Vernon, editor of Black History Month magazine, has launched a petition calling on the Home Office to reduce the high burden of proof required from Windrush generation settlers who arrived from the Caribbean in the UK as children. “As we celebrate the 70th anniversary of Windrush, this creates a sour message about whether we are valued and respected. A lot of people are feeling very upset,” he said. Fundraising efforts to help pay for cancer treatment for Albert Thompson (not his real name) who is in a similar situation to Braithwaite, raised more than £24,000 in five days. Thompson arrived from Jamaica as a teenager and has lived and worked in the UK continuously for 44 years but was denied NHS radiotherapy for prostate cancer last November. Braithwaite was distraught at losing his job. “I had a good rapport with the children. The head said I was an asset to the school, but the HR department said I was illegal because I didn’t have a biometric card,” he said. A biometric card is a residence permit issued to non-British residents, with details of their immigration status. “I had no idea what a biometric card was. I had no idea there was a need to naturalise.” He began attempting to untangle his immigration situation in 2016 when he first understood there was a problem. When it proved difficult to resolve quickly, he lost his job in February 2017. His lawyer said Home Office records showed he had the right to be in the UK, but officials repeatedly failed to issue him with documents to reflect this. The latest letter from the Home Office, sent this month, told him he needed to provide further documentary evidence to show he was in the UK before 1973. Guy Hewitt, the high commissioner for Barbados to the UK, said he would be “raising the case of his unjust treatment directly with the UK authorities”. Highlighting the contribution that West Indian migrants made in the post-second world war era to the building of modern Britain, and given “the UK’s commitment to the Commonwealth”, Hewitt called on the government “to act with urgency and compassion to find a solution to the current treatment of some elderly, Caribbean-born, UK-residents as ‘illegal immigrants’ as a result of their irregular status”. He said such treatment exposed them to the risk of “destitution and detention, along with the possibility of deportation”. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We will be in touch with Mr Braithwaite very soon to assure him that we are looking to resolve his case as soon as possible and issue him with documentation confirming his status here. We value the contribution made by Commonwealth citizens who have made a life in the UK.” Enny Choudhury, Braithwaite’s lawyer, from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: “For almost one year the Home Office has failed to issue the biometric card, without which he cannot work or move on with his life, causing uncertainty and distress.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/14/chart-life-random-men-told-me-about-my-body","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T08:00:17Z","webTitle":"I can chart my life by the things random men have told me about my body | Hadley Freeman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/14/chart-life-random-men-told-me-about-my-body","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/14/chart-life-random-men-told-me-about-my-body","fields":{"headline":"I can chart my life by the things random men have told me about my body","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There has been much talk of late, online and off, about how much male writers love to describe women, and how bad they are at doing so. There have been witty Twitter threads mocking such descriptions (“She wasn’t perfectly thin, nor voluptuously curvy, but what she lacked in general body shape she more than made up for with her breasts.”) US culture website Vulture.com recently listed how 50 female characters were described in their screenplays (“Sarah Connor is 19, small and delicate-featured. Pretty in a flawed, accessible way.”) And it is a truth universally acknowledged that being an appalling sexist is no bar to a man being celebrated as a great writer of the universal human spirit, as the reputations of John Updike and Ernest Hemingway prove; two writers who preferred to describe women, not as whole individuals, but as disparate anatomical parts then specify how those anatomical parts made them feel. These kinds of discussions are especially amusing for those of us with a connection to the women described by the aforementioned men. I’m named after Hadley Richardson, Hemingway’s first wife who he dumped about five minutes after becoming successful. Long after Richardson had happily moved on with her life, Hemingway celebrated her in A Moveable Feast in classic Hemingway style, writing about “her beautiful, wonderfully strong legs” and “her hair red gold in the sun, grown out all winter awkwardly and beautifully”. But even if I hadn’t grown up as the namesake of some strong legs and awkward hair, I would never say that male writers, specifically, are especially prone to making weird comments about women’s bodies. No, this is something men do, whatever their job. Women swap compliments (“I love your dress!” “Asos! I love your Zara boots!”), a female lingua franca that is a way of saying, “I see you and I understand you, because I am like you”. By contrast, when a man feels entitled to tell a random woman how he sees her face, her body, her hair, this sends a very different message. It says that women exist to be observed and appraised, that they are decorative background players while men are the lead roles. So a female stranger might ask me where I got my coat from, but a random man on the train will tell me that I should smile because it would really brighten his day. In fact, I can chart my life by the comments men have made about my physical appearance. (Not included: daily insults from strangers on the internet. Thank you, modern world!) Age 13: at summer camp in Maine, three boys sit next to me and see I am reading a page of Hebrew. I say it’s my Torah portion for my batmitzvah next month. “Don’t you mean your barmitzvah?” one of the boys says, and the others snigger. Barmitzvahs are for boys and the point is that I am so flat-chested I am basically a boy. I promptly enter a decade-long period I call The Padded Bra Years. Age 16: I am on weekend leave from hospital where I am being treated for anorexia. I go for a walk on our local high street. “Oy, anorexic! Eat a sandwich!” a pair of men shout at me as I walk past the bus stop. I go home. Age 19: at university, a boy is in my room and we are kissing. He pulls away and studies my face, soulfully. “It’s really weird,” he begins. “Like, you can look really pretty one minute, and then completely change,” he says. Thank you! Age 25: I am working as a fashion writer for this paper and I’m talking to a male journalist at a party. “If you cover fashion then why don’t you sort your hair out?” he says. I tell him most of my hair fell out as a teenager because of anorexia. He is annoyed I can’t “take a joke”. Age 32: I spot a man (a male novelist, as it happens) who I have met multiple times before and say hi. He looks at me blankly, then the clouds clear. “Oh it’s you!” he says. “I didn’t recognise you because you have one of those faces that looks different every time. That’s so strange!” “And you have one of those male brains that makes you think it’s OK to tell a woman what her face looks like to you,” I don’t reply. Age 37: I am nine months pregnant with twins, and London is in the middle of a heatwave. Less than comfortable, I go to a pharmacy for advice. “You look like something from a nature documentary,” the chemist laughs. My mood is not improved. Age 38: I have emerged from maternity leave and go to a party where I see a male acquaintance. “You know, I think you look better with the baby weight, actually,” he says, apropos of nothing. Age 39: I mention to a male friend that I am going to write this column. “Maybe you’ll miss those comments when you’re older and men act like you’re invisible,” he says. I assure him I absolutely will not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/09/concrete-dreams-new-show-celebrates-southbanks-history-of-performance","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T15:33:52Z","webTitle":"Concrete Dreams: new show celebrates Southbank's history of performance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/09/concrete-dreams-new-show-celebrates-southbanks-history-of-performance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/09/concrete-dreams-new-show-celebrates-southbanks-history-of-performance","fields":{"headline":"Concrete Dreams: new show celebrates Southbank's history of performance","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"An innovative new exhibition at London’s Southbank Centre gives visitors a performer’s perspective of its newly renovated brutalist venues, the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell Room. Concrete Dreams, which opens on Tuesday, is a tour through 50 years of archive material, imaginatively presented in dressing rooms, bathrooms and other backstage areas. It is a tribute to the eclectic talents who have played there over the years. Rifle through a box of index cards and find handwritten notes recording performance dates for Stan Getz, Roaring Jelly and André Previn. In one room, you can watch a Deep Purple gig, scan one of David Bowie’s set lists, see Cleo Laine’s dressing room sign and programmes for poetry festivals featuring Wole Soyinka. Meticulously kept attendance books list artists who played there and how many tickets they sold. Pick up the receiver of a dial telephone and hear oral histories from those who worked at the venues. Concrete Dreams is heaven for architecture nerds too. Original hand-drawn plans for the building line the corridor walls and are used in animations projected on to office windows, accompanied by Steve Reich’s music. You can watch TV documentaries about London’s 60s building boom and listen to Harold Wilson’s 1963 speech about the “white heat” of technology. In wood-panelled dressing rooms, concrete cores removed from the QEH during rewiring are displayed alongside scale models. The tour ends with an arresting live performance in the Purcell Room that captures the venues’ incredibly eclectic artistic history with sophistication, style and humour. The finale features footage of Merce Cunningham’s dancers, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and Lemn Sissay among many others. The exhibition has been created by design practice LYN Atelier and performer collective KlangHaus, who had a hit at the Edinburgh festival in 2014 with an atmospheric gig-come-installation staged in a former small-animal hospital. That show was a sort of musical mystery tour, with projections on the walls and performers popping up in unexpected places, playing right under the audience’s noses. The company’s ethos is to make “a collaboration with buildings” and they say they became obsessed with concrete while preparing the new exhibition. They have even used tracks by musicians who trained as architects: the composer Iannis Xenakis and Pink Floyd. KlangHaus’s Jon Baker explains that they chose to open and end the tour with birdsong – a reference to the bird noises on Cirrus Minor by Pink Floyd, who played at the QEH in 1967, and to the influence of birdsong on other artists whose work has been heard at the venues, from Olivier Messiaen to gamelan musicians. “We had this weird notion that when you build a building, what you’re actually doing is enclosing the outside. You’re colonising a space that was once outside,” says Baker. “So we wanted to bring the sound of birds into the building.” As part of the Concrete Dreams season, there will be a concert of Sam Lee’s Singing With Nightingales, an evening of “human-bird duets”. Georgia Ward, participation producer at the Southbank, said: “We wanted to talk about the amazing history and design of these buildings, but also the performative history. There were some real firsts here: Mike Oldfield’s Tubular Bells, Jessye Norman did an extraordinary performance, Different Trains by Steve Reich. We knew KlangHaus could play with the archive in a beautiful, creative way.” The Southbank Centre’s Royal Festival Hall was built in 1951 for the Festival of Britain. Sixteen years later, it added the QEH, for classical music, dance and opera, and the smaller Purcell Room for chamber music, solo concerts and cabaret. Concrete Dreams also acknowledges the history of the Hayward Gallery, which opened in 1968. A backstage bathroom features displays from the Hayward’s 1969 pop art show and the 1972 exhibition The New Art, where Gilbert and George were billed as George and Gilbert. On the bathroom wall, beautiful silhouettes of photographed visitors at the gallery’s 1970 Kinetics exhibition stand out against the white tiles. The free, one-hour guided tours, supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund, are designed for 15 visitors at a time. Concrete Dreams runs until 29 April and culminates in a three-day festival including a workshop run by the Rambert dance company who once rehearsed in the QEH’s foyer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/15/the-road-to-unfreedom-russia-europe-america-timothy-snyder-review-tim-adams","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"The Road to Unfreedom by Timothy Snyder review – chilling and unignorable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/15/the-road-to-unfreedom-russia-europe-america-timothy-snyder-review-tim-adams","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/15/the-road-to-unfreedom-russia-europe-america-timothy-snyder-review-tim-adams","fields":{"headline":"The Road to Unfreedom by Timothy Snyder review – chilling and unignorable","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Even presidents who don’t believe in history need a historian to rely on. When asked, in 2014, by a delegation of students and history teachers for his chosen chronicler of Russia’s past, Vladimir Putin came up with a single name: Ivan Ilyin. Ilyin is a figure who might have been easily lost to history were it not for the posthumous patronage of Russia’s leader. Putin first drew attention to him – Ilyin was a philosopher, not a historian, a Russian who died in exile in Switzerland in 1954 – when he organised the repatriation of Ilyin’s remains for reburial in Moscow in 2005. Ilyin’s personal papers, held in a library in Michigan, were also brought “home” at the president’s request. New editions of Ilyin’s dense books of political philosophy became popular in Kremlin circles – and all of Russia’s civil servants reportedly received a collection of his essays in 2014. And when Putin explained Russia’s need to combat the expansion of the European Union, and laid out the argument to invade Ukraine, it was Ilyin’s arguments on which the president relied. Timothy Snyder begins his pattern-making deconstruction of recent Russian history – which by design, he argues, is indistinguishable from recent British and American history – with a comprehensive account of Putin’s reverence for the work of Ilyin. Like much of Snyder’s analysis in this unignorable book, the framing offers both a disturbing and persuasive insight. Ilyin, an early critic of Bolshevism, had been expelled by the Soviets in 1922. In Germany, where he wrote favourably of the rise of Hitler and the example of Mussolini, he developed ideas for a Russian fascism, which could counter the effects of the 1917 revolution. As a thread through his nationalist rhetoric, he proposed a lost “Russian spirit”, which in its essence reflected a Christian God’s original creation before the fall and drew on a strongly masculine “pure” sexual energy (he had been psychoanalysed by Freud). A new Russian nation should be established, Ilyin argued, to defend and promote that ineffable spirit against all external threats – not only communism but also individualism. To achieve that end, Ilyin outlined a “simulacrum” of democracy in which the Russian people would speak “naturally” with one voice, dependent on a leader who was cast as “redeemer” for returning true Russian culture to its people. Elections would be “rituals” designed to endorse that power, periodically “uniting the nation in a gesture of subjugation”. To establish that dystopian state, Snyder argues, Putin’s regime has deliberately pursued two of Ilyin’s central concepts. The first demanded the identification and destruction of the enemies of that Russian spirit to establish unity; alien influences – Muslim or Jewish, fundamentalist or cosmopolitan – were intent on “sodomising” Russian virtue (sexual imagery is never far away in the Kremlin’s lurid calls to arms). If those enemies did not exist they would have to be invented or exaggerated. After the terror attacks on Russian institutions – the Moscow theatre siege and the Beslan school massacre – Chechen separatism was used as a reason to bring first television and then regional governorships under state control. Those policies were led, Snyder documents, by Vladislav Surkov, the former postmodernist theatre director who was Boris Yeltsin’s deputy chief of staff and then Putin’s lead strategist. Surkov directs a policy, borrowed from Ilyin, which he calls “centralisation, personification, idealisation”. With Surkov’s management, “Putin was to offer masculinity as an argument against democracy”, Snyder suggests; he was to associate, specifically, for example, gay rights and equal marriage with an attack on the Russian spirit. In this culture war, disinformation was critical. Russian TV and social media would create a climate in which news became entertainment, and nothing would quite seem factual. This surreal shift is well documented, but Snyder’s forensic examination of, for example, the news cycle that followed the shooting down of flight MH17 makes essential reading. On the first day official propaganda suggested that the Russian missile attack on the Malaysian plane had in fact been a bodged attempt by Ukrainian forces to assassinate Putin himself; by day two, Russian TV was promoting the idea that the CIA had sent a ghost plane filled with corpses overhead to provoke Russian forces. The more outrageous the official lie was, the more it allowed people to demonstrate their faith in the Kremlin. Putin made, Snyder argues, his direct assault on “western” factuality a source of national pride. Snyder calls this policy “implausible deniability”; you hear it in the tone of the current “debate” around the Salisbury attack: Russian power is displayed in a relativist blizzard of alternative theories, delivered in a vaguely absurdist spirit, as if no truth on earth is really provable. The second half of Snyder’s book explores how Russia has sought to export this policy to those who threaten it, primarily through a mass disinformation war, a 2.0 update of Sun Tzu’s “confusion to our enemy” principle, with the aim of dividing and polarising pluralist democracies – in particular the EU and the US – against themselves. Snyder is very astute at joining the dots in how Russian propagandists, human or digital, sought to spread fake news to undermine faith in the democratic process, at the same time giving overt support to European separatists and Russia TV regulars such as Marine Le Pen and Nigel Farage. He details how, for example, Russian “news” sources spread the idea that the Scottish independence vote had been “rigged” by “establishment forces” with the aim of undermining faith in democratic institutions in Britain before the EU referendum. We are still awaiting, of course, the full disentangling of Donald Trump’s complex relations with Putin’s government, and the many links between his campaign organisation and Russian operatives. As with Luke Harding’s book Collusion, however, there is more than enough here to keep Robert Mueller busy for a long while yet. One unavoidable conclusion of this depressing tale lies in the acknowledgment that Putin’s strategy has been so successful in shaking faith in the sanctity of fact and expert knowledge. A measure of that assault comes when you examine your reaction to this meticulously researched and footnoted book as you read it. Timothy Snyder is professor of history at Yale. His book Bloodlands, about the fallout of second world war atrocities on the eastern front, won the prestigious Hannah Arendt prize and was described by the late, great Tony Judt as “the most important book to appear on this subject in decades”. And yet as he unfolds this contemporary sequel, you might well hear, as I did from time to time, those sneery voices now lodged in your head that whisper of “liberal elitism” and “fake news” and “MSM” and “tempting conspiracies”, and which refuse ever, quite, to be quieted. How did we get here? Snyder has a good idea. • The Road to Unfreedom: Russia, Europe, America by Timothy Snyder is published by Bodley Head (£25).

Could any of us be turned into “spies, silent killers and resistance organisers”? Those are questions the makers of Secret Agent Selection: WW2 (BBC2, 9pm) have set out to answer with period-era uniform, Meccano challenges and dubious psychological testing. It’s a bit like The Apprentice, only instead of the prize being some cash from Alan Sugar, winners get the chance to carry out a bit of state-sponsored murder and sabotage. At least, I think they do, but I haven’t watched the final episode. In this first show, 14 recruits go through the selection process for the Special Operations Executive, a secret, second-world-war army of agents – drawn from ordinary people, we’re regularly reminded – created in the second world war to go behind enemy lines and bring down the Nazis. They must have “fanatical enthusiasm” and “nerves of steel”. The women must also know how to put stockings on for dinner. This is the army – and the 1940s, supposedly – so everyone is known by their surname. Dewhirst, a property developer back in the 21st century, wants to do it authentically. “The lads who did this for real wouldn’t have been able to second-guess it, wouldn’t have been able to Google it,” he says, knowledgably. Stone – an east London drag artist – admits to being terrified. You know he’s not going to cut it; he’s too gentle. When a gunman bursts into their classroom while they’re taking an exam – to be later quizzed on their observational skills – he dives under a desk, which seems sensible, but is apparently frowned upon. Beauclerk, a translator decended from a real SOE agent, isn’t doing too well, either – she says she couldn’t kill a gendarme in order to successfully attack a factory and doesn’t want to crawl under barbed wire in the assault course because she might get her hair caught. Jefferys, a research scientist, soon emerges as a strong contender. She’s barely 5ft tall and is the first of the recruits to successfully scale a 10ft (three-metre) wall. Could she kill someone? Try to stop her. “I’m going to sound like a terrible person,” she says during the interview section, trying to suppress a hopeful smile, “but I think if I had the orders to kill someone, I could without a second’s hesitation.” She’s my favourite. Four didn’t make it through, including Stone and Beauclerk. It seemed a shame to lose Camara, a council administrator, who was slow at most of the tasks but also demonstrated the most bravery. I thought the selection process was supposed to be about spotting potential. It was all quite fun and the historical snippets were interesting, particularly the sparse bits of information about real agents. The SOE actively recruited women, and I was burning to know more about one of the most effective Allied spies, Virginia Hall, who had lost her leg in a hunting accident (the Gestapo called her the “Limping Lady”) and ran a resistance network in Lyon. Who knows what she, and the other agents mentioned, would have made of being bit players in a reality show. Still, it’s interesting to see how the traits we appear to be drawn to in the modern age probably aren’t ones our wartime ancestors would have valued. Asked to nominate the person they would choose as their leader, many of the recruits went for cocky Dewhirst (who in an assessment interview confessed to insecurity). Only one of the recruits, Bajaj, saw how Dewhirst could be a liability. The hapless, feckless boys from Plebs (ITV2, 10pm), the ancient-Rome-based sitcom, returned with its fourth series and a double bill. A minute into episode one, Stylax, one of the trio, is squished by a falling marble slab. It’s shocking, but at least it wasn’t Grumio, their gormless slave. “I love funerals,” says their boss, Flavia (the great Doon Mackichan). “It’s where I met three of my husbands.” The episode is slow after that, but culminates in the boys – including new member Jason – extorting a toilet block from corrupt property developer Crassus (a guest-starring Robert Lindsay). Episode two picks up when they decide to turn it into a gastropub, the Corona and Toga, which becomes Rome’s latest hipster spot after a (faked) rave review. Grumio is the chef and comes up with an ingenious menu “called ‘stuffing stuff in stuff’, so it’s like a mouse inside a grouse or a squid inside a squirrel.” The joke is so daft that it never gets tired – there’s a snail in a quail, a wren in a hen, a marrow in a sparrow. … It’s all undemanding and wonderfully silly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/09/nobel-prize-judges-quit-over-handling-of-sexual-misconduct-allegations","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T12:41:43Z","webTitle":"Nobel prize judges quit over handling of sexual misconduct allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/09/nobel-prize-judges-quit-over-handling-of-sexual-misconduct-allegations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/09/nobel-prize-judges-quit-over-handling-of-sexual-misconduct-allegations","fields":{"headline":"Nobel prize judges quit over handling of sexual misconduct allegations","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Three members of the secretive committee that selects the winner of the Nobel prize for literature have resigned from the jury in protest at how it has handled the sexual harassment allegations made against a man with close links to the board. Peter Englund, the former permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, and the authors Klas Östergren and Kjell Espmark, all separately resigned from the 18-person jury on 6 April. Membership of the Swedish Academy is intended to be for life, so no one has technically left it before. In 1989, three judges quit when the academy did not denounce Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini’s call for the death of author Salman Rushdie after the publication of The Satanic Verses, but the academy declined to accept their resignations. In 2005, judge Knut Ahnlund resigned over the decision to award Austrian writer Elfriede Jelinek the year before. However, Ahnlund had not been an active member of the academy since 1996, and his chair was left empty until his death in 2012. “The Swedish Academy has for a long time had serious problems and has now tried to solve them in a way that puts obscure considerations before its own statutes, which is a betrayal of its founder and patron, and not least its mission to represent genius and taste. Therefore, I have chosen to no longer take part in its activities. I’m leaving the table, I’m out of the game,” Östergren told Svenska Dagbladet, according to a translation from Swedish site The Local. According to the Associated Press, Espmark told Swedish media that “when leading voices in the academy put friendship and other irrelevant considerations before [this] integrity, then I can no longer participate in the work”, while Englund wrote in a letter to Aftonbladet that “decisions have been made that I do not believe in and cannot defend, and I have therefore decided not to participate anymore in the work of the Swedish Academy”. Englund linked his decision to the academy’s handling of sexual misconduct claims against the artistic director of a literary club in Stockholm to whom the august body has close ties. The man was accused by 18 women of sexual assault and harassment in Swedish paper Dagens Nyheter. The accusations were made in November 2017, and the academy subsequently cut all ties to the man. None of the women reported their accusations to the police. The artistic director has denied all the allegations. Swedish media linked the row to a vote over whether another academy member with close ties to the man should be excluded from the academy. The three members who left had wanted the other member excluded, but the vote went against them. Academy member Anders Olsson told the broadcaster SVT that “we came to the conclusion that no one is to be excluded. Those who left had another opinion. They were in the minority and I think that’s the main reason they left.” According to the Local, the permanent secretary of the academy, Sara Danius, has said that the jury is now considering changing its rules and making it possible for members to leave and be replaced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/09/oklahoma-teachers-march","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T11:20:14Z","webTitle":"'Our feet are gross': Oklahoma teachers on gruelling 110-mile march for better funding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/09/oklahoma-teachers-march","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/09/oklahoma-teachers-march","fields":{"headline":"'Our feet are gross': Oklahoma teachers on gruelling 110-mile march for better funding","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On Sunday at the First Christian church of Chandler, some of the striking Oklahoma teachers went to a special service. The 150 teachers on the grueling march come from different faiths but they have developed a faith in each other. “I have bled on half of these women,” said Madeline Jacobsen, a third-grade teacher at Bell elementary. “Our feet are gross and you can’t reach them at the end of the day so someone literally has to help you wrap them and get your feet good.” Many had never attempted anything so intense as a 110-mile march, in this case from Tulsa to the state capitol in Oklahoma City. But they were inspired to make a statement about the need to fund education properly. “I planned to walk five miles each day because I didn’t think I could do it all,” Jacobsen said. “I have walked every single mile because I can do more with this group and this support than I can ever do alone.” The marchers are mostly women, and they have formed a tight bond. Every night, they have dinner together and go over “pluses” and “deltas” of the day. Deltas are obstacles they would like to overcome. There is give and take. The women talk through issues and figure out solutions to make everyone feel included. “Men wouldn’t be able to do things like this,” said 52-year-old Radonn Broeffle Musgrove, a 31-year teaching veteran. “Women are able to work these sort of things out.” Broeffle Musgrove is one of only a few teachers on the march who participated in the last statewide strike in Oklahoma, back in 1990. She said she saw a big difference. “I think the #MeToo movement has even really propelled us forward,” she said. “It’s so exciting.” The women are driven forward not only by others on the march. Many members of communities on the route have stood by the side of the road, cheering the marchers on and handing out snacks and water. “People have asked me, ‘Why do you stay in Oklahoma?’” said 28-year-old Heather Cody, a single mother who was forced to move back in with her parents to make ends meet while teaching. “This has proved why we have stayed in Oklahoma: the community has helped us. We just had two great meals at the First Christian church of Chandler and every town we walk through it has gotten better and better.” Together, the women feel they are building momentum. On Friday, the state legislature passed two measures expected to help education funding. The main goal remains. “We aren’t gonna shut up, we aren’t done, this movement has gelled us together,” Jacobsen said. “We are ready to fight for our kids for the long haul. We have power together.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/09/man-executed-travel-agent-for-having-relationship-with-his-ex-girlfriend-","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T11:06:17Z","webTitle":"Man jailed for murder of travel agent over relationship with ex-girlfriend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/man-executed-travel-agent-for-having-relationship-with-his-ex-girlfriend-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/man-executed-travel-agent-for-having-relationship-with-his-ex-girlfriend-","fields":{"headline":"Man jailed for murder of travel agent over relationship with ex-girlfriend","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A man has been jailed for a minimum of 26 years for murdering a travel agent in a “cold-blooded execution” at her workplace following the break-up of his relationship. Cassie Hayes, 28, who died in hospital from a wound to the throat, was attacked in front of customers, including children, at a Tui branch in Southport. Liverpool crown court heard that Andrew Burke, 31, had made repeated threats to kill Hayes and himself before the murder on 13 January. Burke’s former partner Laura Williams, 29, had begun a relationship with Hayes since breaking up with Burke, the court was told. On Monday, in front of members of Hayes’ family, he pleaded guilty to murder and having an offensive weapon in a public place. The judge, David Aubrey, told Burke the killing was an “act of unspeakable savagery”. “This was a cowardly act of revenge designed to kill and did kill a totally innocent person in broad daylight in front of, and witnessed by, so many,” he said. The court heard that in January 2017, a year before the killing, Burke was charged with making malicious communications over repeated threats to kill Hayes or himself. He pleaded guilty to that offence and received a fine and an unpaid work placement, the court heard. Gordon Cole QC, prosecuting, said Burke blamed Hayes for the break-up with Williams and was given a police harassment warning in May 2017, eight months before killing her. On 12 January, the day before the murder, Burke appeared at Sefton magistrates court, where he was convicted of harassing Williams and released on bail before sentencing. Cole said the murder was a premeditated and planned attack carried out in a “totally ruthless way”. “It was essentially an execution of a young woman in her place of work,” he said. The killing was witnessed by several customers, including two children aged 12 and nine, who described how Burke walked into the travel agents with his hood up and approached Hayes at the counter. One of Hayes’ colleagues heard Burke say: “I just want to apologise for what I am about to do”, before he walked behind the victim and slit her throat with a 12cm knife. Cole said that, after the attack, Burke apologised to the witnesses and told them Hayes “had it coming for what she had done to his family”. He then waited calmly for the police to arrive and arrest him, the prosecutor said. Burke’s sister, Sarah, had indicated that her brother had a “continuing fixation” with Williams and Hayes and “continually blamed Cassie for ruining his relationship”, the court heard. On the day before the murder, he called his sister and said: “I’ll turn left and go home, or turn right, go to Wilkinsons, buy the biggest knife I can find, go to Southport and slit Cassie’s throat.” But Sarah Burke dismissed those comments and told him to go home and grow up, Cole said. In victim impact statements, Hayes’ family said they had been left “truly broken” by the murder. Her sister, Nadine Hayes, told the court: “My whole world gone, life as I knew it before has gone. This act has torn so my lives apart.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/apr/09/unusual-wedding-gowns-perfect-tights-watches-shoes-fashion","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T12:59:00Z","webTitle":"Unusual wedding gowns, perfect tights, colourful watches and shoes in every shade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/09/unusual-wedding-gowns-perfect-tights-watches-shoes-fashion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/apr/09/unusual-wedding-gowns-perfect-tights-watches-shoes-fashion","fields":{"headline":"Unusual wedding gowns, perfect tights, colourful watches and shoes in every shade","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Tight fit Fed-up with tights digging into your waist and a gusset down by your knees?

Spielberg, who has directed every instalment in the blockbuster movie series, told the Sun that he was “pretty sure” the upcoming fifth outing for the explorer would be Ford’s swansong in the role, but that the franchise would “certainly continue after that”. When quizzed on who might don Jones’s famous fedora and whip, the director said that it was time the character took “a different form”. Nodding in response to the suggestion that said form could be female, Spielberg added that “we’d have to change the name from Jones to Joan. And there would be nothing wrong with that.” Ford first appeared as Indiana Jones in 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark and went on to play the character in three further sequels, most recently 2008’s Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Spielberg confirmed in March that an as-yet-untitled fifth film in the series would begin shooting in the UK next year with Ford again in the title role, and would likely be released in 2020. Spielberg’s latest film, the sci-fi adventure Ready Player One, was released in cinemas last weekend and has performed well at the worldwide box office, taking $200m globally."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2018/apr/04/university-staff-vote-on-pensions-offer-without-a-deal-in-sight","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T11:54:47Z","webTitle":"University staff vote on pensions offer – without a deal in sight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/04/university-staff-vote-on-pensions-offer-without-a-deal-in-sight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/apr/04/university-staff-vote-on-pensions-offer-without-a-deal-in-sight","fields":{"headline":"University staff vote on pensions offer – without a deal in sight","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The outcome of the strike that has crippled 65 British universities this year remains clouded in uncertainty no matter what is the result of a ballot being taken by union members, according to university and union officials. From Wednesday, about 50,000 members of the University and College Union (UCU) can vote on an offer from their employers to renegotiate the pensions changes that sparked the strike. But whether or not the offer is accepted, the union and employers face difficulties finalising a deal in talks that could drag on for years. For the UCU, even holding the ballot has caused deep rifts. While many expect the members to accept the offer and end the strikes that threaten to disrupt exams this summer, a strong backlash has emerged on campuses including University College London and Liverpool universities, where members have been urged to reject the deal as vague and too risky. Jo Grady, a UCU branch member at Sheffield University, said she would vote to reject the proposal by Universities UK (UUK), which offers little more than a new joint committee of experts to examine the valuation and operation of the staff pension scheme. “I would rather have seen a better offer on the table before there was a move to ballot members,” said Grady, a senior lecturer in employment relations who has researched pensions disputes. “On paper there is lots to be welcomed, but the language from UUK is very woolly and allows it to kick too many things into the long grass – and I think that’s their aim,” she said. “I feel I’ve been forced to vote ‘reject’ because the union called a ballot that was unwise.” A number of branch executives are advising their members to reject the offer in the ballot, which closes on 13 April. In a message to its members on Tuesday, the University of Kent UCU branch said: “Like many other branches across the country, the Kent UCU position is to reject this proposal.” Sam James, the Cambridge UCU branch vice-president, said he thought the outcome was finely balanced: “The atmosphere is for rejection but it’s very hard to judge.” Those on the left of the union have also argued strongly to reject the proposal. Carlo Morelli, a UCU national executive member from Dundee, posted a widely circulated video in which he said he would reject the offer. “The offer is ambiguous – the offer doesn’t tell us what we are really going to get and what the settlement is going to be,” Morelli said. “That’s not what we are fighting for, it’s not why we’ve been on strike for 14 days.” Few union officials or branch members are willing to predict the outcome, but many say rancour and disruption could result either way. “There has already been untold chaos in higher education this year. If this [offer] does unravel, then that would make things worse,” said Grady. The strike centres on a radical overhaul of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), the country’s largest private-sector pension scheme, with 400,000 members at more than 60 universities and almost 300 similar institutions such as the Royal Society and Overseas Development Institute. A series of events, triggered by a triennial valuation of the scheme required by law and a botched survey of member institutions, culminated in a decision in January in favour of the employers that ended the scheme’s defined benefits – guaranteed levels of payment to members upon retirement. Instead, the fixed benefits would be replaced by defined contributions, in which members would pay in but their eventual pension payments would be at the whim of the financial markets upon retirement. UCU members voted by 88% in favour of strike action that began in February and which drove the employers back to negotiations – and an offer of a deal in early March that was roundly rejected by UCU branches. But after further strikes, and with more scheduled later this month, UUK came back with its latest offer – a jointly run panel of experts to look at the valuation and revisions – which UCU narrowly decided to put to its members. Critics say that even if an expert panel could agree a new pension structure, it would have to win support from both union and employers, the USS trustees and finally the official pensions regulator. James points out that the UUK proposal says nothing about what happens by the end of June, when the pension scheme must make changes. “I think it’s very possible that this proposal will only affect the next valuation in three years’ time,” said James. What happens in the meantime, he says, is anyone’s guess. But James also reports that Cambridge’s UCU branch membership has risen from 900 to 1,700, with similar increases reported elsewhere, as librarians, technicians and administrators as well as lecturers and researchers sign up to join their colleagues on picket lines. If a newly radicalised university staff reject the UUK offer, university leaders could face a long summer. The vice-chancellor of one Russell Group university said privately that strikes spilling into exam season could mean chaos, with students unable to graduate and legal action being taken. “The government and the [Office for Students] wouldn’t resist throwing their weight around if that happened. It’s hard to imagine a worse scenario,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/04/facebook-gdpr-stronger-privacy-protections-eu-data-protection-law-mark-zuckerberg","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T09:44:05Z","webTitle":"Facebook refuses to promise GDPR-style privacy protection for US users","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/04/facebook-gdpr-stronger-privacy-protections-eu-data-protection-law-mark-zuckerberg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/04/facebook-gdpr-stronger-privacy-protections-eu-data-protection-law-mark-zuckerberg","fields":{"headline":"Facebook refuses to promise GDPR-style privacy protection for US users","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Facebook is rolling out stronger privacy protections to users ahead of the introduction of Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), but Mark Zuckerberg will not promise all future changes will apply to the company’s American users. Although the initial tranche of changes, announced last week, will be available worldwide, Zuckerberg refused to commit to GDPR becoming the standard for the social network across the world. He told Reuters that Facebook was working on a version of the data protection law that would work globally, bringing some European privacy guarantees worldwide, but the 33-year-old billionaire demurred when asked what parts of the law he would not extend worldwide. “We’re still nailing down details on this, but it should directionally be, in spirit, the whole thing,” Zuckerberg said. He did not elaborate. His comments suggest that in some ways, American users will continue to find themselves with weaker privacy protections than their European counterparts. Privacy advocacy groups have been urging Facebook and its Silicon Valley competitors such as Alphabet Inc’s Google to apply EU data laws worldwide, largely without success. “We want Facebook and Google and all the other companies to immediately adopt in the United States and worldwide any new protections that they implement in Europe,” said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, in Washington. Zuckerberg has agreed to testify in front of Congress, the first of several such hearings he is expected to appear before, on Wednesday 11 April. Representatives Greg Walden and Frank Pallone, the ranking members of the House Energy and Commerce committee, said the hearing will focus on the Facebook’s “use and protection of user data”. Even while Facebook introduces its long-planned tweaks to comply with GDPR, the social network is also rushing to introduce a second set of privacy tools following the Cambridge Analytica files, which revealed the company’s historical lack of clarity over how and why user data was shared with third parties. The latest post-scandal change offers users the ability to remove applications from the Facebook platform in bulk quantities. Integrations with external developers were responsible for the initial removal of data from Facebook’s platform that eventually found its way into the hands of Cambridge Analytica, an election consultancy. But it has always been hard for users to manage the settings related to how much data gets shared with external providers, particularly if those users have been on the site for many years. Now, alongside a tool that was previously promised, which deactivates an app if the user hasn’t accessed it in three months, Facebook allows users to remove apps in large numbers, making it easier to clean up their privacy settings. The new settings can be accessed by visiting the main settings, then clicking on “apps”, and checking multiple apps that should be removed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/06/working-less-safe-cash-free-upside","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T09:23:27Z","webTitle":"Should we be working less, and how safe is going cash-free?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/06/working-less-safe-cash-free-upside","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/06/working-less-safe-cash-free-upside","fields":{"headline":"Should we be working less, and how safe is going cash-free?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"New technologies are often touted as the solutions to our problems, as well as decried as the cause of all manner of social ills. We are told that increasing automation of jobs will mean more of us spending less time working, with ever greater responsibility handed over to software, sensors and the cloud. This week we visited some experimental projects that could offer a glimpse of our future, to see how people are grappling with the possibilities and problems of technological innovation. Reducing our working hours, while ensuring sufficient pay and essential services, is often floated as the best model for boosting productivity. It is also a seemingly inevitable byproduct of the rise of the robot worker. In New Zealand, our reporter Eleanor Ainge Roy visited a company trialling a four-day work week while still paying its employees the same, an experiment that is being closely watched around the world. Did employees and management agree on how it was going? Digital payment systems have long been promoted as a cheaper, safer alternative to cash. Physical money creates logistical expense and security risks for individuals and businesses, while its anonymity can be exploited by criminals operating on a larger scale. Sweden has enthusiastically embraced a world without cash, with merchants increasingly refusing to accept physical money. But a small but growing group of Swedes are raising the alarm about the implications of going fully cash-free, as David Crouch discovered. In England, where the number of rough sleepers has risen 169% in the past decade, Rachel Obordo visited startups that are harnessing the power of digital crowdfunding platforms to give homeless people a chance to rebuild their lives. What we liked: This deep dive by the Arizona Daily Star on the causes of and solutions to Arizona’s “foster care crisis”, and this New York Times report on a progressive approach to tackling violence. Also in the Times, this comparison of how different countries handle student debt was enlightening. And we enjoyed this interview with Africa Check’s deputy editor about fact-checking and fake news. What we heard: 44 hour weeks might have been OK when you could go home and your spouse has done the housework and cooked the meals etc but now that both partners usually work, they have to get home and do all the housework and the kids and the meals, and it’s too stressful.

Takings rose an impressive 22% from the previous session, with £5.61m for the weekend period and £21.4m after 17 days. Including Easter Monday, the total rises to a powerful £24.2m. The Beatrix Potter adaptation has a lot more of the school holiday yet to play, and it should perform strongly right the way through to the end of next week. Peter Rabbit has already overtaken Pixar’s Coco (£18.3m) to become the biggest family film of 2018. StudioCanal’s Paddington 2, released last November, stood at £23m at the same stage of its run, and has now reached a mighty £42.6m. The runner-up: Ready Player One Even though it failed to dislodge Peter Rabbit from the top spot, Warners should be satisfied with the debut numbers for Ready Player One: £4.03m over the weekend period, £5.11m including Thursday previews and £6.64m including Easter Monday. While that doesn’t quite match the opening session for Spielberg’s The BFG in July 2016 (£5.29m), Ernest Cline’s sci-fi novel doesn’t have the same audience profile in the UK as Roald Dahl’s beloved children’s classic. Making apt comparisons for Ready Player One is a tricky challenge, because it’s based on a YA novel not a video game, but gamers certainly represent a key component of the envisioned audience. The film’s 1980s references potentially provide a handy hook for nostalgic adults, stretching the target across a broad age demographic. Ender’s Game, based on Orson Scott Card’s 1985 novel and with a cast led by Harrison Ford and Asa Butterfield, might be one valid comparison, although there was much less excitement around the release of that film: it opened in November 2013 with £1.16m. The upscale family film: Isle of Dogs Is Wes Anderson’s Isle of Dogs for grownups, kids, or both? Distributor 20th Century Fox is betting on the last of those three possibilities with the release of this stop-frame animation, which sees a young boy bravely go in search of his pooch Spots when all canines are banished to Trash Island in a dystopian future Japanese city. Isle of Dogs has opened with a decent £1.45m from 472 cinemas for the weekend – £1.64m including previews and £2.23m including Easter Monday. Those numbers are similar to the debut session of The Fantastic Mr Fox in October 2009: £1.52m from 481 sites. Of course, there has been a fair amount of ticket price inflation since that time; on the other hand, Fox had the advantage of being based on another Roald Dahl novel, whereas Dogs did not start with existing audience awareness. The unstoppable train: The Greatest Showman While films spanning the genres saw falls from the previous weekend as steep as 50% (Tomb Raider, Game Night) and 60% (Pacific Rim: Uprising, Red Sparrow, Unsane), The Greatest Showman once again defied gravity with a 7% rise. Weekend takings of £812,000 push the total after 14 weeks to £41.5m, and £41.8m including Easter Monday. That puts the Hugh Jackman musical just outside the top 50 films of all time at the UK box office. The top musicals remain Beauty and the Beast (£72.4m) and Mamma Mia! (£68.6m), with The Greatest Showman in third place – unless you count Disney’s The Jungle Book remake (£46.3m) or animation Frozen (£43.0m). The market Box office numbers are in for last month, and they show a significant drop on March 2017 – down by 28%. The poor performance means that, while box office for January and February was marginally up on the same months in 2017, the first quarter (or, more accurately, the year to 29 March) is trailing a year ago by 9%. The better news is that last weekend is 24% up on the equivalent period from 2017, when Ghost in the Shell and Smurfs: The Lost Village were the top new releases. The coming session looks set to be dominated by films already in the market (such as Peter Rabbit, Ready Player One and Isle of Dogs), but audiences could get excited about John Krasinski’s high-concept horror A Quiet Place.

Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, who was a commander of the now disbanded Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment, said the lack of detail from the British government was allowing Russia to win its “disinformation” campaign about the attack on the former Russian spy and his daughter. De Bretton-Gordon told the Guardian: “Having seen a lot of various intelligence sources I feel 100% confident that the prime minister is correct that the Russians are guilty. The Russians do appear to be on the front foot with communications and their disinformation campaign is putting the UK on the back foot.” He accepted that it was difficult for sensitive information to be given out without the danger of betraying sources, but said the British government had to find a way of explaining more effectively how it had reached its conclusion that Russia was to blame. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, De Bretton-Gordon said the government needed to “throw some more evidence in that is compelling that does not betray sources because we need to get on the front foot”. On Tuesday in a round of television interviews, Gary Aitkenhead, the chief executive of the government’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) at Porton Down, said the poison had been identified as a military-grade novichok nerve agent, which could probably be deployed only by a nation state. Aitkenhead said the government had reached its conclusion that Russia was responsible for the Salisbury attack by combining the laboratory’s scientific findings with information from other sources. The comments came hours before an extraordinary meeting in The Hague on Wednesday of the executive council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), called by Russia. The UK government moved quickly to make it clear that the prime minister, Theresa May, had always been clear the assessment from Porton Down was “only one part of the intelligence picture”. However, the government’s position is being undermined by an interview the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, gave to Deutsche Welle, Germany’s public international broadcaster. Asked how the UK had been able to find out the novichok originated from Russia so quickly, he replied: “When I look at the evidence, the people from Porton Down, the laboratory, they were absolutely categorical. I asked the guy myself, I said: ‘Are you sure?’ And he said: ‘There’s no doubt.’ So we have very little alternative but to take the action that we have taken.” The Russians immediately seized on Aitkenhead’s comments. Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Britain would have to apologise to Russia for its “mad accusations” that “have no foundation whatsoever”. The Russian embassy in London said the UK’s claims that Moscow was behind the attack was a “bluff”, adding: “This has been confirmed by the head of the secret lab. This only proves that all political declarations on the Russian origin of the crime are nothing but assumptions not stemming from objective facts or the course of the investigation.” De Bretton-Gordon said: “Porton Down have done the job that they’re required to do. They have identified the nerve agent and said that it’s a novichock. The prime minister has stated that a number of other intelligence sources have led the UK government to believe that the Russian government are responsible for the attack in Salisbury. “Russia, as a signatory to the chemical weapons convention should be helping investigations including assisting the OPCW to visit Shikhany, [the base of a military research establishment in central Russia], to verify if the novichok came from there. If the Russians are as innocent as they say they are, they should allow them to visit as soon as possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/04/fleetwood-mac-re-enter-us-charts-dreams-twitter-tweet-billboard","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T09:01:21Z","webTitle":"Meme come true: Fleetwood Mac re-enter US charts thanks to Twitter post","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/04/fleetwood-mac-re-enter-us-charts-dreams-twitter-tweet-billboard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/04/fleetwood-mac-re-enter-us-charts-dreams-twitter-tweet-billboard","fields":{"headline":"Meme come true: Fleetwood Mac re-enter US charts thanks to Twitter post","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Dreams, the 1977 single from Fleetwood Mac’s 40m-selling album Rumours, has re-entered the US charts thanks to a Twitter meme.

It was retweeted more than 130,000 times, prompting 2,000 downloads of Dreams and 1.9m streams, a 24% rise. Rumours, which topped Billboard’s Top Rock Albums for a record 31 consecutive weeks on its release, jumped to No 13 in that chart. In the UK album chart, meanwhile, Rumours went from No 49 to 31 in its 725th week in the Top 100, while The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac went from No 27 to 17, chalking up its 328th week.

The DRC has been hit by a series of rebellions and outbreaks of communal violence in recent months, with some observers raising concerns of a slide into anarchy which could destabilise much of the region. The UN has warned of a dramatic deterioration in the humanitarian situation. More than 4 million people are displaced and at least 8 million are in the acute stages of hunger. Thousands have died. A donor conference on 13 April was boycotted by the DRC and raised less than half of the $1.7bn sought by the UN. Police and national military forces are blamed for widespread human rights abuses. About 50 people have already been killed in protests this year According to a recent UN report “state agents” carried out 1,176 killings last year, but the true toll may be much higher. Security agencies are accused of hiding evidence of further wrongdoing and many witnesses have been intimidated. Five members of the civil society movement Lutte pour le Changement (LUCHA) were recently detained in the eastern city of Goma, while many more have experienced systematic harassment. Five protesters and one police officer were injured when security forces dispersed a protest last month. Alexis Kanane, a former spokesman of the LUCHA in Goma, was shot dead last month. Campaigners believe he was assassinated. LUCHA is now planning a new wave of street protests before the end of April. The relatives of victims of recent shootings and alleged abductions contacted by the Guardian were unwilling to talk after receiving threats. But members of the DRC’s fragmented opposition as well as civil society activists said they would continue to protest despite the risk of imprisonment or injury. “We are threatened every day. They tell us: ‘Stop what you are doing or something bad will happen to you.’ The worse thing is not the threat of prison, it is the fear of not being able to act to change the situation,” said Gloire Wahzavalere, a 20-year-old LUCHA activist in Goma. Kabila, who took power in 2001 after his father was assassinated, ignored the end of his second five year term in 2016. Aides have said the 46-year-old will not stand again at polls scheduled for December. “This is not a kingdom … it is a democratic republic,” Lambert Mende, the information minister, told the Guardian in February Many believe Kabila will try to maintain his grip on power, by changing the constitution, outright fraud, ensuring a close ally wins polls or manipulating the electoral system to ensure opposition parties are marginalised. Opposition activists say there is “a new consciousness among the Congolese”. Christian Badosa, an official from the Commitment for Citizenship and Development party (ECiDé), said: “There is a popular anger [Kabila] cannot resist. Everyone wants a change.” Badosa said he had been attacked four times by unknown thugs in Goma and repeatedly detained. “I’ve spent a lot of time in safehouses. They are ready to do anything to silence us but we are used to their threats. We’re going to keep up the pressure.” The lack of unity among the DRC’s multitude of opposition parties may allow Kabila to pursue an effective policy of divide and rule, analysts say, and there is still some support for the president. “We have seen some huge achievements in recent years: hospitals, clinics, schools. But you have to be realistic. Look at where we were coming from! Since independence, this country was effectively destroyed,” said Sylvestre Nkuba Kahombo, a Goma MP with the president’s party. The most popular opposition figure appears to be Moïse Katumbi, the former governor of Katanga province. Katumbi, who was forced to leave DRC after being charged with fraud in 2016, launched his run for the presidecy from South Africa last month. The multimillionaire businessman says the charges against him are trumped up. “He’s the one we want to see. He knows how to get things done. In Katanga there was lots of development when he was in power and that’s what we want to see everywhere,” said Alphonse Bahati, a traditional chief in Nyabiondo, a remote hill town 45 miles west of Goma. Officials say that “no fraud will be accepted” but point to the logistical difficulties of organising the poll in a vast country with limited infrastructure and 46 million registered voters. “We are four times bigger than France, without roads. That’s going to pose some enormous challenges,” said Julien Paluko, the governor of North Kivu province and a Kabila loyalist. A key point of contention is the use of new electronic voting machines, which many believe will facilitate fraud but which officials say are essential to cut costs and ease logistics. The international community led by the US are insisting on paper ballots. The 2006 election led to violent clashes. In 2011, the poll was marred by allegations of systematic fraud. Wahzavalere, the young LUCHA activist in Goma, is defiant. “It’s risky to demonstrate given the response of the security agencies. Every time we try to rise up, they beat us down. But that just shows us why we have to keep going at any price,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/05/drop-in-plastic-bags-littering-british-seas-linked-to-introduction-of-5p-charge","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T05:30:40Z","webTitle":"Drop in plastic bags littering British seas linked to introduction of 5p charge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/05/drop-in-plastic-bags-littering-british-seas-linked-to-introduction-of-5p-charge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/05/drop-in-plastic-bags-littering-british-seas-linked-to-introduction-of-5p-charge","fields":{"headline":"Drop in plastic bags littering British seas linked to introduction of 5p charge","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A big drop in plastic bags found in the seas around Britain has been credited to the introduction of charges for plastic bags across Europe. Ireland and Denmark were the first two countries to bring in levies for plastic bags from shops in 2003, followed by slew of other European countries. England was the last UK nation to introduce one, in 2015. In the first such study of its kind, scientists have found an approximately 30% drop in plastic bags on the seabed in a large area from close to Norway and Germany to northern France, and west to Ireland. The authors of the study, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, claim the drop in plastic bag pollution, measured from 2010 – about the mid-point of charging policies coming into force – showed the power of such levies. “The fewer bags we use, the fewer we can lose, the fewer we can put into the environment,” said Thomas Maes of the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, lead author of the paper. “If we all work together towards a better environment, we can make changes. A lot of people live in doom, but … don’t give up yet.” The results could also be used by campaigners for other charges aimed at reducing public problems, such as pollution, obesity, smoking and congestion. The UK is already consulting on a refundable charge for bottles and cans. “These findings have reminded us of one of the fundamentals of policy – incentives matter,” said Robert Colvile of the Centre for Policy Studies, a rightwing thinktank. “When it comes to the environment in particular, pricing in external costs is better than heavy-handed regulation,” he said. Globally around 8m tonnes of plastics enters the marine environment every year – the weight of more than 80 of the largest aircraft carriers. They are blamed for ensnaring sealife and birds, and have been found in the guts of dozens of species. A UK levy of 5p per bag introduced in 2015 has already reduced single-use plastic bags given out by major retailers by 85% – down from 140 to 25 bags for the average person each year. The policy applies only to major retailers, but government is consulting on extending it to almost all shops. The marine pollution study has been trawling the seabed for 25 years, recording the number of items of pollution found in each square kilometre. Two-thirds of all trawls have found at least one item of plastic, and while the number of plastic bags has fallen, other plastic pollution has increased, especially fishing gear."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/apr/05/scientists-suggest-giant-sunshade-in-sky-could-solve-global-warming","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T06:00:41Z","webTitle":"Scientists suggest a giant sunshade in the sky could solve global warming","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/05/scientists-suggest-giant-sunshade-in-sky-could-solve-global-warming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/apr/05/scientists-suggest-giant-sunshade-in-sky-could-solve-global-warming","fields":{"headline":"Scientists suggest a giant sunshade in the sky could solve global warming","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It sounds like the stuff of science fiction: the creation, using balloons or jets, of a manmade atmospheric sunshade to shield the most vulnerable countries in the global south against the worst effects of global warming. But amid mounting interest in “solar geoengineering” – not least among western universities – a group of scientists from developing countries has issued a forceful call to have a greater say in the direction of research into climate change, arguing that their countries are the ones with most at stake. Scientists have long known that manmade events like pollution in the atmosphere, smoke from forest fires and volcanic eruptions can create a cooling effect. That has led scientists at Harvard University to propose their own experiment, which they call “stratospheric controlled perturbation effect”, or SCoPEx for short. It involves using a balloon to test the controversial proposition that aerosols released at a height of 20km in the Earth’s atmosphere can alter the reflective properties of cloud cover. Now a dozen scholars, from countries including Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Ethiopia, India, Jamaica and Thailand, have joined the debate, arguing in the journal Nature that poor countries should take a lead in the field since they have most to gain or lose from the technology. The cooling effect has long been known in phenomena such as “ship tracks” – narrow artificial clouds of pollution, created by emissions from ships, that contain more and smaller water droplets than typical clouds, making them brighter and more reflective of sunlight. “Solar geoengineering – injecting aerosol particles into the stratosphere to reflect away a little inbound sunlight – is being discussed as a way to cool the planet, fast,” the scientists write in Nature. “Solar geoengineering is outlandish and unsettling. It invokes technologies that are redolent of science fiction – jets lacing the stratosphere with sunlight-blocking particles, and fleets of ships spraying seawater into low-lying clouds to make them whiter and brighter to reflect sunlight. “Yet, if such approaches could be realised technically and politically, they could slow, stop or even reverse the rise in global temperatures within one or two years. “The technique is controversial, and rightly so,” they add. “It is too early to know what its effects would be: it could be very helpful or very harmful. Developing countries have most to gain or lose. In our view, they must maintain their climate leadership and play a central part in research and discussions around solar geoengineering.” In an interview with Reuters, Dr Atiq Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies and the article’s lead author, amplified his arguments. “Clearly [solar radiation management geoengineering] could be dangerous, but we need to know whether, for countries like Bangladesh, it would be more or less risky than passing the 1.5C warming goal. This matters greatly to people from developing countries and our voices need to be heard. “The overall idea [of solar geoengineering] is pretty crazy, but it is gradually taking root in the world of research,” said Rahman. The solar geoengineering studies may be helped by a new $400,000 (£284,100) research project, the solar radiation management governance initiative (SRMGI), which is issuing a first call for scientists to apply for finance this week. The initiative is financed by the Open Philanthropy Project, a foundation backed by Dustin Moskovitz, a co-founder of Facebook, and his wife, Cari Tuna. The fund could help scientists in developing nations study the regional impacts of solar geoengineering, for instance on droughts, floods or monsoons, said Andy Parker, a co-author and project director of the SRMGI. Rahman said the academics were not taking sides about whether geoengineering would work. And not everyone is convinced by the prospect of the technology. In a leaked draft of a report about global warming due for publication in October, a UN panel of climate experts express scepticism about solar geoengineering, suggesting it may be “economically, socially and institutionally infeasible”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/09/can-you-solve-it-the-hipster-bicycle-race","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T06:10:51Z","webTitle":"Can you solve it?

Antonio Lopez was a brilliant Puerto Rican fashion illustrator whose drawing skill was admired and envied by David Hockney and Andy Warhol. He was also, by all accounts, a beautiful and charismatic man, a party animal, a superb dancer, a wonderfully generous friend, and a keen-eyed professional who launched the modelling careers of Jessica Lange, Grace Jones and Jerry Hall. He died of Aids in 1995. People are queuing up in this film to praise him, and yet there was sadness and darkness in his career and perhaps in fashion generally. The film suggests that he left New York for Paris at the end of the 60s because of racism at American Vogue. But this important charge is not followed up. Then we learn, from the emotional testimony of late photographer Bill Cunningham, that when Lopez was gravely ill with mounting medical bills, his supposed friend and colleague Karl Lagerfeld refused to help. Then Oscar de la Renta stepped in and this was forgotten about. So Lopez arguably faced a certain amount of prejudice and even cruelty, but these issues are finally passed over, because of the film’s evident reluctance to criticise the fashion world. Everything has to be celebratory. Perhaps there is another more complex film to be made about Antonio Lopez."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/05/a-quiet-place-review-john-krasinski-emily-blunt","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T14:30:50Z","webTitle":"A Quiet Place review – silence never sounded so terrifying","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/05/a-quiet-place-review-john-krasinski-emily-blunt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/05/a-quiet-place-review-john-krasinski-emily-blunt","fields":{"headline":"A Quiet Place review – silence never sounded so terrifying","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If ever a film had me mentally tiptoeing over a booby-trapped carpet of eggshells while silently gibbering with anxiety, it’s this brutal sci-fi suspense thriller, written by horror specialists Scott Beck and Bryan Woods and directed by John Krasinski, who developed the screenplay with them and stars – alongside Emily Blunt. It’s set in a postapocalyptic wasteland. But this isn’t a young adult drama, it’s a prematurely old adult drama, a world in which innocence, childhood and happiness have been blowtorched off the face of the Earth. There has been some sort of ecological disaster or invasion and now all of humanity, or at any rate everyone in this indeterminate part of the United States, lives in fear of giant reptile predators who stalk the land. The thing is, they’re blind but have advanced hearing. So, as long as you can keep silent all the time, in a 24/7 hyper-alert state of anticipation, you’re all right. But making the slightest noise brings them out, doing everything but sniff the air, like a horrible mix of Ridley Scott’s Alien, Steven Spielberg’s T rex and Robert Helpmann’s Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Krasinski and Blunt play Lee and Evelyn, a couple who now run an efficient Trappist-survivalist smallholding in the countryside, while making regular forays into the devastated town for supplies. We get the time-honoured scenes in the ruined supermarket, and that weird frisson of seeing stuff that you could just take if you wanted, but who cares now that consumerist law and order has utterly broken down? One of their kids wants to take a toy model of the space shuttle Challenger (poignantly yearning for a rocket to take them all away from this ruined planet) but Lee fixes him with a bayonet gaze of disapproval, while grabbing this unexploded noise-bomb and silently removing the batteries. That thing’s too dangerous. Their son, Marcus (Noah Jupe), and daughter, Regan (Millicent Simmonds), are well drilled in the new soundless, wordless discipline and the point is that Regan is hearing impaired, so the whole family has already had to learn sign language to communicate. Lee has even got his soldering iron out and tinkered with adapting a new hearing aid for her. It is Regan’s disability that has enabled the family to cope – an elegant narrative contrivance from Beck and Woods. Yet, as the story continues, there is a new challenge. Evelyn is pregnant, and now the adults must wonder how she is going to have the baby without modern anaesthetic and without making a sound. A world of horror is on the way. A Quiet Place allows you to worry at a strange thought: might it be possible to live life entirely safely and even normally in this situation, if you could somehow mentally train yourself, or evolve over a few generations, to do without sound? Might this be a workable, natural mode of existence? Could you internalise the fear and remain silent to avoid the predators in the way that you might naturally change your habits in some locales to avoid bears or snakes? Lee and Evelyn’s family have developed a habit of joining hands before they eat their meals. Perhaps this was what they used to do before saying grace, or perhaps they have started doing it now. In fact, there are certain circumstances in which they are allowed to make a moderate amount of sound, and they have war-gamed out certain situations in which the production of sound might help them in an all-out confrontation with the beasts. But the point is that suppressing noise makes them yearn for it, not simply as a kind of human expression but an entirely rational howl of rage or horror or despair at what is happening. The movie shows that suicide-by-scream is an open-ended possibility. In its simplicity and punch, this is a film that feels as if it could have been made decades ago, in the classic age of Planet of the Apes or The Omega Man. It is a cracking back-to-basics thriller that does not depend too much on what these creatures look like. Krasinski rather cleverly addresses this issue by keeping them glimpsed only subliminally at first, but then, without giving any clearer idea of what they look like, we graduate to a surreally extreme close-up of the beast’s hideous, undulating ear. A satanically sensitive orifice. This story was amended on 7 April 2018 to correct the name of the character played by Millicent Simmonds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/05/camelot-profits-surge-as-money-for-good-causes-declines-pac-report","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T23:01:32Z","webTitle":"National lottery profits surge as good causes garner less – MPs report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/05/camelot-profits-surge-as-money-for-good-causes-declines-pac-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/05/camelot-profits-surge-as-money-for-good-causes-declines-pac-report","fields":{"headline":"National lottery profits surge as good causes garner less – MPs report","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The government’s Gambling Commission should pressure Camelot to change the way it runs the national lottery to ensure more money goes to good causes amid rising profits for the company, a cross-party committee of MPs has said. The current lottery licence, which runs until 2023, is overly long and too inflexible, the public accounts committee (PAC) said in a report, making it hard to respond to consumer changes which had seen incomes for good causes drop by 15% in a year. In the longer term, the report found, while money for charitable causes raised by the lottery had climbed by 2% between 2009-10 and 2016-17, over the same period Camelot’s profits increased by 122%, from £39m to £71m. The PAC has made a series of recommendations, including that the Gambling Commission take steps to seek “a fair return” for good causes, and that the next national lottery licence is sufficiently flexible to guarantee this. It has also urged Camelot to do more to support gambling addiction education, warning that the low stakes for the lottery and scratchcards were appealing for many teenagers, and could herald the beginning of problem gambling. “Raising money for good causes is one of the founding principles of the national lottery but this objective is under threat,” said Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the PAC. “It would be a sad and significant loss to many deserving organisations and individuals if that funding, which has amounted to some £37bn since 1994, should dissipate as a result of inaction now. “Our report lays bare the need for a concerted effort from government, the Gambling Commission and Camelot – a monopoly supplier whose profits more than doubled in seven years while returns for good causes grew by just 2%.” Camelot has operated the national lottery since it launched in 1994, and is now in its third licence, agreed in 2009. This was amended in 2012, with the end date extended by four years to 2023. Under the renewed licence, Camelot’s profits were now about 1% of sales after tax, rather than the level of 0.6% expected by the Gambling Commission, which told the MPs the new terms had, in hindsight, been too favourable to Camelot. Reasons identified in the PAC report for the 15% drop in the money handed to good causes in the year to March 2017 included a fall in overall lottery sales, and a parallel shift away from people buying draw tickets towards scratchcards. While the draw-based games raise 30p in the pound for good causes, this falls to 10p for scratchcards, the report said. However, the Gambling Commission has no way to amend Camelot’s licence to take account of such changes. The report recommends that the Gambling Commission should evaluate whether changes made by Camelot intended to boost participation in the draws, such as more lottery balls and changes to jackpots, had brought any benefits. The PAC also raises the possibility that the decline in the amount of lottery proceeds channelled into worthwhile causes could further depress participation, recommending better communication about the link between the level of contributions from various types of games. While Camelot had increased its annual contribution to GambleAware from £190,000 to £300,000 to support measures to combat problem gambling, the report said this “falls well short of expectations”. A Camelot spokeswoman said the company would work with the Gambling Commission and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to maximise the money spent on good causes. She said: “During the third licence period, annual returns to good causes have been, on average, 30% higher than under the previous licence. “We’ve already seen some encouraging signs that the initiatives from the strategic review that we carried out last summer are working, and are confident that we have strong plans to get the national lottery back into growth.” A spokeswoman for the Gambling Commission said: “We are extremely disappointed that returns to good causes have declined and we will continue to hold Camelot to account for the performance of the national lottery. “Over the past 12 months, we have required it to carry out a review of the effectiveness of its board. We have also strengthened our approach to assessing [Camelot’s] performance.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/10/sri-lanka-opens-door-for-return-of-divisive-former-president-mahinda-rajapaksa","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T04:00:17Z","webTitle":"Sri Lanka opens door for return of divisive former president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/sri-lanka-opens-door-for-return-of-divisive-former-president-mahinda-rajapaksa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/10/sri-lanka-opens-door-for-return-of-divisive-former-president-mahinda-rajapaksa","fields":{"headline":"Sri Lanka opens door for return of divisive former president","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A familiar face is back on walls across Sri Lanka. The country’s former president Mahinda Rajapaksa has been grinning from thousands of posters and billboards recently, palms pressed together in gratitude. Voters delivered a shock repudiation of Rajapaksa’s government three years ago, as the UN investigated war crimes against Tamil civilians, dissidents disappeared in unmarked white vans and warnings were issued that Sri Lankan democracy was at risk. In February, however, they gave the Buddhist nationalist leader’s new party a surprise victory in local government elections. With polls for parliament and the presidency scheduled for two years’ time, the result has reaffirmed Rajapaksa as Sri Lanka’s most popular politician, and raised hopes among his supporters – and fears in others – that he may yet return to power. The Rajapaksa-led opposition forced a no-confidence motion in parliament against the prime minister, Ranil Wickremasinghe, last week. It failed, but Wickremasinghe was criticised by several of his own ministers during the debate, widening cracks in the already fragile coalition government that turfed Rajapsaksa from office in 2015. “We are heading towards a snap election,” said Namal Rajapaksa, an MP and the former president’s son and heir apparent. “The future of the coalition government is going to be very unstable. The president and the prime minister have no other option.” Campaign ads in the run-up to the February polls were stark. “Remember when winning a rugby match was punishable by death?” asked one United National party flyer, in reference to a murder allegedly linked to the Rajapaksa family. “Remember when white vans were a symbol of terror and repression?” The resurgence of a leader with such heavy baggage is less surprising to close observers of Sri Lankan politics. “Rajapaksa never went away,” said Alan Keenan, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group. “His shadow has loomed over this government, literally from the first day.” It took an unlikely coalition to unseat Rajapaksa from the presidency in 2015. Appalled by a leader they regarded as breathtakingly corrupt and increasingly authoritarian, defectors from his own party forged an alliance with members of the opposition, campaigning on a unity platform of reviving civil society and tackling corruption. In power, however, longtime political enemies have struggled to work together, finding they are united by little more than antipathy toward the former president. “The relationship between the president and prime minister is as bad as it could be,” Keenan said. To win over minorities such as the Tamils, the current president, Maithripala Sirisena, promised to implement tough reforms, including to devolve power to regional governments, pursue the cases of those who disappeared during the Rajapaksa years, and reform the constitution to ensure no president could accrue the power of his predecessor. Commentators in Colombo agree too much of that agenda has been shirked by a government afraid of challenging Buddhist nationalist sentiment in the country, and kicking off a wave of rightwing anger that could lift Rajapaksa and his family back into office. Less lofty issues have also sapped the government’s support. The price of staples such as onions, fish and coconuts has increased steeply, while a decision to remove an uneconomical fertiliser subsidy has burned the agricultural sector, which still employs nearly one in three Sri Lankans. “Mahinda looked after us,” said Gamaga Nona, a paddy and banana farmer in Madilla, a village on Sri Lanka’s south coast. Fertiliser was eight times cheaper under the Rajapaksa government, she said, and the change has nearly halved the annual profit of her family farm. “Now the fertiliser is delayed and sometimes we never get it.” KA Karunanapala, another southern farmer, worries about Chinese influence in the region. The Sirasena government agreed last December to lease a new port in Hambantota to a Chinese state-owned corporation for 99 years. It was intended to help pay back about $8bn in Chinese money borrowed by the Rajapaksa government, but has provoked a furious backlash. “What does [Sirisena] do for us, other than going around trying to sell our assets?” Karunanapala asked. Civil society groups in Colombo acknowledge a pall has lifted since 2015. Newspapers that once laboured under official censorship, or the kind enforced by military vehicles parked outside journalists’ homes at night, now print boisterous criticism of the government. Human rights groups chased out ten years ago are re-establishing offices in the city. People are breathing more easily, said Asoka Obeyesekere, a barrister and director of the local chapter of Transparency International. “Civil society are not fearing for their lives anymore.” Namal Rajapaksa calls the allegations of corruption and violence that dogged his father “well planned, well executed propaganda”. “We are looking for a fresh start,” he said. “We will correct our mistakes and look for a broader relationship with our neighbours.” His party would seek a clean slate with western governments, he said, but added that continuing to participate in a UN security council investigation into the final months of the civil war – in which about 40,000 Tamil civilians may have been killed – would need to be “looked into more deeply”. “Any war will have casualties, we won’t deny that,” Rajapaksa said. “But at the end of the day what matters is the future.” That future is still uncertain for the family. Their party won about 45% of the vote in the local government elections, the largest share in the country, but not enough to win an outright parliamentary or presidential majority. Should opposition groups find a way to paper over their differences, and unite as they did in 2015, they may still have the numbers to keep the Rajapaksas out. “The local government results showed no other political force in the country can shine on their own,” Obeyesekere said. “Really the only way to have any strength is in unity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/08/im-dying-a-slow-death-hazara-refugees-plead-for-release-from-nauru","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T23:03:02Z","webTitle":"'I'm dying a slow death': Hazara refugees plead for release from Nauru","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/08/im-dying-a-slow-death-hazara-refugees-plead-for-release-from-nauru","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/08/im-dying-a-slow-death-hazara-refugees-plead-for-release-from-nauru","fields":{"headline":"'I'm dying a slow death': Hazara refugees plead for release from Nauru","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“I constantly take sleeping tablets because being awake is too hard,” says Narges. “I understand that as a 27-year-old woman, the Australian Border Force considers me an independent. However, this is not the case in our culture and therefore life without my mother is meaningless for me.” Narges and her brother, Daryoush, currently languishing on Nauru, have not seen their mother and sister since 2014, despite multiple officials strongly and repeatedly recommending they be reunited. The family of four are Hazara refugees from Afghanistan. They arrived in Australia in 2013 after travelling through Pakistan and Indonesia, and were sent to the offshore processing centre in Nauru. All have refugee status from the Nauruan government. But in August 2014 their mother was transferred to Darwin for urgent medical care, and only one of the three siblings was allowed to join her two weeks later. The family has been separated ever since. The mother and sister cannot apply for US settlement unless they return to Nauru, but the mother’s health won’t allow her to. Narges and her brother have both suffered mentally and physically after the separation. Narges has self-harmed and attempted suicide. Both have been diagnosed with illnesses including severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Narges has had an ear infection for two years, which she says has not been properly treated and is now affecting her hearing. Daryoush was supposed to go to Papua New Guinea for medical treatment but refused to leave his sister. Both have been repeatedly recommended for family reunification by the numerous service providers that are paid by the Australian government to take care of them. Guardian Australia has seen multiple reports from the health contractor, International Health and Medical Services (IHMS), which include regular and repeated recommendations for the urgent reunification of the family on the basis of severe mental health issues. “Narges continues to experience significant situational stress because of her separation from her mother,” said a 2014 report. “She is continually being reviewed by the mental health team and is provided guidance on how to try to cope and manage the great deal of stress. The psychiatrist’s recommendation for Narges is to be transferred to Australia and reunited with her family, as a matter of priority.” A 2015 report said: “IHMS psychiatrist recommends for the family to be reunified, as the family needs to be together for the sake of the mental health of the brother and sister.” And in 2016: “The IHMS psychiatrist involved in her care has provided several reports stating Ms Narges remain at risk of further deterioration, which was proven by an incident of Ms Narges’ attempt to self-harm by means of overdosing.” Guardian Australia understands further reports in 2017 and 2018 continue to outline the diminishing health of the siblings and recommend they join their family in Australia. Narges is believed to be the only Hazara woman on Nauru. She and her brother live in the notoriously mouldy, hot and ill-equipped tent accommodation inside what used to be called a detention centre. “Where I am living is not adequate and healthy, even for animals,” she says. “If I was in Kabul, I might be killed once, but on Nauru, I am dying a slow death every day. Separation from my country – Afghanistan – is much easier than separation from my mother. I sincerely believe that reuniting with my mother can save my life, and humbly ask for consideration of my critical state.” Narges and Daryoush have written to the various service providers contracted throughout their detention more than a dozen times. These include Transfield Services, Canstruct, Save the Children and Australian Border Force (ABF). “My mother needs our help, our support because she is sitting on the wheelchair,” wrote Narges in March. “She has a lot of pain; also she is emotionally under pressure. I ask to you what kind of treatment is this? How can a sick person get better when suffering from separation of family?” At least six replies that have been seen by Guardian Australia acknowledge receipt of their letters but provide no solution. One, from ABF in January of this year, bluntly told Daryoush to stop contacting them until he can come up with “substantive new issues”. Narges says ABF has told her that reunification is in fact possible – if her mother returns to Nauru. That has been determined by doctors as highly unlikely, given Nasreen’s condition. She is confined to a wheelchair with spinal conditions that have left her “profoundly disabled”, and is awaiting surgery. At least part of her condition stems from injuries sustained when she was severely beaten in Afghanistan while trying to shield her son. There are numerous cases of family separations enforced by the Australian government which, when it can be convinced to transfer someone for medical care to Australia, will almost never allow family to come with them. “The government is well aware that this practice harms people, especially vulnerable women and children, but they persist with it in the face of all the evidence,” the human rights lawyer, George Newhouse, says. The Australian government also shows a consistent refusal to act on advice from its service providers. In 2016 it was revealed a young woman, a rape victim, was left on Nauru for months despite recommendations from every authority on the island – including its government. “I’ve seen case after case where government officials simply turn a blind eye to expert advice that indicates that family members are at risk of real harm and even death because of government inaction, and yet they ignore that advice,” says Newhouse. Newhouse says the government must “urgently” fill the still vacant role of chief medical officer at ABF, held for two years by Dr John Brayley until September. “At least when they have a medical practitioner in that role there was someone advocating for the health and welfare of asylum seekers on the inside.” In Sydney on Saturday, more than 400 doctors and medical students rallied against detention, and against the lack of response from government to their concerns. The protest was organised by the peak body for medical students, Australian Medical Students’ Association, which called for an end to “unacceptable and inhumane” offshore processing, and for independent health assessments of refugees and asylum seekers. IHMS were contacted for this story but all questions were referred to the Department of Home Affairs, which said it does not comment on individual cases. The office of the minister, Peter Dutton, did not respond to questions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2018/apr/04/wonder-woman-lynda-carter-hollywood-star","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T09:18:47Z","webTitle":"TV's Wonder Woman Lynda Carter honoured with Hollywood star","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2018/apr/04/wonder-woman-lynda-carter-hollywood-star","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2018/apr/04/wonder-woman-lynda-carter-hollywood-star","fields":{"headline":"TV's Wonder Woman Lynda Carter honoured with Hollywood star","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"TV’s original Wonder Woman, Lynda Carter, has been honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and the 66-year-old actor addressed speculation she may make a cameo in the forthcoming Wonder Woman 2 movie sequel along the way. Carter posted pictures from the ceremony on social media, thanking fans and saying: “It seems impossible that I’ve been in the entertainment industry for 50 years. But I love this business. I love the creative process, the work, the performing ... all of it.” Carter was Wonder Woman on television between 1975 and 1979 and said of the star: “It will be here for ever, and maybe it needs to say Wonder Woman. Hopefully this character and I will live on in the memories of people.” Interviewed before the ceremony by Variety magazine, Carter said of any role in the new Wonder Woman movie: “I’m just going to leave it up to the universe and Patty.” Director Patty Jenkins, who was at the ceremony, said: “It’s quite incredible to become a part of the story with someone I admire as much as I do Lynda. As the years have gone on, I’ve come to admire that she carried that same spirit into her personal life as well.” “It was Lynda’s portrayal of Wonder Woman that made me fall in love with her, because her Wonder Woman made me believe that I could have whatever I wanted, and even more importantly, it made me unashamed to want it.” The two have been in touch since Jenkins first took the role of directing Wonder Woman for the big screen, and the director says that from the first time they spoke on the phone they could finish each other’s sentences, and have exchanged “some incredibly funny texts since then”.The current Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot, also paid tribute on social media to her predecessor, tweeting: “Congrats my beloved beautiful Lynda Carter. Thank you for your loving kindness shared by the sisterhood of women of wonder.” Carter had some words in support of Hollywood’s #MeToo movement as well, saying: “The #MeToo movement is strong and I give everything to this generation. What my generation can do is support you. We’ve been screaming the same thing but it took this generation of women to make the difference.” “Most women have been hit on, and being hit on is different than assault, and it is different if you’re being pressured because you are a subordinate or you’re being drugged. I’m not saying that you need to be assaulted to have a hand up for #MeToo. If you are super uncomfortable and got yourself in your situation, you get yourself out. And if you see that guy coming, you warn other people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/04/chemical-weapons-watchdog-meets-russian-spy-poisoning-salisbury-sergei-skripal","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T12:49:20Z","webTitle":"Russia must cooperate with chemical weapons watchdog, says EU","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/04/chemical-weapons-watchdog-meets-russian-spy-poisoning-salisbury-sergei-skripal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/04/chemical-weapons-watchdog-meets-russian-spy-poisoning-salisbury-sergei-skripal","fields":{"headline":"Russia must cooperate with chemical weapons watchdog, says EU","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russia must start cooperating with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons’ investigation into the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Salisbury, the European Union and the UK have declared at an emergency session of the global watchdog. “It is imperative that the Russian Federation responds to the British government’s legitimate questions, begins to cooperate with the OPCW secretariat, and provides full and complete disclosure to the OPCW,” the EU said. Wednesday’s emergency meeting of the 41-strong executive in the Hague was called by Russia, which wants to challenge the way British scientists handled samples in the case and to secure an agreement that Russian scientists should be directly involved in testing them. Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were attacked with a nerve agent on 4 March, setting off a bitter dispute between Russia and the UK government, which has said the only “plausible explanation” is that Russia is to blame. Russia has been mounting a diplomatic counter-offensive, demanding that its scientists be involved in investigating the sample. On Wednesday the UK’s acting representative to the OPCW, John Rollo, accused Russia of challenging the impartiality of the OPCW secretariat. “There is no requirement in the chemical weapons convention for a victim to engage a likely perpetrator in a joint investigation,” he said. “To do so would be perverse”. In a powerfully worded statement, Rollo said the insistence that Russian experts participate in the inquiry suggested Russia was nervous about what the results would show. Its response to legitimate British inquiries about what had happened in Salisbury had been characterised by disdain, contempt and sarcasm, he added. On Tuesday the chief executive of the government’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), Gary Aitkenhead, said British scientists had identified the nerve agent used as novichok but were not able to identify the precise source. Aitkenhead also said it had not been DSTL’s role to identify the source of the nerve agent, which was seized on by Russia, which demanded an apology from the British and said a vital part of its evidence had been undermined. Russia’s spymaster Sergei Naryshkin described the poisoning as a “grotesque provocation crudely staged by the British and US intelligence agencies”. UK officials, thrown on the defensive by the way Aitkenhead’s statement appeared, said it was not just science but UK intelligence sources that led the government to ascribe responsibility to Russia. Britain will have been buoyed by the EU’s strong statement of support at the OPCW. The EU said it had full confidence in the British investigation and lauded the UK’s collaboration with the OPCW technical secretariat. It said it still believed it was highly likely Russia was responsible for the poison attack and that there was no other plausible explanation. The UK has built a strong diplomatic alliance against Russia, and British officials will be relieved that it appeared only a quarter of the OPCW executive were willing to back Russia’s demand for involvement. Nevertheless, the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, was facing embarrassing questions over a direct reference he made to Russia producing the nerve agent, after it emerged that the Foreign Office had deleted a tweet blaming Moscow for the attack. He was already under pressure over his remarks to a German broadcaster that a Porton Down scientist had been “absolutely categorical” that the novichok had originated in Russia. It emerged on Wednesday that the Foreign Office had earlier deleted a tweet claiming British scientists had concluded that the nerve agent was “produced in Russia”. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said Johnson “seems to have completely exceeded the information that he had been given”, while the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said she hoped Labour would get some credit for taking a careful view of Russia’s responsibility. The OPCW is the internationally recognised body responsible for overseeing the 1997 chemical weapons convention, and has been testing samples provided by British scientists and taken from the Skripals. Britain sent the OPCW samples of the nerve agent within days of the attack, and results of the organisation’s tests are expected within days. Alexander Shulgin, Russia’s permanent representative to the OPCW, has complained that Russian scientists have been barred from being involved in the tests after British objections. The OPCW is not able to ascribe responsibility for the attack, but identification of the nerve agent as novichok by the OPCW, the premier relevant multilateral body, would shore up the UK’s position – backed by an international diplomatic alliance – that Russian state forces were involved in the attack. Russia insists it destroyed its entire chemical weapons stock. If the dispute over the nature of the Salisbury nerve agent reaches deadlock, Russia could withdraw from the OPCW, which would be a severe blow to global efforts to control chemical weapons. Russia has already challenged OPCW findings about Syrian government responsibility for chemical weapons attacks on Syrian civilians. Despite the political battle, the eventual OPCW report on the samples will be largely technical in nature, confirming the agent used and possibly establishing what method of synthesis was used, how the material was administered or disseminated and what kind of chemical signatures were involved."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/05/german-court-says-carles-puigdemont-can-be-released-on-bail","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T18:10:04Z","webTitle":"German court says Carles Puigdemont can be released on bail","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/05/german-court-says-carles-puigdemont-can-be-released-on-bail","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/05/german-court-says-carles-puigdemont-can-be-released-on-bail","fields":{"headline":"German court says Carles Puigdemont can be released on bail","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A court in northern Germany has ruled that the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont can be released on bail while extradition proceedings continue. The district court in Schleswig set bail for the 55-year-old at €75,000 (£66,000). Puigdemont was arrested on a Spanish-issued warrant upon entering Germany on 25 March as he attempted to drive from Finland to Belgium, where he currently resides. Spain accuses the Catalan separatist of rebellion and corruption after he organised an unsanctioned independence referendum. The Schleswig court said that it considered a charge of misuse of public funds sufficient grounds for an extradition, but that a charge of “rebellion” was not, because the comparable German charge of treason specifies violence. Proceedings to decide whether to extradite him on corruption charges could continue, it said. “There is a risk of flight,” the court said in its explanation of its decision to grant bail. “But since extradition on rebellion charges is impermissible, the risk of flight is substantially lessened.” Puigdemont has written an open letter from prison, urging Catalonia’s parliament to make another attempt to elect jailed separatist activist Jordi Sànchez as the region’s president. Puigdemont had proposed Sànchez as his number two in the Together for Catalonia party last month, but Spain’s supreme court refused to free him to attend a parliamentary session. Sànchez said in a letter from a Madrid jail published on Thursday that he was ready to try again to be elected.

The day after two further murders in Hackney, east London, Victor Olisa, the Met’s former head of diversity and head of policing in Tottenham, said he feared that the violence could get worse. He warned that budget cuts and new demands on police were taking officers off the street and away from gathering intelligence. “Communities are saying we don’t see the police around any more,” he said. “It appears to people I have spoken to as though the police have lost control of public spaces and the streets.” Olisa said Met chiefs should have been more visible after this week’s rise in violence. “The silence from senior officers in the Met is deafening,” he said. “They should say we need more information from the public; this is what we are doing; this is what the results are.” On Thursday, the Met’s commander, Cressida Dick, attempted to take control of the crisis by launching a taskforce of 120 officers and telling the public: “You will see us being even more proactive out on the streets.” But Olisa said that wider cuts were making police officers’ jobs harder. “You don’t have as many officers available to patrol or spend time in public spaces as you did five years ago. There is less time to build conversation lines so you can get information back.” The retired officer was speaking as investigations began into two more killings in the capital, taking the suspected murder toll in London to more than 50 in three months. On Wednesday an 18-year-old man, named as Israel Ogunsola, collapsed in the street after being stabbed and a man aged 53 died after a betting shop fight. On Thursday night, reports emerged that two more people were in hospital after a stabbing attack in east London. Olisa’s intervention was the latest in a week of fierce exchanges over the factors behind the increase in violence in London. They come against a backdrop of sustained reductions in policing numbers. By September 2017, the number of officers in England and Wales was down by 16%, against a 2009 peak, amounting to a cut of more than 22,000 officers. Figures released in November showed a 20% annual rise in gun, knife and serious violent crime across England and Wales, even as the crime survey estimated there had been a 9% overall drop in crime. The Home Office claims that “traditional crime” nationwide has dropped by almost 40% since 2010. Such is the demand on the Met, it is drafting in detectives from another force to investigate the latest murder. The force said on Thursday that City of London police would investigate one of two east London murders committed on Wednesday and had made an arrest. With the murder rate in the capital such that the total for the year could reach levels last seen in 2005, when there were 181 killings, the two new murder investigations prompted Dick to make her first comments of the week on the subject. “We will put even more effort into bearing down on violent crime,” she said. “We will have a greater presence in the hotspots of violence and a focused effort, including intelligence-led stop and search and the use of specialists in covert tactics.” But critics fear that the commissioner’s initiative is a short-term measure. Met chiefs accept that “supression activity” is not enough to tackle knife and gun crime. This week in the capital two teenagers were gunned down in Tottenham and Walthamstow, while others were stabbed to death or were knifed but survived. Next week, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, is expected to announce a new government anti-violence strategy concerning interventions to deter young boys from offending. Olisa, who retired at the rank of chief superintendent, led policing in north London after the 2011 riots. He said austerity and longstanding tensions around social inequality were again playing a part, as well as the rise of aggressive taunting on social media. “There are frustrations building up because people feel lack of control of their destiny,” he said. “There are no youth clubs, young people feel they had no access to the wealth they see that others have, there is a bigger divide between the haves and the have nots, the frustrations are building up. It could lead to a public display of anger.” He argued that the shooting of Mark Duggan in 2011, which led to the riots, had “brought up residual anger”. He said that when, in 2013, he became head of policing in Haringey, an area including Tottenham, there were six officers to every council ward in London. Now there were two. “We can’t find something to control or mitigate it,” he said. “You’ll never totally stop it. The level of violence seems ridiculously high. My worry is that it is a trend that will end up far worse than where we are at the moment.” In Hackney, people were stunned by the latest violence. Ogunsola, a student who had recently returned home to live with his parents, died about half an hour after being stabbed, despite the efforts of a police, paramedics and a trauma doctor from London’s air ambulance. “The policewoman’s arms were literally covered in blood, you could see she had been trying to fight for this man’s life,” said one witness to the aftermath, who declined to give her name. “People were just coming all night, just crying and breaking down in tears.” As mourners gathered at the cordon surrounding the police forensic science tent on Thursday morning, the political argument over the violence deepened, with David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, accusing ministers of abdicating responsibility and police of failing to tackle organised crime. Lammy told the BBC: “What we’re seeing today is the worst I’ve ever seen it. There are parents, friends, families, schools traumatised and grieving. And there is absolutely no sign at the moment of reduction in the violence.” He said there was no single cause for the crisis, but turf wars over drugs were a big factor. “It’s like Deliveroo, they’re as prolific as ordering a pizza,” he said. “You can get them on Snapchat, WhatsApp. That is driving the turf war and it’s driving the culture of violence that’s now becoming endemic.” Meanwhile two 17-year-old boys were arrested on suspicion of murder. Ogunsola had been charged with causing actual bodily harm, dangerous driving without a licence, having no insurance and being in possession of cannabis after an incident in Stevenage in November that left a police officer with a head injury. A friend of the teenager said he had been a student at the University of Hertfordshire, in Stevenage, but had recently returned home to live with his parents. “Israel was a nice person,” said a 19-year-old, who gave her name as Petronel, as she stood by the police tape in Morning Lane. She said she had last seen him the previous day, when she had heard he was back in London. “I hugged him, thinking that I might just see him again tomorrow.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/05/bryony-frost-grand-national-milansbar","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T17:32:25Z","webTitle":"Bryony Frost: ‘The Grand National has lived in my family since I opened my eyes’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/05/bryony-frost-grand-national-milansbar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/05/bryony-frost-grand-national-milansbar","fields":{"headline":"Bryony Frost: ‘The Grand National has lived in my family since I opened my eyes’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“You’ve got to go in there all guns blazing,” says Bryony Frost, outlining her approach to next week’s Grand National, confounding any chauvinists who thought this young woman might prefer quietly popping round at the back for her first attempt at the famous race. “You can’t say, ‘We’re just trying to get round.’ That’s not my job, my job is to fill my horse with confidence, fill my team with confidence and keep kicking.” The 22-year-old Frost brought a similarly attacking attitude to a schooling session here, where she cleared six Grand National-style fences on her mount for next week’s race, Milansbar. The horse has never been to Aintree, so she wanted to know how he would react to the different look of spruce-covered obstacles and since this was only the second time she had sat on him, she wanted to find out how he will cope with meeting a fence on a bad stride. All went smoothly and the spruce was hardly ruffled. When Frost asked for a big one, Milansbar came up readily for her. But he was clever enough to fit in a short stride at the final fence when taking a flier would have been too ambitious, not to say dangerous. Frost was well pleased. “I’d rather a horse back off these fences than take them on. Those are the intelligent ones.” She likened Milansbar to Pacha Du Polder, who gave her an enjoyable spin over the Aintree fences to be fourth in last year’s Foxhunters. “Pacha didn’t hit one last year. They know where they’re at, they know their scope and they know their limit. As long as you’ve got the revs up, they can change their stride.” But even if we take the jumping for granted, Frost has a tightrope to walk with her tactics on Milansbar. Somehow in the National’s 40-runner field she must find a bit of space for this veteran who doesn’t like to be crowded. He is a frontrunner who has been recently enlivened by blinkers but Frost must conserve his stamina for four and a quarter miles. How will she do it? “The main aim is, get in a pocket, if you can find one. Get in a rhythm, because rhythm wins races, especially in those marathon races. And you’ve got to find luck.” This first attempt on the National means a great deal to Frost, whose father, Jimmy, rode Little Polveir to win the race in 1989. The VHS tape of the BBC’s coverage that day has seen plenty of use. “It’s a race that has lived in my family since I opened my eyes,” Frost said. “It runs through my blood. “There’s something about these marathon races, when you get on a horse and you’re galloping for nine minutes solid, going over fences like this, there’s a sort of partnership you don’t get normally with them. It’s where I’m happiest. When you get an opportunity to ride in it, it’s allowing you to have a buzz that you don’t get from anywhere else.” The National also has a special resonance for Milansbar’s owner, Robert Bothway, a semi-retired Norfolk farmer who says his cousin’s father-in-law owned the 1959 winner, Oxo. Neil King, trainer of Milansbar, says it is “terribly exciting” to have a runner in the Aintree race. If King has one regret, it is that he has run the horse four times already this year, having believed he would not make the cut for the National, which now looks a formality.

The deal was announced Thursday by the city and the Islamic community. Baher Azmy, legal director of Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), told a news conference that the agreement ensures the NYPD will act legally as an increasingly empowered Muslim community asserts its rights. The agreement resolved a 2012 suit in Newark, New Jersey, after the Associated Press revealed how the NYPD infiltrated Muslim student groups and put informants in mosques to try to prevent terrorist attacks. The AP reported that the effort crossed into New Jersey, where the department collected intelligence on ordinary people at mosques, restaurants and schools starting in 2002. The surveillance extended across at least 20 mosques, 14 restaurants, 11 shops, two schools and two Muslim student groups in New Jersey alone. By the NYPD’s own admission the blanket surveillance failed to produce a single intelligence lead. “There is no reason a police officer should be scribbling notes on little girls attending school, or noting what type of clothes someone wore to a store. This was not lawful policing, it was blatant discrimination against innocent Americans,” said Farhana Khera, executive director of Muslim Advocates which brought the lawsuit jointly with CCR. Under the terms of the settlement, the NYPD confirmed that it has dismantled the surveillance unit formerly known as the “demographics unit” that carried out the spying on Muslim communities. The department also agreed that it would not engage in religious-based surveillance in the future in New Jersey, as it had already accepted for New York. In addition, there will be a new set of guidelines for intelligence gathering, and the NYPD will submit their training procedures for police officers to review by the plaintiffs in the case. The force will pay damages that amount to a total of $47,500 to businesses and mosques that suffered economic harm as a result of the blanket spying, and $25,000 to individuals who were stigmatised. Azmy said that the settlement had to be seen in the context of the anti-Muslim messages emanating from the White House. He said the lawsuit was concluded in the “age of Trump when full-throated racism and xenophobia is part of White House policy. We hope the decision sends a strong signal that profiling of the sort that consumes this White House is unconstitutional, and there are communities that will mobilise and exert their growing power to challenge those activities and prevail.” The named plaintiff in the case, Farhaj Hassan, a US army sergeant from Helmetta, New Jersey, said that joining the lawsuit had been an effort “to speak out in defence of the constitution and to resist any activity, even from law enforcement, that would attempt to destroy or curtail the values it stands for. When I found out about the NYPD’s illegal surveillance of my mosque, my community, little girls going to Sunday school, it hit me that officers from the most powerful police force in the country were targetting Muslims in my back yard, my home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/05/kyrie-irving-out-for-postseason-knee","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T17:20:49Z","webTitle":"Boston Celtics' Kyrie Irving needs left knee surgery and will miss playoffs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/05/kyrie-irving-out-for-postseason-knee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/05/kyrie-irving-out-for-postseason-knee","fields":{"headline":"Boston Celtics' Kyrie Irving needs left knee surgery and will miss playoffs","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Kyrie Irving, the Boston Celtics’ All-Star point guard, will need surgery on his left knee and miss the rest of the regular season and playoffs.

The five-time All-Star recently developed an infection at the site of the screws, and now they must be taken out. The team had said the knee was structurally sound and the kneecap healed, but the wire had been putting pressure on the knee. Irving was acquired by the Celtics from the Cleveland Cavaliers in an offseason trade for Isaiah Thomas.

I’ve just been on the fanzines at Cardiff – they all like you. I can’t believe it.’ I said: ‘Darling, some people do, you know.’” They have plenty of cause to like Warnock now. Cardiff, with a squad who look like an island of lost toys in a division where money has flowed freely, are five points clear of third-placed Fulham with a game in hand. On Friday night they host the leaders, Wolves, then on Tuesday visit Aston Villa, who are fourth. Barring a calamity, Cardiff will win promotion to the Premier League. Not bad considering they were second bottom when Warnock arrived in October 2016. The promotion, if it comes, would be the 69-year-old’s eighth, a record. But there seems to be a contradiction in a manager who will tell you he much prefers the “muck and nettles” of the Championship to the Premier League, trying his best to get out of the division. There is an element to Warnock’s motivation that is different. For most people the reward of promotion is playing in the Premier League with all the attendant status, riches and glory, but for Warnock a big part of the goal is simply the promotion. If there was a way of winning promotion from the Championship but playing the following season in the same division, Warnock might take it. “Yeah, it wouldn’t bother me at all,” he says. He is also still motivated by the usual things. Like proving a point. “I don’t feel I’ve had a fair crack of the whip in the Premier League, given the circumstances,” he says, going on to explain the difficulties at Queens Park Rangers in 2011, the summer after promotion. The club were in the process of being sold to Tony Fernandes, which delayed the most significant transfer business until the last week of the window. “I had four or five very good players at my house willing to sign, then in the end they said I couldn’t sign anybody,” he says. Pinches of salt should be taken here: they signed six players before those final few days, albeit none of blinding quality and three on free transfers. But clearly the circumstances were not ideal and the grievance holds: Warnock was sacked in January of that season. “It was terrible really, having got promoted, having the carpet pulled from under you,” he says. “Then Sheffield United, obviously the Carlos Tevez situation didn’t help, but before that when we got promoted, within 24 hours I got a letter from the club saying they were going to take my option up but with no increase in wages, just incentives. That knocked me for six.” He does not even mention the brief spell at Crystal Palace in 2014 but presumably he would cite extenuating circumstances there too: it is easy to think these are just gripes, that he is making excuses for poor performances in the top flight. It is possible Warnock is not suited to, or perhaps is not a good enough manager for, the Premier League, but he wants another crack at it. Yet here lies another contradiction, in that if it did not happen, Warnock would not be overly upset. He had essentially retired in 2016 when Rotherham persuaded him to haul them out of relegation trouble, and success there reignited something. “That was the turning point in my football career. It was fantastic. I started to think: ‘By gum, I enjoy this.’” When managers of his vintage renew their enthusiasm like that, it can go one of two ways: either they try to reclaim their past and play a young man’s game or, free from pressures of having to prove themselves or build a career, they can manage more freely, unshackled by expectation. They are there because they want to be rather than because they have to be. It is easy to see into which category Warnock falls. “No disrespect to Cardiff but they probably needed me more than I needed them, when I was appointed. The sack doesn’t worry me. When you’re younger, you have three or four bad results and you worry about everything. You worry about injuries, because they always seem to be your best players. I used to take it home with me: ‘What am I going to do? He’s out for a month, I can’t see where the next goal or point is coming from.’ At my age, I don’t give these things the time of day.” Combine that with a club who were not expected to challenge (certainly for automatic promotion) this season, and you get a pretty free and easy atmosphere. “I said to Vincent [Tan, the Cardiff owner] the other day: ‘We’re almost in the play‑offs guaranteed, so if we didn’t win automatic we’d be in the play-offs. And if we didn’t win the play-offs we’d have another go next year.’ He was OK with that. I’m not saying that underneath he’s not desperate to get back, I’m sure he is, but they’ve not put any pressure on me, the board.” It is worth pointing out that Cardiff are not total outsiders: they have been frequent dark-horse tips for the play-offs. Nor are they paupers, having spent £6m on Gary Madine and nearly £3m on Lee Tomlin, though in a classic Warnockian move they swapped the latter for Jamie Ward, football’s answer to Scrappy-Doo, in a January loan deal. But at the same time there are not many other managers who could have got Cardiff where they are now. Victory over Wolves would put them within three points of the runaway leaders. “We weren’t supposed to be here,” Warnock says. “If we didn’t do anything else for the rest of the season, our fans would clap us off, because they’ve had a great year. It really is a massive bonus.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/05/phil-neville-england-women-arrogance-swagger-style","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T21:29:13Z","webTitle":"Phil Neville wants England Women to play with ‘arrogance, swagger and style’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/05/phil-neville-england-women-arrogance-swagger-style","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/05/phil-neville-england-women-arrogance-swagger-style","fields":{"headline":"Phil Neville wants England Women to play with ‘arrogance, swagger and style’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Phil Neville wants his England Women team to play with “arrogance, swagger and style” as they face Wales in their first World Cup qualifying match under his management. Southampton’s St Mary’s Stadium is expected to have a crowd of 23,000 for this top-of-the-table clash in Group One. Wales are leaders by a point from England, though they have played a game more. Neville’s side have a 100% record and last month finished the SheBelieves Cup in the US as runners‑up, but he says his team must guard against complacency if they are to continue in his stated aim of becoming the best team in the world. “To walk out at a Premier League stadium with England Women will be a great honour for me,” he said. “It surpasses anything that I’ve ever achieved as a player. But it’s not really about me, it’s about the players. I think the players are more excited than I am because it’s a big World Cup qualifying game. Wales are top of the group so by the end of Friday we’ve got to make sure we’re back top of the group. Where we believe we should be. “I’ve spoken for the last two months about wanting to win the World Cup, but we’ve got to qualify for it first. We’re not taking that for granted. We’re playing a Wales team that’s well coached, well organised. They have got some individuals that can cause problems. But my team are used to playing big games, they’re not intimidated by them and in fact it’s something they’re looking forward to. They’ve got the attitude of ‘bring it on’. That’s what’s been impressive this week. “Now it’s about going out there and playing in the style I want them to play. Having the confidence to go out there, that’s the most important thing. When I came out of SheBelieves the thing I thought was that the team need more belief in the style that I want to play. You’re playing for England, I want them to play with a certain arrogance, swagger and style.” Neville says that his experience at the SheBelieves Cup and the past two days of training on the south coast have proven invaluable in building an understanding with his new squad. “As a coach you’ve got to connect with your players and the moments away from the training pitch are the most quality times,” he said. “Because players played on Sunday the first day and a half of this week were recovery days so I managed to have individual meetings with every single one. “My management style is to tell the players where they stand in my squad and what I think they need to become best in their position in the world. It’s as simple as that. It’s about how are we going to become the best in the world and it’s the last 5% that’s always the hardest. I’ve outlined my plan to the team as individuals this week. I expect them to perform for their clubs like I expect them to play for England. That’s where I really want to raise the bar. We’ve got 10-12 players who could compete on the world-class level. I want 23 or more.” Neville says he expects more Lionesses matches to be played at Premier League stadiums and for them to return to Wembley, as demand among fans grows. “I think it shows where the game’s going that we’re now filling Premier League stadiums,” he said. “I have fixture meetings all the time and the picture for the next year is that people are now looking at bigger venues, better stadiums against top opposition. There will be another England game at Wembley, that’s something I think the FA are committed to. We’ve got a Premier League stadium that’s going to be packed to the rafters, full of people coming to support my team, and that should fill us all with excitement.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"fashion/2018/apr/20/fashion-whats-hot-not-seagulls-bardot-tops","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T11:00:21Z","webTitle":"From seagulls to Bardot tops: this week’s fashion trends","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/20/fashion-whats-hot-not-seagulls-bardot-tops","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/apr/20/fashion-whats-hot-not-seagulls-bardot-tops","fields":{"headline":"From seagulls to Bardot tops: this week’s fashion trends","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Going up Cling Outfits should be tight this week in honour of the new Azzedine Alaïa store opening in London.

It’s not a label bestowed lightly, but Ruth Jones is well on her way to earning it, thanks to her much-loved TV projects, Gavin &amp; Stacey and Stella, which mixed drama and comedy to heartwarming effect. Her screen work has that elusive quality of the top-notch writer, a “voice” that wins you over instantly. So it’s disappointing to open her debut novel and find that voice subdued to the point of absence. Can this flavourless work really have come from the same writer who gave us the outrageously quirky Nessa? “It’s a different way of writing,” Jones said of her novel last year, “because you go inside people’s heads.” And indeed, she seems to have treated the book as an expeditionary assignment: go inside heads, have a good snoop around, and report back. “He thought of the guilt he’d felt after that first night on the beach.” “She felt ashamed for ever doubting him and relieved to the core of her soul.” “Kate’s affair had floored him.” Well, now we know. Never Greener is about a love affair that breaks up two marriages. The woman, Kate, is 17 years younger than the man, and is a TV actor. Indeed, the most moving scenes here are not the grand declarations of passion, but glimpses of her professional life. As a recognisable star, on set she finds herself boxed into a routine of jolly double entendres and faux camaraderie. “No peace for the wicked, eh?” guffaws her driver, little knowing how painfully the phrase hits home for this particular home-wrecker. Kate, her fierce selfishness deftly drawn, is subtly balanced by the wronged wife, Belinda, a Welsh stalwart with a knack for witty retorts. The male characters, however, are bland. Jones may have a good novel in her, but even her spark can’t set this soggy material alight. • Never Greener is published by Bantam.

Is Paul right? Rarely pictured offscreen wearing anything but motorcycle leathers, The Great British Bake Off judge certainly has the air of someone who has downloaded the Headspace app and is thinking about a Route 66 tattoo. The most recent off-Bake Off story we heard about Paul, 52, saw him caught up in a wider New York Times exposé about people buying bots as Twitter followers. It was a bit too technical for me to get my head around, but for a feel of how quite bang Paul was to rights, you could do worse than his spokesman’s comment to the paper: “Paul deleted his personal account last week.” OK, got it. Whether his new girlfriend, 22, should have done the same with her Insta is a matter of debate. But we’ll come to Summer Monteys-Fullam shortly. Before we go on, I must remind you of the First Law of Thermomix, which states that there is a finite amount of midlife crisis in the telly cooks community. It can be neither created nor destroyed; it can only be passed from one of them to the other, like a really great guacamole recipe. Each will add their own twist to it, of course, but the ur-recipe – the ur-crisis – is the same. A chap who aggressively critiques civilian cooking efforts on telly will make an absolute dog’s dinner of a situation, while stubbornly claiming it all tastes great to him. In his head: the image of Steven Seagal in Under Siege, a highly decorated ex-Navy Seal (“Security clearance revoked after Panama”), who also cooks, and is able both to dispatch villains using kitchen knives and turn a microwave into an improvised weapon, all the while knowing he’s having Erika Eleniak for his pudding. In everyone else’s head: the image of Seagal now. For some of our telly chefs, the condition is high-functioning. Gordon Ramsay has been having a rolling midlife crisis since he was 18, when – contrary to his recollection – he wasn’t actually in the Rangers first team squad. For others, things build to a point of dramatic reckoning. Ready Steady Cook star Antony Worrall Thompson started shoplifting at Tesco, you may recall, later explaining that the temptation of pinching stuff at the self-service tills had been “something that sparked my naughtiness, my desire to live on the edge”. Sorry, Jimmy Dean, but there’s only one place not paying for two tubs of coleslaw and a ciabatta is going to take you, and that’s a rural Oxfordshire cop shop. Thankfully, as Antony later revealed: “The police were very nice, wanted to keep all the other hoods away from me.” But the nick experience is still “not nice. I couldn’t say to them: ‘May I borrow a magazine, or can I read a book?’” When the reality of the incarceration crisis hits you, it hits you hard. Anyway. Undisputed master of the telly chef midlife crisis is, of course, MasterChef’s Gregg Wallace. Currently married to wife No 4, Gregg likes to give regular tell-all interviews on Where He’s At with the women in his life. Last year, he was explaining how he didn’t care to venture to not “nice places” like shopping centres, because of what people might think of his much-younger wife. Spoken like a great protector, and one familiar with how the famous jibe goes: “There’s no fool like a young fool.” Remarkably, though, this self-publicised-telly-chef-midlife-crisis column is not actually about Gregg. Back, then, to Paul Hollywood, whose new-ish girlfriend wrote an Instagram tribute to him at the turn of the year. One aspect of Summer Monteys-Fullam’s tribute to her “amazing boyfriend” has now caught people’s unfavourable attention: namely, the bit where she says he has “turned me from a girl to a woman, and to a house woman”. She followed that with a cry-laughter emoji – and why not? The precise emoji for that sentence has arguably yet to be invented, and may indeed never be. As for the reaction to this … well, let’s just say it could have gone better. It was, of course, the poet Juvenal who used his Satires to pose the eternal question: who judges the telly cooking judges? The answer, evidently, is “a hell of a lot of people on the internet”. And if Paul and Summer currently feel like getting on his Kawasaki Ninja H2 and disappearing into the American west, I’m sure we could all quite understand it. Past performance is no guarantee of Steven Seagal’s worth What we might term the No-Shit Intro of the Month comes courtesy of Fortune magazine, which opens a story with the words: “Regulators in New Jersey and Tennessee are sending clear signals that investors should steer clear of a cryptocurrency endorsed by faded action-film star Steven Seagal.” Ya think? In what my made-up market analysts are calling a clear signal that “nothing’s blue chip any more”, Seagal’s Bitcoin knock-off has run into a series of strong regulatory warnings. Like me, you may be collecting a series of one-fact stories from the past couple of years that you plan to go back in time with and freak out your 2014 self. In which case, you’ll already be across the reality that Above the Law legend Seagal is the spokesmodel for a cryptocurrency. The news was exclusively revealed by the project’s website, which went with “ZEN MASTER STEVEN SEAGAL HAS BECOME THE BRAND AMBASSADOR OF BITCOIIN2GEN.” Which is presumably more enticing to investors than “VLADIMIR PUTIN’S JUDO PATSY HAS BECOME THE BRAND AMBASSADOR OF BITCOIIN2GEN”. Or any of the other even more malarial options for this most multi of all multihyphenates. As you can see, its name is Bitcoiin – with two “I”s - which strikes me as the cryptocurrency equivalent of calling your cab firm AAAAAAAAAA Taxis back in the anciente tymes of the Yellow Pages. Quite how this cryptocurrency has been red-flagged as potentially risky for investors is beyond me. According to Bitcoiin, Seagal “believes that what he does in his life is about leading people into contemplation to wake them up and enlighten them in some manner”. Do go on. “These are precisely the objectives of the Bitcoiin2Gen.” That was the point at which I went all-in, but for the ultra-timid investor, there was more: “Zen Master Steven mentioned an old Chinese saying: ‘Flow with whatever may happen and let your mind be free. Stay centred by accepting whatever you are doing. This is the ultimate,’ by Chuang Tsu.” Amazing. Apparently, in the interests of balance, I have to mention a less old saying by the New Jersey Bureau of Securities, which goes: blah blah cease and desist, blah blah “fraudulently offering unregistered securities in violation of the Securities Law”. Whatever. I know which type of financial advice I feel spiritually closer to. News that Seagal is now departing his spokesmodel role in order that the currency may remain “genuinely anonymous” is only further proof of its – and his – integrity. Pile in, readers, and let the pyramid-shaped journey to financial enlightenment commence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2018/apr/14/mail-wrongly-addressed-letters-bailiffs-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"Addressing the issue of being sent threatening letters meant for a previous tenant\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/14/mail-wrongly-addressed-letters-bailiffs-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/apr/14/mail-wrongly-addressed-letters-bailiffs-bills","fields":{"headline":"Addressing the issue of being sent threatening letters meant for a previous tenant\r\n","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"I bought my first home 18 months ago and have since been receiving huge amounts of mail for a previous tenant – including fines for traffic violations, and what looks like information on outstanding loans.

Foyles said the business rates revaluation had added £70,000 to its running costs while it was forced to close its Charing Cross Road store for several days during the school holidays because of electrical damage caused by sprinklers flooding the basement. The number of shoppers visiting its stores declined after the terrorist attacks in London and Manchester, the company said as it posted a loss of £88,791 for the year to 30 June 2017.

Much of this investment we have made will take full effect in the current and subsequent years.” Foyles moved its Charing Cross Road branch in 2014 to the former St Martin’s School of Art building, just a few doors up. Currie said the store continued to perform well in its new location. It will feature on the silver screen later this month in the film adaptation of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. In January, larger rival Waterstones said pre-tax profits increased from £9.9m to £18m in the year to 29 April 2017. It pointed to cost savings and a shift away from selling low-margin academic course books into more profitable products such as stationery and toys. Its sales were flat at £404m."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/12/johnny-ruin-dan-dalton-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T08:00:26Z","webTitle":"Johnny Ruin by Dan Dalton review – for the love of a Manic Pixie Dream Girl","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/12/johnny-ruin-dan-dalton-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/12/johnny-ruin-dan-dalton-review","fields":{"headline":"Johnny Ruin by Dan Dalton review – for the love of a Manic Pixie Dream Girl","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Some novels review themselves. They give you a synopsis. “A man takes a road trip through his own mind with Jon Bon Jovi.” They don’t hide the novelist’s Notes to Self, drawn from screenplay manuals: “Start with the weather … Set the scene … Give your character a flaw …” They then wittily describe that flaw: “My superpower is selective vision. I can see what I want to from a hundred paces.” They even spell out their own moral. “Every book is a self-help book if you read it right.” All this could be frustrating for the non-reviewing, out-for-fun reader, but Johnny Ruin is charming in the way that Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is charming – by which I mean, charming if you’re OK with a multilayered metafictional fiction about a depressed male protagonist who pines, mourns and defies death for a Manic Pixie Dream Girl. I am when it does it as zappily, and with as much verbal wit and accessible emotion, as Johnny Ruin. This is Dan Dalton’s first novel, and it betrays a newcomer’s desire to do and say everything at once, but it also has a sentence-by-sentence assurance that he’s built up beforehand. Dalton was a BuzzFeed writer and the novel is formed out of short paragraphs, sometimes single sentences, isolated by meaningful space. At times, it doesn’t feel so much like reading pages as being showered in the confetti of them. This sentence confetti is in some ways the default form of contemporary, post-internet writing. When novels seem to understand themselves too well, though, you start trying to understand them better. If I was doing this, I’d say Johnny Ruin was about a youngish man who destroys his relationships by objectifying and idealising the women he loves. His internal, infernal road trip – with Jon Bon Jovi as Virgil – shows him doing his damnedest to break this habit of breakups, and thinking he has succeeded. The plot implies that he has triumphed by letting the dream girl fly free. He hasn’t. A few pages from the end, we get: “She was poetry to me. Every part of her. She still is.” But Johnny Ruin’s lack of self-knowledge, his ultimate self-ruin, makes this a deeper and more powerful novel than his success would have done. • Johnny Ruin is published by Unbound.

The letter, to the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, came from a group of cross-party peers, drafted by Lord Polak, who is honorary president of the Conservative Friends of Israel. The letter says the messages on some pro-Corbyn Facebook pages “go well beyond what can reasonably be considered as free speech, and we believe those which incite violence should urgently be investigated to establish whether they were made with serious intent”. An example given by the peers was the Facebook group called Supporting Jeremy Corbyn &amp; John McDonnell, which allegedly carried a post saying: “Adolph [sic], you should have finished the job.” Another cited was the Facebook group Jeremy Corbyn Leads Us To Victory, which had pictures of journalists at the New York Times and CNN, with the Star of David pasted on to those they believed to be Jewish. The peers who have signed the letter included the crossbencher Lady Deech, a former member of the Jewish Leadership Council, and Labour’s Lord Turnberg and Lord Beecham, as well as the former Liberal Democrat Lord Carlile. Ros Altmann, the former Conservative pensions minister, has also signed it. Lord Sugar, who this week was criticised by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, for tweeting a made-up picture of Corbyn attending a Nazi rally, doubled down on Twitter on Thursday, tweeting a derogatory poem about the Labour leader that called him a “dangerous fool who is antisemitic”. Sugar, a Jewish peer and former Labour member and donor until he left the party in 2015, has been highly critical of Corbyn’s leadership, particularly over the party’s handling of antisemitism. “I am happy to put my name to this letter. If I didn’t know better, I would say Corbyn has deliberately aggravated the situation by associating himself with known haters,” he told the Daily Express. The peers’ letter says such hate speech “not only stirs up racial hatred which threatens the very fabric of community cohesion throughout London and the UK, but also poses a possible physical threat to the Jewish community”. A Met spokesman said: “The Metropolitan police received correspondence addressed to the commissioner’s office on 4 April and it will be reviewed.” Separately it was revealed on Thursday that Joshua Garfield, a Labour council candidate in Newham, had resigned his position as a London Momentum officer, saying he felt “unsafe and untrusted” as a Jewish member of his local group. He said antisemitism had escalated in recent weeks as the issue had come under media scrutiny. He added: “I cannot work alongside individuals who seek to silence the legitimate concerns of Jewish Labour members, or who remain silent in the face of blatant racism. Denying that antisemitism exists within the Labour party, or in its affiliated organisations, factions, and supporters, is misguided, ignorant and offensive. While some may seek to weaponise the issue, something cannot be weaponised if it doesn’t exist. Our Jewish comrades need solidarity, not faction-based infighting.” Garfield said he still supported Corbyn’s leadership and would run as a councillor in the May elections in the Stratford and New Town ward. Momentum’s main governing body released a statement this week saying it had acknowledged that antisemitism within Labour was not a rightwing smear and was more widespread than many had previously believed. Its national coordinating group said that antisemitism “manifested itself in varied, nuanced and subtle ways”, though some MPs and activists then raised concerns that the grassroots group did not have sufficient control of its local divisions or social media pages to adequately tackle the problem. On Wednesday it was announced that the two largest Jewish bodies had agreed to meet Corbyn to discuss his efforts to tackle antisemitism, which Corbyn said would be held according to an agenda proposed by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and the Jewish Leadership Council."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/17/selling-twitter-handles-big-business-identity","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T10:04:20Z","webTitle":"You can buy anything on the black market – including Twitter handles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/17/selling-twitter-handles-big-business-identity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/17/selling-twitter-handles-big-business-identity","fields":{"headline":"You can buy anything on the black market – including Twitter handles","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Everything has a price, even the top Twitter handles, and if somebody does not want to sell then they may be forced to relinquish their account. “We have a marketplace which allows the sale of Twitter handles,” says Philly, a subversive marketer who founded ForumKorner, an online gaming forum. “Unlike some websites, however, we do not allow the sales of stolen accounts that some people phish, or hack, to obtain before reselling them.” It’s the same across the whole of social media. Last month a teenage boy was given a £5,000 cruise in exchange for his Snapchat username while accounts on Instagram are sold openly on online marketplaces. Shady brokers stalk the web searching for the most potentially lucrative handles, convincing their owners to part with them before reselling at a significantly higher price. “It’s funny some people don’t know the true value of a handle,” says another trader on condition of anonymity. “For example, I used to look for three-letter acronyms. The handle would generally go for around $30 but little do they know people look for specific @’s correlating with their business. I’ve flipped $20-$40 to $700 on multiple occasions.” Elsewhere, people allege their accounts have been phished, and their handles stolen and sold, yet Twitter has apparently not implemented robust systems to prevent the practice. “Twitter has yet to go after the hackers or phishers, let alone the legitimate account sellers, like myself,” says Philly. “Phishing an account is as easy as downloading an infected program, ticking a couple options and hitting run.” “They used social engineering strategies with multiple other services and sites (like Amazon),” says Josh Bryant, a designer at a digital product firm, who documented how he almost lost his handle in a blog post. “The why is just money. I own both @jb on Twitter and Instagram and there’s a huge economy for desirable usernames right now. If a hacker can get them, list and sell them before the site responds they stand to make a pretty healthy profit.” Another user claims their username was taken by Twitter itself. “A broker kept approaching me, and when I declined his final offer, a formal complaint was made to Twitter, by whom I don’t know, and the handle was handed over to JPMorgan,” says Chase Giunta, a software developer who previously owned the handle @Chase. “I always assumed JP Morgan would want it since they’re the largest bank in the US, but I also assumed they, or maybe even Twitter, would contact me directly to set up some kind of exchange – not some shady broker.” Twitter, however, does not permit the trading of usernames. It explicitly states: “Attempts to sell, buy, or solicit other forms of payment in exchange for usernames are also violations and may result in permanent account suspension.” This does not seem to have stopped them changing hands, though. “After his last offer, I received action from Twitter,” says Giunta. “The steps they took to take my account down were incredibly unsettling. They sent me automated emails claiming I was impersonating Chase Bank, which I wasn’t, before they took the username from me.” “Of course, in hindsight, I would’ve accepted his last $20,000 offer. But I thought I was doing the ‘right thing’ by turning it down at that time.” This sentiment was echoed by Patrick de Laive, the founder of The Next Web, who was offered $20,000 for @patrick by an athlete. Accounts may be permanently removed due to prolonged inactivity to prevent handle squatting. In the early days of the social media giant, this meant people could contact the administrator and request inactive handles. A former Twitter employee told the Guardian how they could request unused usernames for themselves and family. Others have since demonstrated the relative ease in which enterprising people can secure their desired handle. “I got my first name as my Twitter handle after a six-month campaign that included some light Internet stalking, badgering staff at Twitter, $250 and a visit to the patent office,” says Haje Jan, a director at Bold, a venture capitalist company, whose first name was taken by an inactive user. “I registered a web domain for my first name to strengthen my case (in case the trademark people decided to look any deeper), then forked over my £170 to the Intellectual Property Office, registering Haje™ as a trademark.” “Armed with the trademark I contacted Twitter’s support team and about a week later, I received an email saying that I could either create a new account or move the username to an existing account. Mission accomplished – and it turned out to be easier than I anticipated.” It’s not just individuals who have bought up desirable usernames. The state of Israel bought the @israel handle for reported six-figure sum in 2010, while CNN employed the owner of @cnnbrk as a consultant in exchange for transferring them the account. “Twitter has always been very clear that it’s against their terms and conditions to sell usernames but that hasn’t stopped people trying,” says Sue Llewellyn, who trains journalists to use social media. “They also frown upon people squatting on usernames – ie creating an account and not using it.” “Frankly I think if a big name celebrity wanted a specific name that wasn’t being used then they could probably get it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/2018/apr/08/azed-crossword-2391","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T23:02:13Z","webTitle":"Azed crossword 2,391","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2018/apr/08/azed-crossword-2391","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2018/apr/08/azed-crossword-2391","fields":{"headline":"Azed crossword 2,391","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Click here for a printable version.

Asked if Facebook’s board had discussed whether he should step down as chairman, a move that would still leave him as chief executive, he replied: “Not that I’m aware of.” It’s probably safe to assume Zuckerberg would have known about any such discussions among his fellow directors, so take his answer to mean: no, Facebook’s board has heard the calls for the appointment of an independent chair, from New York City’s pension fund for example, and decided to ignore them. In doing so, the board seems to have accepted Zuckerberg’s bizarrely loose version of accountability. Allowing the data of up to 87 million people to be “inappropriately shared” with Cambridge Analytica was “my responsibility”, he said in answer to a later question. It was also a “huge mistake” not to focus on abuse of data more generally. But, hey, “life is about learning from the mistakes and figuring out what you need to do to move forward”. This breezy I-promise-to-do-better mantra would be understandable if offered by a school child who had fluffed an exam. But Zuckerberg is running the world’s eighth largest company and $50bn has just been removed from its stock market value in a scandal that, aside from raising deep questions about personal privacy and social media’s influence on democracy, may provoke a regulatory backlash. In these circumstances, why wouldn’t a board ask whether it has the right governance structure? The motivation would be self-interest. First, there is a need to ensure that the company isn’t run entirely at the whim of a chief executive who is plainly a technological whizz but admits he failed to grasp Facebook’s responsibilities as the number of users exploded to 2 billion. Second, outsiders, including users, advertisers and politicians, want reassurance that Facebook has basic checks and balances in its boardroom. The lack of interest in governance reform is explained, of course, by the fact that Zuckerberg has a stranglehold over Facebook’s voting shares. His economic interest is 16% but he has 60% of the votes and thus, for practical purposes, can’t easily be shifted from either of his roles. The best advice to Scott Stringer, the New York City comptroller who oversees a pension fund that has $1bn invested in Facebook, is to keep pushing. He has common sense on his side. Stringer’s proposals for how Facebook could start to pursue a “reputation-enhancing second chapter” are also modest – appoint an independent chair; recruit three outside directors who are better versed than Zuckerberg in the complexities of data and ethics; and create an independent board committee with oversight of data privacy policies and risks. The US congressional committee that will question Zuckerberg next week should also press the governance issue. Facebook’s founder, even on his own account this week, created a beast whose behaviour he didn’t fully predict or control. What – other than the dent to his ego – is the problem in having a few more individuals in the boardroom whose job is to ask hard questions? Best way out of hole for Hammerson is to drop bid for smaller shopping centre rival When in a hole, stop digging. It has dawned on Hammerson’s board that obsessing over the supposed wonders of buying smaller shopping centre rival Intu – a £3.4bn deal its own shareholders seem to hate – is not a good way to prepare for a possible bid from French group Klépierre. Thus Hammerson will pause the Intu action until Klépierre has shown its hand, which it must do by 16 April. Sensible move. If Klépierre converts its talk of a cash-and-shares offer at 615p-a-share into a proper bid, the next debate will be about the real worth of Hammerson’s Birmingham Bullring to Bicester Village estate. On that score, Hammerson waved an asset valuation of 790p a share, an uplift of 1.8% in three months, and invited investors to bask in the “good demand for space across our centres”. Fair enough, in normal circumstances, it would enough to defeat Klépierre at most prices below 700p. Hammerson’s problem, however, is that it was prepared to issue stock to Intu when its own share price was 530p. That hardly inspires confidence in the new 790p figure. The best way out of the hole is to drop the Intu bid altogether."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/05/the-guardian-view-on-the-skripal-case-a-long-battle-for-values","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T17:24:41Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the Skripal case: a long battle for values | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/05/the-guardian-view-on-the-skripal-case-a-long-battle-for-values","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/05/the-guardian-view-on-the-skripal-case-a-long-battle-for-values","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the Skripal case: a long battle for values","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Anyone who thought the Sergei Skripal poisoning might be a relatively short-lived international incident, after which something like pre-existing normality would reassert itself, knows differently now. It is a month since Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned in Salisbury by a novichok nerve agent of a type developed by Russia. A week later Theresa May told parliament that it was highly likely that the Russian state was directly or indirectly responsible. The British view was then backed by the main political parties and most of Britain’s major allies. Diplomats were expelled on both sides. But the scandal refuses to die down and the questions surrounding the Skripal case continue to proliferate. Much but not all of this is because Russia’s response has been so determinedly aggressive, energetic and defiant. Far from hiding away until the embarrassing dust settles, Russia has decided to fight an attacking propaganda and disinformation war on all fronts. President Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, have gone out of their way to parade a variety of grievances about the British charges, shamelessly turning Tuesday’s official UK scientific confirmation of the use of novichok into an apparent admission that the agent could not be sourced to – and thus might not be from – Russia. After the international Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons voted in the Hague by 15 to six against a Russian move for its scientists to be involved in a “joint” investigation. Russia pronounced that its move had succeeded because 17 countries had abstained. And on Thursday it was Russia, not Britain, that was due to take the matter to the United Nations security council. Earlier on Thursday the Russian ambassador had given a marathon press conference full of the now familiar Russian disdain and innuendo against the British government. Even while the ambassador was speaking, his account littered with facetious red herrings, other events moved forward too. Russian TV broadcast a recording of an alleged phone call between Ms Skripal and her cousin Viktoria (presumably this was provided by the Russian intelligence service). Simultaneously, the Metropolitan police published the first public statement from Ms Skripal since she regained consciousness following the attack. This will not be the end of the matter. Russia clearly wants to get access to Ms Skripal and to get her back home. It is already using her cousin’s wish to visit to force the issue further. Meanwhile, next week, the OPCW will issue its own report on the nerve agent samples that Britain has provided in line with agreed procedures. This week’s bogus Russian claims in the Hague seem certain to be repeated. Russia is engaged in a long game of sustained diplomatic and political disruption. Its policy towards the liberal democracies is to undermine and divide. It is, as we have said before, a troll state. The united response to the Skripal poisoning has set its strategy back. Yet breaking alliances remains the name of the Russian game. It must be matched with a western long game, based on evidence (which a post-Iraq public will expect to see), law and patient alliance-building. This is one reason why Boris Johnson, with his indiscipline and his addiction to colourful language, is so often unhelpful for the British case. It may be tempting for the UK to hit back with the same kind of intemperate contempt that Russia is displaying. But that temptation must be resisted at all costs. This is not just a conflict of state against state, but one of liberal values against their negation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global-development/2018/apr/06/healthcare-privilege-world-health-organization-world-health-day","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T12:07:48Z","webTitle":"The fight goes on to ensure healthcare is not a privilege reserved for the rich | Lucy Lamble","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/06/healthcare-privilege-world-health-organization-world-health-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/apr/06/healthcare-privilege-world-health-organization-world-health-day","fields":{"headline":"The fight goes on to ensure healthcare is not a privilege reserved for the rich","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On this World Health Day, 7 April, the World Health Organization marks its 70th anniversary. It has notched up some notable achievements such as the efforts to eradicate diseases like smallpox, a convention on tobacco control and a framework to prevent flu pandemics. Alongside this runs coordinating work on global standards and guidelines for essential drugs, diagnosis, treatment and health workers. World Health Day this year will focus on one of WHO’s founding principles: “The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.” This language and the creation of the World Health Organization on 7 April 1948 reflect the post-war times. Leaders, galvanised by the devastation of the years of conflict, were open to building societies afresh, incorporating basic values such as the right to health. That same year, the UN adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UK set up a National Health Service to meet the needs of its population regardless of income or social access, and the country has reaped the social and economic gains ever since. Since then, WHO’s membership has tripled to 194 member states, with developing countries now in the majority. The organisation relies on the interest of states being met by working together for the greater good, to prevent infectious diseases like Sars from crossing borders, for example, or to tackle common risks like drug resistance. But huge inequities in health provision between richer and poorer countries persist. While Europe and America might prioritise health security, for many developing countries, providing fairer access to quality healthcare must come first. The challenge of increasing drug resistance highlights the complexities of the WHO’s role. The organisation has warned that too few antibiotics are in the pipeline to tackle the rise of infections that are close to untreatable. While research and development play a part, controlling access to antibiotics is also vital. In poorer states, the health systems aren’t always in place to facilitate that – if the majority of your population don’t have dependable access to a doctor or nurse qualified to prescribe, and would therefore be at risk of dying from an infection for want of a signature, how can you enforce such restrictions?The election last year of Ethiopian Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as WHO’s director general is part of the slow shift to greater representation for developing countries. Tedros has a fine line to walk for his five-year term if he is to keep donor confidence to raise core funds and maintain the organisation’s independence, while delivering on WHO’s founding remit.Wealthier countries still use their financial influence. Only 20% of WHO’s activity is untied core funding from member states. The remaining 80%, a combination of government funding, philanthropy and the private sector, is money earmarked for specific projects. Without greater member state contributions, this looks to be the WHO’s reality. The field of global health has become a more crowded place. The World Bank secured significant funds in the misguided structural adjustment era championing user fees and so was able to sweeten advice with loans and grants. More recently the arrival of the more narrowly defined remits and nimbler decision-making of the Global Fund (to fight Aids, tuberculosis and malaria) and the vaccine alliance Gavi have also attracted significant funds. The appointment of a health professional, Jim Yong Kim, as president of the World Bank, with invaluable experience of healthcare in resource-strapped settings, was encouraging. Yet the Bank can do more. There is an inherent contradiction if another part of the organisation is advising investment in countries with low tax regimes when public finance has been shown to be key to delivering sustainable health services. Growth won’t bring countries prosperity without ensuring citizens’ core health needs are met – health has a huge impact on economic and social development. An international body like the WHO can’t deliver universal access alone but must convince national governments to invest in health. The previous director general, Margaret Chan, found a way to make member states cooperate again but as the Ebola crisis showed, some tensions still need tackling. Tedros has a diplomatic tightrope to walk. Despite an early misstep over the Mugabe appointment, there is still good will for his tenure and he will need to deploy all his political skills to ensure the next 70 years bring us closer to health access for everyone. For all its imperfections, WHO still has a vital role. We need its convening power as much as we did in 1948. Its failings reflect our current global health inequality and its challenges the politics of redressing this."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/05/arsenal-v-cska-moscow-europa-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T20:57:20Z","webTitle":"Arsenal 4-1 CSKA Moscow: Europa League - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/05/arsenal-v-cska-moscow-europa-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/05/arsenal-v-cska-moscow-europa-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal 4-1 CSKA Moscow: Europa League - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"David Hytner’s match report A first-half blitz gives Arsenal a commanding first-leg lead. Some of Arsenal’s attacking, against opponents who may regret playing so openly, was delightful. Ozil’s passing was sublime and one of Ramsey’s goal was a gem. Arsenal should really have been more clinical and scored at least a couple more goals, but they can be confident of doing that in Moscow. Here are the results from the other quarer-final first legs: Lazio 4-2 Salzburg Atletico 2-0 Sporting Leipzig 1-0 Marseille 90+2 min: Ozil tries to create one last goal. But his low cross from the left is intercepted by Akinfeev. 89 min: There will be at least four more minutes. 87 min: There’s a couple of hundred bare-chested CSKA fans jumping up and down and singing. There are easier ways to keep warm Such as putting a shirt on. But there’s no fun in that, apparently. 85 min: Iwobi pokes a clever pass through to Ramsey, who has a clear sight of goal from eight yards, at the left-hand side of the box. Is this his hat-trick? Nope, he skews his shot wide of the far post. 84 min: Ramsey curls over a cross from the right. Welbeck dips in front of his marker and tries to turn the ball towards goal from close range. Akinfeev spreads himself to make a good block. CSKA substitution: Khosonov on, Musa off 80 min: There’s little to suggest that CSKA are capable of winning 3-0 in Moscow, but Arsenal should be dissatisfied if they don’t score at least a fifth goal today. 77 min: Ozil wrongfoots half the CSKA defence with a foxy dummy 10 yards inside opposition territory. Arsenal then begin probing around the box. Ozil joins in again, tipping a nice pass through to Iwobi at the edge of the area. Iwobi smartly picks out Ramsey in the middle. The Welshman’s sidefooter from 16 yards bounces out off the post! Arsenal substitutions: Welbeck and Elneny on, Lacazette and Wilshere off 72 min: Wilshere sends Iwobi galloping down the left. The Nigeria international tries to play in Lacazette. The striker dummies it near the penalty spot, allowing it to roll over to Ozil, who tries to guide a curler into the far corner. Denied by Akinfeev! 71 min: Arsenal pen CSKa into their own box. Then Ozil clips a diagonal pass towards the far post. Monreal’s climbs above a defender but his header lacks enough power to trouble Akinfeev. 69 min: Arsenal are besieging the visitors’ goal. They’ve decided that more attacking is the best form of fence. Alex Berezutski clears a low Ozil cross at the near post. 67 min: Ozil bisects the CSKA defence with another superb pass. Iwobi runs on to it in what must be called the Thierry Henry position. Will he curl it round the keeper and in at the far post? No, he tries to square it for Lacazette. But it’s slightly overhit and the striker ends up having to fire it back across goal from a tight angle. 65 min: Musa wriggles down the left and slips a ball into the penalty area. It runs to Wernbloom, who tries to bundle it past Cech. The keeper saves but the rebound is headed into the net ... by an offside player (Dzagoev). No goal. Arsenal need to be careful here: there’s a big difference between going to Moscow with a 4-2 lead rather than 4-1. OK, by big difference I mean one goal. But a degree of psychological comfort, too. 63 min: Alex Berezeutski makes a crucial interception to foil a counter-attack, cutting out Wilshere overly-delayed pass towards Lacazette. 62 min: Good move by CSKA but Schennikov ruins the money shot after being primed by Wernbloom. Arsenal substitution: Mkhitaryan seems to have damaged his knee in that tackle by Schennikov. He can’t continue and is replaced by Iwobi. 60 min: Strong sliding tackle by Mustafi on Musa, fair and true. 58 min: Schennikov booked for clattering into Mkhitaryan near half-way. 56 min: Mkhitaryan unleashes a shot from 25 yards, Akinfeev only parries it and Wilshere runs in to try to stab hime the rebound. But a defender get a foot to it first, succeeding only in nudging it towards the penalty spot. Ramsey charges in and, under pressure, wellies a shot just over the bar! 55 min: CSKA seem a bit deflated. 52 min: Super move by Arsenal! Monreal began it and, after swapping quick passes with Wilshere and Mkhitaryan, he cut a pass back from the byline to Ramsey, who hat-trick attempt from 12 yards was deflected out for a corner 50 min: Mustafi meets the corner at the near post but only heads it up in the air. Cech rushes off his line to punch it farther away. 49 min: CSKA remain enterprising but they haven’t shown the quality around the box that Arsenal have. But they’ve won a corner just now ... 47 min: 71 seconds in to the second half, Ozil begins wielding his wand again. He conjures a wonderful pass from near the right-hand corner of the box to Xhaka on the far side. Xhaka takes it down but can’t get off a clean shot, blemming over. 46 min: Off we go again. Neither side made any subs during the break. Here are the half-time scores from the other Europa League quarter-finals: Lazio 1-1 Salzburg Atletico 2-0 Sporting Leipzig 1-0 Marseille What an entertaining half that was! Arsenal have been vulnerable defensively but excellent going forward and they can be confident of putting this tie to bed today. Ozil is orchestrating things beautifully and Ramsey’s movement is a total mystery to the Russian defence - and his second goal was a marvel. More please! 44 min: Bellerin skitters down the right, prompted by a lovely pass from Mkhitaryan. The cross is cleared but Arsenal quickly regain possession. Xhaka flights a canny pass over the top towards Ozil, steaming in at the back post. He tries to flip a first-time shot past the keeper from an acute angle, but sends it a couple of yards over the bar. It’s the first time his precision has dropped below exquisite today. 43 min: Musa dashes forward again. He’s being closed down by several defenders so fires off a shot from 20 yards before they can reach him. He doesn’t catch it cleanly, though, and Cech saves easily. 42 min: Dzagoev has another pop, this time a snapshot from 20 yards. He found space well but fails to control his shot, which veers off into the stands. But at least CSKA do not seem too disheartened by the scoreline: they’re right to suspect there are more away goals available for them. But Arsenal can be confident of scoring more themselves. There’s no telling how this will end. 40 min: That’s better from Musa! he sprints past Bellerin, no less, and plays a smart low pass into Dzagoev ... who blazes over from 15 yards! 37 min: CSKA probe again. Musa is caught offside again. Xhaka opens up the defence with a pass to Ozil on the left wing. The German canters forward and looks up before picking out Lacazette, who takes a to control it about 12 yards out and then slams a low shot into the net. Arsenal could wrap this tie up today! 33 min: Ramsey makes another run into the box unnoticed by the Russian defence. But Monreal spots him alright and clips a nice pass in his direction. The time, alas, Ramsey fluffs his attempted finish, mistiming his jump and sending his shot way off target. But you can be sure he’ll get his hat-trick soon if CSKA don’t wise up to his movement. 31 min: Koscielny, who’s had an unsteady start, slides in to nick the ball off Dzagoev and curtail a counter-attack. What a brilliant goal! Ozil sent a dainty chip over the defence. Ramsey ran on to it, sensed the keeper had crept off his line, leapt into the air to meet the dropping ball and bent his leg into the shape of a chicken wing in order to guide a deliciously deft lob over the advancing keeper from 12 yards and into the net! That’s a work of art! 27 min: The highlu influential Golovin slips a pass through to Musa, who shimmies past Mustafi at the edge of the area ... and then twonks a terrible shot way wide. 26 min: Natcho flights a corner out to the edge of the area, where Golovin tries to take it on his chest and tee himself up for a shot. But Arsenal were quick to close him down and nick the ball. 24 min: Both sides are neat and cutting in possession and quite ropey in defence: there’ll be a good deal more scoring before the game is out, I fancy. The Frenchman sends the keeper one way and the ball the other way, low and into the corner! Ozil goes down under a tackle by Schennikov! 21 min: Slick interplay between Ozil and Mkhitaryan, followed by a dummy by Bellerin to allow the ball to roll through to Lacazette in the box. But the flag goes up for offside, again incorrectly. 19 min: Wilshere and Xhaka combine well to cut through midfield. Xhaka sends a pass wide to Lacazette on the right. The Frenchman’s cross is put behind for a corner, which is cleared without fuss. 17 min: CSKA are not satisfied: they want more. And if their ambition is based on the belief that Arsenal’s defence is flaky, they’re being vindicated: Musa has jsut sidestepped Koscileny in the box and found himself one-on-one with Cech from a tight angle. But he miscues shot shot, blasting low into the sidenetting. Those familiar jitters are now audible around the Emirates... Golovin curls a sweet 23-yard freekick over the wall and into the top corner! That’s a precious away goal and a fine way to punish Arsenal for sloppy defending. 14 min: CSKA are mounting a spell of pressure. And now they have a great chance to test Cech, as Koscielny makes a clumsy aerial challenge to concede a freekick just outside the D. 12 min: A handball by Ramsey gives CSKA a chance to loft over a freekick. Natcho sends it beyond the back post. One of the Berezutski twins tries to nod it back across goal but Cech intercepts easily. Another sweeping move from Arsenal concludes with Ozil slipping the ball wide to Bellerin, who sends over a low cross to Ramsey, who guides a first-time shot into the net from 10 yards. 7 min: Ramsey makes a burst from deep and sidefoots a cross from the right into the net from six yards! But that, too, is ruled out for offside. The replay is less conclusive on this one: he may have been level with the last man. 6 min: Schennikov shanks a cross from the left after being played into a lot of space. That’s another let-off for Arsenal and another warning that CSKA have come in search of any away goal, at least. 5 min: Wernbloom outjumps Koscielny to flick on a long pass to Musa, who is suddenly running clear on goal! But he’s pulled back for offside - the replay shows that was a flawed call and Arsenal are very lucky! 4 min: Monreal scapers down the left to collect a pass from Ramsey. The Spaniard cuts the ball back from the byline to Ozil, who picks out Mkhitaryan near the middle. He has a bang from 10 yards but it flies into the sidenetting. Cracking move, though! 2 min: Ozil receives the ball mid-way inside the opposing half. He swivels and immediately looks to release Lacazette. But his threaded pass is cut out by Ignasheveich. 1 min: Arsenal kick off, Lacazette rolling the ball to Ozil. That’s a100% pass completion so far, stats fans. Here come the teams. Arsenal are wearing their traditional garb, while the visitors are all black, so the officials have plumped for yellow. I can’t see how close the Emirates is to being full but in terms of sound, the atmosphere is not exactly Anfield On A Big European Night – more like Anfield on an average Premier League afternoon. “This is an opportunity and we have to make it a great opportunity. It is a little bit tricky when you play the first game at home to find the balance between going forward and defending because of the weight of the away goal.” Asked whether it is a risk to reinstate Lacazette for a first start after a two-month lay-off following knee surgery, he says: “It is a little bit. Will he last the whole game? Certainly not. But Danny Welbeck had a back problem so the decision was easy.” Regarding the goalkeeper decision, he explains that Ospina suffered an ankle injury in training yesterday so it is not necessarily the case that Cech has been restored as the permanent No1 for this competition. No messing about from Wenger with this line-up. He’s even restored Cech in goal (with 23-year-old Matt Macey the back-up on the bench). Koscielny comes back into the side and so does Lacazette in place of the cup-tied Aubameyang. He’ll be up against a defence that has few peers for experience, at least. Other visitors they’ll have to be particularly wary of are Alan Dzagoev, an attacking midfielder who can be slinky on his day; and maybe Ahmed Musa, who may have made little impact while at Leicester but has enjoyed his best days in CSKA’s colours. Arsenal: Cech; Bellerin, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Mkhitaryan, Ramsey, Xhaka, Wilshere; Ozil; Lacazette Subs: Macey, Holding, Iwobi, Chambers, Welbeck, Kolasinac, Elneny CSKA: Akinfee; A Berezutski, Iganshevich, V Berezutski; Kuchaev, Golovin, Natcho, Dzagoev, Schennikov; Musa, Wernbloom Subs: Pmoazun, Milanov, Vitinho, Bistrovic, Chalov, Zhamaletdinov, Khosonov Referee: P Kralovec (Cze) Hello. Despite the howling rage that has soundtracked most of their season, Arsenal remain on the trophy trail. The Europa League would be a fine addition to the club’s cabinet, and to Arsène Wenger’s own palmarès, and also provide them with a shortcut back into the Champions League. So a lot rides on this game. Arsenal have seldom enjoyed visits from sides from Moscow sides. CSKA, indeed, became the first overseas side to stop Arsenal from scoring at the Emirates when they held them to a 0-0 draw in the group stages of the 2007 Champions League; and back in 1982 Spartak rocked up at Highbury for a Uefa Cup clash and won 5-2 with a performance that made Terry Neill’s pre-match warning about the dangers of the Russian team seem a tad understated (“they’re quite capable of sneaking a win if we do anything silly” said Arsenal’s manager, eschewing the routine of the time, which was to refer to every side from behind the Iron Curtain as a “crack outfit”). And Wenger will have noted that CSKA have already annoyed Frenchman on their travels this season, as they reached this stage by winning 1-0 at Lyon in the last round. In fact, CSKA, contrary to Arsenal, have generally been stronger on the road than at home this season, winning also at AEK Athens, Young Boys and Benfica. They even riled Manchester United for a moment when they took a lead at Old Trafford before losing 2-1 in this season’s Champions League group stages. So you could say that they’re quite capable of sneaking a win here if Arsenal do anything silly. ."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/08/mo-brixton-academy-observer-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T08:00:24Z","webTitle":"Mø review – plenty of swagger, but can the Danish star be the main feature?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/08/mo-brixton-academy-observer-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/08/mo-brixton-academy-observer-review","fields":{"headline":"Mø review – plenty of swagger, but can the Danish star be the main feature?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"At some point in the past decade, a young Danish creative stuck two of her initials together to create a moniker that, in Danish, doubles as the word “maiden” or “virgin”. In time – and it would take a couple of incarnations – Mø would become widely mispronounced. As with Björk, English speakers – including ticket touts for tonight’s gig – see an “ø” and say “oh”. And so 29-year-old Karin Marie Aagaard Ørsted Andersen – bouncing around in athleisure, a tracksuit top wrapped around her waist – is now widely known as “Moe”, rather than “Murr”. Online, her byline is MOMOMOYOUTH, further muddying the waters. Moreover, there are two distinct halves to Andersen’s career – the hugely listened-to featured artist, and the lesser-known, faintly leftfield pop auteur. It is an imbalance which 2018 is supposed to redress, if all goes to plan. Having an unpronounceable, tricky-to-type name, an alias and two strands to her work has, somehow, turned out not to be a major branding fail for Andersen. Glyphic monikers have always lent mystery; search engine optimisation means that idiosyncratic spellings can be a boon in the online clamour. People’s Twitter or Instagram feeds often go by a nickname, from @champagnepapi (that’s Drake) on down. It’s not a stretch, then, to imagine that read as “M.Ø.”, the name hints at something of a modus operandi too, so successful has Mø been at cracking the upper echelons of pop while retaining some core waywardness. A punky teenager, her previous outfit, MOR, played stroppy electronic tunes called things like Pussy in Your Face (2008). There are still tangible traces of that attitude in Mø tonight, ending her UK tour with a mammoth set heavy on newer songs, and no lack of energy. Before she was bolshy and emo, Mø was a Spice Girls fan who took their “girl power” at face value. So there are faint vestiges of Sporty Spice too, as Mø bounds around, gripping the mic and punching the air more like a rock star than a pop performer. The night is high on hits, but low on other pop signifiers: zero choreography, zero dancers, zero confetti cannon, no costume changes. (There are video backdrops, a new addition.). There remains an intriguing tension at play in what Mø does: it’s pop, but it’s also, often, not all that pop. Horns (canned ones) often figure in these songs, accompanied by black and white footage of just-so girls playing saxophones; you don’t get that with Miley Cyrus. Tonight’s first track is relatively new: the brooding Roots, from October’s When I Was Young EP, has sultry, jazz-noir overtones; it is rather a departure from those huge EDM-meets-tropical pop confections she is most famous for. Ultimately, many people are here because, in 2015, a song Mø sang – Lean On by Major Lazer &amp; DJ Snake – became the most-streamed track of all time on Spotify, “all time” being millennial-speak for, “since a few years ago when streaming became a thing”. Still: it was no paltry achievement; in 2017 that track was one of just four songs to have hit 1bn streams (another was @champagnepapi’s ubiquitous One Dance). The effect was rocket-like, catapulting Mø out of her reasonably successful milieu – her own fetching debut album, No Mythologies to Follow (2014), had both critical traction and a burgeoning audience – and into global renown. Moreover, Mø was not just the bought-in token female singing the hook (and writhing around in the video) of Lean On. She was one of its writers. As #MeToo, and recent court cases involving Taylor Swift and Kesha attest, the entertainment industry is a predatory snakepit, an ecosystem in part attributable to the disproportionate control exerted by men on the means of production. Norse teen Sigrid’s timely breakout hit of last year, Don’t Kill My Vibe, was inspired by her experience of being patronised by older male industry figures. There is still a long way to go, but the plethora of writer credits by artists like Mø (Charli XCX is a major player here) are finally making some inroads into that old model. For good (it has made her famous) and perhaps, ill (she still struggles to escape the G-force) Mø hit it off, professionally speaking, with Major Lazer hit-maker Diplo; he became a significant presence on her biggish 2015 single, Kamikaze, which gets a surge of love tonight. More recently, the two combined for another earworm of a tune, Get It Right, which came out in November. You can level all sorts of accusations at Diplo – cultural appropriation being a popular one, for this DJ who has mined every continent for sounds – but these big, dramatic tropical pop/EDM/R&amp;B fusions really shake a room; there are mass outbreaks of dancing. Moreover, Mø’s vocals rise to these big occasions tonight – not just audible, but pugnacious and elastic over the din of live drums, live bass-or-guitar and a hub full of electronic gear. Mø’s continued employability as a featured artist (she’s done loads) hinges on this very versatility – she can do R&amp;B cadences, not just the gauzy Europop of her early work. With that, Mø also brings a hard-to-define swagger, only emphasised when Andersen cut her long hair off mid-2017. Of all the somewhat interchangeable female voices in pop, Mø stands out. What, then, of her own output? Mø’s putative second album has been delayed for so long, it almost doesn’t matter any more. There are mixtapes, there are EPs, there are “projects”; Charli XCX puts things out as and when. This tour strives to reintroduce Mø as a standalone artist, and only partially succeeds. You get the feeling that, having got used to hugeness, Mø isn’t going back to her No Mythologies sound, which is logical, if perhaps just a bit of a shame. Tonight we get the light and shade of the rest of the When I Was Young EP, and a couple of new tracks, nestled away. Thematically, When I Was Young takes MOMOMOYOUTH’s young maidenhood and recasts it into long Scandinavian glances backwards at when she was really young. The title track might not have garnered quite as many streams as the Diplo co-write juggernauts but it’s not doing too shabbily (4m-plus YouTube views). Nostalgia, meanwhile, is a sung-talked tune about an early infatuation that, yes, brings out the tropical pop once more, but with a persuasive catch in Mø’s voice. Mercy – a new ballad – lacks any audible idiosyncrasies. Ultimately, it will take a definitive piece of work – a second album, say – to finally bring together the swirl of cross-currents that make up Mø, a composite pop star. For now, though, her swagger is just about enough."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/05/christopher-taylor-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T16:01:15Z","webTitle":"Christopher Taylor obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/05/christopher-taylor-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/05/christopher-taylor-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Christopher Taylor obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My former colleague Christopher Taylor, who has died aged 79, was a fine applied economist who served the Bank of England for 20 years. Although by training and instinct a Keynesian, sceptical of the claims of monetary control as a panacea, he was judicious in analysing the strengths and weaknesses of any argument. He saw inflation-targeting as a sensible goal of monetary policy but believed fiscal policy was the key to achieving an optimal balance of inflation and output. Chris was recruited to the Bank of England in 1974 by Christopher Dow. He spent eight years as head of the economics division, after a couple of years in Washington as the UK’s alternate executive director of the IMF. Later, as chief adviser in the European division, he explored the ramifications of European monetary integration, work he continued after retiring from the Bank in 1995, first at Chatham House and then at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. He published several articles and books on the subject. Chris was born in Mold, North Wales, to Doris (nee Bell) and John Taylor, a clerk. They spent the second world war years in Manchester, after which the impoverished family moved to Sheffield, where Chris won a scholarship to High Storrs grammar school for boys, becoming head boy, cricket captain and an exhibitioner at King’s College, Cambridge. His experience led him to be a firm believer in state action. After graduating with an economics degree in 1960, he spent five years in Montreal, obtaining an MA with distinction at McGill University while working as an economic researcher with Canadian Pacific Railway. There he met Rosemary Peel, a doctor; they married and returned to Cambridge in 1964 when he was offered a job at the department of applied economics, of which he later became deputy director. He also lectured in macroeconomics at the Judge Business School in Cambridge, and contributed substantially to a project to put an economics course online. His last book was as editor (with Graham Hacche) of Dow’s memoir, Inside the Bank of England, 2013. Rosemary died in 1995 of colon cancer. Soon afterwards Chris met Leslie Turano, then a fellow in Spanish at New College, Oxford, who was embarking on a new career as a lawyer. They married in 1999. His other major activity was conserving medieval buildings – he had moved a derelict barn to an Essex village and restored it as a prospective retirement home with Rosemary. Later he and Leslie bought and restored a guildhall in a village near Cambridge. Finally, he commissioned a beautiful modern house in the grounds of the guildhall, in the face of fierce local opposition. He is survived by Leslie, his children from his first marriage, Penny and Jonathan, and his twin grandchildren, Charlie and Ethan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/08/observer-sudoku","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T23:01:13Z","webTitle":"Observer sudoku","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/08/observer-sudoku","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/08/observer-sudoku","fields":{"headline":"Observer sudoku","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Click here to access the print version.

The stakes could not have been much higher than in the last encounter either, and the emphatic nature of Liverpool’s win in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final gives some credence to Klopp’s insistence that but for Sadio Mané’s unfortunate dismissal at the Etihad in September, Manchester City might not have skewed the balance of this season’s head‑to‑head contest in the Premier League by coasting to a 5-0 victory. Even taking that result into account, Klopp has won more games than he has lost against the City manager – seven wins and one draw from 13 meetings – and though Cook is able to boast an unassailable 100% record through his one-off FA Cup victory, no regular pitchside adversary of Guardiola’s can get anywhere close. Certainly José Mourinho, whose often overcooked personal rivalry with Guardiola was at its peak when the latter was in charge of Barcelona, has not succeeded in unnerving the City manager in the way Klopp has. When Mourinho brings Manchester United to the Etihad on Saturday it will be for his 21st meeting with a Guardiola team. From the 20 previous games Mourinho has four victories, with 10 defeats and six draws. Another defeat in a game that could see City crowned champions was widely assumed, though that was before the Guardiola gameplan was so spectacularly blown apart at Anfield. No one is suggesting for a moment that Mourinho is likely to copy Klopp’s tactics against City, with Romelu Lukaku asked to replicate Roberto Firmino’s pressing and movement, though United and their supporters can only be emboldened by the way the champions-elect have faltered right at the moment when everyone was expecting their supremacy to be rubber-stamped. Actually, faltered might not be a strong enough word. City were rumbled at Anfield and for a short time in the first half the elegant construction that has drawn praise from all quarters in a seemingly unstoppable glide towards the title was rattled in a way that has not been seen this season. Klopp was generous in victory, arguing that City did not play badly but were not allowed to create their usual number of chances, and he had a point. City did not play poorly by most teams’ standards but by the benchmark they have set for themselves, they were terrible. Even Guardiola left himself open to criticism. Selecting Ilkay Gündogan ahead of Raheem Sterling was a conservative ploy that Liverpool were able to exploit and not making changes to the system until almost an hour had been played and three goals conceded was hardly the sort of decisive interventionism that has earned the City manager such a cerebral reputation. Leroy Sané did not have a bad game, he just found himself up against an extremely capable full-back in Trent Alexander-Arnold, yet long after it had become obvious that City were not going to get any joy down the left wing that is where the ball kept going. The one opportunity that might have changed the game fell to Sané at 1-0, yet in keeping with an evening of poor decision-making the winger went for glory, with Kevin De Bruyne free in support, and failed even to hit the target. There was surprisingly little in the way of encouragement for City. Gabriel Jesus did not look the answer up front, where admittedly he was living on scraps, but he could have performed his high-pressing duties more effectively and should have been able to avoid a late booking. Nicolás Otamendi seemed to be affected by the Anfield atmosphere and reverted to his error-prone ways of last season while Sterling, unsurprisingly, was unable to answer the taunts of the crowd when he came on late to attempt to rescue a lost cause. The question, now that City have been exposed as light up front, porous at the back and less than tigerish in midfield, is not so much what United will do to them in the derby but how City themselves will react. With the second leg against Liverpool coming up on Tuesday there is suddenly no time for celebrating, even if City win the title against their neighbours and rivals. The likelihood that has to be faced is once again going out of Europe ahead of schedule – for all his tremendous Barcelona record, Guardiola has yet to reach a Champions League final with either of his two clubs outside Spain – and the way City are set up, indeed the way their manager thinks, mean even the Premier League title will be scant consolation should the European elite go unchallenged again. City won the Premier League under Manuel Pellegrini, after all. Bayern Munich won three Bundesliga titles under Guardiola but it was no more than was expected. For the very biggest clubs, which is how City want to see themselves even if this latest disappointment suggests they are still a work in progress, only the big‑eared trophy will do. Although it is not impossible to come back from a three-goal deficit, attempting to do so three days after playing a derby on which the domestic title might hinge ups the ante somewhat, and having to face Klopp’s Liverpool completes the tallest of orders. It has been a while since Liverpool have been able to regard themselves as one of the very biggest clubs, either in terms of financial resources or consistent achievement, though evidently their ability to pack a punch in Europe remains unchanged. They have exactly the right manager in place, enviable support and a bold spirit of adventure capable of taking them a long way. City may be closing in on a third title in seven years while Anfield is approaching 30 years in the wasteland, yet the stern lesson for the second leg is that when Liverpool come alive in Europe they can make even Guardiola and his players look like wannabes. • This article was amended to reflect the fact that Shakhtar Donetsk have beaten Manchester City this season."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/06/blackpool-struggles-kick-heroin-seaside-deprivation","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T14:15:06Z","webTitle":"Blackpool struggles to kick heroin amid seaside deprivation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/06/blackpool-struggles-kick-heroin-seaside-deprivation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/06/blackpool-struggles-kick-heroin-seaside-deprivation","fields":{"headline":"Blackpool struggles to kick heroin amid seaside deprivation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When Johnny first tried heroin in 1987 aged 15, he had been told the drug was a bit like cannabis. “If someone had said to me then, ‘See that bag of brown powder you’re picking up? Kiss goodbye to the next 30 years of your life’, I would have thought twice.” The 47-year-old has been off the drug for nine months and says he has never felt so well, but many of his friends have not been so lucky. Over the years he has been to the funerals of 19 people who have died from drug overdoses. “I hung around with 22 lads when I was growing up, and there are three of them left now,” he says. Johnny’s experience is not unique. His hometown, Blackpool, was one of seven coastal towns to feature in a list this week of 10 local authorities in England and Wales with the highest rates of heroin deaths, according to the Office for National Statistics. The Lancashire seaside resort tops that list and has recorded the highest rate of deaths involving heroin or morphine of any other council district since 2010. There were 14 heroin misuse deaths per 100,000 people in 2016, compared with the national average of 1.7 in England and 2.3 in Wales. That is almost twice as high as the borough with the next highest rate – Burnley, with 7.6 per 100,000. Arif Rajpura, Blackpool’s director of public health, says the high death rate was due to a number of factors, most of which were linked to poverty. The town has plenty of very cheap accommodation – often in former tourist guesthouses – which attracts hard-up people from surrounding areas. “Blackpool imports its ill health,” he says. “People are often running away from something. They’ve got a positive memory of Blackpool from visiting as a child and they see Blackpool as a place to go where they can find cheap housing.” The situation in the town, Rajpura says, is also part of a national picture in which heroin deaths have more than doubled between 2012 and 2016, from 579 to 1,201. He points to analysis by Public Health England that partly attributed the rising death rate to the increasingly frail “Trainspotting generation” – people who started using the drug in the late 80s and 90s and whose health has been ruined by decades of addiction. Gordon Marsden, the MP for Blackpool South, says the ability of local authorities such as Blackpool to deal with problems like drug abuse had been seriously hindered by cuts to council budgets. Blackpool council has lost £450m from its budget over the past seven years. “When you look at that in the context of a relatively small unitary authority – with a population of around 150,000 – that is a lot of money,” he says. Marsden is also keen to point out that the problems the town faces are shared with other coastal areas. Bournemouth, Portsmouth, Hastings, Thanet, Swansea and Neath Port Talbot also appear on the list of heroin death hotspots. “Seaside towns often have far more in common with each other, even if they’re 200 miles apart, than they have with towns that are 20 miles inland,” he says. It is a view shared by Will Jennings, a senior lecturer in politics at the University of Southampton and co-founder of the Centre for Towns, a thinktank that has highlighted the exodus of young people from smaller towns to find work in big cities. The demise of many British seaside towns cannot be viewed as part of the general trend of deindustrialisation that brought economic decline in some of their inland neighbours, he argues. “This is about a very long-term historical arc over 50 years,” says Jennings. “At a certain point in history, around 100 years ago, they were actually quite affluent leisure destinations.” The rise of foreign travel hit places like Blackpool, he says, and the fact that many seaside towns are poorly connected to big cities means young people have had to move away to find work. Ian Treasure, the service manager at the charity Blackpool Fulfilling Lives, insists the town is taking innovative steps to tackle its problems. “Every seaside town has this dichotomy of the glitzy promenade and then the problems behind the scenes, but the work that is going on in Blackpool is really making a difference.” The charity is one of scores of groups in the town working to help its most vulnerable residents. Established in 2014 in partnership with the national charity Addaction using £10m of lottery funding, it works with people who are struggling with mental health issues, drug addiction, and homelessness. Staff and volunteers, many of whom have had experience of drug addiction themselves, work with individuals to navigate the system and access services – accompanying them to appointments and helping them fill out forms. “Blackpool is serious about trying to reverse the tide on the negative publicity we’ve had because look around today, it’s wonderful,” Treasure says. “It’s sunny, it’s warm, there are people shopping. It’s a lovely place to be.” He thinks everybody in the town should feel a sense of responsibility to help address its drug problems. “I live in Blackpool and one of the things I find upsetting is when people say, ‘Oh, this town is a tip’, because what are they doing to try and change things? Everybody has a role to play.” These days Johnny spends his time volunteering at Blackpool Fulfilling Lives, and is learning to drive. “I want to carry on volunteering for a bit and then work and get a job,” he says. “I want to help people turn their lives around, like people have helped me.” Although he has not always had the best time in Blackpool, he enjoys living there. “I love the atmosphere. I love the people. I loved growing up here. My family are here and I would never leave. I had bad times here, but that was my own doing. It was nothing to do with Blackpool.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/06/football-transfer-rumours-monaco-djibril-sidibe-manchester-united-luke-shaw-tottenham","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T08:06:46Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Monaco's Djibril Sidibé to Manchester United?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/06/football-transfer-rumours-monaco-djibril-sidibe-manchester-united-luke-shaw-tottenham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/06/football-transfer-rumours-monaco-djibril-sidibe-manchester-united-luke-shaw-tottenham","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours:  Monaco's Djibril Sidibé to Manchester United?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Mill has no doubt about who’ll be getting it in the neck if Manchester City get over their rocky coach ride outside Anfield by wrapping up the title with victory over Manchester United on Saturday evening: step forward Luke Shaw, José Mourinho’s No 1 fall guy! Ee might be witnessing the last knockings of Shaw’s Old Trafford career, however, because it looks as if Mourinho’s favourite whipping boy will be leaving this summer. Shaw is a target for Tottenham Hotspur and United hope to replace the left-back with Monaco’s Djibril Sidibé. Tottenham’s Danny Rose, Juventus’s Alex Sandro and Celtic’s Kieran Tierney are alternative options, while Mourinho is also mulling over a move for Fabinho, one of Sidibe’s Monaco team-mates. It seems there are going to be a few changes at United, who only need one more window to get all their ducks in a row, or maybe two, or three, or maybe even four – it really depends on whether their puny football heritage continues to undermine them. Anyway, Juan Mata will be turfed out and replaced by Chelsea’s Willian, while Juventus are monitoring Anthony Martial’s contractual situation. Martial’s contract runs out in the summer of 2019 and the forward has fallen down the pecking order since Alexis Sánchez’s arrival in January. Juventus are also mulling over a swoop for another French attacker. Atlético Madrid’s Antoine Griezmann could be theirs if they play their cards right, although the 27-year-old is also a target for Barcelona. Paris Saint-Germain plan to replace the disappointing Unai Emery with Thomas Tuchel, but West Brom have made it clear that they have no interest in filling their managerial vacancy with Mick McCarthy this summer. Arsenal have decided that they need to bolster their defence and will sign Borussia Dortmund’s Sokratis Papastathopoulos, while the plunder of Monaco will go on when Liverpool sign Christian Koffi, who has been dubbed the new Sadio Mané."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/06/swimmers-and-cyclists-drive-australia-to-top-of-commonwealth-medal-table","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T14:17:29Z","webTitle":"Swimmers and cyclists drive Australia to top of Commonwealth medal table","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/06/swimmers-and-cyclists-drive-australia-to-top-of-commonwealth-medal-table","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/06/swimmers-and-cyclists-drive-australia-to-top-of-commonwealth-medal-table","fields":{"headline":"Swimmers and cyclists drive Australia to top of Commonwealth medal table","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia’s Dolphins have kickstarted the host nation’s Games with an impressive six gold, four silver and four bronzes on day two to drive Australia to the top of the medal table. Two quinellas and a remarkable third-ever clean sweep in the women’s 100m butterfly have capped a dominant night in the pool, with medals also arriving in the velodrome, weightlifting and gymnastics. In a field boasting the South African Chad Le Clos and England’s James Guy, Australia’s Rio golden boys Kyle Chalmers and Mack Horton led the way, chasing down the fast-starting Le Clos to deliver an impressive one-two finish in the men’s 200m freestyle. Both the sprint specialist and the long distance star finished strongly in a result that pleased Chalmers and delighted a vocal home crowd. “We had a race plan and we stuck to it really well”, said Chalmers. “The third 50 felt pretty strong, and I knew I had a bit to give in that last 50. I could see [Guy] coming at me, but it’s awesome to go one-two with one of my best mates.” Mitch Larkin and Bradley Woodward then delivered a second Australian quinella in the men’s 100m backstroke but the result of the evening came in the women’s 100m butterfly – a pet race of Australian greats such as Susie O’Neill and Petria Thomas – where Emma McKeon and Madeleine Groves both put aside recent adversity and injury to sweep the medals alongside Brianna Throssell. James Magnussen notched a third consecutive Commonwealth Games gold in the men’s 4x100m freestyle relay as the men echoed the exploits of their female counterparts from day one in grabbing gold, while an exuberant Clyde Lewis produced one of the personal bests of the Games thus far, shaving 3.5sec off his previous mark for gold in the men’s 400m individual medley. The local boy’s post-race interview was cut short as the colour appeared to visibly drain from Lewis’s face, as exhaustion and lactic acid took hold. Asked to describe how he was feeling, only one word came out: “Obliterated.” In the velodrome, Stephanie Morton repeated her day-one success in the women’s sprint, firstly defeating team partner Kaarle McCullouch in the semi-final before proving too strong for New Zealand’s Natasha Hansen in a final where she led from front wheel. In 2014 Morton delivered one of the upsets of the Glasgow Games, beating Anna Meares in the same event, and with the “queen of the boards” watching on in the arena that now bears her name it was only fitting that it was Meares’ successor Morton who recorded Australia’s 100th track cycling Commonwealth Games gold. Matt Glaetzer added a second gold in quick succession in the men’s keirin with Scotland’s Katie Archibald maintaining her cadence brilliantly to relegate Rebecca Wiasak to silver in the women’s 3000m individual pursuit, in which Annette Edmonson also claimed bronze in an all-Australian clash with Ashley Ankudinoff. On the floor, Australia put wobbles on the beam behind them to finish with bronze in the women’s team final behind Canada and England, but the performance of the night came in Carrara, at the weightlifting. Dubbed the “world’s fittest woman” after winning the 2017 CrossFit Games, Tia-Clair Toomey successfully made the transition to weightlifting with dual PBs in both the snatch and the clean and jerk components to take gold ahead of the favourite, Canada’s Tali Darsigny, in a display of tenacity that in retrospect almost appeared inevitable. After the medal presentation Brisbane-born Toomey was reduced to tears at the memory of her cousin, Jade, who died tragically in a car accident last week. “She was there lifting that barbell with me … that was dedicated to her,” said an emotional Toomey, who made six clean lifts, 87kg in the snatch and 114kg in the clean and jerk to take gold in an event that has evaded Australia since Melbourne 2006. Australia have 36 medals in all, with 14 gold thus far, ahead of traditional rivals England in second place with nine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/07/a-league-western-sydney-wanderers-v-brisbane-roar-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T09:43:42Z","webTitle":"A-League: Western Sydney Wanderers 2-2 Brisbane Roar - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/07/a-league-western-sydney-wanderers-v-brisbane-roar-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/07/a-league-western-sydney-wanderers-v-brisbane-roar-live","fields":{"headline":"A-League: Western Sydney Wanderers 2-2 Brisbane Roar - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A denouement in the end as Wanderers proved far too strong during that opening stanza. The in-form Roar huffed and puffed, but displayed nowhere near the final-third precision of their counterparts, and their fans will be left to rue a first half where they were second best in almost every department. Clinical finishing, three bullet headers and inch-perfect delivery from the Wanderers, and when they needed him most their marquee man Oriel Riera stood tall to head home just his second brace of the season. Ikonomidis was immense, with Cejudo also putting in one of the more lively performances of his season. In fact there weren’t too many in red-and-black who weren’t at the top of their game. The win sees Wanderers leapfrog both Roar and the Glory back into that all-important sixth place. It sets up an intriguing last round as those two sides then lock horns, with the Wanderers able to take in that result before their final round trip to Adelaide. Nevertheless, all three sides still with the potential to make the A-League finals. It’s set up nicely for one of the more interesting last round fixtures in recent memory. Thanks for your company tonight – more enjoyable for those not bleeding orange I imagine. We’ll see you back here anon as the A-League ramps up for its finals series! That’s all she wrote! Well, Josep Gombau called for a reaction after a disappointing loss against the Victory last week, and with the season literally on the line, his men in red-and-black have well-and-truly done the business. 90 min: Three minutes of added time, and the Roar look to fashion something at the death from a corner. Bautheac with a decent ball, but Riera rises well to showcase his heading prowess at both ends. Mandatory close up of JA on the Roar bench who isn’t quite chewing wasps, but certainly looks the less happy of the two bosses. 87 min: Gameiro tries to fire an effort goalwards, but the Roar attacker fails to connect cleanly. Wanderers happy to run the clock down from here, they don’t seem too plussed about chasing any additional goals. 85 min: Holman still buzzing around, the Roar have looked notably sharper since his involvement. You forget he’s only 34 sometimes such is the grizzled cro-magnon auro the boy from Bankstown eludes. He’s at the heart of most attacks for the Roar lately, but they’re just not sticking. 82 min: Deary me. VAR has had it’s say, and no doubt Aloisis John or Ross will have theirs about that post match or midweek. Maccarone looked to have marked his tenth of the season after a clever leave from Holman, but the Australian was deemed to have interfered from play from an offside position. Tough on the Roar. One of those that’s probably technically correct, but sides have got away previously. 80 min: Holman looks for Maccarone once more, but his bisecting pass has just too much on it for the veteran. Brisbane come again – despite the comfortable lead Gombau will be wary of his side sitting back.. 78 min: Big chance, Roar! Holman clear in the box, he waits for a lumbering Maccarone to join the fray, but he can’t hold off any longer and fires a disappointing shot-cross that is deflected anyway. They need to make these count, Brisbane. At least one goal here could still rattle their hosts. 75 min: O’Toole on for Franjic the final substitute from Aloisi. Still plenty to play for in the final fifteen minutes of this one, as should Wanderers hold on, goal difference could yet come into play next week. And it’s Santalab on.. for Carrusca. Josep bottles it. Great chance to sub Riera and reignite the A-League’s favourite player-coach rolling spat. 72 min: McKay tigerish as ever as he wins it back inside the Wanderers’ back third, but Bautheac can’t fashion a shooting opportunity. Gombau goes to the bench, and its an appreciative hand from the home fans for Baccus Snr who got through a power of work. He makes way for Lustica. 70 min: FBK makes way – on comes Gameiro as Aloisi looks to fresh legs. Baby Baccus with a driven effort; not the worst that, it certainly had enough on it to capture the attentions of Young in the Roar goal. 68 min: Lively stuff from Ikonomidis! He’s leading the Roar defence on a merry dance and fires a tempting cross across the face; but Riera had peeled deep and there was nobody else there to tap home! 65 min: Shot! Holman! For half a second that looked very ominous for home fans, as the experienced former-Socceroo jinked inside onto his dangerous left peg, but he didn’t quite get the strike he would have liked. On target, but safe enough for Janjetovic. This is really starting to open up. 64 min: Riera with a bending effort.. but it drifts wide of the far post! He’s up for this hattrick tonight. Ooh, go on Josep. Sub him off just for giggles. 62 min: Baby Baccus in the book. Bad Baby Baccus! An accumulation of fouls there, and again it’s a set-piece opportunity for the Roar. Maccarone with the initial flick, but it evades an on-rushing Franjic at the far post. They need to make some of these half-chances count if they’re to find anything here tonight, the Roar. 60 min: Skipper for the evening Hamill goes in the book for an ‘agricultural’ slide on Maccarone. Bit grim getting done for pace by a guy who’s older than Yoda, but there you go. Ikonomidis keeping the Roar looking over their shoulder though with a fast break that had Brisbane’s backline scrambling. 57 min: FBK with a cheeky effort from distance. Technically a set-piece, and nominally intended for Maccarone who had peeled to the near post, but you almost suspect the Tunisian was hedging his bets there. A goal would make things a wee intriguing here, especially with the firepower of Holman and Maccarone on the pitch. 55 min: Shot! It’s Hingert who sends his boot through a loose ball, following decent work from Maccarone. It flicks the side netting, and Pepper heads the subsequent corner wide. Aloisi, John has seen enough – it’s Holman on for a subdued Henrique. 52 min: Maccarone with the spectacular! He attempts the overhead but doesn’t quite connect cleanly. It was a mis-struck clearance from Baby Baccus that provided the opportunity but the former Middlesborough man couldn’t capitalise. Meanwhile at the other end, it’s a terrific clearance from Hingert that denies Riera his hattrick! Teasing stuff from Western Sydney once more. 50 min: Some intricate stuff here from the hosts. The balance of double Baccus appears to have given Cejudo a touch more freedom to strut his stuff between the Roar lines as he rotates with Carrusca to evade the defensive attention of McKay and Kristensen. 47 min: Post! A mazy dribble from Cejudo and a clever backheel finds Ikonomidis. He rolls a well-placed effort and Young watches in relief as it just flicks the base of his lefthand upright on its way wide. They’ve picked up where they’ve left off, Western Sydney. 45 min: And we’re back! No changes from either side at HT, but you can imagine the vastly experience Brett Holman isn’t too far away for the visitors. So that’s that. Any bold Oranje fans out there willing to stake their reputation that their lads can reel this one back? Hopefully some of the RBB faithful have snuck in tonight incognito, because it would be a shame to have missed this first half performance. Meanwhile, chapeau this man. 45 min: So ends a remarkable half of A-League action! How’d you see that one – were Roar poor, or Wanderers just too clinical? Either way it’s a commanding lead in the battle for the top six. Poor John Aloisi will be either thumbing through a Churchill quotes book or sending brother Ross to find old VHS tapes of Wollongong Wolves v Perth Glory to inspire their team from here. Cripes. 45 min: Frustration from the Roar defence here as Pepper goes in heavily on Carrusca and earns the ire of referee Ams for his efforts. Into the book, sir. It’s another dangerous set-piece opportunity, and this time it’s Ikonomidis who looks like he fancies it. What can he fashion.. But the wall stands tall! 42 min: Wowee. Where’s this been from the Wanderers?! They’ve been largely hit and miss over the last seven rounds, with only two four-goal hauls against Wellington Phoenix to show for their efforts. But they’re putting the in-form Roar to the sword here! 39 min: Deary me – forget a two-goal buffer, Wanderers have gone again! The hosts opening up the Roar seemingly at will; Carrusca with space and almost finds Riera for a tap-in from about 2m out. It evades the Spaniard but his compatriot Llorente recycles with a terrific improvised outside of the boot jabbed-cross and this time it’s the Socceroo applying the bullet header. Gee, they’re finishing with aplomb from the noggin tonight, the Wanderers! 36 min: Wanderers now looking reasonably comfortable here – indeed Gombau will be understandably impressed if his side can go in with a two-goal lead given how much is at stake on tonight’s game. Another set piece from Carrusca and again he’s whipped it dangerously into the ‘corridor of uncertainty’. The veteran Maccarone does well defensively to prevent it reaching Riera once again. 33 min: Baby Baccus in strongly on FBK and referee Kurt Ams blows for the foul. That looks like something that coach Gombau might have perhaps emphasised pre-game – getting good pressure around Brisbane’s No.10 for the night to deny him the space to dictate proceedings. 30 min: Wanderers resolute as Roar fire in a dangerous cross, but its comfortably defended. A touch of sitting on their heels perhaps from the hosts, as Brisbane enjoy their best spell of the match, territory &amp; possession wise. 27 min: Bautheac with half a chance for the Roar, but his decision making lets him down. He’s been lively across the season, but for a man of his pedigree many fans in orange might be a touch disappointed by his end product this campaign. Just the two goals for the Frenchman. 24 min: So seven shots to one to the hosts, so far – a seemingly fair reflection of their dominance across the first quarter of this one. What can the brothers Aloisi do to fire their chargers back into this one? 21 min: FBK and Bautheac try to combine for the Roar with a clever flicked one-two inside the box, but the French speakers have overcooked that one slightly, and Ben Khalfallah is adjudged offside. 18 min: Well, how bout this. The season on the line, and the Wanderers’ top man has delivered! He’s no Dino Kresinger, sure, but he’s well and truly earned a handshake from his beleaguered coach tonight, has Riera. They’ve not seen eye-to-eye those two, but unless the Catalan hooks him, you’d imagine it will be all smiles on that front tonight. 15 min: Ooh, he’s up for this one! Terrific pinpoint cross from Carrusca once more, this time from live play, and Riera has thumped another fine header. Young gets a strong hand to deny the Spaniard, but can only watch haplessly on as the ball falls kindly to the feet of Riera who duly tucks home. And he’s equalled the best ever return for a Wanderers striker with his 14th of the campaign! 12 min: It’s Wanderers very much in the ascent early on as Cejudo and Ikonomidis continue to probe around the box. That said, another sharp transition and Maccarone’s found FBK in behind Clisby! The Tunisian fires a strong shot.. but Janjetovic is equal to the task and holds well! 9 min: Shot block! Fine positional awareness from Pepper to deny Cejudo. Wanderers with a well-worked effort as Risdon picked out his Spanish teammate, whose driven shot was well anticipated by the Roar utility. 6 min: A long ball direct pass almost finds Maccarone through, but the Roar veteran isn’t able to make the most. At 38 he’s not exactly noted for his pace but with nine goals this campaign he’s more than silenced many of the knockers, has the Italian. 4 min: Phwoar! Hello, boys. A wickedly whipped ball from Carrusca, and it’s given some from the Spanish marquee! What a header! From just inside the 18 yard box he’s given that the full crane of the neck and thumped it past Young between the sticks. Just the start for Gombau and the home fans! 3 min: A fine dispossession from Baccus Snr almost launches a counter-attack for the hosts, but Pepper in his continued role of makeshift centre back sees the danger away comfortably. A cheap foul though gives Carrusca a set piece opportunity – what can Wanderers make from this? 1 min: Two enter, only one will leave! (ish) Wanderers get us underway – Riera with an early touch before Ikonomidis rolls a very early effort goalwards, but it’s comfortably collected in the Roar goal by Young. We’re not too far away from kick-off, your tips ahead of this one? Wanderers have done an impressive job of looking decent but not necessarily getting the biscuit in recent months, whereas Roar have shown every millimetre of their experience to grab some decent results. Will the experience of FBK, Maccarone, McKay et al see the Roar home? Or will Baby Baccus and their fancy Spanish buddies run over their visitors? Our learned comrades at FoxSports have just called a Brisbane clean sweep. Let us know your thoughts! Kia ora koutou! Good evening all. Rich Parkin here in the chair to take you through what bills as a decisive clash tonight. There’ll be some nervous WSW fans inside the cavernous ANZ Stadium tonight that’s for sure, with their side’s season hanging by a thread. As always, nobody enjoys travelling in the quiet carriage – so if you’re keen to join tonight’s coverage fire us a tweet or email. Quips, musings, reflections welcome. Before we get going though, some team news: Wanderers: Janjetovic (gk); Llorrente, Clisby, Hamill (c), Risdon; Keanu Baccus, Kearyn Baccus, Carrusca; Cejudo, Ikonomidis, Riera Bench: Suman (gk), Lustica, Santalab, Sotirio, Mourdoukoutas Roar: Young (gk); Hingert, Bowles, Pepper, Franjic; McKay (c), Kristensen, Bautheac, Henrique, Ben Khalfallah, Maccarone Bench: White (gk), O’Toole, Oxborrow, Gameiro, Holman In a season that’s been dominated by off-field headlines it’s refreshing to preview a match that holds genuine fascination with the stuttering Western Sydney Wanderers playing host to the fast-finishing Brisbane Roar. Wanderers have won just one in their last six in a season that’s seemingly stumbled ever since foundational coach Tony Popovic sensationally left the club on the eve of the season. Conversely, the much-maligned ‘Dad’s Army’ from Queensland have put together an impressive run in recent weeks as they enter this clash unbeaten in four, with coach John Aloisi and his staff performing apparent miracles given some of the club’s off-field machinations this season. With two rounds to play Wanderers have slipped to an unlikely 8th position, with Perth Glory’s shock upset of second-placed Newcastle Jets opening up a fascinating three-way tussle for what is presumably the last-remaining finals spot. The equation is simple – lose tonight and Josep Gombau’s expensively assembled squad will be receiving an off-season early mark, joining Wellington Phoenix and Central Coast Mariners in the spectator seats. Win, and the hosts will set up a tantalising last round battle that will set both Brisbane and Perth against each other, before the Wanderers then face Gombau’s old club, Adelaide with their destiny in their own hands. A proper cup final therefore – don’t miss a single kick as we take you through all the action here, from 5.30pm (AEDT) onwards."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/11/country-diary-waterscape-rewilded-river-tern","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T04:30:49Z","webTitle":"Country diary: a waterscape rewilded","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/11/country-diary-waterscape-rewilded-river-tern","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/11/country-diary-waterscape-rewilded-river-tern","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: a waterscape rewilded","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Marsh marigold flowers, orbs of sunshine yellow, are held on stems just above the water. Caltha palustris, the goblet-shaped flower of the marsh, named Mary-gold or marigold, is a great buttercup with kidney-shaped leaves. Some here are submerged and the river Tern is still rising over them. Beery and slow, the Tern rises above the celandine banks and spills into woods of alder and willow; it rises up the buttresses of oaks fattened like bells from centuries of flooding; it rises over fields and forces through bridge arches pulling the rug from under the earth; and its bubbles trail towards the confluence with the Severn like flowers of light. On this, the brightest, warmest day of the year so far, there is a darkness in the backwaters of the swamp. Under leafless trees, some standing gauntly, others fallen half drowned, the marsh marigolds reclaim an ancient place that belongs to a time before rivers and the land they flow through were so engineered. Rising from the slough is an idea, older than the deer park at Attingham, older than the name Tern or Tearne: the Welsh Tren, means strong, powerful, a river that wanders, braids and pools; a river at liberty. This is a waterscape that should hear the slap of a beaver’s tail and the splash of elk; it has rewilded itself, conjuring ghosts from rain and the boggy corners of a watershed drained, farmed and built on for centuries. And yet the strong river gathers an unstoppable flow, finds the old eel channels and pooling places and, despite the loss of creatures it once had, recreates its own world and time for when they return. This Tern, unlike the one that loiters in its surly ditch from Market Drayton to Atcham for most of the year, is the reason we should abdicate our responsibility and set rivers free. Floods are a form of ecological restoration, reinvigorating the moors and making gloriously anarchic swamps where animals and plants that remain part of the river’s memory can be brought back, this is what the marsh marigolds say, shining above the rising waters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/06/what-can-the-liberal-party-do-about-its-talent-problem","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T07:11:42Z","webTitle":"What can the Liberal party do about its talent problem? | Van Badham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/06/what-can-the-liberal-party-do-about-its-talent-problem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/06/what-can-the-liberal-party-do-about-its-talent-problem","fields":{"headline":"What can the Liberal party do about its talent problem?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"London, 7 February 1769 may seem a distant place to begin a discussion about the troubles of Australia’s Liberal party. Bear with me. In the context of recent events, lessons in both history and the political usefulness of a long memory have become imperative. That particular date marks the publication of a letter in The Public Advertiser, where a writer known as Junius drubbed the ministry of King George III. “If the affections of the colonies have been alienated,” he mocked, “if Corsica has been shamefully abandoned, if commerce languishes, if public credit is threatened with new debt, and your own Manilla ransom must be dishonourably given up, it has all been owing to the malice of political writers, who will not suffer the best and brightest characters ... to take a single right step, for the honour or interest of the nation.” The habit of those with power to blame others for their haplessness, is of course, somewhat more than 249 years old. Yet to observe its persistence, one need look no further than the Twitter account of backbench MP Tony Abbott – once upon a time, prime minister. Last week he laid into commentator Peter van Onselen accusations of “unsubstantiated bile”, demanding to know “if my office was so hopeless why is my former deputy COS (chief of staff) now director of the Liberal Party ...?” This exhibition of behaviour is so antique it borders on the charming. Abbott’s real problem is that van Onselen has already answered his question, as well as affirmed the resonance of Junius to the political moment. The pretext given by Malcolm Turnbull for rolling Abbott from the prime ministership was Abbott’s loss of 30 consecutive Newspolls. Turnbull has just endured a 29th defeat, the backbench are restless and the ghost of John Howard has stirred from its crypt to give advice. But van Onselen’s of the opinion that Turnbull “needn’t worry”. “There is no challenger this time around,” he said, “not even a viable alternative.” Old Junius’ invocation of “the best and brightest” to mean somewhat the opposite – the first recorded instance of the phrase – is the crux of the Liberal party’s contemporary problem. Because van Onselen is right: even if a challenger emerges, who’ve the Liberals really got? Leaving aside the obligation for a prime minister to be drawn from the lower house, and not the Senate, let’s Fantasy Football the available players for a poll-turnaround challenge match. Julie Bishop? Christian Porter? Peter “Dead to Me” Dutton? Michaelia Cash is bedevilled by press questions about those AWU raids . Matt Canavan thinks he was elected to the Senate by an electorate entirely of coal barons. Alan Tudge transformed Centrelink from a service provider into a digitised fiasco. Scott Morrison seemingly enjoys creative interpretation on the subject of economic “facts”. Their individual failures are within inept company. As I write this, a movement of Coalition MPs are insisting Australia should open more coal-fired power stations. In policy terms, they might as well holler “the future is farthingales!” or demand greater government investment in wig powder, the industry of the now. It’s kinda threadbare. How it got to this isn’t even a question of an ideological “my-side-good-their-side-bad” polarity so much as the logical consequence of the ideology the Liberals hold. After the economy was transitioned to a neoliberal framework in the 1970s and 80s by successive Liberal and Labor governments, the Howard Coalition government’s record-breaking wealth transfer to the rich in the 1990s was a crowning structural achievement for the party of big business, creating conditions beyond favourable to their base. If one is a private-wealth-oriented, small-government, corporate Tory of any talent, taking a massive pay cut to pursue public office lacks logical appeal, especially now that the “pollie’s pension” is gone. Alan Joyce is banking $25m a year. Execs of lower-level enterprises bring home more than an MP does. Yes, Turnbull and other wealthy Liberals may indeed have enough pre-existing fortune to indulge politics as a personal interest, but vanity projects are rarely popular and 29 losing Newspolls tend to agree. Of all the political movements represented in the parliament, only pro-business conservatives lose more from representing their constituency than joining it. Let’s not limit analysis of the malaise to federal politics, so much as a rot movement-wide. On Good Friday, Victorian opposition leader, Matthew Guy, ratted on a pairing deal with the Labor party. By sneaking back into the chamber two members who’d earlier pled to be excused for religious observance, he gained two extra numbers in a vote at the expense of generations of parliamentary convention. He has bragged about doing so, and said he would do it again. Guy would be rewarded with a read of The Best and Brightest. The 1972 book chronicles how a handpicked generation of American policymakers with “brilliant policies that defied common sense” mired that nation in the ongoing disaster of the Vietnam war. One suggests – without malice – that if your best just ain’t that bright, Corsica is the least of your problems, and political disaster historically inevitable.

Initially, the editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, defended Williamson, writing in a memo to staff that he did not believe “taking a person’s worst tweets ... in isolation is the best journalistic practice”. But after the release of a podcast in which Williamson talked at length about hanging women, the writer was fired, and Goldberg admitted “that the original tweet did, in fact, represent [Williamson’s] carefully considered views”. “The tweet was not merely an impulsive, decontextualized, heat-of-the-moment post, as Kevin had explained it,” he wrote. As Maya Angelou says: “When people show you who they are, believe them.” Expressing a belief in a tweet – or on Facebook or Instagram – does not make that belief any less yours. That’s why I found it so odd when New York Times columnist Bret Stephens wrote an open letter to Williamson this weekend, apologizing to him over having his character “assassinated”. “I jumped at your abortion comment, but for heaven’s sake, it was a tweet. When you write a whole book on the need to execute the tens of millions of American women who’ve had abortions, then I’ll worry,” Stephens wrote. I wonder, on the scale of tweet to book, where podcast lies. I agree with Goldberg that a person’s worst tweets don’t sum up who they are. But there is a difference between “just a tweet” and a belief. What Williamson tweeted (and doubled down on many times over Twitter and the podcast) was not a bad joke or a even a cruel comment dashed off in anger. It was a political position – and the Atlantic had a decision to make over whether it believed that political position was within the norms of reasonable critical debate. Whether or not they wanted to expand their definition of acceptable discourse to include “hanging women”. Sharon Kann, abortion rights and reproductive health program director for Media Matters, who helped unearth the podcast of Williamson talking about his “soft spot for hanging”, told me that her team “sees a wide variety of horrible rightwing commentary about abortion providers, patients and clinics every day”, but that she was “truly shocked about how callous he was”. The truth, of course, is that Williamson never should have been hired in the first place; the Atlantic and Goldberg knew about Williamson’s belief about executing women who had abortions and brought him on anyway. They knew they would be forcing the women at the magazine – some of whom we can assume have had abortions – to sit in an office with a man who wanted them dead. I understand the desire, especially now, to have ideologically diverse publications. But that can be done without sacrificing integrity. No one is entitled to column inches, and every day publications draw lines about what opinions they consider unworthy of publishing. Surely we can all agree that this particular line was an important enough one to uphold.

Is he ready for it?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Mark Zuckerberg would like you to know one thing – Facebook messed up. During a rare press conference last week, Zuckerberg was grilled by journalists over Facebook’s privacy lapses. His message was consistent: mistakes were made, he takes responsibility and the company has made sweeping changes to better protect user data. “We didn’t take a broad enough view of what our responsibility is, and that was a huge mistake. It was my mistake,” he said. While some of the questions were tough, it was merely a dress rehearsal for a much more consequential grilling in Washington DC this week. On Tuesday, Zuckerberg will testify before a joint hearing of the Senate commerce and judiciary committees over data misuse, following revelations that Cambridge Analytica acquired millions of profiles of US citizens and used it to build a software program to predict and influence voters. The next day, Zuckerberg will testify on the same topic before the House energy and commerce committee. Taking the stand will be a major test for Zuckerberg’s communication skills. Unlike when he deals with the media, his public relations team won’t be there to cherry-pick questions from friendly parties. And Congress wants its pound of flesh. “Congress is theatre. More than what they are going to want to learn [about the data lapses], they are going to want to inflict pain. They are going to want to be seen as being responsive to public disgruntlement with how Facebook handled the issue,” said Ari Ratner, founder of communications consultancy Inside Revolution and former Obama administration official. Adam Hodge, a crisis communications veteran from SKDKnickerbocker, agrees. “I expect members of Congress are going to grill him intensely and if they feel like they aren’t getting straight answers they are going to lose their patience pretty quickly,” he said. Zuckerberg will want to come across as authentic and apologetic, and will, according to his testimony published on Monday, highlight the sweeping changes that the company has announced already to its privacy tools and to the way third parties can access data on the platform as well as a verification process for political advertisers and page administrators. He will probably also want to talk about Facebook’s global compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a broad set of privacy protections being introduced in the European Union in May. “He clearly has to deeply, personally apologise and hope he will satisfy and blunt any attempt at US regulation,” said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy. “He does not want to see strong regulatory oversight.” Although Zuckerberg will likely continue to blame “bad actors” misusing the platform, it will be difficult to deflect questions about Facebook’s core business model of continually tracking and monetising individuals and their relationships. “This is a long-standing problem, not a bug in the Facebook system. It’s a feature,” said Robyn Caplan, a researcher at Data &amp; Society, pointing out that Facebook lured third-party developers by offering them access to user data. “The main issue is not whether or not entities have individual data but how that data is being used. How are advertisers or political campaigns using that data to come back onto the Facebook system and seed content to particular users,” she added. “We know very little about how this targeting works.” Chester agrees: “People have no idea what is operating behind the Facebook curtain. They don’t know about data mining, analytics and digital ad practices,” he said. The company is pouring money into its defence, hiring US law firm WilmerHale, led by Reginald Brown, previously a special adviser to President George W Bush, to coach Zuckerberg on the best strategies for handling the heat, according to the New York Times. At the same time Facebook is bolstering its lobbying capabilities. The company spent almost $12m on lobbying in 2017 and is currently on a “hiring spree” for policy communications specialists. In spite of this investment, Zuckerberg can’t expect an easy ride – as the bosses of other companies in industries facing public and political ire have found. One tactic policymakers might use is to fixate on tiny symbolic details that might tarnish Facebook rather than questions that go to the core of the problem. This happened in 2008 when the CEOs of Ford, Chrysler and General Motors took private jets to Washington to request taxpayer bailout money. “They came to discuss the fate of a major industry and Congress hit them on ‘why did you fly here?’” said Ratner. “He’s going to have to be prepared for that.” A few rounds of public humiliation might just be the price Zuckerberg has to pay to appease regulators, provided he is generous with his time and detailed and contrite in his responses. The only real imminent regulatory threat to his company is the Federal Trade Commission’s investigation, which could lead to huge fines. “Symbolically he’s going to be taken to the political woodshed, but will probably be let off without any serious consequences at a federal level,” said Chester."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/05/trump-china-trade-war-new-tariff-proposal-100-billion","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T06:06:55Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump considering new $100bn tariff on Chinese goods as trade feud escalates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/05/trump-china-trade-war-new-tariff-proposal-100-billion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/05/trump-china-trade-war-new-tariff-proposal-100-billion","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump considering new $100bn tariff on Chinese goods as trade feud escalates","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump has instructed the US trade representative to consider slapping $100bn in additional tariffs on Chinese goods in an escalating standoff over trade. Trump said in a statement on Thursday that the further tariffs were being considered “in light of China’s unfair retaliation” against earlier US trade actions. He added that the US trade representative had determined that China “has repeatedly engaged in practices to unfairly obtain America’s intellectual property”. The White House said Trump had instructed the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the agency responsible for developing and recommending trade policy, to consider whether the additional tariffs would be appropriate under section 301 and, if so, to identify which products they should apply to. He’s also instructed his secretary of agriculture “to implement a plan to protect our farmers and agricultural interests”. “Rather than remedy its misconduct, China has chosen to harm our farmers and manufacturers,” Trump said. Trump argues China’s trade practices have led to the closure of American factories and the loss of millions of American jobs. On Friday China’s commerce ministry said Beijing would fight the US “at any cost”. China’s state-run tabloid Global Times called Trump’s latest threat “ridiculous” in an editorial on Thursday, noting that it “reflects the deep arrogance of some American elites in their attitude towards China”. Trump’s move comes one day after China issued a $50bn list of US goods including soybeans and small aircraft for possible tariff hikes. That itself was 11 hours after the White House announced a list of 1,333 Chinese imports, also worth about $50bn, for punitive tariffs of 25%. “Hopefully the president is just blowing off steam again but, if he’s even half-serious, this is nuts,” said the senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska, who has been critical of the president’s posture on trade. “China is guilty of many things, but the president has no actual plan to win right now. He’s threatening to light American agriculture on fire.” The tit-for-tat has rattled stock markets on worries over a full-blown trade war between two of the world’s largest economies. US stock futures fell more than 1% following Trump’s announcement, made after the close of trading. In currency markets, the dollar fell against Japan’s yen. The National Retail Federation, a Washington-based trade group, said in a statement: “We urge the administration to change course and stop playing a game of chicken with the nation’s economy.” Last month, the US president claimed that “trade wars are good, and easy to win”. Trump has said the tariffs will push Beijing to change policies that force American companies to give up their intellectual property to Chinese businesses, a policy the US believes is part and parcel of one of Beijing’s key industrial plans, Made in China 2025. On Wednesday, Trump sought to play down concerns, saying on Twitter: “We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the US. Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!” He added: “When you’re already $500 Billion DOWN, you can’t lose!” However, if China matched the White House’s threats to subject as much as $150bn in Chinese goods to tariffs, it would more than cover total US exports to the country. The US exported around $130bn to China last year, mainly in agricultural products like soybeans and grains, as well as vehicles, aircraft and pharmaceuticals – items included in China’s list released on Wednesday. Trump’s threatened increase of tariffs on Chinese goods would affect only about 30% of what China exports to the US. Beijing has not signalled any willingness to back down. China’s People’s Daily, the official voice of the ruling Communist Party, said in an editorial on Thursday: “Within 24 hours of the US publishing its list, China drew its sword, and with the same strength and to the same scale, counterattacked quickly, fiercely and with determination.” The two sides have still left room for manoeuvre. US tariffs will not come into effect until after a public comment and consultation period that should take about two months. China has said implementation of its tariffs will depend on the US. A senior US official told Reuters that the US was willing to negotiate with China, though no formal negotiations had been set. China’s economic tsar, Liu He, has spoken over the phone with the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and reportedly exchanged letters with Mnuchin and US trade representative Robert Lighthizer. “We are at a critical juncture where the US may have its maximum leverage to get changes in China, and both sides are at least talking about talking,” said Claire Reade, senior counsel at Arnold &amp; Porter, who advises on Chinese regulatory and governmental issues. “If the two sides can reach an agreement in the next 60 days, [then] no trade war.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/06/bp-plan-to-drill-in-great-australian-bight-risked-750km-oil-spill-documents-show","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T04:30:28Z","webTitle":"BP plan to drill in Great Australian Bight risked 750km oil spill, documents show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/06/bp-plan-to-drill-in-great-australian-bight-risked-750km-oil-spill-documents-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/06/bp-plan-to-drill-in-great-australian-bight-risked-750km-oil-spill-documents-show","fields":{"headline":"BP plan to drill in Great Australian Bight risked 750km oil spill, documents show","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Up to 750km of coastline was put at risk of contamination from possible oil spill by BP’s plan to drill in the Great Australian Bight, newly released documents show. Government documents released under freedom of information laws show a major oil spill in the sensitive seascape would pollute up to 750km of beaches and shoreline, according to BP’s own modelling. The company also thought drilling could disrupt migration of the endangered southern right whale. Two letters from the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema) to BP in 2015 and 2016 show BP had failed to address the regulator’s concerns about managing these risks. The details suggest it would be costly for any oil company to drill the area in an environmentally responsible way. BP withdrew its plans to drill in October 2016, citing better options for investment. But the company said the Bight remained a prospect and it still owns two of the four offshore leases that were subject to the original plans. The other two leases were passed from BP to Statoil last year and the Norwegian firm, which was a partner in BP’s initial project, intends to drill an exploratory well in one of them by October 2019. However, the Nopsema letters show any oil company seeking to drill that wild and remote corner of the Southern Ocean will face serious regulatory hurdles. “Given the plan was never finalised, this material doesn’t represent the final views of BP or the regulator,” a spokesperson from BP said, adding that BP had no plans to reactivate its interest in the Bight. Chevron has also since dropped its own plans for the area. In 2016, BP released modelling showing a spill could hit land as far away as New South Wales. The letters revealed that BP’s “worst case shoreline oiling scenario predicts oiling of 650km coastline at 125 days after the spill, increasing to 750km after 300 days”. Nopsema had raised concerns over BP’s ability to mobilise the people and equipment needed to clean up such a vast expanse of coast. According to Nopsema’s letters, the crew on BP’s seismic survey saw migrating southern right whales and feeding sperm whales “on a number of occasions”. The oil company’s environment plan concluded whales may be exposed to underwater sound “at levels within the behavioural disturbance range”. BP had not evaluated the potential ecological consequences of the exposure. It concluded southern right whales (which are endangered) would simply change course to go around the area, but did not assess what that might mean for their ability to access food. “This correspondence included a range of feedback that BP was working to address,” said the company spokesperson, when asked about these specific impacts. Campaigners who fought BP’s proposal said the Nopsema letters showed particular difficulties associated with drilling in the Great Australian Bight which Statoil would struggle to overcome. Jenny Webber, the campaign manager for the Bob Brown Foundation, said protecting the Bight’s wildlife from these risks would prove “prohibitively expensive”. “That’s why BP and Chevron have withdrawn. Statoil must meet the same standards required of BP: its shareholders, not least the Norwegian government, need to know the company cannot reasonably meet the cost of keeping Australia’s southern ocean and coastlines safe from an oil spill which could take months to cap. Statoil should drop its plans,” she said. Nathaniel Pelle, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace Australia, said: “Now we not only know how far it could reach, but how extensive an oiled coastline could be – 750km of oiled beaches is a horrifying thought.” Pelle said this scale and the lack of a plan to recruit the necessary salvage crews “confirms the community’s concerns that an effective clean-up would not be possible”. Even after BP was given a detailed rejection notice by Nopsema in November 2015, its resubmitted plan failed to comply, or had provided insufficient information, on 69 out of 88 required criteria, the documents show. A Nopsema spokesperson said it was “common to see improvements in the environmental management approach proposed by titleholders for a particular activity as an environment plan assessment progresses”. BP said the letters were part of an “ongoing process” and until the time it withdrew, it was “absolutely committed to working with the regulator to finalise our draft environment plan”. Andrew Hopkins, an emeritus professor of sociology at the Australian National University who has consulted and written books on BP’s safety practices, said it would have cost BP “many millions” to comply with the regulator’s requirements. BP said that compliance with the regulator had not made the project uncompetitive. “Statoil must be able to see what will be required,” Hopkins said. A spokesperson for Statoil said the company was developing an environmental plan to submit to Nopsema, which would be subject to consultation. “We will only undertake drilling activity if we can do it safely. By the time we drill we will have spent more than two years planning this well to satisfy ourselves that we can operate safely and in accordance with Australia’s strict environmental and regulatory requirements. We have collaborated with CSIRO to study the local environment and this is taken into account in our plans. Our exploration project is also designed to protect the interests of fishing, aquaculture and tourism operators,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “As the world’s leading deepwater operator, we will draw on more than 45 years of experience successfully operating in similar offshore environments. We are speaking with local suppliers and stakeholders to ensure we properly understand the local conditions. We have decades of experience coexisting with other interests, including fisheries and tourism. We will continue to use a combination of local experts and global best practice throughout our exploration program. With careful planning and regulatory oversight, we are taking the time we need to prepare for safe operations.” The freedom of information request to Nopsema was delayed by BP until well after its commercial interest in the region had cooled. The original document request was made in August 2016. The Bob Brown Foundation assisted CHN with the $386 fee for the request, but had no further input until asked to comment for this article. • This is an edited version of an article first published on Climate Home News"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/05/sergio-garcia-nightmare-13-shots-masters","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T23:42:00Z","webTitle":"The ball just didn’t want to stop, says Sergio García after nightmare 13","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/05/sergio-garcia-nightmare-13-shots-masters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/05/sergio-garcia-nightmare-13-shots-masters","fields":{"headline":"The ball just didn’t want to stop, says Sergio García after nightmare 13","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Not even a Jordan Spieth charge could spare the blushes of Sergio García. What Augusta giveth, Augusta taketh away. Masters drama arrives in the most varying of forms. García, the defending champion and an individual for whom nothing could apparently douse an upbeat Masters mood, was front and centre of an extraordinary scene on the return to the course which yielded his greatest triumph. The Spaniard has entered the record books after taking 13 strokes at the par-five 15th. It was the joint highest score ever on a single Masters hole and the biggest tally – by two – on that hole. Amateur golfers the world over nodded in quiet appreciation of what García encountered. In golfing context the detail is almost too gruesome to revisit. García, who was two-over par at the time, attempted to find the putting surface in two with a six iron. He found water, just as was the case the four subsequent times he played with only a wedge in hand. “I don’t know what to tell you,” said a shellshocked García. “It’s one of those things. I feel like it’s the first time in my career where I made a 13 without missing a shot. Simple as that. I felt like I hit a lot of good shots and unfortunately the ball just didn’t want to stop.” García did little to hide his disdain for the pin-placement which caused him so much trauma. “Well, you saw it, I don’t think I need to describe it,” he added. “It’s not the first time it’s been there, so it’s not new, but with the firmness of the greens and everything, I felt like the ball was going to stop and unfortunately for whatever reason it didn’t want to. “I had 206 yards [the first time]. I had six iron. I thought it was perfect, straight at the flag. If it carries two more feet, it’s probably good. And if it carries a foot less, it probably doesn’t go off the green and stays on the fringe. Then I kept hitting good shots with the sand wedge and unfortunately I don’t know why, the ball just wouldn’t stop.” That point, however, was undermined by the 15th playing as the second easiest hole of this Masters round. Nobody else came close to matching García’s tale of woe. Doc Redman, an American amateur who was in García’s group, was almost bashful about what he had witnessed. “It was tough, you don’t want to see anyone go through that,” said the 20-year-old. “It was very difficult and you wouldn’t wish that on anyone.” García recently named his baby daughter Azalea after the 13th hole here and which was so crucial to his maiden major victory. Suffice to say Firethorn – the 15th’s label – won’t be on the shortlist when number two arrives. In cold reflection, the Spaniard at least has that Masters win as consolation. Lesser players would be defined by their unlucky 13. García responded after his debacle admirably and produced a birdie two at the 16th. The glass-half-full reporter who asked the 38-year-old whether he took anything from the playing of Augusta National’s three closing holes in minus one was met with a short shrift. “Not really,” said the Spaniard. The 81 was the highest opening round by a defending champion in Masters history, triggering a Friday battle just to survive the halfway cut. Spieth played the opening seven holes in level par, with no hint whatsoever of what was to come. That is if one ignores the Texan’s record at Augusta. Spieth, by this stage two under, birdied the 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th and 17th in racing to the top of the leaderboard. His 66 – Spieth dropped a shot at the last – means a two-stroke lead after 18 holes. In 2015 he became only the fifth wire-to-wire champion in Masters history and appears of a mind to do precisely the same again. Rory McIlroy had not posted a sub-70 opening round here since the 65 which took Augusta by storm in 2011. That changed in the 82nd edition of the Masters, with the Northern Irishman’s 69 hinting strongly at better things to come. McIlroy missed chances to improve on that score, albeit he saved par smartly from 13ft at the penultimate hole having found a greenside bunker with his approach shot and even more impressively at the last having pulled his second shot into the galleries. “Everything worked well today, I’m really pleased with that start,” said McIlroy. “The greens were so much firmer and faster today than what we had been practising on so that was a bit of an adjustment. There have been a few good scores out there but nobody is going ridiculously low.” Tony Finau’s participation was in serious doubt after an Alan Shearer-esque celebration of a hole in one during Wednesday’s par-three competition went wrong. The American suffered a dislocated ankle which he immediately remedied but still had checked by way of an x-ray and an MRI scan. With both clear, Finau proved the adage of beware the injured golfer as he signed for a 68. Matt Kuchar lies alongside Finau at four under. “It’s nothing short of a miracle, if you ask me,” Finau said. “I could barely put any pressure on it, I could barely walk, but obviously after the MRI we knew there was no real damage. So at that point, I knew I was going to play.” Tiger Woods rightly reflected on an “up and down” 73 where he was “sloppy” on the par fives, which he played in an aggregate of even par. It remains a stretch of the imagination to believe Woods can win here. Tommy Fleetwood, who partnered the 14-times major champion, outscored Woods by a shot. Marc Leishman, the third player in the morning marquee group, is another stroke better off. Justin Rose finished late in the day on level par, the world No 1, Dustin Johnson, was one over and Paul Casey compiled a 74 for two over. Henrik Stenson’s 69 hinted at a belated upturn in his Masters fortunes. Haotong Li, the first ever professional from China to earn a Masters spot through automatic qualification by virtue of his third place in the Open, matched Stenson’s score. Nonetheless, this was to prove a day when the highest number grabbed the greatest attention. • This article was amended on 6 April 2018 to correct the spelling of Sergio García’s surname."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/23/flint-water-crisis-governor-rick-snyder-criminal-trials","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T10:00:08Z","webTitle":"Flint activists still waiting as governor escapes fallout of water crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/23/flint-water-crisis-governor-rick-snyder-criminal-trials","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/23/flint-water-crisis-governor-rick-snyder-criminal-trials","fields":{"headline":"Flint activists still waiting as governor escapes fallout of water crisis","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The lead poisoning crisis that swept Flint was, for a time, expected to fell Rick Snyder, the governor of Michigan. But the start of criminal trials of those deemed responsible for the disaster has stirred outrage in Flint at the prospect that the governor will pay no price for what happened on his watch. Neither Snyder, nor any of his closest aides, are among the 15 people identified by Michigan attorney general Bill Schuette as being criminally responsible for allowing lead to leech into Flint’s drinking water in April 2014 and failing to deal with its deadly consequences. Wednesday will be four years since Flint’s water switched to the Flint river, without lead corrosion controls, prompting the public health crisis. “No one is above the law, not on my watch,” Schuette, who is running to replace term-limited Snyder this year, has vowed. But no crime has been been established against the governor, Schuette stressed. As it stands, Snyder will be able to round off his eight-year tenure in January and return to the private sector, where he forged a sizable personal fortune via venture capital and technology before he ran for office. The technocratic Republican, whose Twitter handle is @onetoughnerd, would exit with little worse than some gloomy approval ratings. “I don’t think the governor is going to get what he deserves,” said Gina Luster, an activist with Flint Rising. Laura MacIntyre, a sociologist at University of Michigan-Flint, is more descriptive: “He deserves to be tarred and feathered.” At the apex of the crisis, in 2015 and 2016, it appeared that Snyder would, at least politically, be toppled by the outrage. He faced a humbling congressional hearing in March 2016 where, sipping a bottle of water held with trembling hands, he told lawmakers “I kick myself every day” over what happened in Flint. “Career bureaucrats” in his administration had deceived him. “I get so mad, I should’ve never believed them,” Snyder said. The governor was jeered by Flint activists and residents, some wearing “Flint Lives Matter” T-shirts, and got little respite from his interlocutors. “I’ve had enough of your false contrition and apologies,” said congressman Matt Cartwright. “You sit there dripping with guilt.” As he was shielded out of the hearing by his security detail, Snyder’s political end seemed nigh. It wasn’t to be. “You don’t roll up in a ball, you don’t walk away,” Snyder said, explaining his unwillingness to resign. Efforts to gather signatures from Michiganders to remove Snyder withered. A Republican-dominated legislature wasn’t going to push the issue even though Snyder, who allowed the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare, vetoed a bill that allowed guns in schools and halted an anti-abortion driving license plate that read “Choose life”, is moderate within a staunchly rightwing Michigan GOP. The criminal legal action, now starting to hit the courts, has so far focused on the sort of “career bureaucrats” Snyder blamed for the Flint crisis, rather than their ultimate boss. “They started with the low hanging fruit and we weren’t happy, we thought ‘really?’” Karen Weaver, Flint’s mayor, told the Guardian. “People are waiting to see if the governor will be involved and, if the evidence points that way, he should be involved. “We want everyone to be held accountable. What happened was inexcusable. People ask how I can work with the governor. Well, he’s in office. He has power. He has resources we need.” Schuette would not comment when contacted but sources at the special counsel set up to handle the prosecutions insist there is no motivation to shield Snyder. “We’ve looked, we’ve combed through every document we could find, talked to every witness,” said one of the investigators. “We’re not sitting on evidence. It’s just that the evidence doesn’t point to any specific charge.” The Flint crisis unfolded when the city, under the control of a Snyder-appointed emergency manager, switched the drinking water source from Lake Huron to the Flint river. Corrosion control chemicals were not applied to the water system, allowing lead from pipes, joints and fixtures to seep into the water supply. Residents began to complain of discoloured liquid tumbling from taps; children’s blood lead levels began to spike. Lead exposure is linked to significant developmental and behavioral problems in children. The Flint contamination is also blamed for an outbreak of legionnaires’ disease, which caused 12 people to die in the area in 2014 and 2015. It is these deaths that provoked the most eye-catching of Schuette’s charges, of involuntary manslaughter, leveled against Nick Lyon, director of the Michigan’s department of health and human service. Lyon, a member of Snyder’s cabinet, is the most senior official to be charged, followed by Dr Eden Wells, the state’s chief medical executive. Wells has been charged with misconduct in office for allegedly threatening to withhold funding for a project after researchers started looking into the legionnaires’ outbreak. Lyon’s attorneys have denied that he is guilty of the charges, while Wells’ legal team has said it is reviewing the charges. Snyder has not dismissed either employee. “Being charged with a crime is not the same as being convicted of one,” said Snyder’s spokeswoman. She added that Snyder “promised residents in January 2016 that because this happened on his watch, he would fix it, and that’s exactly what he has done.” Lyon, according to the charging document, “exhibited gross negligence” by failing to alert the public about the legionnaires’ outbreak, leading to the death of at least one person. “Everyone has to die of something,” Lyon told staff, the document alleges. Four other state officials – Stephen Busch, Mike Prysby, Mike Glasgow and Adam Rosenthal – are charged in separate proceedings with tampering with lead test results and instructing residents to “pre-flush” taps ahead of tests – a manipulation that is widespread across the US. Glasgow, who has taken a plea deal in return for giving evidence, has testified in pre-trial proceedings that Prysby and Busch wanted to remove test results taken from the home of LeeAnne Walters, a Flint resident, after they found 104 parts of lead per billion in her water. The federal actionable limit is 15 parts per billion. Prysby and Busch pleaded not guilty to charges at an earlier pre-trial hearing. Rosenthal agreed to a plea deal late last year to plead no contest to a misdemeanor charge. Snyder declared a state of emergency for Flint in January 2016, more than 15 months after his advisers called the quality of the Flint river “downright scary” and urging reconnection to the previous water source, according to emails released under freedom of information laws. A surge in legionnaires’ disease in Genesee County, where Flint is located, was reported to Snyder’s staff as early as March 2015. The apparent sluggishness to respond to the crisis provoked an outcry but doesn’t provide quite enough ammunition for prosecution, according to legal scholars. “To prove criminal liability is very hard in Michigan,” said David Moran, professor of law at the University of Michigan. “It’s not enough for someone to be terrible or lazy in their job. You need to be grossly negligent, to do something while knowing it would cause people to die. “It would be extraordinary for the governor to be so aware of what is in Flint’s water that he would know the imminent health risk. It’s hard to prove what the higher ups knew.” This situation raises the possibility that the trials will deepen the disillusion felt by Flint residents, rather than provide catharsis if punishment is finally meted out. Trust in basic governance has eroded to the point that many residents still rely on bottled water, despite state officials repeatedly declaring Flint’s water is now safe. “People have been lied to so much here,” said Arthur Woodson, a Flint resident and activist. “We just feel that elected officials are never held accountable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/05/trump-mexico-caravan-voter-claims-speech-west-virginia","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T22:11:11Z","webTitle":"Trump defends Mexican rapists claim during conspiracy-laden speech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/05/trump-mexico-caravan-voter-claims-speech-west-virginia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/05/trump-mexico-caravan-voter-claims-speech-west-virginia","fields":{"headline":"Trump defends Mexican rapists claim during conspiracy-laden speech","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump veered wildly off-script at an event intended to tout the Republican tax bill on Thursday, making false claims about voter fraud and darkly warning of the menace of predominantly Hispanic gangs. Trump, who spent much of the 2016 campaign alleging massive voter fraud, returned to the topic at the event in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. “In a lot of places, like California, the same person votes many times,” said Trump. “You probably heard that. They always like to say ‘that’s a conspiracy theory’. It’s not a conspiracy theory, folks. It’s millions and millions of people and it’s very hard because the state guards their records.” There is absolutely no evidence for such voter fraud occurring. After winning the electoral college in 2016, Trump falsely claimed that he would have won the popular vote as well if not for fraud and created a controversial commission to investigate voter fraud in the United States. He also harped on the danger posed by illegal immigration and by the “caravan” of refugees travelling to the US from Central America in an effort to seek asylum. “Women are raped at levels that have never been seen before,” Trump claimed of the caravan as he referenced his infamous 2015 remarks when he launched his presidential campaign that Mexico was deliberately sending murderers and rapists into the US. “Everybody said, oh, he was so tough. I used the word rape,” said Trump, as he reflected on his comments then. Trump touted his proposal for a border wall and for increased enforcement of immigration laws. He also claimed that the MS-13 gang had gained control of swaths of Long Island, requiring towns to be “liberated” while gang members get thrown into “paddy wagons” – a term found offensive by some Irish Americans. The event featured Trump sitting in between two of the three main candidates for the Republican nomination for US Senate in West Virginia. On Trump’s right was congressman Evan Jenkins and on his left was the state attorney general, Patrick Morrisey. The third candidate, the convicted former coal company executive Don Blankenship, was not present. Trump spent much of the event criticizing the Democratic incumbent, Joe Manchin. Trump also offered new details on the scope of the mission to strengthen security at the border after announcing earlier this week that he wanted to send in the military to “secure” the border from what he described as an escalating threat of undocumented immigrants, drugs and crime flowing into the US. The administration intends to mobilize between 2,000 and 4,000 national guard troops to the US-Mexico border in an effort to boost security there, Trump told reporters on Air Force One on the trip back to Washington DC. He said the troops would remain at the border until a “large portion” of the wall is built, an effort that could take years to complete. Asked about the cost of deploying thousands of national guard troops, Trump said the administration was still “looking” at it. Trump meanwhile on Thursday took credit for a record-low drop in unlawful border crossings from Mexico. “Because of the Trump Administrations actions, Border crossings are at a still UNACCEPTABLE 46 year low. Stop drugs!” he tweeted. Trump also weighed in on the allegations against the EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, who has faced questions in a series of scandals about his use of government money as well as his lodging in a property owned by a lobbyist. Trump told reporters on Air Force One Pruitt “has done a fantastic job”, adding: “I think he’s done an incredible job. He’s been very courageous. It hasn’t been easy, but I think he’s done a fantastic job.” He added of the reports about Pruitt’s conduct: “I have to look at them … I’ll make that determination.” Trump’s statement was a comparative vote of confidence after a White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, said earlier on Thursday: “I can’t speak to the future of Scott Pruitt.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/05/alex-oxlade-chamberlain-praises-anfield-atmosphere","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T21:30:13Z","webTitle":"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain praises fans for ‘horrible’ Anfield atmosphere","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/05/alex-oxlade-chamberlain-praises-anfield-atmosphere","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/05/alex-oxlade-chamberlain-praises-anfield-atmosphere","fields":{"headline":"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain praises fans for ‘horrible’ Anfield atmosphere","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has thanked Liverpool fans for generating a “horrible” atmosphere for Manchester City on Wednesday and believes it disturbed Pep Guardiola’s players during the Champions League quarter-final. Liverpool have been charged by Uefa after the City team coach was damaged outside Anfield before kick‑off but it was the noise inside that Oxlade-Chamberlain has cited as having the greater influence on the first leg. City’s manager and players were dismissive of the effect of the Anfield atmosphere on their performance but that was contradicted by the England international, who admitted he knew from experience with Arsenal how it can have a major influence. “It was an amazing atmosphere, the best I’ve ever played in,” said Oxlade-Chamberlain, who struck a superb second goal in Liverpool’s 3-0 victory. “You have to give credit to the fans because it is never nice coming to Anfield and hearing that crowd – I’ve been on the other end of it and it is not easy. “The fans play a massive part. I’ve never witnessed anything like that. Coming into the stadium for a game which was not a final it almost set it up to be like a final. It definitely got us going and you could see that. If you are the away team and the crowd gets going like that it is horrible. “City are an amazing football team but they are only human and you put anyone in a pressure environment in an atmosphere like that maybe it can disturb them. I wouldn’t say to the extent it did that because they still played some good stuff and dominated the ball but it definitely played a part in the first half. It got us going and it would probably shake anyone up so you have to give fans credit for that.” Oxlade-Chamberlain ranked his long-range strike past Ederson among the finest goals of his career but surprisingly, given his contribution in central midfield, admitted he was dissatisfied with his overall performance. The 24-year-old said: “The manager has been pushing me all season and shouting at me for not taking the game by the scruff of the neck and providing those kinds of moments, being the one shooting and making the difference. Slowly it is starting to pay off and it helps me to create moments like that. “It definitely shows why I wanted to come here and I want to keep improving. My game I wasn’t too happy with. I could have been better on the ball so I was a bit disappointed with that and there are areas I need to improve on and can improve on. “There were a few runs I did in the first half where I broke the line and it was just the last man I didn’t manage to get past or didn’t get the shot off and it is those moments where I could have had a second goal or set someone up that I can work on. But I was really happy for the team and tried to work as hard as I can to help the boys to defend.” Oxlade-Chamberlain insisted there was no prospect of complacency creeping into Liverpool’s performance in the second leg. He also claimed Jürgen Klopp’s team were ideally suited to the Champions League and the latter stages in particular. “We definitely have qualities that are suited to this competition,” he said. “The further you go the better the teams you play against and you don’t get many opportunities so you have to be clinical. The three boys up front this season have stood out in how clinical they have been. Going forward they are always a threat on the break and that is good for us because there will be times like against City when we don’t see a lot of the ball and when we can break that is when we can hurt teams. You’ve seen teams go far in this competition doing that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/05/robert-griffin-iii-is-filling-a-spot-that-should-belong-to-colin-kaepernick","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T18:14:23Z","webTitle":"Robert Griffin III is filling a spot that should belong to Colin Kaepernick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/05/robert-griffin-iii-is-filling-a-spot-that-should-belong-to-colin-kaepernick","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/05/robert-griffin-iii-is-filling-a-spot-that-should-belong-to-colin-kaepernick","fields":{"headline":"Robert Griffin III is filling a spot that should belong to Colin Kaepernick","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"No matter what would eventually happen, Robert Griffin III and Colin Kaepernick were destined to be linked forever as the faces of a quarterback revolution in the NFL. For four wonderful months in the fall of 2012 they, along with Seattle’s Russell Wilson, offered a tantalizing glimpse of the future: signal-callers who ran as well as they threw. They inspired words rarely used in NFL offenses, spawning talk of “zone reads” and “the pistol”. While Cam Newton had already established himself as a pass and run threat, the sudden arrival of Griffin, Kaepernick and Wilson that season suggested that NFL quarterbacks would never be the same. They were going to change the game for good. Now, five and a half years later RG3 and Colin Kaepernick are bound again through an inexplicable transaction on Wednesday that startled many around the NFL. This came when the Baltimore Ravens announced they will sign Griffin to be their backup quarterback next season. It’s an odd signing at best. Injuries have stolen from RG3 the skills that once made him great. The explosive bursts of speed that propelled him past would-be tacklers was gone after the second major knee surgery. In the moments when he has appeared on a field, his body has been broken too many times. But Griffin will fill a spot that should belong to Kaepernick. By all reasonable metrics Kaepernick was the better quarterback when Baltimore considered signing him last summer to be the backup to longtime starter Joe Flacco. Kaepernick might never have matched the greatness of his 2012 breakout season but he remained a far more reliable passer and more durable runner than RG3. The on-field comparisons aren’t even close. The Ravens, of course, passed on Kaepernick. This after they crowdsourced their fanbase to measure how toxic Kaepernick’s protests for racial equality would seem to ticket buyers. When enough fans reportedly balked, team owner Steve Biscotti quashed the idea of adding the quarterback. It might well have been Kaepernick’s last real shot at playing again in the NFL. The timing of Griffin’s signing rang strange, coming right before the team held a draft press conference with general manager Ozzie Newsome and coach John Harbaugh on Wednesday afternoon, but it might not be accidental. Not long after the announcement, Pro Football Talk reported that Newsome and Harbaugh were to be deposed by Kaepernick’s lawyers on Thursday as part of a collusion lawsuit the quarterback has brought against the league. Obviously, Griffin’s name will arise in the interviews. The Ravens will have to justify why RG3 is a better fit than Kaepernick. It’s not an easy explanation, either. Like Kaepernick, Griffin’s last year in the NFL was 2016. He started five games for the woeful Cleveland Browns, had more interceptions than touchdowns and threw for just 886 yards, running for 190 more. Meanwhile, in 11 starts that year, Kaepernick had 16 touchdowns and only four interceptions as well as 2,241 yards passing and 468 on the ground. Griffin hobbled through a number of injuries that season, just as he had in his previous four years in the league. He, however, did not kneel for the national anthem as Kaepernick did in an effort to draw attention to racial problems and police brutality. So while Kaepernick is a superior quarterback, RG3 gets another shot at the league as Kaepernick’s career appears dead. Newsome and Harbaugh did not debate the merits of Griffin over Kaepernick at their draft press conference. Publicly, at least, Kaepernick’s name is not discussed seriously anymore, not only in the Ravens headquarters but in every team’s facility. “We’re very excited about it,” Harbaugh gushed Wednesday about the Griffin signing. “We felt like we needed a No2 quarterback. We needed a guy. You look at the veteran quarterbacks out there, I mean where we’re at right now, I’m pretty excited about this guy. I’m really feeling like we got a steal. I’m really feeling that way.” Harbaugh is naturally effusive in such situations, so some of his enthusiasm shouldn’t be taken too seriously. Still, it seems baffling how any reasonable NFL coach or executive could look at the field of washed-up reserve quarterbacks and believe they got “a steal” in Griffin while Kaepernick remains untouched. “We are trying to become better,” Harbaugh added. “And this move makes us better.” Perhaps the Ravens have a good plan for Griffin. Maybe they can use him strategically as an occasional change-of-pace from the more robotic Flacco. RG3 can step into a game, break off a few runs or catch the defense surprised with a pass, before running back to the sideline. Who knows? Griffin could possibly be a brilliant signing. But the record says he is nothing like Kaepernick. The record says Kaepernick in a Ravens uniform would be worth far more than Griffin could bring. But this is apparently the price of activism. The best player doesn’t always land the job."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/11/russian-activists-arrested-sexual-harassment-protest-leonid-slutsky","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T14:52:46Z","webTitle":"Russian activists fined for sexual harassment protest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/11/russian-activists-arrested-sexual-harassment-protest-leonid-slutsky","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/11/russian-activists-arrested-sexual-harassment-protest-leonid-slutsky","fields":{"headline":"Russian activists fined for sexual harassment protest","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Two Russian activists have been found guilty of staging an unlawful protest, in what they claim is an official backlash against their campaign for sexual harassment allegations made against MP Leonid Slutsky to be taken seriously. Authorities arrested Alena Popova, Anastasiya Glushkova and Anastasiya Alekseeva last week on the charge of having organised a mass event without permission after they protested with a cardboard cutout of Slutsky outside the State Duma in Moscow. Slutsky has been accused by various women of sexual harassment, prompting a public debate and comparisons with the Harvey Weinstein scandal. The State Duma’s ethics committee cleared Slutsky on accusations levelled by several journalists. Popova and Glushkova were found guilty at a hearing on Thursday and fined 20,000 roubles (£228) and 10,000 roubles (£114) respectively. Officials were unable to reach a verdict on the charge against Alekseeva, and referred her case back to the police. The arrests followed an unprecedented outcry over sexual harassment in Russia, where the issue is often laughed off and painted as a pet subject for western liberals at odds with traditional Russian values. Popova, Glushkova and Alekseeva claim members of “patriotic” organisations had arrived at the protest to intimidate them into giving up their campaign and accused the activists of “working for the west”. Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, recently suggested the claims against Slutsky were made because complaints about sexual harassment had become “fashionable”. More than 600 media professionals from outlets such as RBC, TV Rain, RTVI and Echo of Moscow, as well as the Tass news agency, have signed an open letter calling for a boycott of the Russian parliament because of the allegations made against Slutsky, the head of the Duma’s foreign affairs committee. Russian law demands that a protest of more than two people be granted permission from local authorities before it can go ahead. The three women had been picketing the Russian parliament individually. The activists had made four requests to hold larger protests in Moscow, all of which were denied. Popova, a prominent women’s rights campaigner who was detained twice before being arrested and charged, told the Guardian: “Without permission for a protest, you can stand alone with a poster, and can pass that poster to another person, but not stand together. We did just that, and our single picket abided by the law.” “We will keep applying for permission to hold a bigger protest and continue with our single protests in the meantime. We will apply for permission 1,000 times if we have to.” Kirill Druzhinin, who is involved in the Slutsky protest campaign, said: “The reaction of the government to our campaign is absolutely irresponsible. Instead of giving citizens the opportunity to express their discontent in a legal way, the authorities, under far-fetched pretexts, forbid us from doing so. “According to Russian human rights organisations, every second woman in Russia [has been] sexually harassed. Authorities believe that recognising the unacceptability of Slutsky’s behaviour means admission to their own weakness, which they cannot do.” The protests organised by activists seek to attract as much of attention as possible to an “intolerable situation”, Inga Kelehsaeva of Amnesty International said. “We are deeply saddened but no way surprised by this case – by decriminalising domestic violence last year, the lawmakers have already demonstrated that they support and promote an anti-women agenda in Russia and turn a blind eye to the fact that the modern society has much evolved and all litanies about ‘traditional values’ are deeply outdated.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/06/hopping-mad-easter-sean-penn-tactile-terminations","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T16:54:07Z","webTitle":"Hopping mad about Easter, and Sean Penn's tactile terminations | Emma Brockes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/06/hopping-mad-easter-sean-penn-tactile-terminations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/06/hopping-mad-easter-sean-penn-tactile-terminations","fields":{"headline":"Hopping mad about Easter, and Sean Penn's tactile terminations","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Monday The separation of church and state is taken very seriously in the US, nowhere more so than in the public school system, where tussles over Easter-Passover are still being felt this week after kids returned home from school last Thursday bearing decorated eggs and bunnies. “Surely it’s pagan not Christian?” I said naively to a friend, who was in high dudgeon over the promotion of Christianity over Judaism as she prepared for her annual Passover pilgrimage to a beach in Miami. “That’s bullshit,” she said. “It’s to do with Easter and they know it.” Meanwhile, grumbles from across the Judeo-Christian spectrum that too many other groups are being given public holidays, after the schools in New York shut for Chinese Lunar New Year in February. This did not, as intended by the mayor, Bill de Blasio, seem to usher in a warm spirit of multicultural understanding, instead triggering in non-Chinese parents scrambling for childcare a lot of grumpy “where does it end-ism?” What next, a day off for the Bahá’ís? The Jains? If Scientology is a religion, why don’t they get a day? You get the idea. And then in come the Christians with their bunnies and eggs, slyly trying to undermine the US constitution. It can only be a matter of time before Fox News catches wind of all this and starts to crank up its coverage of the war against Easter. Tuesday I have new health insurance, which as tends to happen in the US in these circumstances, means changing all my doctors. (I say “all”; I persist in the stubborn British belief that unless bits of my body are actually falling off, I don’t need a doctor at all.) My children on the other hand need routine immunisations and so we go to a fancy doctor a block from Central Park. I have heard good things about her, but also a report from a friend that when her three-year-old picked up a surgical glove in the consulting room and inflated it to look like a cow’s udder, the doctor was blatantly unamused. You might think this irrelevant, but in the competitive marketplace of New York paediatricians it constitutes a serious failure of salesmanship and my friend duly changed doctors. I would have stayed with our existing paediatrician until the end of time, were it not for the fact that, insurance issues aside, after my children’s flu jab this year he put a plaster on each child’s arm that, in both cases, was fully three inches from where the needle went in and I got the distinct impression he was short-sighted and hiding it. Even my British lassitude in the face of indifferent service has limits. That’s it, we’re out. Wednesday The gift that keeps giving, and may yet continue to give, is, of course, everything implied by the sentence “Sean Penn’s debut novel”. You are perhaps familiar with Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff, but in case not, here is a sample of the actor’s prose: “There is pride to be had where the prejudicial is practiced with precision in the trenchant triage of tactile terminations.” In an intermittently respectful review in the New York Times, the reviewer wondered whether Penn’s novel could be described as a “furious, despairing takedown of America as the country battles its own worst instincts?” No. Thursday Mark Zuckerberg says he won’t back down or resign for his failure to stop the massive data breach at Facebook. There is human drama in this story, in which most of us have a stake, and yet as I read the headlines about the possibility that 87 million people’s data has been scraped, as opposed to the previous estimate of 50 million, it is hard to escalate my feelings accordingly. This is a failure of imagination on my part, but I wonder if “Cambridge Analytica” or the term “data breach” itself will come to have the effect on people that stories leading on “global warming” or “BAE systems” have had over the years; that is, a dim sense of outrage under attack from a much more powerful urge to turn the page and read about something more interesting instead. I’m reminded of John Oliver’s encounter with Edward Snowden a few years ago, when to Snowden’s obvious dismay, Oliver told him the only way to engage the American public with the complex and often very dry issues behind government surveillance, was to frame it with the question: “If I send someone a picture of my dick, can the government see it?” The Cambridge Analytica story may need a similar appendage. Friday Things I had forgotten about until I had children: weeing in car parks; conjunctivitis; the stress of children’s party games; the taste of jelly. The party games thing is particularly tricky, since we seem to have another party every weekend. I read endless pieces about the dangers of making one’s children conform to socialised standards, and then I watch my kids, born two minutes apart, and am struck again by how these things come preloaded. One child instinctively throws herself into the fray. The other, happy to play during free time, darkens at the first whiff of organised fun and retreats, scowling, to watch from the sidelines. My own socialisation compels me to chivvy her to join in, when in fact sideline scowling – be it on the edge of the dodgeball game, the Facebook feed, or the super-fun egg hunt in the park – is where my true people lie.

Announcing details of the show on Friday, Tristram Hunt, director of the V&amp;A, said video games were “one of the most important design disciplines of our time”. He added that he was confident the museum’s founding director, Henry Cole, would also have staged the show. “Contemporary video games are strikingly innovative, uniquely creative and commercially successful – making a huge social and cultural impact across the globe,” Hunt said. Highlights from the exhibition is Nintendo’s Splatoon, a huge online squid paintball experience which pits player against player, and original character sketches for the 2013 game The Last of Us, a post-apocalyptic zombie blockbuster that follows two companions, Ellie and Joel, across a ravaged US over the course of a year. Curators said there would be large-scale immersive installations including one showing the intricate and collaborative building of Westeros, from Game of Thrones, in Minecraft. The show’s curator, Marie Foulston, said it would explore games from the mid-2000s that have been transformed by technological advancements, such as increased access to broadband and social media. One common complaint about video games is that they are too violent, but Foulston says there are wider issues that will be explored in the show. “What we want to show is that this is an incredibly broad design field … the broader cultural conversation tends to be sometimes quite fixated but there is an immense design field that needs to be explored and appreciated,” she said. Overtly political games will be on display including Phone Story, a satire in which players control aspects of mobile phone production, including babies mining coltan in the Congo while being watched by armed soldiers. It was banned from the App Store. Some of the games will be playable by visitors, including one called How Do You Do It?, which puts players in the role of a curious 11-year-old exploring the idea of sex. The character uses plastic dolls to allow “the audience to understand the discovery of sexuality from the perception of a young girl”. Hunt said the V&amp;A had the national collection of digital art and design and had been acquiring digital material since the early 1960s. It continues to do so. In 2014, it added the Flappy Bird app to the collection; last year it acquired WeChat, China’s largest social media platform, a process which took two and a half years to achieve. To coincide with the exhibition, the V&amp;A said it was inviting applications from UK-based artists and designers to be its video games resident between October and June 2019. Which games will feature and, crucially for some, what will be playable has still to be announced, but Foulston promised a DIY arcade space at the end of the exhibition and the opportunity for people to play Line Wobbler, a game inspired by a viral video of a cat playing with a door-stopper spring. • Video games: Design/Play/Disrupt will be at the V&amp;A 8 September-24 February."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/apr/06/the-masters-2018-second-round-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T23:43:43Z","webTitle":"The Masters 2018: second round – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/apr/06/the-masters-2018-second-round-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/apr/06/the-masters-2018-second-round-live","fields":{"headline":"The Masters 2018: second round – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Yep! A chip to 18 inches and a tap-in, and Patrick Reed is putting his name to a stunning 66. At the halfway stage, he tops a leaderboard with some big names on it. It promises to be quite a weekend ... unless Reed keeps carrying on like this, of course. Join us tomorrow! -9: Reed -7: Leishman -5: Stenson -4: McIlroy, Spieth -3: D Johnson, Thomas -2: Finau, Fowler, Oosthuizen, Rose, Watson, Hoffman Reed bangs his drive at 18 straight into the sand. His second is clacked straight at the flag, but it doesn’t bite on the front of the green and topples back off the front. Stenson and Thomas scrambled pars from this spot earlier. Can the leader? Reed bumps up to six feet. And rolls his par saver into the cup. That was crucial given his dropped shot at the last. Up on 18, Stenson wedges to a couple of feet and makes his par. He signs for a 70 and will be out in the penultimate group tomorrow with McIlroy. Bubba signs for a 69; he’s -2, and the two-time champ isn’t out of this. -9: Reed (17) -7: Leishman (F) -5: Stenson (F) -4: McIlroy (F), Spieth (F) While I was droning on about Sergio, Thomas screeched his third into 18 to 12 inches, saving his par majestically. He signs for a 67, and at -3 is right in this Tournament now. Especially as Reed is beginning to stumble on his way home. He hooks his tee shot behind a tree down the left of 17, and can only smash his ball to the front right of the green. Meanwhile on 18, Stenson leaves his second short, and it topples off the front of the green and back down the fairway. A warm reception for Sergio as he reaches the final green. It’s not been the most auspicious of title defences: he finishes in a tie for 82nd out of 87, at +15, with only two amateurs below him. And that 13 - 13! - will live long in the memory. But hey, if you’re going to blow up, you may as well blow up big. And Seve missed the cut in both of his title defences too, so it can happen to the best of them. Oh, and of course he departed the scene as reigning champion having made a brilliant birdie at 18. Of course he did. Oh Sergio! We still love you! Reed leaves his long putt on 16 eight feet short. He runs up to mark his ball before a gust of wind can blow it down the glassy green. Much good it does him: he pulls the par putt, and the lead at the top is only two. He’s -9. Meanwhile a mistake by Justin Thomas on 18: he whistles his 3-wood off the tee and into the Lyle Bunker ... then smashes his second against the lip, his ball failing to reach the green. He’s got a job on to save his par now. But on 17, Henrik Stenson makes textbook birdie: a drive straight down the middle, a wedge straight at the flag, a putt straight into the cup. He’s -5. Tiger blows his cheeks out in frustration after landing his approach at 18 to eight feet, but failing narrowly to tease in the left-to-right curler for his birdie. But at least he’ll be here this weekend: he ends the second round at +4 having carded 75 today. Then Leishman tidies up for his par, and he’ll be signing for a fine 67. He’s alone in second place at -7. Tommy Fleetwood finishes with a par as well, and Europe’s number one is level par at the halfway mark. Leishman’s tee shot at 18 is tight down the right. He fades one round the corner, but can only find the bunker front left of the green. He splashes out to ten feet, and will have a chance to save his par. Back on 16, Reed’s tee shot dribbles away to the bottom left of the green; the flag’s a good 60 feet away at the top right. Stenson’s tee shot at 16 is short and left. He’s left with a 70-footer up and over a ridge to the cup, top right of the green. His putt isn’t much cop. He’s left with a tricky 10-footer ... but he guides it in and remains at -4. Par for Thomas at 17. And Reed chips up to six feet at 15, and for the third time today completes a string of three consecutive birdies! -10: Reed (15) -7: Leishman (17) -4: McIlroy (F), Spieth (F), Stenson (16) Leishman knocks in his par saver on 17. That could be a big putt come the end of the week, because it keeps him in touch with Reed, who crashes one down the middle of 15. Reed’s second over the water isn’t the best shot he’ll ever hit, but though the ball topples over the back of the green, it stops pretty much the second it does so. He’ll have a decent chance to get down in two and extend this lead ... -9: Reed (14) -7: Leishman (17) -4: McIlroy (F), Spieth (F), Stenson (15) Leishman is in a spot of bother at 17. He’s short and left of the green in two, and his chip on isn’t all that. He’s got a 12-footer left to save his par. Back on 15, Stenson finds the green in two big blasts but he overcooks his long eagle putt and can’t sink the return. A disappointing par. It’s worse for Bubba, though: bogey after getting wet, and he’s back to -2. Thomas finds the middle of the green at 16 and makes a nondescript par. He’s more than happy with it, moving on, still at -3. A three-putt bogey on the last for Hideki Matsuyama and that’s a 71 to go with his opening-day 73. And Bubba finds water with his approach at 15. Leishman can’t make his birdie putt on 16. Par will have to do. But he’s two behind Reed now at -7. And a three-putt bogey for his partner Tiger, who drops back to +4. That’s clumsy, and puts him back in a little trouble. Sergio bumps up onto the green. He’s given it some welly, which might not be the greatest idea. For a second ... oh dear, oh dear, please no, it’d be too much ... but the ball slows down and stops before getting too close to the bank that’d gather it towards yesterday’s blue nemesis. He makes par. That’s an eight-shot improvement on the first round, to be fair. Birdie for Justin Thomas, though, whose chip up from the back was much more delicate. That’s JT’s third in a row, and he’s suddenly -3 for the Tournament and putting a very nice round together. Oh, ho! Here comes Sergio, ambling down 15! He’s not been going well today either, it’s fair to say: bogeys at 6, 7, 11, 12 and 13, a double at 10, and just the one birdie at 14. He’s +15 overall, not the ideal title defence. At least he’s not wedging into the green this time. Instead, he lashes long towards the flag. He brushes the stick, and the ball topples off the back and down the bank. It’s never going in the water, but he’ll have a hell of a wedge coming back up, with the water he’ll remember so well from yesterday waiting to claim any hot chips. Oh Sergio! Reed splits the 14th fairway, then lifts a 132-yard wedge to 18 inches or so. He’s making this look absurdly easy. He’ll kick that in to more to -9. Meanwhile up on 16, Leishman lands his tee shot pin high, 12 feet from the flag. It’s only Friday, but the quality is dialled up to Sunday Afternoon already. This is wonderful golf ... and the rest of the field will be mildly worried if these two pull away any further. At this rate, Henrik Stenson will soon find out what it felt like to be everyone else at Troon. Henrik Stenson finds the back of the 14th green in two, then rolls in a 25-footer, straight as a die, for birdie. He’s -4 again. Up on 15, Tiger’s just off the back of the green, and putting for eagle. There’s a huge left-to-right break on the putt, though, almost impossible to read. He gets it close, and birdie will do. He’s +3 and he should be here this weekend, providing he does nothing daft on the way in. And Marc Leishman knocks in his eagle putt! That was no more than his ballsy, brilliant second shot deserved. Birdie for Tommy Fleetwood, too: he’s level par. -8: Reed (13) -7: Leishman (15) -4: McIlroy (F), Spieth (F), Stenson (14) Reed sprays his tee shot at 13 into the pines down the right. He’s forced to take his medicine, pitching out and laying up. He sends his third to 15 feet, then rolls in his 18th one-putt of the Tournament! That’s 18 out of 31 holes. Astounding. No wonder he’s three in the lead at -8. Birdie also for Hadwin: he’s back up to -2. Shot of the day ... nah, of the week, it’s a shoo-in already ... by Marc Leishman! He sends his drive down the right of 15. It looks like the trees are blocking him out, and he’ll have to lay up instead of going for the green. But from 226 yards, he snap-hooks a glorious long iron around the corner! The ball lands over the water, onto the green, and rolls to the left, the slope of the green gathering the ball towards the hole. It stops six feet from the cup! That is astonishing! The sort of shots that Masters champions make. The PGA champ Justin Thomas rakes in a fine putt from off the back of 14. That’s back-to-back birdies, and he’s -2. Bubba makes birdie on 13 to move to -3. And birdies for Hideki Matsuyama on 13 and now 15: he’s -1. Reed splashes out of the bunker at the back of 12, using the fringe to take the pace off the ball. He tidies up for a brilliant par. He’s the only one in this final group who escapes with his par. Hadwin (-1) bogeys, while it’s a double bogey for Hoffman (-3). And a three-putt bogey for Leishman on 14. A good few minutes for Reed. -7: Reed (12) -5: Leishman (14) -4: McIlroy (F), Spieth (F) Justin Thomas has been pootling along quietly. Pars all the way since that dropped shot at 7. But now he nearly rolls in a long eagle putt on 13. Not quite, but he taps in for birdie that brings him up to -1. This is a man who has shot 62-64 over a weekend on Tour this season already. He’s still in with a shout. Hoffman hits a fat one into the drink at 12. That never even threatened to make it over the water. His ball plunges out of sight with a sickening gulp. Reed’s effort is snaffled by a bunker at the back; he’s lucky his ball rolls back into the middle of the trap, because it was threatening to hang on the downslope, and being shortsided, with water behind, makes it difficult enough. Hadwin’s is the best of the bunch, and he’s missed it left. Birdie fours for Marc Leishman and Tiger Woods at 13. That moves Tiger away from the cut line to +4, and brings Leishman up to -6. He’s still a shot behind Patrick Reed, who sent a big curling birdie putt at 11 eight feet past the hole ... but knocked in the one coming back. Bogey for Adam Hadwin, a result of a visit to Mizeland: he’s -2. And up on 12, Henrik Stenson clanks his tee shot into the trees at the back of the green. He gets a lucky break, his ball dropping into a bunker instead of sticking on the bank, but he can’t get up and down: he’s -3 again. -7: Reed (11) -6: Leishman (13) -5: Hoffman (11) -4: McIlroy (F), Spieth (F) Nothing is certain yet, but it looks as though there will only be one amateur competing this weekend. Doug Ghim carded a 76 today, to add to the level-par 72 he posted yesterday. He should easily avoid the cut at +4, unless something very strange occurs. That’ll mean the young Texan, who qualified as runner up at last year’s US Amateur, will automatically win the Silver Cup for lowest-scoring amateur to make the cut. The only person who can stop him is the man who staged a comeback from two down with two to play to pip him at that US Amateur: Doc Redman. But he’s +8 overall through 12, and that doesn’t look super-likely. Before Bubba can do anything, Stenson chips in from the front of 11! That grabs back the shot he dropped at 10, and he’s -4 again. Bubba can’t guide in his birdie putt, but fair’s fair, that was a decent par save from where he was back up the hole. That approach shot was so entertaining. Meanwhile back on 10, Hadwin, with the tree denying him backswing, stabs up onto the green to a couple of feet. That’s a shot of genius in itself. He saves his par, which is absurd really. Hoffman scrambles from a tight position too. But Reed can’t get up and down from the bunker and drops to -7. Bubba manufactures an astonishing shot from behind a tree down the right of 11. He almost pirouettes on the pine straw as he sends a huge hook round the trunk, guiding the ball down to the green. The water not even a consideration! That’s not quite up there with his famous hook from the trees to win the 2012 play-off with Louis Oosthuizen ... but it’s not far off. He’s left with a 30-footer. I hope he knocks that in for birdie, because that shot was sensational, and deserves reward for sheer chutzpah! Tiger is in serious danger of missing the cut now. He hits a lovely third from the dropzone, to a couple of feet, and will salvage a bogey for the second day in a row. But it’ll drop him to +5, right on the cut line. No room for error, and the outcome may not be in his hands depending on events, unless he starts making a birdie or two. He storms off in a hot funk. Pars for Leishman (-5) and Fleetwood (+1). Tiger dunked his tee shot at 12 into the water yesterday ... and he does exactly the same thing today! He contemplates burying the hosel of his 8-iron into the tee box, but instead opts for some trenchant self-analysis: “Fucking idiot.” Some more comic stylings are played out on 10, as Reed sends his approach into a bunker on the right, Hoffman pulls his left, and Hadwin really loses his left, dropping his club on the follow-through and watching in horror as his ball nestles in front of a large tree. He’ll have little or no backswing to work with there. Tiger, Leishman and Fleetwood all guide brave second shots into 11, caring not a jot about the water on the left. Surely someone will be rewarded with birdie? Nope! They’re +4, -5 and +1 respectively. (Fleetwood’s bid having hit the skids with bogeys at 7, 8 and 10.) Stenson meanwhile pulls his second down the bank to the left of 10. His chip up towards the green snags in the turf. He bumps his next shot to the side of the cup, so the damage is limited to bogey, but that’s the 2016 Open champ back to -3. A lucky break for Adam Hadwin on 9. His chip into the green has way too much backspin on it, and that’s heading off the steep slope at the front. It should by rights trundle about 50 yards back down the fairway, but somehow it snags on the tight turf and stops. Hadwin still has a job to get up and down, mind, and he bumps up nicely to a couple of feet and tidies up to save his par. Charley Hoffman scrambles par from behind the bunker on the left; a fine effort seeing he’d driven into trees down the right. But Patrick Reed creams his second over the flag to 12 feet, and he rolls in the birdie putt. He’s out in 31 strokes, having started out with three birdies in a row, and finished the front nine in similar style. He’s taking charge of this Masters. -8: Reed (9) -5: Leishman (10), Hoffman (9) -4: McIlroy (F), Spieth (F), Stenson (9) -3: D Johnson (F), Wiesberger (15), Hadwin (9) Back-to-back birdies for Jason Day at 8 and 9. He’s +1, and heads for the turn with a spring in his step that suggests he doesn’t consider his bid over. Birdie for Bernd Wiesberger on 15: he’s -3. But it’s a bogey for Zach Johnson on 11; he’s back to -1. Here’s Simon McMahon: “I’m now rooting for Sergio to finish in last place. That would be history, of a sort. First to last in the space of a single year. They could give him a green wooden spoon or something. Looks like Harry Ellis will deny him, but if he goes round Amen Corner in six over par, with 15 still to come, it could be back on.” The last group of lads are all doing very nicely, thank you. It had been a poor start for Adam Hadwin, with bogeys at 2 and 5. But he’s turned it round with back-to-back birdies at 7 and 8. He’s -3. Charley Hoffman makes his third birdie of the day; he’s -5. And it’s three out of three birdies on the par five, as Patrick Reed finds the heart of the green in two, makes two easy putts, and consolidates his position at the top. -7: Reed (8) -5: Leishman (10), Hoffman (8) -4: McIlroy (F), Spieth (F), Stenson (8) -3: D Johnson (F), Hadwin (8) Rose splits the fairway at 18. If only he could have done that 12 months ago in the play-off, huh. He clips his second to 12 feet. Dustin matches him shot for shot. Only DJ manages to convert for birdie, though. Rose is -2; Dustin -3; both nicely positioned for the weekend. Tiger is clinging on: he rolls in a 15-foot downhill effort on 9 to save his par and remain at +4. Zach Johnson fluffs a pitch at the front of 10, but rolls in a huge par saver to stay at -2. Bubba rolls in a big left-to-right breaker on 8 for his fourth birdie of the day: he’s -2. And Henrik Stenson finds the middle of 8 in two big crashes, rolls the long eagle putt up to a couple of feet, and tidies up for a birdie that moves him to -4. Latest leaderboard? Whyever not. -6: Reed (7) -5: Leishman (9) -4: McIlroy (F), Spieth (F), Hoffman (7) -3: Stenson (7) Jordan Spieth pushes his birdie effort at 18. It was never going in, heading right the second it left the face. Never mind: that’s a fine 74 given he started out 6-6. He’s -4, and will be a big part of this Masters at the weekend. Meanwhile Big Dustin follows up his silly save at 16 with another act of astonishing escapology at 17: a wild drive into the trees down the right, a stab out, then an easy wedge and putt to stay at -2. Patrick Reed regains the lead. He lands his second at 7 pin high, 15 feet from the flag, and trundles in the birdie putt. He’s -6. Meanwhile up on 18, Jordan Spieth finds the Lyle Bunker with his tee shot ... then hits a Lyle Iron into the green. That’s a wonderful shot, not wholly dissimilar to the 1988-winning strike by our Sandy. He’ll have a great look at a birdie that’d take him to -5 and salvage nearly all of the damage caused at 1 and 2 today. Rory talks to Sky Sports. “It feels OK. I played really well on the back nine. I had chances all the way in. I’m a little frustrated that I’m not in the clubhouse six or seven under par. I left a couple out there. The wind was up, the pin positions were tricky, it was tough to get it close. You have to stay patient around here! There are some six-footers where you have to give it two feet of break. You have to hole your fair share.” No birdie for Tiger on 8: he stays at +4 and continues to exude disappointment. And a fine scrambled par by Jordan Spieth from the front of 17. He remains at -4. “A good chance I would have thought of McIlroy and Spieth playing together tomorrow, maybe even last out,” writes Adam Hirst. “I’ve been wanting this to happen for a couple of years now, those two duking it out at the top of one of these major thingies.” Some characteristically absurd shenanigans involving Dustin Johnson. His tee shot at 16 is decent enough, 15 feet above the hole. His tapped birdie putt trundles past the cup and 50 feet down the green. Oh Dustin! But you already know what happens next, don’t you. That’s right, he drains the par putt! The patrons go loco. He stays at -2 in the most marvellously ludicrous fashion. His antics manage to obscure a fine two-putt par from his partner Justin Rose from 60 feet. Justin Thomas hands a shot back, from prime position in the centre of 7 too. His second flies through the green, his chip back doesn’t make it up the hill, and two putts later he’s scribbling a bogey five on his card. He’s level par again. Meanwhile up on 18, McIlroy finds the centre of the green, but can’t tease home his downhill ten-footer. Par, and he’s signing for a decent 71 that moves him to -4 and keeps him very much in the hunt. Incidentally, his playing partner Jon Rahm came back in 32 strokes, after birdies at 11, 13, 15 and 16. After yesterday’s poor 75, the Spaniard is in this Tournament again! He’s -1 overall. Matt Kuchar yips at what should be his final putt of the day, and that’s a needless bogey. He’s signing for a 75, having dropped back into the pack at -1. Rickie Fowler signs for a par 72: he’s -2 for the Tournament. Back on 15, Justin Rose clatters a gorgeous second into the heart of 15; a calm two-putt birdie is his prize. He’s -2. The in-form Bubba was very quiet yesterday, shooting a bog-standard 73. Today he’s firing on all cylinders: birdies at 2, 3 and now 6 more than offsetting the one dropped shot at the very difficult par-three 4th. He’s -1. On 8, Zach Johnson clips a wedge to a couple of feet, and will surely kick in for a birdie that’ll move the 2007 champ to -3. And up on the last, Phil drops yet another stroke, and smiles thinly as he puts his name to a 79. He’s +5, right on the cut line; he’ll be holding his breath for the next three or four hours. Charley Hoffman likes it round here: a top-ten finish three years ago, a couple of top-3o finishes since. And he’s at it again. After yesterday’s 69, he’s in credit today: bogey at the opening hole, but birdies at 2 and now 5. He moves to -4, just one off the lead - which still includes Marc Leishman, the Aussie having done very well to scramble his par after that wild drive on 7. He got his second to within touching distance of the green, and got up and down to salvage his score. Par for Spieth at 16; par for McIlroy at 17. Tiger hasn’t got moving this afternoon. He sends his second at 7 just off the back, then races his birdie putt a good ten feet past the hole. He knocks in the return to save his par. He stays at +4, on the right side of the projected +5 cut. There are currently 55 players at +5 or better; it’s the top 50 and ties, plus players within ten strokes of the lead, who will remain here at the weekend. The margins are slim, unless he can get moving the other way soon. A par five next, though! Jordan Spieth’s comeback continues! He finds the heart of 15 in two big blows. His long eagle putt trundles 18 feet past. No worries! He strokes the return straight into the cup, and that’s a birdie that brings him back to -4. Justin Thomas holes one from just off the green at 6: it’s his third birdie of the day already, and he’s -1. Rickie Fowler, having dropped a stroke at 16, picks it up again at 17: he’s -2. And look at the veteran Vijay Singh! The 2000 champion follows up birdie at 8 with another at 10, and the 55-year-old Fijian is right in the mix! -5: Leishman (6), Reed (4) -4: McIlroy (16), Spieth (15) -3: Singh (10), Stenson (5), Hoffman (4) Patrick Reed surrenders sole ownership of the lead. His tee shot at the par-three 4th clattered into the stand on the left; he failed to get up and down, and he’s back to -5. He might be handed it back soon, mind, because Marc Leishman has just flayed a wild drive deep into the trees down the right of 7. Meanwhile up on 16, Rory clips his tee shot pin high, and very nearly drains the uphill 25-footer for birdie. He remains at -4, just one off the new lead. Justin Rose’s putter has betrayed him in the last hour or so. A three-putt on 11, a tiddler yipped at 12, and now a birdie chance from 12 feet passed up at 14. Birdie at 13 is the one bright note in that little run, and it keeps him in good nick at -1. Tony Finau’s in the clubhouse with a 74, incidentally; he’s -2, having rescued an average round with birdie at the last. McIlroy lags a long putt from the fringe at the back of 15 to a couple of feet. That’s only a par at the par-five, but he’d have settled for that score when he saw his second come hot off the face, and sail dangerously close to the water. He stays a couple off the lead at -4. Meanwhile Tommy Fleetwood continues to amble across Augusta in a very calm and considered fashion: another par, this time at 6, and he’s -2 for both his round today (having birdied 2 and 3) and the Tournament. Here’s the world number two, the most in-form player right now, Justin Thomas. He posted a very disappointing 74 yesterday, but he’s started very well today, with birdies at 2 and 4 that bring him back to level par for the Tournament. Up on 16, bother for Phil, who sends his tee shot into sand at the back of the green. He’s left with a delicate splash down the putting surface, and having overhit it, is happy to see the fringe stop the ball before it drops into the water. Two putts, and that’s another shot gone. He’s never been the same today since hitting a tree flush on 9. He’s +4, and his dreams of becoming the oldest Master are as good as over already. Tiger managed to get up and down from the sand at 5, after all that hassle in the bushes. He’s limited the damage to a double bogey, and drops to +4. Meanwhile up on 15, Rory sends his second through the green and flirts with the water at the back. His ball stops on the bank, but he’ll have a hell of a chip up. His bump up doesn’t reach the putting surface, but he doesn’t look too upset: if he’d hit that one hot, it’d have been through the green and into the drink on the other side like a shot. Still, he’s left with an up and down from the fringe to save his par. Thanks to Michael. Tomorrow is Moving Day, of course ... rain permitting ... but maybe that qualified as Moving Hour, because a lot of big names made some positive strides at last. Patrick Reed with three birdies in the first three holes, matching the feat of Marc Leishman earlier, to take the lead. A birdie at 13 for Jordan Spieth. Birdie for Zach Johnson at 5. Birdie for his namesake Dustin at 13. Birdie at 13 for Louis Oosthuizen. And a shot picked up by Henrik Stenson at 2. So here’s the latest leaderboard: -6: Reed (3) -5: Leishman (5) -4: McIlroy (14), Stenson (3) -3: Spieth (14), Oosthuizen (15), Z Johnson (6), Hoffman (3) Scott is back from his break so I’ll hand you back. Enjoy the rest of day two! Bye! McIlroy is on a roll! Back-to-back birdies – at 13 and 14 – means he’s tied for third with Stenson! The Northern Irishman played a wonderful tee shot from 13, with his second shot bouncing on the green and rolling to the back of it, just short of the dangerous bunker. From there he two-putts. On 14, his tee shot just about stays on the right edge of the fairway, he flies his second shot onto the green, and then sinks a 27-footer (!!!) to move to -4. Who would bet against McIroy in this sort of form? Tiger, meanwhile, has hit a couple of horrible shots at 5. His tee shot goes right into the patrons, and despite a decent lie, Tiger absolutely whacks it clear the green, his ball rolling well into the magnolias. He’s going to have to take a drop from inside the bush! He can only dink it out into the bunker, and is facing a triple-bogey. This could be curtains for Tiger, such a shame after his par at 4. Any social players out there – myself included – will recognise this sort of golf: this triple-bogey at 9 took Phil from -2 to +1 after a wayward drive, a bump off some trees, a dropped shot and a loose chip from the rough. He’s since slipped to +3 thru 14. Ouch. Just like Leishman, Reed has started birdie, birdie! Reed landed in the bunker at 2, but duffed his way out beautifully to within four feet and knocked in his birdie. That means we have a tie for the lead: Reed and Leishman are at -5! Tiger at 4, his tee shot clearing the green and ending up by the fifth tee! But a delightful, delicate dink is beautifully weighted, and Woods clips the fringe, the ball carefully rolling back onto the green. He did well not to overcook that chip, it’s a lightning fast downhill slope. As it is, he has a tricky 11ft downhill putt … and makes his par! Wow! That was quite something from Tiger! He doesn’t make any impression on the leaderboard, but that par save will do him a world of good. The crowd are pumped up! Leishman is making moves, man. The Australian has started his first three holes with three birdies, and once again takes an outright lead at the top! He’s now on -5, after a delicious chip at 3 left him three feet from the hole. No problem for our red-hot leader, he sinks in. Leishman looks very focused, as he marches off to the fourth tee. Kuchar is playing very well and after a bogey at 12, he responds immediately at the par-five 13 with a birdie. Unlike many of those around him, he’s not falling away … yet. Stenson, meanwhile, is out of the clubhouse and has started like a train and now shares second place with Cabrera-Bello and Reed after a birdie at 2. His second shot just about pulled up short before the bunker on the front of the green and he’s able to two putt from there. He looks well set for another birdie on the par-four 3, too, after a huge 327-yard drive to leave him within 50 yards of the pin. The same can’t be said for Mickelson, who continues to nosedive back through the field. He’s now +5 today thru 13, which means he’s at +3. Tiger misses a chance for birdie at 3, his putt squirting left to right just before the hole. He remains at +2. Cabrera Bello hits straight back, to tie the lead! He birdies at 9, pars at 10 and starts Amen Corner by smoking a drive 282 yards straight onto the fairway. He’ll have a perfect approach shot into the green, where Spieth has made a miraculous recovery. His drive ended up so far right that is ended up the other side of the trees, and the overnight leader was able to go back over the foliage and reach the back of the green in two. He two-putts from about 70ft to make his par. Excellent scrambling there. That’s a long par four – 505 yards – and maybe the hardest hole on the course with a narrow drive. Thanks Scott. Send me your hopes, dreams, opinions: michael.butler@theguardian.com or tweet @michaelbutler18, if you are so inclined. As Scott mentioned, we have a new leader! Leishman has started birdie, birdie and looks in ominous form. Here’s how he started at the first. Meanwhile, Spieth is at Amen corner and has gone right, near to where Tiger was yesterday. Right, I’m going to hand over to Michael Butler for a bit. Back soon, but I’ll leave you with the latest - much-changed, super-concentrated - leaderboard. With all-new leader, thanks to Marc Leishman’s second birdie at 2! -4: Leishman (2) -3: Cabrera Bello (9), Wiesberger (6), Stenson, Reed, Hoffman, Hadwin -2: Fowler (12), Kuchar (12), McIlroy (11), Spieth (10), Oosthuizen (10), Z Johnson (2) -1: Smith (F), Finau (15), Rose (9), D Johnson (9), Moore (8), Singh (5), Stanley (3), Fleetwood (2) Mickelson meanwhile only just finds the front of the dancefloor from the dropzone, and has a long putt for bogey. He very nearly drains it, but that’s another double, and he’s clanking down the leaderboard to +3. A bogey, double and triple in the last four holes. Oh Phil! Kuchar meanwhile doesn’t take advantage of his big break. duffing his chip and leaving himself with a long putt from the fringe. Two strokes with the flat stick, and he drops out of the lead to -2. And spare a thought for poor Rickie Fowler, who clipped a lovely tee shot to 12 feet, but somehow his well-struck birdie putt didn’t drop. He stays at -2. More woe for Phil Mickelson II: He’s short and wet at 12. Oh dear. His challenge is beginning to unravel again. Some luck for his partner Matt Kuchar, though, whose tee shot is big, but doesn’t stick on the azalea-covered bank, dropping back down towards the green. It’s not ideal, but it’s much the better of the two options he had when the ball was sailing through the sky, taking his hopes and dreams with it. More woe for Phil Mickelson. He sends his second at 11 into Larry Mize Country. Faced with a treacherous green, and water behind it, he quits on his lob shot. Now there’s something you don’t see every day: a mishit Phil Flop. His second attempt goes close, rolling quickly enough towards the hole to appreciate why Phil was so hesitant in the first place. But that’s a bogey, and he’s back to +1. Pars for Kuchar and Fowler, who stay at -3 and -2 respectively. Tiger can’t make his par, a 20-foot putt slipping away to the right. That’s a dismal bogey from prime position in the fairway. He slips back to +2. But it’s a birdie for Marc Leishman, who joins the leading group at -3 after swishing his second to ten feet. Par for Tommy Fleetwood, who stays at level par. Elsewhere, birdie for Cabrera Bello on 8, as the Spaniard rejoins the leading pack. And a very fine par save by Spieth on 9, who wanged his drive miles right, but gave himself a chance by sending his second greenside, then getting up and down from the back. He stays at -2, but he’s taken 40 to reach the turn. Tiger’s out and about! And he starts by blootering a 340-yard drive down the middle of Tea Olive. Perfectly placed. But he misses badly, sending his ball down into the swale to the left of the green. His chip up only just remains on the green, and he’ll have a testing par putt. This isn’t quite as good as Sergio making birdie on 16 yesterday after running up 13 on the 15th ... but Phil Mickelson rebounds from that tree-bothering triple-bogey on 9 with birdie at 10. His iron into the elevated green, arrowed straight at the flag, is as good an approach as we’ve seen on that difficult hole all week. He’s back to level par for the Tournament, and despite it all, just three off the lead. A strong end to 1988 hero Sandy Lyle’s round. The first British player to win a green jacket birdied 13, 15 and 16, which hauled him up the standings to +6 for the Tournament. That burst may be enough to survive the cut ... which currently stands at +8, and won’t be sending too many people home, though it’s way too early to speculate at the moment. More hot cut chat later, as the picture becomes clearer. Jordan Spieth just can’t get it going today. He crashes onto the par-five 8th green in two big strokes, but ends up missing a ten-footer for birdie. A disappointing three-putt par. He stays at -2. Tony Finau continues to slip, thankfully just down the leaderboard this time: bogey at 11 means he’s three over today, and -1 for the Tournament. And the very early clubhouse leader is Cameron Smith of Australia: he’s followed up yesterday’s 71 with a 72, and stands at -1. If Fred Couples plays this weekend, he’ll be in a tie in second place with Gary Player for most cuts made at Augusta: 30 to Jack Nicklaus’s 47. He should make it easily, too, because he followed up that birdie at 12 with another at 13. He’s back to +1, a fine response after that triple-bogey blowout at 11. Meanwhile at the top, Bernd Wiesberger bogeys 4 to drop back into the pack at -3. And Ryan Moore has birdied 6 to rise to -1; he’s three under for his round, which is quite something on a day when red figures on the leaderboard are at a premium. Mickelson is left with a downhill slider for triple bogey. He strokes it in, but that seven means he reaches the turn in 39, and he crashes down to +1 for the Tournament. The gallery falls quiet as he wanders off with the air of a man who worries that the jig might already be up. It’s probably a bit early to be thinking like that ... but sevens on your card don’t encourage positivity. Par for Kuchar (-3) and bogey for Fowler (-2) seem undramatic by comparison. Phil flops up onto the green. He doesn’t give it enough, and the ball threatens to topple off the front of the severely sloping green. He’s very lucky that the fringe stops his ball, because you’ve seen them running off back down the fairway from there. He rattles his putt up the green and towards the cup; it’s close, but sails six feet past. This is getting very messy. Phil the Thrill is in awful trouble down the right of 9. Having crashed a wild drive into the pines, he tries to flash his second through a gap in the trees ... but hits one trunk flush, his ball twanging back and right, into further trouble. He’s forced to take a drop ... and though it’s not yet confirmed, talk is that it’s an unplayable. So he hits his fourth up towards the green ... and only finds the patrons down the right. He’s left with a chip up a steep bank, and not much in the way of green to play with. This could be terribly costly for the 2004, 2006 and 2010 champion. And we have a new leader, because the big Austrian Bernd Wiesberger - previously steady at Augusta National but never spectacular - has just followed up his birdie at 2 with another at 3. Factoring in the recent oscillations of Fowler and Spieth, plus another bogey for the erratic Cabrera Bello, this time at 6, the leaderboard is, like the Love Boat, exciting and new! -4: Wiesberger (3) -3: Fowler (8), Kuchar (8), Stenson, Reed, Hoffman, Hadwin -2: Mickelson (8), McIlroy (7), Spieth (7), Cabrera Bello (6), Z Johnson, Leishman Spieth’s second into 7 is short and right. With the pin tucked tightly behind bunkers on that side of the hole, getting up and down is a job of work. And it’s one he can’t complete. Another dropped shot for the overnight leader, who slips out of the leading group: he’s -2. Meanwhile up on 13, Amen Corner finally catches Haotong Li. He doesn’t connect with his approach at all, giving up on his swing halfway through. It’s so weak the ball doesn’t reach Rae’s Creek. He very nearly salvages par, an inch or so away from draining a big right-to-left curler. But he’s back down to +2 now. A 60-foot eagle effort for Matt Kuchar at the par-five 8th. He severely undercooks it, leaving himself ten feet short. His birdie effort stays on the right lip, and that’s a three-putt par. Very disappointing for the co-leader, who spurns a golden chance to snatch the glory for himself. Then Fowler trundles one in from 30 feet for birdie, and he joins the pack in the lead at -3! Par for Mickelson who remains at -2. Do we need another player in the leading group at -3? Well, we’ve got one. Bernd Wiesberger, with birdie at 2. Big Dustin slips back to level par for the Tournament with bogey at 5. And an opening-hole birdie for Daniel Berger, one of the USA’s many major champions in waiting. The 24-year-old from Florida often gets forgotten amid all the talk of your Spieths and Thomases ... but he’s already got a top-ten finish here to his name. And after yesterday’s 73, he’s positioned nicely enough this week. He’s level par for the Tournament. Justin Rose never got into red figures yesterday. But he battled and battled, and birdie on the 18th meant he was signing for a level-par 72. Now he’s finally crossed into credit, having bogeyed 1 but bounced back with birdies at 3 and now 5. Last year’s runner-up is now -1 for both round and Tournament. Also bouncing back: Boom Boom, with birdie at 12, moving up to +2 ... and Cabrera Bello, picking one up again at 5 to rejoin the leading pack at -3. McIlroy drops out of the leading bunch, failing to get up and down from the back of the par-three 6th. Cabrera Bello slips back, too, with bogey at 4. Very few folk are moving forward, the aforementioned Oosthuizen and DJ apart. But here’s Ryan Moore, with early birdies at 2 and 3: he’s suddenly level par for the Tournament, and his is the best round on the course right now. Augusta National is playing hard, fast and tough. Up on 11, disaster for Fred Couples, who sends his approach into Larry Mize Country, then whistles a chip across the green and into the water. He runs up a triple-bogey 7. That follows birdie at 8 and bogey on 10, so he’s dropped four shots in two holes. He’s +3 for both his round today and the Tournament. Meanwhile after getting out of position, his partner Li nearly holes out from the fairway for the second day in a row. He’ll happily settle for par ... and then caresses the shot of the week so far at 12 to 18 inches! He’ll kick that in for a birdie that’ll bring him back to +1. Li birdied every hole of Amen Corner yesterday: he’s taken to this place, it’s fair to say. One of the very many co-leaders, Matt Kuchar, gets himself into a spot of trouble down the left of 7. He can only find the bunker at the front of the green, but splashes out to four feet to scramble his par. His partners Mickelson and Fowler both set up birdie chances, though. First Rickie from 20 feet: it shaves the right lip. So close. Then Phil from eight feet, but that one doesn’t drop either. Kuchar stays at -3; Mickelson and Fowler at -2. The world number one Dustin Johnson has been quiet, by his own standards. He signed for a one-over 73 yesterday. But he’s exploded out of the blocks this morning, knocking in a 30-footer for eagle at 2. That brings him up the leader board to -1. Going the other way: Xander Schauffele, with bogeys at 5 and 6 more than negating his birdie at 4. He’s back to level par. An up-and-down start for Rafa Cabrera Bello. Bogey at 2, and now a bounce-back birdie at 3. It brings him into an eight-way tie for the lead at -3, with Kuchar, McIlroy, Spieth, Stenson, Reed, Hoffman and Hadwin. This is gloriously ridiculous. Speaking of which, Haotong Li had reached the turn in 42, carding another double at 9 after another wild drive. He’s in trouble again up 10, down the steep bank front-left of the green. But he slam-dunks the chip into the cup for a much-needed birdie! He flings his club into the air in theatrical glee, nearly braining poor Freddie Couples as he does so. But it’s all taken in good spirit. Yes, there’s something of the showman in Haotong Li alright. There are ways of making par, and ways of making par. Rickie Fowler - who had birdied 5 - sent his tee shot at the par-three 6th wide right of the green. Faced with a treacherous downhill chip, he sent it sliding 70 feet past the hole. And then, to the astonishment and delight of the punters, he rolled in the monster putt to save his par! He stays at -2, just one off the lead! Spieth makes a meal of Flowering Peach. His drive is straight and true, but his chip up is clumsy, and he’s left with a 15-footer coming back. He can’t make it, and a genuine birdie opportunity is passed up. A little succour is provided by Rory McIlroy, who can’t get up and down from the back of the testing par-three 4th, and slips out of the lead ... for a second or two. That’s because Matt Kuchar pulls his second to 5 into sand, an error from the centre of the fairway that costs him bogey. Nobody’s moving forward right now ... except for Louis Oosthuizen, who birdies 3 and is just a shot off the lead. This is a very crowded leaderboard. Can you spot your favourite? Pretty much everyone, apart from poor old Sergio, is on it. -3: Kuchar (5), McIlroy (4), Spieth (3), Stenson, Reed, Hoffman, Hadwin -2: Finau (7), Mickelson (5), Fowler (5), Oosthuizen (3), Cabrera Bello (3), Wiesberger, Z Johnson, Leishman Mickelson loses his early momentum, carelessly at the par-three 4th. His tee shot topples off the back of the green. It should be a reasonably simple up and down for a player with his short game, but a heavy chip rolls eight feet past the hole and he can’t hole out coming back. He drops into the group at -2. Rory joins the leaders with birdie at 3! He skelps his drive down the bank to the left of the green at the short par-four, then chips up to four feet and knocks in his putt. Tony Finau continues to move the wrong way, though: a second bogey of the day at 6, and perhaps that sleepless night worrying about his ankle on Wednesday is beginning to catch up with him. He’s -2. And Jordan Spieth’s travails continue! Another wild drive, this time down the left of 2, leads to a dropped shot at the par-five. This is an uncharacteristic wobble by the young Texan, who has now dropped four shots in the last three holes he’s played. -4: Kuchar (3), McIlroy (3) -3: Mickelson (3), Spieth (2), Cabrera Bello (1), Stenson, Reed, Hoffman, Hadwin McIlroy repairs the damage of that opening bogey with birdie at 2. He’s back up to -3, just one off Kuchar and Spieth’s lead. His playing partner Jon Rahm is also fixing things up nicely: eagle at 2 offsets the damage made by inexplicably finding water on 16 yesterday. He’s back to +1 overall. Jimmy Walker gets back in credit today with birdie at 8: he’s level par again for the Tournament. And Xander Schauffele, last year’s Tour Championship winner, continues to enjoy his Augusta debut: a birdie at 4 to follow yesterday’s impressive 71, and he’s -2 overall. Li’s struggles continue. The poor young chap is really feeling it today. His drive at 7 is tight down the right. His second finds sand. Not for the first time this week, he catches one clean out of the trap, and his ball flies hysterically off to the 17th! He chips back through the trees and holds the green wonderfully, using the shoulder of a bunker to stop his ball topping off the front. He very nearly drains the 30-foot bogey putt, but that’s a double that sends him crashing down to +1. He’s four over for his round already. Yesterday’s 69 suddenly seems an awful long time ago. The leader Jordan Spieth makes an awful mess of Tea Olive. His opening drive is sliced deep into the trees down the right. He doesn’t make a great job of extricating himself from the situation, and can’t find the green with his third. He’s just off the front. And he doesn’t get up and down from there, when he desperately needed to. That’s a double bogey. What a shocker of a start by the Tournament leader. Remember he was standing on the 18th tee yesterday evening at -7, three clear of the field, before dropping a shot there. Now look... -4: Kuchar (2), Spieth (1) -3: Finau (5), Mickelson (2), Cabrera Bello, Stenson, Reed, Hoffman, Hadwin -2: McIlroy (1), Wiesberger, Z Johnson, Leishman A miserable start to the round for Rory McIlroy. After skelping his opening drive into the trees down the left, he looks to have salvaged the situation by reaching the green in regulation. But a hideous misread leaves his first putt 15 feet short, and that leads to a bogey that drops him to -2. Not the sort of thing you can afford when Jordan Spieth is heading up the leaderboard, and behind you watching. Meanwhile up on 2, birdie for Phil Mickelson: he’s just three shots back at -3! Fred Couples continues to serenely perambulate around Augusta. His tee shot at the par-three 6th topples back off the front of the green, much to the displeasure of the patrons. No matter! He flips a delicate lob onto the green to five feet, and knocks in the saver. Six pars in a row and he stays at level par for the Tournament. Meanwhile his partner Haotong Li showcases his sense of humour, knocking in a five-footer to save his par and avoiding the ignominy of three bogeys on the bounce. He punches the air with both fists, grinning broadly in mock celebration. He stays at -1, and has a bit of crowd-pleasing star quality about him. He’s enjoying himself, even if he’s been struggling a little today. “In your life (like the famous Verne Lundquist call of Tiger’s chip in 2005) wouldn’t you love to be able to do anything as easily and as well as Couples plays golf?” wonders Hubert O’Hearn. “No competitive rounds for a year, one of the toughest courses there is, elite competition? Yawn, scratch, stretch - BANG! - in the Top Ten. As you do.” Scoring is proving difficult on a warm but slightly windy morning. Jimmy Walker bogeys 6, meaning he’s back where he started the day at +1. That means the only man out there in red figures for his round today is the 2012 US Open champion Webb Simpson: birdies at 2 and 3 have taken him up to +2, after yesterday’s miserable 76. The 2011 Masters champ Charl Schwartzel is heading the other way: bogeys at 1 and 3 drop him to +2. Mickelson strokes his par putt straight into the cup. He strides off the green with the air of a relieved man. That’s a fine escape. Bogey for Fowler, though; a dismal effort after a perfect drive; he’s -1. Kuchar cleans up to remain at -4. Another dropped shot for Li, meanwhile, and his driver has cost him again. He found a deep bunker to the left of 5, caught the lip with his second, and bogey was almost inevitable. Back-to-back bogeys drop him to -1. Kuchar takes his medicine, punching back out onto the fairway. Then he wedges to six feet. Mickelson is able to slice his ball round the trunk of a tree, sending his ball all the way up to the verge of the green. A good result from where he was. He’s off the putting surface but takes his flat stick ... and leaves his putt a good 15 feet short. Fowler misses the green to the left from the middle of the fairway. His bump up from the swale is weak, and he’s ten feet short. All of a sudden Kuchar is the most likely to save his par, which just goes to show the value of a calm head in a crisis. Here comes the three-time Masters champion Phil Mickelson! Lefty carded a two-under 70 yesterday, without ever getting anywhere near top gear. He hoicks his opening drive today into the trees down the left. And this is a very interesting group. Rickie Fowler is up next: he splits the fairway, hoping to build on yesterday’s 70, which culminated in a three-birdie blitz on 15, 16 and 17. Finally it’s the ever-hovering Matt Kuchar, like Fowler one of the game’s great major-championship bridesmaids. Kuch shot a superb 68 yesterday; he’s two off Spieth’s lead, currently alone in second spot. But he’s hooked his opening drive into the woods down the left. The first look at where his ball has landed, by the trunk of a pine, suggests he might not have a swing. Li splashes out to ten feet, but tugs his par putt. A rare nerve-betraying pull from an impressive player. He drops back to -2. Couples never looks like sinking his birdie effort, but he tidies the par putt away without fuss from a couple of feet, and the 1992 champ has started out with four pars today. Li can’t convert a birdie putt from the fringe at the back of 3. But that’s another par, and this is a solid start by the young man. Here comes the hellishly difficult par-three 4th, though ... and he’s sent his tee shot into the bunker to the left of the green. His playing partner Fred Couples clacks calmly towards the rear portion of the putting surface, just to the right of the flagstick. He’ll have a look at birdie from 20 feet. Elsewhere, Smith’s erratic round continues apace with bogey at 7: he’s -1 for the Tournament again. And Walker drops one at 4, so he’s back to level par overall. Walker is still under par for his round today, though, the only player in credit out there so far today. Jimmy Walker is in the mood today. Another birdie, this time at 3, and he rises to -1. Cameron Smith is on the up again, too, scrubbing out that bogey at 5 with birdie at 6. He’s back to -2 for the Tournament. Just the one par so far for the young Aussie this morning. “After finally winning the damn thing last year, Sergio was always going to have to do something outstanding this year to be truly legendary,” begins Matt Dony. “Yesterday was a magnificent attempt at sporting immortality, so what can we expect today? A jazz flute solo on the 8th green? A Connor McGregor style outbreak of violence against a bus? A Kim Jong-Il-esque series of holes-in-one? The possibilities are endless.” You’ve really whetted the appetite here, Matt. Here’s hoping he takes to the 1st tee like RJ Sizzle. The first big change at the top of the leaderboard today sees Tony Finau fall out of a tie for second place. The 28-year-old Utah saint shot a magnificent four-under 68 yesterday, and the fact that it was his debut round at Augusta was rather obscured by his ankle-popping antics of the day before. So ... yeah, that was some introduction to life at the Masters. And after an opening-hole bogey, too. Well, he’s dropped a stroke at Tea Olive again today. It’ll be interesting if he can launch a similar fightback in his second round. That left leg’s got to be giving him gyp, though. -6: Spieth -4: Kuchar -3: Li (2), Finau (1), McIlroy, Cabrera Bello, Stenson, Reed, Hoffman, Hadwin Another birdie chance for Fred Couples. This one’s on 2, set up by a nerveless flop over sand to six feet. But he leaves this one high on the right. It was never going in. A couple of half-decent putts away from a very fast start, but it’s par-par and he remains at level. Li meanwhile cradles his long birdie putt to a couple of feet, and that’s another fine par for the young Chinese star after a couple of extremely wild drives. Ian Poulter is out early. The new Houston Open champion shot a two-over 74 yesterday, but he’s moving in the right direction today with birdie at 2. Doug Ghim continues to entertain. The amateur responds to that opening-hole double bogey with birdies at 2 and 3 and a bogey at 4. He’s +1. The 2016 PGA champ Jimmy Walker birdies 2 to move to level par for the Tournament. Cameron Smith drops a stroke at 5; he’s -1 again. And the 2008 champion Trevor Immelman continues to struggle, following up yesterday’s dismal 78 with bogeys at the opening two holes: he’s +8. Li has driven into a lot of bother. He’s deep in the trees, though his ball is sitting up on the pine straw. No time for heroics. “I just wanna make par,” he tells his caddy, course management uppermost in his mind. He takes his 8-iron and, swing restricted, punches a fine recovery out onto the fairway. In prime position to reach the green and make his par. He’s a little short, the ball only just reaching the putting surface, but he’ll have a long uphill birdie putt. Haotong Li is made of the right stuff. The 22-year-old from Hunan, China proved that with his final-round 63 in the Open at Birkdale last summer, coming from nowhere to snatch third spot. And he continues to provide evidence on his Masters debut. Yesterday he shot a wonderful three-under 69, a score built on a run of three birdies around Amen Corner. Today he’s already got his score-grinding abilities on display: after flaying a dreadful drive down 1, over the trees on the left, he sent a high second into the heart of the green, and two-putted to escape with a sensational par. He walked off the green with a huge smile across his face: he’s enjoying himself on his first visit to Augusta. He’ll need to scrap some more on 2, mind you: he’s just pulled his drive into thick oomska down the left again. But for now, he stays at -3, just three off Spieth’s lead. “Please no bedlam at the golf.” Eamonn Maloney with a cry from the heart there. “I’m having enough trouble keeping up with the mayhem at the chess and the downright pandemonium at the croquet. Feelgood veteran story this year? Couples looking OK.” Yes, well, Freddie Couples looking good at the Masters is the feelgood veteran story pretty much every year, it feels like. Since turning 50, he’s got one top-ten finish, three top-15s and two top-20s to his name. Throw in ties for third and sixth when in his forties. How on earth did he only win one Masters? Anyway, Boom Boom bangs one down the opening hole, then gently sends his second to ten feet. A great birdie chance. But he lets his putt slide off to the right and has to make do with par. He stays at level par after yesterday’s 72. Not half bad for a 58-year-old battling with a bad back. The first-round leader Jordan Spieth may be happy to see Cameron Smith high up the rankings. The 24-year-old Aussie finished tied for fourth in the 2015 US Open at Chambers Bay, a tournament Spieth won, and everyone’s a sucker for a good omen. Smith posted a calm and considered 71 yesterday, birdies at 10 and 15 offsetting an early bogey at 4. He’s on more of a rollercoaster today, though: an opening bogey followed by birdies at 2 and 3. He’s now -2 for the Tournament, in a tie for 11th spot. He’s the only one of the early starters in red figures for his round today. Mind you, there are only 15 players on the course so far. What Augusta National gives with one hand, it takes away with the other. Last night, the young Texan amateur Doug Ghim lived the dream, holing out from the fairway on 18 for eagle. Even better, his dad was on his bag. There’s not a golfer in the world who hasn’t drifted away, picturing a perfect moment like that. Ghim will always cherish the memory. But golf being golf, some bite-back misery is always around the next corner. And on the opening hole this morning, Ghim took four to get down from the side of the green. Double bogey, and that eagle’s handed straight back to the field. Oh! Still, the 2017 US Amateur runner-up had signed for a superb level-par 72 yesterday, so he’s still in good nick at +2. But what a game of ups and downs golf is. It’s a warm if not particularly sunny day at Augusta. The winds were changeable yesterday but not very strong; the players can expect more of the same today. So no great dramas. We can save those up for tomorrow, when rain is more likely than not, and thunderstorms could even be on the cards. Bedlam awaits. Perhaps. Here we go, then.

The courthouse swirled with diminished beauty: cracked marble, tarnished brass. It seemed so unlikely that it could feel like an actual hall of justice, that hope could find its way past the bulletproof glass and the metal detectors. I stood and smoothed my shirt, adjusted the 18 years’ worth of papers in my manila file folder, and tried to catch my breath. Please let today be the day it ends, I silently prayed. Let today be the day I clear my name. Lisa Selin Davis I bent down in the fading light and made out a faint red welt rising on his ankle. “It’s probably a stingray,” I said. Whatever bumped me in the water had felt substantial and solid. After the ray brushed my thigh, Sean must have inadvertently stepped on it. I had seen people stung by stingrays before and knew how excruciating it could be. So I wasn’t surprised when Sean said, “My head feels heavy. I’m having trouble breathing. Go get help.” He was quiet, calm, coherent. “Come with me,” I said, looking down at him, his dark hair wet, his long white legs now covered with sand. I’d never heard of venomous marine life in Thailand. I thought he was being squeamish. “Come with me,” I said.

This baby was not coming early. I simply wouldn’t allow it. Another week in bed went by. Every once in a while, they had me stand up, and every time I leaked amniotic fluid. But still I didn’t go into labour. Nor did I have a fever or abdominal pain, the two greatest indicators of infection. Life as I now knew it went on. After I had been on bed rest in the hospital for 25 days, there came a time when I stood up and no fluid gushed out of me to splatter on the floor. The nurse and I looked at each other in amazement. “Go take a shower, quick!” she said. “I’ll change the sheets on your bed.” Katherine Heiny The pressure to have sex was supposed to come from the outside world, not within.

My singular option was to uphold the promise of my purity ring or else deserve eternal damnation. My virginity vow no longer felt empowering.

I was just pretty': photos tell story of Jane and Serge","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The English singer and actor Jane Birkin met Serge Gainsbourg in 1968 when she was 22, and left the French singer and songwriter more than half a lifetime ago in 1980 – yet at 71 her name is still rarely mentioned without being bracketed with his. As an exhibition of photographs – called, inevitably, Jane &amp; Serge – opens in Calais, she seemed philosophical about the oversight. Among scores of glamorous images of the couple, the largest photograph by far, blown up to the size of a barn door, is of his handsome if haggard features cradling not Birkin but their dog Nana. “That’s what happens when you are with a great man,” she said. “He was a great man. I was just pretty.” She was equally cheerfully accepting of the fact that much of her fame still rests on one scandalous song, the ecstatic moans of Je t’aime ... moi non plus, recorded in the year she met him, and an international hit despite being banned in many countries. “It was surprising to be banned by both the Vatican and the BBC,” she said. “And it was funny to have the BBC orchestra playing it because they wouldn’t play it on Top of the Pops.” Birkin is halfway through a world tour of orchestral versions of Gainsbourg songs, and added: “If I am singing in Argentina in two weeks’ time, it is because of Je t’aime.” The photographs were taken by Birkin’s brother, Andrew, a film scriptwriter and director, who had been photographing his sister since he first bought a cheap camera in his teens. Some in the exhibition are family snaps, while others – including the couple mugging for the camera on a red doubledecker bus – come from a magazine photo shoot. All had been carefully filed away for half a century, and some he had never seen printed before. He met Gainsbourg almost as soon as his sister did, when he was working with Stanley Kubrick on the eventually aborted project for an epic film of Napoleon, and she wrote from the set of the film Slogan, begging him to come and keep her company and cheer her up from her daily encounters with “a horrible man”, who was mocking and teasing her. Gainsbourg was, and remains a giant in French cultural circles, but Birkin was already well known from film roles including a famous nude scene in Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1966 film Blow-Up. Birkin said: “I fell in love with Serge, Andrew fell in love with Serge, Serge fell in love with Andrew, we were a trio.” Her brother had no partner or children at the time, and regularly joined the couple and their children – her daughter Kate from her marriage to the composer John Barry, and Charlotte, born in 1971 – and dogs for holidays. Andrew Birkin took photographs continuously, documenting long lunches, smoky evenings, sleepy mornings, and less familiar views of the moody Gainsbourg roaring with laughter or playing rowdy games with the children. The gallery in Calais is a few miles up the coast from many of the happy seaside settings. “I had never met anyone like him, I adored him,” Andrew Birkin said. “It was not sexual – or maybe that is not what a psychiatrist would say. We did kiss on the lips.” Their intense triangular friendship survived the breakup of his sister’s relationship. He last saw Gainsbourg a few months before his death in 1991, at his house in Paris with its black and chrome interior, where fans still lay floral and painted tributes on the pavement. “He took me back to his bedroom with the big black bed in the big black room. He had a pile of film videos – not good films, terrible American cowboy things – he put one on, and he was fast asleep in two or three minutes. I left in the small hours and I never saw him again.” “It’s a bit weird,” Jane Birkin said, looking around at walls lined with her own shining young face, and Gainsbourg’s crumpled features usually wreathed in cigarette smoke, “it’s a bit like being dead.” She left because his melancholy and heavy drinking made him impossible to live with, she said, but thinks in many ways they were better friends and he wrote her better songs after she left. “You could talk back to him for once,” she said. “You were not just his creation any more.” • Jane &amp; Serge, Calais Museum of Fine Arts, until 4 November"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/10/mark-bonnar-i-do-a-good-cold-hard-stare-line-of-duty-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T14:00:28Z","webTitle":"Mark Bonnar: 'I do a good cold, hard stare'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/10/mark-bonnar-i-do-a-good-cold-hard-stare-line-of-duty-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/10/mark-bonnar-i-do-a-good-cold-hard-stare-line-of-duty-interview","fields":{"headline":"Mark Bonnar: 'I do a good cold, hard stare'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mark Bonnar takes comfort in the fact that he once played the back end of a pantomime cow. It was the actor’s first stage role, at the amateur Leith theatre in Edinburgh, the city where he was born. It was a funny start for a man who would go on to be known for the icy stare of his green-grey eyes. Back in 2008, he was in Michael Grandage’s Twelfth Night at Wyndham’s theatre, and on press night, he started to feel a serious case of nerves. “I knew Branagh was in the audience, and Judi … I was Orsino, so I opened the show with ‘if music be the food of love, play on.’” He starts to thump his chest. “My heart was giving it that,” he says, “and then I remembered about the pantomime cow. I thought, it’s all right, isn’t it?” He laughs. “It’s not a big deal, look …” If you can be the back end of a cow … “you can do anything”. I meet Bonnar over hasty supermarket sandwiches in his lunch break. He’s much more twinkly in the flesh than his famous TV baddies and bastards, from Line of Duty to Apple Tree Yard, would suggest. But he’s also adept at comedy, playing the acerbic and pathologically dry Chris in Catastrophe, as well as popping up in Psychoville and the rebooted Porridge. We’re at a rehearsal space in south London, where he’s finishing preparations for a new play at the Royal Court, Thomas Eccleshare’s Instructions for Correct Assembly. “It’s ostensibly about a man and a woman” – played by Jane Horrocks – “who have lost their son to a heroin overdose when he was 21,” he explains. “So they buy a new one, a flatpack son. A son they can construct. It’s about love and our relationship with technology, I suppose, and about parenting, and loss, obviously. All the big questions.” It’s the first time Bonnar has been on stage in six years, bar a monologue for Mark Gatiss’s Queers at the Old Vic in 2017. “I made a conscious decision after I did The Duchess of Malfi at the Old Vic [in 2012], when my daughter was six months old, to try doing more screen work,” he says. By that point he’d been doing theatre almost exclusively for over 10 years, and wanted to see what it was like in front of the camera. It also meant he had more time to spend with his two young children. “Certainly with stage, as I’m remembering, you don’t get to spend any time at home. With film, you might do three, four days a week, and they might not be full days. So that aspect of it was a consideration. But I also just wanted to try different kinds of working.” Almost immediately, he was cast as the philandering Duncan in BBC1’s Scottish take on scandi-noir, Shetland, a role that’s about to take him into its fifth series. “It’s a lovely thing to do,” he says. “And there were a few bits and bobs along the way, but Line of Duty was certainly a big break, if you like. It was the biggest part I’d played on telly, with the biggest profile.” In fact, his turn in the second series of Jed Mercurio’s show, playing the incorrigibly corrupt DCC Dryden, almost didn’t happen. Robert Lindsay had been cast but left the production two days in; Bonnar stepped up with barely any time to prepare. At one crucial point in the show’s labyrinthine plot, Dryden faces an interrogation that lasts 17 unbroken minutes of screen time. The scene is breathtakingly intense. “Never in my life had I seen a script [for one TV scene] that had 19 pages in it. That’s the genius of Jed ’s writing. He’s unafraid to go places other people don’t.” As the series progressed, its ratings grew, and by the finale, Line of Duty hype had reached fever pitch. “Man, I loved it. Who wouldn’t?” says Bonnar. “There was a point when somebody texted me a picture of me and Keeley [Hawes, who played Detective Inspector Lindsay Denton] on the front page of the Times! Just the name, and ‘whose team are you in?’ I thought, my god, it’s kind of mental.” Since then, he’s been on a roll, jumping from one quality TV show to the next, most recently in the grimly gripping Unforgotten, where he was a gay barrister who had been sexually abused as a child. He puts some of his success down to luck, or, as he puts it, “a chaotic miasma of circumstance that brings you to somebody’s door”. For example, when he played Eric Morecambe in BBC4’s Eric, Ernie and Me, he was lucky that his wife, the actor Lucy Gaskell, was from Wigan, and could help him with his north-west accent. “But it also helped when I woke up the morning of the audition saying, ‘I’m not going to do it. I can’t, it’s not me, I’m not right.’ She was going, ‘Don’t be stupid, get out of the door and go.’” He thinks it’s probably easier to be married to another actor, though he’s never been married to anyone else, he points out. “It’s a weird one, isn’t it, because sometimes you have to look deep into somebody’s eyes and tell them you love them and do it every night, or for millions of people to see on the telly. So yeah, I suppose it’s a bigger leap for those who don’t do it themselves, to imagine what the fuck you’re doing.” He laughs. “You have a shorthand: ‘God, I had to get my pants off today, it was really embarrassing.’ That’s all it would take, rather than, ‘You had to do what? Why? In front of how many people? 16?’” It was the simple fact that he loved Instruction for Correct Assembly so much that brought Bonnar back to the stage, even though his TV career continues to go from strength to strength. While he acts in a dystopian play about rebuilding one’s dead child, he will appear on Channel 4 in another near-future role, the third series of Humans. He plays a government scientist – other details are secret, including whether he’s a goodie or a baddie. “I don’t know if I should tell you that. And anyway, I think it’s more complicated. He’s neither one nor t’other. But both, maybe,” he teases. Why does he think audiences are so fascinated with the future right now? “I was in my 20s in the 90s, when mobile phones were first around,” he says. “That wasn’t that long ago. It feels like the rate at which it is evolving is far outstripping the rate at which we are.” He mentions fake news, Trump and the Cambridge Analytica revelations. “That kind of thing is exactly why we should be questioning our relationship with technology and truth and memory, and all the exciting things that this play brings up, albeit in a very domestic setting. That’s why things like Black Mirror are such a huge hit, because people are, rightly, terrified about what this all means.” He left Facebook himself a year ago, he says, and hasn’t missed it. Bonnar will turn 50 in November. “It gets weirder, the older you get. You look in the mirror,” he says, with a dramatic sigh, “and go, Jesus Christ, it’s all going so fast. I certainly don’t feel 50.” It’s also his mum and dad’s 50th wedding anniversary this year, and their 70th birthdays, so they’re thinking about getting together for one massive party. “My dad went to art school when I was one. They scraped and continued scraping, because artists, as we all know, don’t earn a lot of money. It’s a precarious existence and my mum didn’t work, so dad sold paintings. He was town artist for a couple of places, in the glorious 70s, when a thing like that even existed. A town artist, wow.” There’s a knock on the door, and Bonnar’s lunch break is up. This is the last day before they move into the theatre, and time is tight. Before he goes, I ask if he ever takes offence at being known as such a good villain. “No, I don’t think so,” he grins. “I relish it in a way, because you get to do things you would never obviously do. It’s more interesting to dive into those kinds of psyches.” And, he says, he’s got a good thousand-yard stare. “I do a good cold, hard stare,” he nods. Go on then. And he turns to me, and stares, and it’s so unnerving that I begin to squirm. “Yeah?” he says, refusing to drop it, for just a second too long. And then he starts to laugh. Instructions for Correct Assembly is at the Royal Court, London, until 19 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/06/david-trimble-ireland-risks-provoking-paramilitaries-over-post-brexit-border","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T11:31:36Z","webTitle":"David Trimble: Ireland risks provoking paramilitaries over post-Brexit border","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/06/david-trimble-ireland-risks-provoking-paramilitaries-over-post-brexit-border","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/06/david-trimble-ireland-risks-provoking-paramilitaries-over-post-brexit-border","fields":{"headline":"David Trimble: Ireland risks provoking paramilitaries over post-Brexit border","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"David Trimble, whose support was critical in creating the Good Friday agreement, has warned that the Irish government risks provoking loyalist paramilitaries with its stance on the border after Brexit. In a wide-ranging interview to mark the 20th anniversary of the agreement, Lord Trimble said any special deal to keep the region within Europe would destroy a key tenet of the agreement that there would no constitutional change without majority consent in Northern Ireland. “What is happening now is that people are talking up the issue of Brexit and the border for the benefit of a different agenda from the agreement,” Trimble said. “The one thing that would provoke loyalist paramilitaries is the present Irish government saying silly things about the border and the constitutional issue. If it looks as though the constitutional arrangements of the agreement, based on the principle of consent, are going to be superseded by so-called ‘special EU status’ then that is going to weaken the union and undermine the very agreement that Dublin says it wants to uphold.” Trimble was the Ulster Unionist leader at the time of the Good Friday negotiations and his backing for the agreement was crucial to its success. He was later awarded the Nobel prize for his efforts to secure peace in the region and was awarded a life peerage in 2006. But the former first minister of Norther Ireland said he believed loyalist paramilitaries could reactivate if the principle of consent enshrined in the agreement was put in danger by any post-Brexit deal demanded by the Irish government and nationalist parties. “I believe that some senior Irish government officials go around Brussels talking about the ‘Hong Kong model’ – the one country, two systems idea,” Trimble said. “That is a precedent they talk about where sovereignty has been transferred from Britain to China. Anything that looks remotely like this or is building on that foundation would be extremely dangerous. Although I think that under this Conservative government I cannot see that prevailing.” Trimble also claimed another threat to the union between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK was the Democratic Unionists alienating pro-union Catholics and the “moderate middle classes” in general over issues such as the party’s opposition to gay marriage equality. And the DUP made a mistake by asking for £1 bn as the price for keeping the Conservatives in power, Trimble said. “When the DUP asked for that money it was always going to infuriate Scotland, Wales, many of the English regions. That is how you lose friends in Britain as well as the votes especially of the moderate middle classes in Northern Ireland.” The Tory peer was equally downbeat about the possibility of a Jeremy Corbyn government, which he thinks may agree to Northern Ireland being given special status inside the EU after Brexit, which in turn would decouple the region from the UK. “His right-hand man [John McDonnell] who in government might get a rush of blood to the head and go to his old mates like Gerry Adams and give him what they want. If he and Corbyn were the two leading figures in a Labour government and created ‘special status’ after Brexit that would be very dangerous.” While having “no real regrets” in signing the agreement even after it split his party, Trimble said he wished he had kept closer to Tony Blair when he was prime minister. By the time he lost his Upper Bann parliamentary seat in the 2005 general election, Blair’s government was already pursuing a strategy of “wooing the extremes”, according to Trimble, by seeking support for a second agreement, between Sinn Féin and the DUP. “I genuinely believe that Blair was the last person to back a strategy which effectively saw the two centre parties, the UUP and the SDLP, abandoned. In fact I know now it was a very senior civil servant in the Northern Ireland Office who agreed to the strategy, proposed by the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin..” Trimble said Blair’s letter of assurance over IRA disarmament that he gave Trimble’s negotiating team less than 24 hours before Good Friday 1998 was “absolutely critical and vital” in securing UUP support for the agreement. Under the rules of the talk the agreement would not have come into existence unless it acquired the backing of both major unionist and nationalist parties around the negotiating table. One of Trimble’s most vocal internal critics in the UUP after he backed the Good Friday agreement was Arlene Foster, the leader of the DUP. While he said he sympathises with the problems Foster has to deal with in the absence of a power-sharing government in Belfast, he laughed and added: “Do you know that in all the times when I was UUP leader and she used to be in the party before defecting to the DUP, Arlene never spoke to me once. “Other internal critics like Jeffrey Donaldson [once an Ulster Unionist now the DUP MP for Lagan Valley] always went out of their way to speak to me even when the UUP was a divided house over the agreement. Jeffrey was always civil with me despite our differences but I cannot recall one occasion where Arlene said anything to me at all.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/06/alice-in-wonderland-and-midsomer-murders-moscows-alternative-theories-for-skripal-case","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T10:08:20Z","webTitle":"Alice in Wonderland and Midsomer Murders: Moscow's alternative theories for Skripal case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/06/alice-in-wonderland-and-midsomer-murders-moscows-alternative-theories-for-skripal-case","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/06/alice-in-wonderland-and-midsomer-murders-moscows-alternative-theories-for-skripal-case","fields":{"headline":"Alice in Wonderland and Midsomer Murders: Moscow's alternative theories for Skripal case","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Moscow’s explanations for the Salisbury nerve agent attack last month have been irreverent and numerous; Russian officials appear to have hurled alternative versions of events at the wall just to see what sticks. Russian polemics at the UN security council have alluded to Alice in Wonderland and the TV series Midsomer Murders, suggesting that Sweden synthesised the poison or that it was a “false flag” attack by British authorities, among more than a dozen other theories. By Thursday night, Russia’s embassy to the UK was zeroing in on what happened to Sergei Skripal’s pets – two cats and two guinea pigs, according to his niece – in its latest Twitter allegations of a cover-up. “Was there even a poisoning at all?” asked Aleksey Pushkov, a Russian politician and one of the country’s many outspoken hawks competing for attention. “In 2003, PM Tony Blair lied to the whole world about the danger of an Iraqi chemical attack. Is it a relapse?” British diplomats, who have made their own missteps in promoting their version of events, have complained about Russia’s blase attitude toward the allegations that Moscow was behind the first military-grade nerve agent attack in Europe since the second world war. But Moscow’s madcap defence of unlikely alternatives has characterised its diplomatic wrangling over years of conflict with the west, starting long before the Skripal poisoning. The appearance of unidentified Russian soldiers in Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in 2014 was explained away as locals wearing uniforms they bought at a store. The Malaysian jetliner MH17, which was downed by a Buk missile brought in from Russia, according to Dutch-led investigators, had been shadowed by a phantom Ukrainian fighter jet seen only by a fake air traffic controller. And the hacking of the US Democratic National Committee in 2016 may have been done by Russians, as the US claimed, but they were just unaffiliated patriots who follow their whims like artists. These three alternative versions of events were not voiced by isolated officials, but by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Rather than shying away from the Skripal case, Russian public figures have put it front and centre, at times engaging in almost reckless controversy. On national television, presenters have insisted on bringing out Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun, the two ex-KGB agents accused of the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko with polonium-210. They appeared on the same show as Viktoria Skripal, the niece of Sergei Skripal. She later gave a recording of a conversation she said she held with Skripal’s daughter Yulia, claimed to be her first statements heard in public since the attack. Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Moscow Carnegie Centre, said that showing Russians the conflict with the west over the Skripal case could play in the government’s favour. Public opinion was on the side of the government, he said – 72% of Russians have told the independent Levada Centre that they believe Russia was not responsible for the poisoning. As with MH17, Kolesnikov said, the majority of Russians would reject the suspicions against Moscow. And the sense of being besieged, he said, may bolster patriotic feeling. “If you don’t have a second Crimea, you have to exploit unjust attacks from the west,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/05/police-stop-and-search-knife-crime","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T15:55:07Z","webTitle":"As an ex-police officer I know stop and search is no solution to knife crime | Leroy Logan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/05/police-stop-and-search-knife-crime","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/05/police-stop-and-search-knife-crime","fields":{"headline":"As an ex-police officer I know stop and search is no solution to knife crime","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A couple of years before I retired as an officer, the Metropolitan police carried out a survey on knife crime across the capital’s schools. One point came through loud and clear: that many young people carried knives out of fear for their own safety. This echoed the anecdotal evidenced I observed during my 17 years’ work on developing educational responses, and was especially true where young people lived in crime hotspots, invariably linked to street robberies, crack cocaine drug-dealing and the associated “postcode” gang affiliations (though only about half of violence is gang-related). With more than 50 murders in the capital this year, there has been a renewed focus on gun and knife crime. It is a complex issue and divides opinion over police tactics and community responses. Added to my experience of policing over three decades, it seemed to me that if young people did not feel safe and secure, they could be swayed by peer pressure or crime gangs into carrying knives, and so knife crime would increase. And if vulnerable youngsters, often traumatised by exposure to violence, directly or indirectly, are not given any emotional or psychological support they can internalise their emotions, only to erupt with the minimum of provocation, resulting in violent episodes and tit-for-tat reprisals. If this is overlaid by the misuse of drugs, alcohol, social media and violent music, you have a cocktail of volatility that can spread like a disease. Sadly, services aimed at safeguarding young people have been drastically cut by the government’s austerity strategy. Therefore it shouldn’t be a shock that knife crime increased by more than 25% last year, following gradual increases beforehand. And the devastating consequences have been the increasing number of deaths and life-changing injuries. When I was the deputy borough commander of Hackney, east London, from 2004 to 2007, I was in charge of the safer neighbourhood teams, whose purpose was to build trust and confidenceand improve two-way information sharing. I also had safer schools officers in each of the borough’s secondary schools. These all generated significant intelligence on why and where violent crime was occurring, and helped in crime prevention. I realised then that we could not arrest our way out of the knife crime problem, since it bore no correlation with stop and search. This is still the case today, according to Home Office data: the proportion of stop and searches that end in arrest for carrying a knife is less than 5%. The Met undertook 300,000 stop and searches last year (more than 50% of all stops nationally); and given that black people are eight times more likely to be stopped than white people, there’s little doubt the resentment it causes has an impact on community intelligence, an essential ingredient in effective policing. Added to this, the safer neighbourhood teams have now been drastically cut under austerity, like many police resources. The Met has fewer than 30,000 officers for the first time in 15 years, and has 700 fewer detectives than it had a few years ago. The World Health Organization has for many years advocated a public health approach, which has significantly reduced violence in many cities globally. Glasgow, once known as the murder capital of Europe, was able to cut knife crime by 40% by recognising trauma in young people as adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). This put young people at the centre of its strategy, caring for them and not trying to scare them with chest-thumping rhetoric around enforcement. For the past year I have been working on an all-party youth violence commission, bringing together academics and practitioners, and looking at how the public health approach can be adapted in London. Above all, I believe there is an urgent need to fund safeguarding organisations, and improve their engagement with and support for young people. If we start with that we will at least have a chance to deal with violent crime – a crisis that at the moment only seems to be getting worse. • Leroy Logan is a former superintendent in the Metropolitan police and a former chair of the Black Police Association Charitable Trust"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/15/browse-bookshop-five-leaves-bookshop-nottingham","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T10:00:10Z","webTitle":"Browse a bookshop: Five Leaves, Nottingham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/15/browse-bookshop-five-leaves-bookshop-nottingham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/15/browse-bookshop-five-leaves-bookshop-nottingham","fields":{"headline":"Browse a bookshop: Five Leaves, Nottingham","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"“Five Leaves has always seen diversity (class, gender, age, sexuality and race) as important – in its staff, stocking policy, events,” says bookseller Jane Anger. “It reflects the world, and community, that we live in.

Less than two months ago, Kimmel explained, Trump boasted in a tweet of a “45 year low on illegal border crossings this year”, adding that “Ice and border patrol agents are doing a great job for our country. “So even though border crossings are the lowest they’ve been since 1971, and everyone’s doing a great job, he’s sending in the national guard,” the host said, noting that in the last week Trump has been particularly fixated on what he believes to be “caravans” of illegal immigrants crossing the southern border into the US. “And I’m sure the members of the national guard are thrilled they will be now spending their weekends in Nogales standing next to a cactus,” Kimmel quipped. NBC’s Seth Meyers also addressed the Wednesday memorandum and Trump’s desire to militarize the border. “This has been a week of Trump indulging his various obsessions, and one of those obsessions remains our border with Mexico,” Meyers said, referencing the president’s stream of tweets regarding the southern border and Amazon. “He’s been fuming about a caravan of immigrants headed here through Mexico and claiming that the border is essentially a lawless territory.” Meyers then cut to a clip of Trump discussing his plan to deploy troops to the border; the president blames the Obama administration’s “catch and release” policy, in those caught in unlawful immigration status are released while they wait for a hearing with an immigration judge, for what he sees as lax enforcement on the southern border. “That’s right, it’s called catch and release,” Meyers said. “Or as Trump used to call it: marriage.” Meyers went on: “In reality, under Trump, immigration and customs enforcement has massively ramped up the tensions of undocumented immigrants, in many cases tearing apart families and deporting people who have lived here for decades. But this week Trump called for yet another aggressive step: he wants the military to guard the border.” In a speech given on the subject, which Meyers showed clips from, Trump states that “until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be guarding our border with the military”. “Today, the Trump administration announced a plan to send national guard troops to the border,” Meyers continued. “And lately Trump has been obsessed with this idea of militarizing the border, an idea he floated last week when he said the US-Mexico border should be just as fortified as the border between North and South Korea.” The host then showed a video of Trump, in late March, touting the border between North and South Korea and its “wall of soldiers”. “We don’t get paid very much for this, do we?” Trump said. “But our own border, we don’t take care of it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/11/macbeth-jo-nesbo-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T09:03:00Z","webTitle":"Macbeth by Jo Nesbø review – Shakespeare reimagined","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/11/macbeth-jo-nesbo-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/11/macbeth-jo-nesbo-review","fields":{"headline":"Macbeth by Jo Nesbø review – Shakespeare reimagined","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Hogarth Shakespeare project invites modern novelists to reimagine some of his most celebrated plays. After such entries as Howard Jacobson’s take on The Merchant of Venice, Shylock Is My Name, and Dunbar, Edward St Aubyn’s King Lear, we now have a Macbeth by the king of Scandi-noir crime, Jo Nesbø. It turns out to be rather an inspired choice: the bloody tragedy of political ambition translates well to a corrupt police department in a lawless town, where the cops are just one more armed gang. The Scottish play is here transplanted to a geographically agnostic place that mixes terms of Scottish and Scandinavian origin (the area is Fife, the sharpshooter named Olafson), along with allegorical touches: the capital city is known simply as the Capitol. But we spend most of our time in a grim northern town where industry has shut down and it nearly always rains. From one clue we deduce that the story is set in 1970. (It turns out to be helpful to avoid the characters having mobile phones.) Nesbø piles on the forbidding atmosphere, writing of “the soot and poison that lay like a constant lid of mist over the town”, and several chapters open with the equivalent of an establishing shot in cinema, as the prose follows a single raindrop or seagull over the blasted town before happening upon major characters who are about to speak. Macbeth leads a paramilitary Swat unit. He is a man of the people, unnaturally strong, with a thing for daggers: admittedly an unusual detail amid these modern warriors fitted out with assault rifles and sniper scopes. (He is so good at throwing knives, we are told, that he once nearly joined the circus.) Duncan, meanwhile, is the chief commissioner of the police and Malcolm his deputy. The leader of the narcotics unit, perhaps to avoid too many Scottish-sounding prefixes, is here known simply as Duff. The police are at semi-permanent war with a biker gang known as the Norse Riders, who serve as couriers for the top bad guy. This is Hecate: rather than Shakespeare’s queen of the witches, he is the town’s untouchable drug lord, an old man also known as the “Invisible Hand”. (The reference to the political economy of Adam Smith is deliberate.) He manufactures a drug called “brew”: not the alcohol whose effects Shakespeare’s hungover Porter wryly describes, but a crack-like substance to which half the town is addicted. Three of Hecate’s henchwomen play the role of the witches, promising that Macbeth will get the top job if he does nothing to interfere with the drug business. (In a nice touch, these women are also rumoured to use “toads’ glands, bumble bee wings, juice from rat’s tails” when cooking the drug.) It’s not long, then, until the murders start, with Macbeth egged on by his paramour, here known simply as “Lady”: a flame-haired femme fatale who runs a casino. Her scheme for him to murder Duncan is the same as Lady Macbeth’s, stabbing him while he sleeps and blaming it on his bodyguards – arguably a terrible plan in the context of 20th-century forensics. But Macbeth gets away with it, and so wades deeper into the sea of blood that must finally engulf him. There follows much edgy paranoia within the police department and some excellent action sequences involving cars and guns. (A person is shot with “the sound of a thud like hammer on meat”.) Nesbø orchestrates scenes of blackmail and fighting with the slickness of a writer who has sold 36m crime novels. There are odd touches of the supernatural, sometimes with a naturalistic alternative explanation. (The ghost of the murdered Banquo turns up at a dinner, but Macbeth might just be hallucinating because he’s high.) Nesbø finds some clever twists, too, on the source material. It would be invidious to give away what plays the role of Birnam Wood, but the sequence is majestically satisfying. At times the novel strains credulity: no one notices the possible connection between the manner of Duncan’s murder and Macbeth’s fondness for daggers for quite a while, and when the newly promoted Macbeth gives a press conference explaining how his team have just shot dozens of people, the assembled journalists lap it up uncritically. The book’s style, in Don Bartlett’s translation from the Norwegian, is workmanlike, but from the combination of simple materials a thought can arise that seems authentically, blackly bardic: “For eternal loyalty is inhuman and betrayal is human.” This is in the end a deliciously oppressive page-turner that, like The Tragedy of Macbeth itself, seems to harbour something ineradicably evil at its core. The main effect, indeed, of all the differences between this book and a standard modern potboiler is to remind you how weirdly nightmarish the original play is: what Shakespeare brewed up is still almost too over-the-top for modern, ultraviolent mass entertainment. • Macbeth is published by Hogarth.

What happened?” I frantically responded. “There’s going to be a women’s amateur golf tournament at Augusta National next year!” he declared. He wasn’t the only one to share the news with me that day. My Twitter mentions were filled with joyful messages along the lines of: “Finally, women will be able to compete at Augusta!” My Facebook page was no different, and I even had people send me emails and direct messages on Instagram. Goodness, I felt really popular yesterday. As a sports writer who focuses on gender issues in sports, and as a former LPGA golfer, this was welcome news. Augusta National Golf Club, which is 85 years old, did not admit women as members until 2012 (only three have joined since), and has pushed against the notion of hosting a women’s Masters. So a quick glance at the news means that yes, the tradition-steeped Georgia club hosting a women’s amateur event is progress. To break it down, the Augusta National Women’s Amateur Championship will be a 54-hole event, with the first 36 holes played at the nearby Champions Retreat Golf Club, and the final round to be played at Augusta. The field will be made up of the 72 of the best amateur women players in the world, and will take place the week before the Masters. This is a great opportunity for young women golfers, but it’s not without a few immediate problems. The LPGA’s first major of the year, the ANA Inspiration, typically takes place the week before the Masters. The ANA grants six exemptions to the best amateurs, which means these players would likely have to choose between playing in the LPGA’s first major or playing at Augusta. Second, it also means the LPGA will be competing for ratings. Does this mean the ANA will have to change when it stages next year’s tournament? That has yet to be determined. But I’m sure it’s something that will be discussed or considered. And I’ll admit, I want more. I want to see the best professional women’s golfers tee it up at Augusta National. Women’s golf is exceptional, and should Augusta decide to host a professional women’s event, the ratings would prove profitable (LPGA viewership is increasing yearly). But it would also show that Augusta is committed to growing the game, as they so often claim. The talent pool of the LPGA is deep, and continues to improve every year. Just compare the scoring average of the LPGA in 2000 to the 2017 season. In 2000, the leading scoring average was 70.049 by Karrie Webb. In 2017, Lexi Thompson’s scoring average was 69.114, with eleven other players averaging below 70. In addition, the courses the LPGA is playing now are longer and more difficult. Because golf has been made more accessible and open to girls over the years, they’ve also been able to play competitively as long as their male counterparts, and have had the chance to develop and hone their skills at the same level. This has made for better golf on the LPGA, and LPGA players, along with other top professional women golfers in the world, would benefit from Augusta supporting them by hosting a tournament. Would there be an angry mob of stodgy guys upset about breaking “tradition?” Absolutely. Some people already expressed disdain for a women’s amateur event being held the week before because the course wouldn’t be in pristine conditions for the men. (Playing one round at Augusta will not impede on the conditions for the men, so simmer down y’all.) And some felt Augusta, under new leadership, was trying too hard be politically correct. We are in a new era though, one touched by what my mother has dubbed the “Wonder Woman effect”. The consequences of not being more inclusive of women are greater than ticking off a group of people still stuck in the 18th century. Maybe Augusta isn’t ready to make the leap yet. But it’s possible that this women’s amateur event will eventually lead them to hosting a professional women’s tournament. I’m a hopeful person, and to be honest, I never imagined that a women’s event would take place at Augusta National any time soon. With that in mind, I’ll keep my fingers crossed and start working on my swing. I want to be ready, just in case."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/05/rank-shares-three-year-low-profits-warning-casinos-mecca-bingo-sales","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T16:38:44Z","webTitle":"Rank shares tumble 15% to three-year low after profits warning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/05/rank-shares-three-year-low-profits-warning-casinos-mecca-bingo-sales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/05/rank-shares-three-year-low-profits-warning-casinos-mecca-bingo-sales","fields":{"headline":"Rank shares tumble 15% to three-year low after profits warning","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A winning streak among high-stakes gamblers at its casinos and empty seats in its bingo halls have hit profits at the leisure group Rank. Its shares tumbled 15% to a three-year low after the company said annual profits would come in at around £77m rather than the £83m forecast by City analysts. Rank blamed much of the profits fall on the squeeze on consumer spending, with its board expecting tough trading conditions to continue into 2019. Underlying sales in its Mecca bingo halls declined by 2% in the 13 weeks to 1 April as bingo fans stayed home during the recent snows. The situation was worse at its Grosvenor Casino chain, with where sales down 9% as weaker than expected visitor numbers were compounded by the run of good luck among high-rollers. “The board is cautious about the UK consumer outlook and as a result expects venues to continue to be impacted for the remainder of the 2017-18 financial year and into 2018-19,” said Rank. The uncertainty created by the Brexit negotiations, coupled with rising inflation and stagnant real wage growth, has eroded consumer confidence with a string of high street retailers and mid-market restaurants reporting weak sales. The downturn comes at a difficult time for Rank, which last month announced that Henry Birch, the chief executive, was leaving to run the online retailer Shop Direct. To offset the slowdown at its halls and casinos, Rank has expanded its online operation with websites such as meccabingo.com and grosvenorcasinos.com to attract younger people who use mobile apps. This was the one area in which Rank has performed strongly, with digital sales up 17% in the 13-week period. As part of its fightback Rank has also launched a high street bingo chain called Luda, which with a coffee shop and bar, is aimed at a younger audience. It has opened three venues to date, but the results have so far been mixed, the company said. Rank’s shares closed at 180p on Thursday, their lowest since February 2015. The decline of retail gambling has triggered a wave of consolidation in the sector. In February Ladbrokes Coral was bought by GVC, the Isle of Man-based firm behind Foxy Bingo, in a deal worth up to £3.9bn. In 2016 Rank tied up with online gaming firm 888 Holdings to bid for William Hill but the proposal was rejected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/05/former-catalan-police-chief-charged-over-role-in-independence-bid","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T13:15:30Z","webTitle":"Former Catalan police chief charged over role in independence bid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/05/former-catalan-police-chief-charged-over-role-in-independence-bid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/05/former-catalan-police-chief-charged-over-role-in-independence-bid","fields":{"headline":"Former Catalan police chief charged over role in independence bid","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A former head of the Catalan police force who gained widespread praise for his handling of the Barcelona terrorist attacks last August has been charged with belonging to a criminal organisation for his role in the events leading up to Catalonia’s illegal declaration of independence two months later. Josep Lluís Trapero belonged to a “complex and heterogeneous criminal organisation” led by the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, the Spanish national court judge Carmen Lamela said in an indictment on Thursday. Trapero also faces charges for public order offences related to the independence declaration in October. The regional police force, the Mossos d’Esquadra, “shared a common goal of bringing about Catalonia’s secession and the proclamation of a republic, and in this manner changing the political organisation of the state and the government, contrary to the constitution and the statute of autonomy,” Lamela said. Less than a year ago, Trapero and his officers were hailed as heroes for their handling of the terror attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils in which 14 people were killed and more than 130 injured. Within hours, the Mossos had shot dead five of the perpetrators and arrested the others. The charges against Trapero relate to events in September and October last year. In September, the Mossos did nothing to intervene when a large crowd kept members of the Spanish civil guard trapped for hours inside a Catalan government office they had been ordered to search. During the incident, several civil guard vehicles were vandalised. On 1 October, the Mossos were expected to close down polling booths set up in schools for an independence referendum. However, the police only intervened sporadically and, in many cases, only took away ballot boxes if the schools’ occupants gave them up voluntarily. Spanish civil guards and national police officers then attempted to stop the referendum with force. Images of riot police beating voters and taking away ballot boxes were beamed around the world. Trapero quit the force in October after being demoted when the Spanish government imposed direct rule on the region. Two other members of the regional police and an official with the regional interior department were also indicted on Thursday. The charge sheet alleges that “the action plan was known in advance by the people occupying the schools and, knowing the Mossos would not intervene, obstructed police officers who did attempt to carry out the judicial order”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/05/mercedes-bahrain-gp-lewis-hamilton-f1","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T15:00:06Z","webTitle":"Expect Mercedes to step up in Bahrain and give F1 rivals a sterner test | Giles Richards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/05/mercedes-bahrain-gp-lewis-hamilton-f1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/05/mercedes-bahrain-gp-lewis-hamilton-f1","fields":{"headline":"Expect Mercedes to step up in Bahrain and give F1 rivals a sterner test","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In Bahrain this weekend, Mercedes will be confident they have eradicated the problem that cost them an almost certain win at the opening round of the Formula One season in Australia. The debriefs will likely have been uncomfortable, with Lewis Hamilton showing clear frustration after a race he thought was in the bag. But setting aside the number-crunching glitch or Sebastian Vettel making the most of it and the virtual safety car to take the win, there were questions raised at Albert Park to which we may see answers at the Sakhir circuit. Hamilton had led comfortably in Melbourne until he pitted to cover off Kimi Raikkonen’s stop. Vettel stayed out and then, taking advantage of the slower track speed imposed by the VSC and by accelerating between the safety‑car line and the pit-lane entry, came out ahead of the British driver. The Mercedes chief race engineer, Andrew Shovlin, admitted that it had not been race strategy software at fault but an offline tool used to calculate required lap times. “The number that we were calculating was around 15 seconds, and in reality the number was slightly short of 13 seconds,” he said. “That is why we thought we were safe. We thought we had a bit of margin and then you saw the result.” In short, the team needed to have had Hamilton going marginally quicker than he had been before the imposition of the VSC. Mercedes have said they will go about solving the matter in the same way they would were it a mechanical failure and given their efficacy in that department a repeat seems unlikely. Hamilton’s exasperation was understandable but what was intriguing was that he clearly felt he could have bridged the gap required to keep him in front even through a VSC stop. That Mercedes were quick was clear. Hamilton was never under threat from Raikkonen in second, but they chose not to push that pace in Melbourne. They were, it seems, trying to do just enough – as dictated by their misleading figures – to keep the lead. That is ominous on several levels. For their rivals it raises the question of just how much further down the track Mercedes could have been if they had really let Hamilton go. The intimation from both the team and driver was that they had much more in hand. Shovlin said: “In future we are going to make sure we have more margin because we want to be able to cover for Vettel doing an amazingly good in-lap to the pits, or having an incredibly fast stop.” They may well have more than what was on show in Melbourne then. The team explained this week how the power deployment works at different phases of the weekend and the race. It had become a talking point after Hamilton called their qualifying specification “party mode”. The team went on to describe how they will switch modes during the race according to the scenario. The one in Australia, an unthreatened lead, strongly suggests they had felt no need to turn the wick up. We may see them do that in Bahrain and hence that race could be a better indicator of how close Ferrari and indeed Red Bull might be. Equally, however, once Hamilton had lost the lead he hared off after Vettel and closed him down but could not pass, at which point he backed off to save his engine. It was a decision he was not happy about, saying it “goes against my spirit of racing”. The teams are limited to three engines this year before incurring grid penalties, a cost-cutting measure that has failed in its intent. Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo started in eighth after a grid penalty but had made his way to fourth and caught Raikkonen whom he pushed hard, before the Australian opted to settle for fourth place. The difficulty in passing at Albert Park will have been a key factor in this and so Sakhir this weekend, where passing is possible, could demonstrate how much more backing off we might see this season. If the leading protagonists again choose to settle for the final third of the race rather than to attack, it does not bode well. If however that is the case there is a further corollary, which is that qualifying is going to become even more crucial. Passing in these cars proved to be tricky last year and does not appear to be any easier now. If this is combined at the sharp end with increased concerns over engine longevity, the first half of the season may prove to be one of cagey, tactical conservatism rather than all-out racing. Hopefully Bahrain will be decided by something more dramatic than a mere numbers game and prove that drivers will genuinely feel able to push to the flag in 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/05/stop-brexit-eu-withdrawal-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T12:49:58Z","webTitle":"I’ve negotiated with the EU – and I know we can still stop Brexit | Steve Bullock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/05/stop-brexit-eu-withdrawal-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/05/stop-brexit-eu-withdrawal-bill","fields":{"headline":"I’ve negotiated with the EU – and I know we can still stop Brexit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Should remainers now “get behind” Brexit and turn their energies to shaping a close UK-EU relationship or to rejoining the EU post-Brexit? That is what some respected Brexit commentators have started to accept. The essence of their point is that all the legal routes to stopping Brexit are now politically too unlikely and that, since the mandate from the referendum was only to leave the EU, all that happens afterwards is up for grabs. But for remainers to give up on the campaign to stop Brexit would be wrong on principle, and practically ineffective. A key lesson from my time as a negotiator for the UK in the EU is that it is essential to be calm, at full strength, and there up until the very last moment of the process. The final stages are when events happen at an artificially accelerated rate, and realities can change in an instant. Slinking out early, or switching focus to the next issue, opens you up to missing a game-changing opportunity. While time may be tight, a week is now an eternity in British politics. On principle, we should oppose what we know to be harmful. We know that Brexit will harm our families, friends, neighbours, fellow citizens, and the country and its standing in the world. To acquiesce quietly to this would be wrong while there is some chance of success. The odds are against stopping Brexit. They always have been, but it can still happen. The main obstacles are political, not legal. For example, were the Labour party leadership to significantly alter its position, the odds could shift considerably in favour of remaining. It is true that, without a request, and EU27 agreement to an extension of the two years allowed by article 50, or a revocation of the notice given under it, the UK will leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Time is tight, but it was always going to be, and there are good reasons to believe that the EU27 would grant an extension for democratic processes in the UK to play out. Successive statements by EU leaders have made it clear that, for the EU27, the UK abandoning Brexit is still a preferred option. There was a mandate from parliament for the government to invoke article 50, and negotiate terms, but this does not mean that whatever those terms are must be accepted. By the time the withdrawal agreement and a declaration on the shape of a future relationship is finalised (if indeed they are finalised in time, which is far from certain) it will be well over two years since the referendum. Their contents were not and could not have been known at the time. If Brexit goes ahead, we would then face negotiations on agreements on a future relationship during a transition period, but with no option to remain, and only the option of a disastrous no-deal cliff edge if those results were unsatisfactory. At that point, four and a half years after the referendum, whatever is on the table would have to be accepted. As a vote, either in parliament, or if it wishes through a referendum, requires an alternative other than certain disaster to deserve the term “meaningful”, the withdrawal agreement represents the last opportunity. Should parliament reject it, either itself or through a referendum, it would have every right to require the government to withdraw article 50 notification. The existing mandate is weakened by allegations that the small majority in the referendum was gained on the basis of deliberate untruths and potentially serious wrongdoing. Had there been an open, frank and (largely) honest debate, based on truthful, transparent campaigns from both sides, and resulting in a large, decisive majority, it may not be so weak. That a general election was called with the express purpose of strengthening the government’s mandate, and resulted in its majority being eliminated weakens its mandate yet further. It is therefore reasonable to consider the government’s mandate to be limited to the invoking of article 50 and the negotiation of a withdrawal agreement, and not to require the automatic acceptance of any outcome that is presented. It is up to parliament to either issue, or seek a public vote to issue, a mandate to accept the outcome or seek to remain a member of the EU. In practical terms, there is little point in “getting behind” Brexit and focusing instead on the post-Brexit world. Remainers’, or indeed anybody’s, ability to influence the government’s approach has been negligible. Business leaders, senior civil servants, devolved governments, renowned economists, soft leavers, noted experts, and even some more moderate cabinet members have been systematically ignored. The government has not listened, and there is no evidence that it would begin to, if we accepted Brexit. It is far more likely that it would simply pocket our move, use it to claim support for its misguided approach, and continue as before. The same goes for the official opposition. Giving up opposing Brexit would be seen as an endorsement of its woefully ineffective triangulating approach. It would lessen, not increase, the pressure within Labour to genuinely oppose Brexit. Our future options would also be very limited. The government has expressly ruled out the closest possible relationship available. Rejoining is a purely long-term prospect. After the hassle, uncertainty and cost that Brexit has caused, it would be impossible for EU27 leaders to sell an early UK re-entry to their own electorates, even in the unlikely event that they wanted to. Most in Brussels put the earliest point for rejoining at least a decade from now, and many say longer. Brexit really does mean Brexit. The government and much of the media have already pre-trailed the myth that Brexit would have been a roaring success had it not been for those pesky foreigners, judges, civil servants, businesses, economists, remainers. If this is allowed to stand, it is easy to imagine the UK a few years down the line, dealing with the damage caused by Brexit to its society, economy, political culture and constitution, in which all its ills are blamed on the myth of stab in the back by the EU. In that case, even simple agreements on cooperation may be impossible, and every dispute would be blown up into a terminal crisis. This would be appalling for the UK, the EU and the world as a whole. Seven or eight months ago, those like me calling for a referendum on the deal and arguing that Brexit could be stopped were dismissed by many as cranks and fantasists. Now we have MPs from all major parties arguing for one or both, and both being discussed as real possibilities, even by the overly cautious BBC. So remain campaigners are having an effect. It may not be enough, and the odds are always stacked against us. Even if you disagree with the principled objections to giving up, there’s no payoff, no practical benefit from doing so, and you can bet your shirt that it would be used against us. • Steve Bullock, a former negotiator for the UK in the EU, is a campaigner, commentator and writer on Brexit This article was amended on 6 April 2018 to remove a misplaced link"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/09/did-you-solve-it-the-hipster-bicycle-race","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T16:00:02Z","webTitle":"Did you solve it?

The hipster bicycle race","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On my puzzle blog earlier today I set the following questions: 1) Two hipsters, Atticus and Abe, were arguing about whose electronic bicycle was the slowest. They decided to race them along a 100m track. They agreed that the bike reaching the finish line last would be the winner. The guys got on their bikes on the start line. But, predictably, they just stood there, since no one wanted to start first and risk being the first to finish. They had been immobile for hours when their pal Daisy showed up. She asked if anything was the matter, so they put down their bikes and walked over to her to explain. She said a few words, at which point they ran back, jumped on the bikes and sped to the finish line as fast as possible. What was her advice? Solution: She told them to ride the other person’s bike. 2) Why would a Parisian hairdresser prefer to give a haircut to two Belgians rather than one Briton? Solution: Because a hairdresser would get twice as much giving two haircuts than just one. The nationalities is a red herring. 3) Three sisters receive the following gift: 7 crates of wine, 7 half-empty crates of wine and 7 empty crates. How do they divide the gift in such a way that each sister gets the same amount of wine and the same number of crates, without transferring wine from any crate to any other crate? Solution: Give two sisters 3 full crates, one half-empty crate and three empty crates, and give the other sister one full crate, 5 half-empty crates and one empty crate. In this way each sister gets 7 crates, and 3.5 crates-worth of wine. To work this out first sum all the crates and the wine: you get 21 crates and 10.5 crates-worth of wine in total. So each sister must get 7 crates and 3.5 crates worth. There are only a limited amount of ways to add up to 3.5 crates-worth of wine using 7 crates - try them out and eventually you will get the answer. 4) Which English word is pronounced the same when four of its five letters are removed? Solution: Queue. Or aitch. 5) What stays the same however many letters you take from it? Solution: A post box. The extra question taken from Football School: The Amazing Quiz Book was Who is the only footballer to have played in a World Cup final and acted in a movie that was nominated for an Oscar for the best film?

A mere 17 years and nine months after their debut album We Didn’t Say That! thundered into the charts at No 140, Daphne &amp; Celeste are releasing the followup. You remember Daphne &amp; Celeste. They crashed the UK Top 20 with two classics of tartrazine-addled trash-pop, 1999’s Ooh Stick You and U.G.L.Y in 2000, registered another hit with a cover of Alice Cooper’s School’s Out, and then more or less vanished, save for an appearance at the Reading festival that was, depending on your perspective, either iconic or calamitous, as the pair were pelted with bottles of urine by fans of “proper” bands such as A and Blink-182. Someone even threw a wheelchair at them. The hiatus between their debut album and newie Daphne &amp; Celeste Save the World is more than three times the length of the wait for the Stone Roses’ Second Coming (“Is that a world record?” Celeste asks. “We really ought to have someone find out”) as the pair returned to acting on, and writing for, TV and stage. Eagle-eyed viewers will have been able to spot Celeste in an episode of 30 Rock, for example, playing the love interest in a telenovela that stars a South American Jack Donaghy doppelganger. In 2015, they suddenly re-emerged with the single You and I Alone, their first collaboration with UK electronica artist Max Tundra, whose remix credits include Mogwai, Pet Shop Boys, the Strokes, Futureheads and Mint Royale and who wrote … Save the World. A reasonably straightforward electro-funk love song, You and I Alone gives absolutely no indication as to the berserk oddness of their new album, which veers from the pummelling dirty beats of second single BB, their broadside against homogenous boys-with-guitars, which may be the only pop single to work the word “heteronormative” into its lyrics, to the jarringly baroque Song to a Succulent. Throwaway bubblegum, this isn’t. I talk briefly to Celeste after she has returned to the US with a stinking post-tour cold. She is effusive about the gigs, which were attended by both old fans (literally old, in many cases), and curious newcomers; indeed, one person I know who saw them in Brighton was seven months old when Ooh Stick You came out. Buoyed by the sheer unlikeliness of their return, the duo’s concerts are suitably celebratory and loopy affairs involving bubble machines and onstage construction of balloon animals. “The reaction is a bit of a mystery,” says Celeste, “but it’s why we wanted to do it. We knew we kept some fans, so we figured if we could just give everyone a break for the night, it would be good. But it’s fair to say it worked out better than we thought it would, or even dreamed it would. Give us an hour and we’ll make it weird, I guess. And balloon animals make people happy.” I am warned off asking about Reading, which seems fair enough, since nobody wants their defining moment to be a urinary bombardment (although by all accounts, Daphne – real name, Karen DiConcetto – sees it as a career high watermark). But Celeste warms to the idea that the UK, generally, “gets” D&amp;C’s eccentricities in a way that their home country does not, and is particularly pleased when I compare Song to a Succulent to Kate Bush. “I can take that,” she says. The new record has won them praise from the likes of indie pop veteran Helen Love (“The most punk rock record of the year”) and Franz Ferdinand’s Alex Kapranos (“It’s ace”). So now that they are definitely back, where next for Daphne &amp; Celeste? “I don’t know,” she says. “Come back in 18 years and ask me.” Daphne &amp; Celeste Save The World is out now on Balatonic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/13/the-time-travellers-guide-to-restoration-britain-by-ian-mortimer-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T15:00:01Z","webTitle":"The Time Traveller’s Guide to Restoration Britain by Ian Mortimer review – wonderfully entertaining","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/13/the-time-travellers-guide-to-restoration-britain-by-ian-mortimer-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/13/the-time-travellers-guide-to-restoration-britain-by-ian-mortimer-review","fields":{"headline":"The Time Traveller’s Guide to Restoration Britain by Ian Mortimer review – wonderfully entertaining","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In this and previous guides, historian Ian Mortimer’s delightful conceit is that the reader is a time traveller in need of advice about a particular period, from where to stay and what to eat, to tips about entertainment and how to stay healthy. The four “tumultuous” decades from 1660 to 1700 saw the end of “the most religious decade Britain has seen since the Middle Ages” and the restoration of the monarchy. With it came “a unifying spirit of licentiousness” and the dawn of the age of individualism and rationality, as the values of science and the Enlightenment took hold. But it’s in the details of daily life that Mortimer’s book excels. This wonderfully human history captures the experiences of Restoration Britain, including insults (“you white-livered son of a Fleet Street bumsitter”), street food (pies are fine “if you don’t mind the gristle inside the pastry and the flies on the outside”), personal hygiene (“Pepys does not immerse himself in water for the whole 10‑year period of his diary”), and how to post a letter (envelopes had not yet been invented but a letter to France will cost you one shilling).

The Champions League quarter‑finals may be only at half-time but in the Championship there is a match that is about more than a trophy because it has the potential to change the lives of the players, backroom staff, the kitman and even the tea lady. Cardiff v Wolves on Friday night is a huge game, where the victor is all but guaranteed a place at the top table in English football. It reminds me of a year ago when we achieved promotion at Brighton and the whole city as well as millions worldwide via social media shared in the celebrations with immense pride and joy. What very few saw was the effect going up had on Dee, working in our players’ canteen, who every day would do everything to make our lives easier and better. Like every employee at the club, Dee got a promotion bonus, which allowed her to take the kind of holiday with her family she had always dreamed of, and that’s an example of the small but no less important detail of how football positively affects lives. Yes, the European games this week were huge and so are the derbies on Merseyside and in Manchester this weekend but for the biggest game in terms of outcome, it is the top-of-the-table clash in Wales which I expect will be the most nervy, passionate and intense. Both Nuno Espírito Santo and Neil Warnock have performed brilliantly throughout this season, although they have done it in different ways: Wolves’ success has been built on a platform of beautiful attacking football facilitated by a large transfer budget spent very wisely, whereas Cardiff’s has been based on the resilience, toughness and character that Warnock seems to have a gift in creating at most clubs he has been at in his long managerial career. The contrast in the style of football of the two clubs exemplifies what a wonderfully and unpredictable league it is – no doubt the most competitive and well-supported second-tier division in world football. No matter how it is achieved, I can’t make the point strongly enough that navigating your way through a gruelling Championship season successfully is impossible without organisation, camaraderie, mental strength, physical fortitude and no little skill, regardless of how much money has been spent in the process of getting there. Now that Wolves and Cardiff are at a point where they can see the light at the end of the tunnel, this is where the points seem even more difficult to gain and goals that much harder to create, and games appear to go on for 90 days rather than 90 minutes. It’s the point where the true test of character comes, with players running around the football pitch knowing that one mistake can adversely affect the outcome of not just their own professional careers but the futures of many of the staff who play a huge and unheralded role behind the scenes, let alone the dreams of supporters itching to watch their clubs play at Old Trafford or Anfield and if not that then catching up on the highlights on Match of the Day – a show that as kids we all dreamt of appearing on. I have been fortunate enough to feel those nerves and excitement in the buildup to this kind of game. The sick feeling in your stomach due to the combination of adrenaline and nerves flowing through your body, the good-luck messages from close friends and family who know how big an ambition it has been for you throughout your whole life to be seen as a Premier League player, as well as the understanding that promotion to the Premier League could be life-changing financially on a personal level, enabling you to plan a life for your children that you never thought possible. These will be the things going through a lot of those players’ heads on Friday night and, while the quality on show may not be on the same level as in the Champions League or this weekend’s top Premier League games, the nerves, excitement, passion and intensity will at least be on a par with them. The job that both managers have done to get their teams to this position has been nothing short of superb but a huge amount of recognition must go to Warnock, a man who always seems to bring out the most positive or negative reactions in people, yet throughout the last decade, especially, has consistently produced teams that far outweigh the sum of their parts. Throughout this year he has cleverly taken the pressure away from his players, with quotes such as “just happy to be here” and “we’re not expected to be in the top two” but even he deep down will know he can only deflect the pressure for so long and that the sick, nervy sensation every human naturally feels at that moment on the verge of accomplishing an amazing feat is now upon his players. I can’t wait to see how both his side and Wolves fare in the run-in. When it comes to drama, excitement and consequences, the Championship can compete with most competitions in the game and I expect that to be borne out over the next few weeks – just ask Dee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/05/jose-antonio-abreu-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T13:54:09Z","webTitle":"José Antonio Abreu obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/05/jose-antonio-abreu-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/05/jose-antonio-abreu-obituary","fields":{"headline":"José Antonio Abreu obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Venezuelan music educator José Antonio Abreu, who has died aged 78, was the founder of the programme known as El Sistema (The System) that changed the lives of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of his fellow citizens, but that latterly attracted accusations of corruption and mismanagement. El Sistema came into being in 1975 in a Caracas car park, where Abreu held his first rehearsal with 11 young Venezuelan musicians. The educational programme he developed was based on a national system of local music centres – and within a decade there were hundreds of them. Abreu’s system differed from traditional methods in being aimed primarily at developing collaborative skills among musicians: from the start they were encouraged to play together and soon perform in one of the many orchestras that mushroomed in Venezuela. Tuition was rigorous, with 24 hours’ ensemble instruction per week the norm; total commitment to the project was demanded. Abreu himself, known as El Maestro or simply JAA, was a man of monastic habits, spurning leisure or holidays in pursuit of his goal: to bring music to as many children as possible. His methods were sometimes criticised as hierarchical, even tyrannical, involving repetitive rather than creative procedures, but they undoubtedly produced several generations of accomplished musicians in Venezuela. He was also a shrewd operator, securing the backing of one government after another, irrespective of its political colour. Well before Hugo Chávez came to power in 1999, Abreu effected a fundamental shift in policy. No longer was El Sistema purely about nurturing orchestral musicians; it now became an instrument of social melioration. Offering a way out of destitution and deprivation, the programme spread into the barrios – slums ruled by gang violence and drug dealing. Then, in the early years of the new century, El Sistema burst unexpectedly on to the international scene, with an exceptionally talented alumnus, Gustavo Dudamel, appointed artistic director of the Simón Bolívar Youth (now Symphony) Orchestra in 1999, now in charge. Under the charismatic Dudamel, the orchestra made its BBC Proms debut in 2007 to enthusiastic acclaim. Dressed in jackets the bright colours of the Venezuelan flag, which they hurled into the delirious crowd at the conclusion, the youngsters exuded the joy of music-making. They made several further appearances in future years, also with artists of the stature of Daniel Barenboim and Simon Rattle. So successful was El Sistema in transforming the lives of disadvantaged young Venezuelans that similar projects were initiated elsewhere. In England the cellist Julian Lloyd Webber founded the In Harmony programme which, with Arts Council England support, has delivered educational projects to Lambeth, Liverpool and elsewhere. Sistema England, a charity chaired by Lloyd Webber, supports similar projects across the country. Richard Holloway’s Big Noise project, aiming to develop “confidence, discipline, teamwork, pride and aspiration” in its participants drawn from some of the most deprived communities in Scotland, currently runs projects for some 2,000 children in Raploch (Stirling), Govanhill (Glasgow) and Torry (Aberdeen) under the aegis of Sistema Scotland. El Sistema has also cooperated in exchange programmes with Canada, Spain, the US and other Latin American countries. Born in the small Andean city of Valera, José Antonio was the eldest of six children of musical parents, Melpómene Abreu and his wife, Ailie Anselmi. From 1957, he studied in Caracas as a pianist, harpsichordist, organist, conductor and composer, and then graduated in economics from the Andrés Bello Catholic University, teaching economics there and at Simón Bolívar University during the 1960s and 70s. In 1963 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the Congress of Venezuela. He returned to politics in 1988 as minister of culture and president of the National Council of Culture, posts he held until 1993 and 1994 respectively. In 1993, El Sistema was awarded the IMC–Unesco International Music prize in the institution category, while Abreu’s many personal awards included the Polar music prize given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Music in 2009 and the Erasmus prize in 2010. In recent years there has been stringent criticism of Abreu and El Sistema, as well as of Dudamel and others, for failing to denounce the administration of Chávez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro, which has continued to support the project. More than 800,000 individuals are currently enrolled in El Sistema, according to official figures. Geoff Baker’s book El Sistema: Orchestrating Venezuela’s Youth (2014) detailed allegations of financial irregularities and sexual abuse by teachers, as well as nepotism and corruption by Abreu and his colleagues. Baker also argued that the project had chiefly benefited musicians from the middle levels of society rather than those from the most deprived families. The latter charge has yet to be proved or refuted definitively, but the testimony of countless individuals, both students and their parents, who believe that El Sistema has offered them a way out of abject poverty, is not easily discounted. Nor can it be denied that the ideals of the project – however tarnished the latter may have been by disreputable conduct – have inspired emulation across the world. Abreu is survived by a brother, Jesús. • José Antonio Abreu Anselmi, music educator and director of youth orchestras, born 7 May 1939; died 24 March 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/apr/11/milk-and-more-delivery-problems-website","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Milk – yet more complaints about deliveries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/11/milk-and-more-delivery-problems-website","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/apr/11/milk-and-more-delivery-problems-website","fields":{"headline":"Milk – yet more complaints about deliveries","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Following the comments regarding the poor service from Milk &amp; More last week, I just wanted to add that I opted out of the company’s internet service and returned to direct communication with our milkman.

But in Germany, criminals have allegedly found ways in which it can make you a millionaire. A 27-year-old man faced court on Thursday in Bochum on two fraud charges, after allegedly making €1.2m (£1.1m) through illegally manipulating machines used for the German deposit return scheme for bottles and cans. He is accused of defrauding drinks manufacturers by disabling the shredding mechanism on two machines, allowing him to claim back deposits for the same bottles over and over again. With each plastic bottle usually earning a 25-cent return, the accused man would have had to “recycle” his set of bottles 4.8m times. His lawyer claimed his client was a “straw man” who had taken over a retail outfit as a favour to a distant relative, unaware of the manipulated machines having been put in place. Under the deposit return scheme, which has been in place in Germany since 2003 and is due to be introduced in England this year, customers pay an additional deposit or pfand as part of the price of a bottle or can, which they can reclaim when returning the drinks container to a vendor. The return usually takes place via sophisticated “reverse vending machines” that scan in the bottles and hand out a voucher customers can cash in at the counter. Reusable bottles are stored and sent back to the manufacturer, while non-reusable “one-way” bottles, usually made out of polyethylene terephthalate, are shredded inside the mechanism. Since retailers are obliged to pay back deposits even for non-reusable bottles they do not sell, a clearing system is meant to compensate shops for any potential losses. Prosecutors in Germany believe criminal gangs are trying to exploit this system by claiming back deposits for bottles they did not receive in the first place. The organisation responsible for deposit clearing said it had been aware of fraud attempts since 2016, but had struggled to detect individual instances of criminal activity due to the vast daily data streams involved."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/05/wildlife-on-your-doorstep-share-your-april-photos","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T10:30:45Z","webTitle":"Wildlife on your doorstep: share your April photos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/05/wildlife-on-your-doorstep-share-your-april-photos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/05/wildlife-on-your-doorstep-share-your-april-photos","fields":{"headline":"Wildlife on your doorstep: share your April photos","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"What sort of wildlife will we all discover on our doorsteps this month?

Falciani, an IT specialist, fled from Switzerland to France in 2008 with a list of 130,000 names of organisations and individuals who were using the Swiss banking system to launder money and evade taxes. The leak was dubbed the biggest in banking history. The Swiss first issued an international warrant for Falciani’s arrest in 2009. The French, however, instead of extraditing him and returning the stolen data, used his list to prosecute tax evaders. Falciani later fled to Spain and, in 2013, Spain’s national court rejected a Swiss extradition request on the grounds that the charge of violating bank secrecy was not an offence in Spain if the secrecy was used as a cover for serious offences. The Swiss justice ministry said it had submitted a formal request for Falciani’s extradition on Thursday. The Spanish national court judge Diego de Egea freed Falciani while he considers the case for extradition. He has had his passport retained, must report to the police once a week and is not allowed to leave Spain. Falciani’s case is now before the same Spanish court that acquitted him on the same charges nearly five years ago. It remains to be seen what new argument will be presented that might reverse the earlier decision. Since 2013, Falciani has lived mostly in Spain under a high-security programme sponsored by the United Nations. In November 2015, a Swiss court sentenced Falciani in absentia to five years imprisonment for financial espionage and data theft. They now want to extradite him to serve his sentence. For its part, Spain is keen to extradite two Catalan fugitives from Switzerland. Marta Rovira, the secretary general of the Republican Left party, and Anna Gabriel, a prominent member of the radical Popular Unity Candidacy, are currently taking refuge in Geneva. Until now, Swiss authorities have been reluctant to comply. The arrest of Falciani is widely seen in Spain as a favour to the Swiss, in the hope that it will be returned in kind. The arrest order for Falciani was issued on 19 March, four days before Rovira fled to Switzerland, but several weeks after Gabriel sought refuge there. Falciani was arrested on Wednesday as he was about to give a talk at a Madrid university entitled: When telling the truth is heroic. To many people Falciani is a hero, a Robin Hood figure who didn’t seek to benefit from the information he had, which he freely shared with the authorities in France, Spain and other countries. Ada Colau, Barcelona’s mayor, described Falciani’s arrest and possible extradition as a scandal. “He is a key figure in the fight against corruption who worked with the Spanish authorities to prosecute tax fraud,” she said. “He also advised Barcelona city council on how to improve transparency.” Spanish tax authorities recovered some €300m (£262m) in unpaid tax from some of the 637 Spaniards who appeared on Falciani’s list."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/apr/10/smart-meter-solar-power-income-fault","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T06:00:21Z","webTitle":"Our Green Star energy meter is anything but smart","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/10/smart-meter-solar-power-income-fault","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/apr/10/smart-meter-solar-power-income-fault","fields":{"headline":"Our Green Star energy meter is anything but smart","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"We have a problem with our energy supplier, Green Star. In February it offered us the free installation of a smart meter, and it seemed like a good idea to go ahead. A young man changed both the electricity and gas meters. He was only here for a very short time, even though he initially expressed concern that it would be impossible to fit a new gas meter because of the lead piping attached to the old one. A week later, on a sunny day, I noticed that our wireless “Sunny Boy” meter was recording no energy generated by our eight solar panels. Further investigation revealed that the inverter, that processes the energy produced, had stopped working due to a “voltage error”. It happened at the exact time that the smart meter installation was going on, so I feel it is safe to assume that the two incidents are connected. Since then, I have been trying to get Green Star to come and rectify the problem. I keep getting told that the matter will be addressed in the next seven days but nothing happens. We are losing out on the income that the panels should be producing. NB, Leicester Green Star Energy – one of the challenger suppliers – told us that of the many smart meters the installation company has fitted, this is the first time it has seen such an issue. It confirmed that the inverter cut out as a safety feature. It has now sent a team member to visit your home to reset the safety device. This did not work, so it has arranged for an engineer to attend. It has also apologised for failing to respond quickly enough and said that it will make up any income lost as a result, although given that the sun has barely appeared in the last few months, that won’t be a huge amount. On a wider issue, I would strongly advise readers to be cautious of having a smart meter installed, unless you get a written guarantee that it will be a second generation, Smets2 version. It emerged in February that only 80 of these improved meters that allow easy switching, and better remote reading, had so far been installed in the UK. Over 9m of the Smets1 meters are in UK homes, but users have found that after they switched supplier, they lost the meter’s smart functions. The meter then had to be read manually. The whole thing is a giant, expensive mess. Last month, the National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, opened an investigation into the smart meter programme, which has cost £11bn so far — scandalously paid for by all of us through higher electricity bills.

Sugar-sweetened soft drinks are the main source of the sugar that children consume. While the levy on high-sugar drinks is a response to the obesity crisis – 20% of children in the last year of primary school in England are now obese – there is huge concern about children’s teeth as well. Every day, 141 children have teeth extracted in hospital and some are as young as one year old. It is the most common reason for children aged 5 to 9 to be admitted to hospital, causing 60,000 missed days of school each year. Children with decayed teeth suffer pain and problems with eating and sleeping, says PHE. The cost to the NHS is £3.4bn a year. The sugar levy on the manufacturers of soft drinks will hike the price of a litre of high sugar drink (8g of sugar per 100ml) by 24p. Drinks with 5g per 100ml will go up by 18p a litre – if the manufacturers pass the tax to shoppers. Some companies have replaced sugar with artificial sweeteners and have avoided the tax. Others, like Coca-Cola, have chosen to stick with the recipe for their original brand which will rise in price, while pointing out they offer a zero-sugar version too. But the tax will solve neither obesity nor tooth decay and PHE is urging parents to change their children’s eating and drinking habits. “It’s upsetting to see so many children admitted to hospital with tooth decay, but swapping out sugary drinks could be an easy win for busy families,” said Dr Sandra White, dental lead for Public Health England. “Parents can also help prevent decay by making sure their children’s teeth are brushed twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and reducing the amount of sugar they’re eating and drinking.” The budget for public health sits with the local authorities. “These shocking figures strengthen the need for urgent investment in oral health education so that parents and children understand the impact of sugar on teeth and the importance of good oral hygiene,” said Izzi Seccombe, chairman of the Local Government Association’s Community Wellbeing Board. “Untreated dental care remains one of the most prevalent and preventable diseases affecting children and young people’s ability to speak, eat, play and socialise.” PHE suggests families should look at the advice on the Change4Life website on swapping to low fat milky drinks, water and low sugar drinks. Fruit juice and smoothies should be limited to 150ml a day. They may appear healthy but contain large amounts of natural sugars. Children should brush their teeth twice a day, including before bedtime, using fluoride toothpaste, says PHE. The introduction of the sugar tax has been applauded by health campaigners. Caroline Cerny, Obesity Health Alliance lead, said it was great news that the levy was in force and that many manufacturers had reduced the sugar levels in their drinks. “We’re all eating more sugar than is recommended and sugary soft drinks contribute to this – particularly in teens where sugary drinks are their top source of sugar. They provide empty calories and contribute not only to rising levels of obesity but also to poor dental health,” she said. Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs said: “Obesity can have a devastating impact on our patients’ long-term health and wellbeing, but we are particularly concerned about the increasing rates of obesity in children and young people – this is setting them up for a life plagued with serious health conditions, including increased risks of a range of cancers as well as diabetes and heart disease.” She added that they were working to help GPs have the “incredibly sensitive conversations” with parents about tackling their children’s weight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/05/generational-war-womens-institute-vulva-quilts","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T14:24:14Z","webTitle":"Keep calm, there’s no generational war at the Women’s Institute  | Caroline Brooks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/05/generational-war-womens-institute-vulva-quilts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/05/generational-war-womens-institute-vulva-quilts","fields":{"headline":"Keep calm, there’s no generational war at the Women’s Institute","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Women’s Institute that I help run has received a sudden amount of media interest this week. The first inkling was a message to the Shoreditch Sisters WI Facebook page from a press agency, asking about a blog written by another WI member in Hastings. The writer had recently attended an event at the Royal Albert Hall celebrating 100 years of women’s suffrage, at which our treasurer, Lottie Gough, had spoken about the future of the institute. Writing pseudonymously as “Hastings Battleaxe” she accused us of considering her generation dinosaurs. Voila, the press had “a war within the WI”. At our usual weekly committee meeting, the agenda, which included booking speakers to teach us how to make pickles, was put to one side. That day articles had appeared in the Daily Mail, The Times and The Telegraph, for which neither our branch nor the woman from Hastings had commented. We were saddened that the coverage was for such a negative reason. We love the WI, and as volunteers we wouldn’t continue committing our time if we didn’t. It has been a place to make friends, especially important for potentially isolated young women who have moved to a city for work or study. We hope to offer a place for all types of women to be themselves, young and old and from any background. Age, political views, religion, work or marital status doesn’t matter. We extend that friendship to all members of all WIs, including those in Hastings. We certainly don’t, as the blog accuses, consider anyone an old bat. She wrote that we are “held up to the rest of us presumably uncool un-regenerated ‘unwoke’ old bats [and] battleaxes as the role-model future of the movement” She goes on to say that if you look. at what we do it is no different from the activities of any other WI group. In this she is correct. We bake cakes, have a monthly knitting night and have just as much fun socialising and making friends as every other WI in the country – except we’ve done it with more press coverage. When we began, in 2007, our founding president was Jazz Domino Holly, now an author of craft books. She is also the daughter of the Clash frontman Joe Strummer, and so we were dubbed the coolest WI in the country. Stories about us as a younger WI appeared, contradicting the stereotype of elderly village ladies. We decided to put the attention to good use by campaigning with a project designed to attract press attention to the practice of female genital mutilation affecting women in the UK. We made a quilt of individually stitched vulvas, including those made by members in other branches. This was eye-catching enough to interest the local, then national press. A few years later, we started campaigning about refugee detention at Yarlswood with Women For Refugee Women, and are currently working on a new campaign about period poverty. The Jam and Jerusalem media image of the Women’s Institute has always been a little off, and the Shoreditch Sisters WI are no different from the organisation as a whole. Our campaigning is exactly what the WI has always done. The women who came before us passed some radical mandates for campaigning. In the 1940s, there was a mandate to demand equal pay for women. In 1960 we were discussing the impact of pesticides, in 1971 it was plastic packaging. A later resolution in 2005 saw WI members return excess packaging to supermarkets to encourage retailers to reduce waste. In 1975 we were discussing refuges for survivors of domestic violence and their children, asking for sufficient provision in every county. In 1986 we asked for the government to inform the general public of the true facts concerning Aids. The Terrence Higgins Trust has said the WI “does not flinch from the more difficult issues that face society”. After the media attention this week, we have received messages of support from WI members all over the country, with some saying our branch inspired them to start their own WI. Many new branches have opened in the last ten years, such as The Dalston Darlings, Buns and Roses and the Gnosall Jambusters and they all accept members of all ages. All WIs are different. With more than 6,300 branches totalling more than 220,000 members, each one is semi-autonomous, deciding its own programme of events. As far as we are concerned, there is no divide within the WI. We’d love the Hastings blogger to come to one of our meetings and meet us. She wrote that the “life experience and knowledge of the older members” needs to be combined with the “enthusiasm and energy of the new”. We couldn’t agree more. • Caroline Brooks is president of the Shoreditch Sisters Women’s Institute"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"media/2018/apr/05/john-dekker-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T12:36:38Z","webTitle":"John Dekker obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/05/john-dekker-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/apr/05/john-dekker-obituary","fields":{"headline":"John Dekker obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My father, John Dekker, who has died aged 91, was a BBC current affairs editor credited with jump-starting the careers of numerous television journalists. He produced current affairs programmes including Tonight, 24 Hours and The Money Programme, and said he was “very grateful to the host of people who were there in my time and supported me, often in ways I never knew and certainly didn’t deserve”. In turn, he encouraged and mentored younger colleagues, giving so many of today’s producers and editors their first contracts at the BBC that he became an unofficial “open door” for journalism training. He would hire someone on a one-week contract then “stretch it out” if they showed talent. He also persuaded secretaries and technicians to become temporary researchers, which gave them a route into production posts. John was born in Paddington, London, to Margaret (nee McKay) and Anthony Pini. Anthony later became principal cellist at the Royal Opera House. John’s parents divorced when he was young and John was estranged from his father for many years. In his 20s he changed his name after the 16th-century playwright Thomas Dekker. John’s mother, who took various office jobs, could not settle in one place, so he and his older sister, Julie, never spent more than a year at any school, and John left secondary education at 14 with no qualifications. He worked in Kew Gardens before joining the navy at 17. Commissioned at 18, he served on the destroyers Quantock, in the Adriatic and North Sea, and the Trafalgar in the Pacific. There followed jobs in a coal mine, a sweet factory and a hospital, and as a clerk for British Railways. He won a trade union scholarship to Ruskin College, Oxford, where he studied history and organised a student protest against the Suez crisis . He went on to do a degree in politics and modern history at Manchester University, becoming president of the student union, campaigning for better pay for university cleaners and arranging a city arts festival. He also met a fellow student, Aileen Gill, in the library. They married in 1959 and had three daughters, Sophie, Sarah and me. On graduation, John was offered a job as a radio reporter, the start of a long career at the BBC, which he always saw as a privilege. He moved from Manchester to London, producing and editing current affairs programmes at Lime Grove. After retiring from the BBC in 1984, John taught eclectic courses in broadcast journalism at Manchester University and City University, London (now City, University of London). His wealth of experience meant he was a mine of useful information, and always entertaining. He achieved his MA in war studies aged 80 from King’s College London, and in 2014 he published A Very British Conspiracy, an account of Britain’s entry into the first world war. Aileen died in 2014. John is survived by Sophie, Sarah and me and by seven grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/06/stranger-than-fiction-deep-state-homeland-and-post-truth-tv","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T05:00:24Z","webTitle":"Stranger than fiction: Deep State, Homeland and post-truth TV","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/06/stranger-than-fiction-deep-state-homeland-and-post-truth-tv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/06/stranger-than-fiction-deep-state-homeland-and-post-truth-tv","fields":{"headline":"Stranger than fiction: Deep State, Homeland and post-truth TV","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The press release for Fox’s new thriller Deep State didn’t pull its punches. “It’s gritty, intense and will leave you questioning everything,” it roared. “And we don’t just mean in the show”. Once upon a time, this assertion might have raised an eyebrow. But in 2018, so what? The hard stuff isn’t post-watershed any more. If you like your high-octane, labyrinthine espionage and conspiracy thrills in concentrated form, why not just watch the news? That way, the teeth-gritting tension comes with a visceral side order of reality too. It isn’t fair to single out Deep State for specific criticism. On the evidence of its opening episode, it’s likely to be expertly constructed, convincingly performed, reasonably involving, if mildly generic fare. Mark Strong does his wary, wounded alpha male thing to perfection as Max Easton, a former MI6 operative bullied out of bucolic retirement in rural France and packed off to Beirut to clean up some lingering, smouldering spy debris. It’s hard to imagine the mission ending well for Max. But the question remains: in a year in which foreign agents are dining on novichok in the Zizzis of provincial England, are his travails going to raise more than a shrug? Spare a thought for poor old Carrie Mathison too, as she battles not just numerous personal demons but a rising tide of public indifference. Homeland has recently managed what must go down as the greatest feat of reverse-prescience in TV history: the show’s fictional first female president Elizabeth Keane began her term of office in a season beginning just days before Donald Trump’s inauguration. Oops. Gamely, the writers formulated a salvage plan for season seven. Via the assassination attempt that closed the previous series, they’ve transformed Keane into a proto-despotic lunatic. But in the face of reality, it doesn’t really wash. She might be locking up intelligence operatives by the dozen but even so, Keane is Roosevelt, Lincoln and Jed Bartlet all rolled into a saintly paragon of statecraft compared to the real life commander-in-chief. Has Keane endorsed neo-fascists? Backed an alleged paedophile for the senate? Used a speech to some boy scouts as an opportunity for a score-settling ramble more akin to Father Ted’s Golden Cleric address than anything a real, actual president might say? She hasn’t? Then she’s 50 flavours of vanilla and she needs to raise, or perhaps lower her game. Arguably, dark, conspiracy-ridden dramas fulfil an important function. They’re a safe space for our wildest speculations, a decompression chamber for our paranoia. The X-Files is an interesting example. If any show epitomised an era during which political scientist Francis Fukuyama was able to posit “the end of history” without being laughed out of academia, it’s Mulder and Scully’s wild goose chase. The 90s now look like a mere pause for breath before the real business of humanity (wars, vicious ideological clashes, terrorism, you know the drill) got underway again. Imagine, in 2018, having enough available mental bandwidth to obsess about the possible existence of aliens? Such decadence. After 9/11, the show suddenly looked frivolous but at the time, it represented a gentle, controlled ripple on an otherwise calm pond. But the effective operation of this safe space depends on the show in question staying in its box, refusing to venture out of its fictional realm. Otherwise, it simply becomes more fuel to the fire. Might these shows bear a tiny degree of responsibility for our fake news, post-expertise predicament? Have they helped drive the suspicion that nothing is definitively true, that everything solid melts into air? One of the more alarming yet emblematic revelations of recent times was the news that Vladimir Putin was a fan of House of Cards. This offered a disturbing insight into both Putin’s behaviour and the values he projects onto those involved in top level American politics. But did it also mark a turning point in the relationship between fact and fiction? Previously, fiction was making the running. But now, reality has raced ahead and fiction is playing catchup. Even before Kevin Spacey’s transgressions came to light, House of Cards was losing the race, trailing in the slipstream of Putin and Trump. How can speculative fiction navigate our furthest imaginative reaches when such dark, strange realities are playing out every day?

But, for art’s sake and an obsessive pursuit of realism, the director was prepared to endanger a stuntman’s life, a new book claims. Bill Weston simulated weightlessness and zero gravity as an astronaut in the film’s extraordinary spacewalk sequences, but Kubrick refused to allow a second safety cable, despite the dangers of performing more than 10 metres (30ft) above a hard concrete floor. Some of the most demanding scenes filmed at the MGM Studios in Borehamwood – now demolished – were shot without a safety net. Nor would Kubrick agree to the British stuntman having air holes punched into the back of his astronaut’s helmet, in case light was visible through the visor. He also refused to stop filming even when he was warned that Weston was in grave danger, the book claims. Weston realised that he was losing consciousness, with oxygen deprivation and carbon dioxide taking their toll. He mustered enough strength to extend his arms into a crucifix pose – an arranged signalling system for an emergency. Weston, who died in 2012, is quoted in the book saying he will never forget hearing someone urging Kubrick that “we’ve got to get him back”. Or, as he was passing out, hearing Kubrick ignore that warning, exclaiming: “Damn it, we just started. Leave him up there! Leave him up there!” The extraordinary episode is revealed in the forthcoming book Space Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C Clarke, and the Making of a Masterpiece. It will be published by Simon &amp; Schuster on 19 April for the 50th anniversary of the film’s release. Its author, Michael Benson, included in depth interviews with Weston and the visual effects supervisor Doug Trumbull, who photographed the daredevil stunts, among others. Kubrick’s masterpieces include Paths of Glory, one of the most powerful anti-war movies. It starred Kirk Douglas, who also played the hero in Kubrick’s Roman classic Spartacus. Kubrick was a supreme visual stylist with a perfectionist’s attention to detail. 2001 was so realistic that the Soviet cosmonaut Alexey Leonov, who became the world’s first spacewalker in 1965, said after seeing the film in 1968: “Now I feel I’ve been in space twice.” Benson says that, decades before digital effects, the 2001 stunts “constitute an extraordinary, largely unsung moment in film history”. Kubrick, like his lead actors Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood, was afraid of flying. Yet the most complex shots of his film included Weston playing the dead astronaut Frank Poole, spinning lifelessly. His stunts involved being suspended horizontally from wires connected to a drill motor against a black abyss of outer space recreated by vast curtains of black velvet. But Kubrick did not make things easy. He insisted that Weston wore a wig that made his hermetically sealed spacesuit become all the more overheated. More seriously, a small tank within Weston’s backpack contained only 10 minutes’ worth of compressed air. In his book, Benson writes: “Given the complexity of the shots, and the amount of time it took simply to remove the platform used to prepare the stuntman’s wires and suspend him, 10 minutes wasn’t enough. “There was another problem. Even when the tank was feeding air into the suit, there was no place for the carbon dioxide Weston exhaled to go. So it simply built up inside, incrementally causing a heightened heart rate, rapid breathing, fatigue, clumsiness, and eventually, unconsciousness.” Having recovered from the oxygen deprivation, Weston was so outraged that he decided to confront Kubrick, only to find that he had fled the scene. The director did not return for two or three days, Weston recalls. “Because I was going to do him.” Tempers were soothed after the stuntman was given a swish dressing room with a fridge full of beer and a large raise in his fee. Weston, who went on to perform in numerous James Bond films, says: “One of the great things about Stanley was he had an incredible, tremendous artistic integrity. I think morally he was a little bit weaker.” Another leading film-maker, Martin Scorsese, has endorsed the book. “Over the years, so much has been written about 2001 and its creation that I thought we knew all that there was to know,” he wrote. “And then I received a copy of [this] … exciting and exhaustively researched book, which further expands our understanding of what is truly one of the greatest films ever made.” • This article was amended on 13 April 2018. An earlier version said Michael Benson spoke to Bill Weston and others.

However I am mystified by Tim Adams’s piece in the same edition that makes repeated references to private data on Facebook. As far as I can establish, there is nothing private online. Unless it is encrypted – and even then it’s doubtful if the code can withstand the hackers – the chances of anyone sharing a private moment online are as likely as it snowing in the Sahara desert. Advertising-supported media rightly see Facebook as a rival. This has resulted in some highly emotional accounts about people’s rights. Facebook has given people a platform to express themselves, but as far as I know it has not given them any rights. There is no code of ethics, just terms and conditions, which nobody reads. Adams’s piece does cast doubt on the effectiveness of the Cambridge Analytica campaigns, which leads one to think: what is the fuss all about? In this digital age there is a tendency to marvel at what can be done with the right devices. This in no way lessens the importance of that old warning: buyer beware. Children, especially, need to be instructed how to use these devices to protect themselves and their friends. Adults also need to apply some common sense in what is becoming an increasingly confused and complicated world. Val Wake Lodeve, France Healing power of nature In Nature Watch – Chew Valley (23 March) Dawn Lawrence expresses her gratitude that some ancient pastures have been saved from modern farming. She reminds me how lucky I am to live here in Victoria, where I can drive half an hour and be immersed in pockets of wilderness. Last week I was in a grove of firs and cedars two metres in diameter and 60 metres tall that somehow escaped the rapacious saws. As I walk along sketchy back-trails I am always conscious of when I am in second growth from industrial logging (post-second world war, small trees close together), second growth from selective logging (pre-second world war, larger trees with more space between) or original growth (huge ancient trees in valley bottoms). I can feel how healing it is to spend time with the old trees. When I return to the city I am greeted by a forest of tower cranes. While the local population explodes, I am amazed that just a short time from here I can be surrounded by timeless natural beauty and never meet a soul. Edward Butterworth Victoria, British Columbia, Canada ‘Schoolchildren’ disdainful In your comment piece Trump won’t fall without a push (23 March) the young people who are organising the public protests against gun violence are referred to as “schoolchildren”. This is misleading and carries a hint of disdain. The word implies humans up to the age of about 10. The young people organising the protests are high school students. In the US high school covers the last four years before college: the 15- to 18-year age range. As a Brit who has lived in various parts of this continent for 60 years, I observe that most high school students are more mature, confident and aware of social issues than those in the UK in the years around 1940. That might be different today. Joyce Phillips Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, US Who is hogging all the art? The Opinion in brief of 16 March featured the piece Why should we let the rich hog all the art?, decrying 13 Picasso works having been bought by a London art adviser, along with nine more having been sold at Christies, the implication being that these works would be lost to the super-rich and would no longer be available for viewing in public museums. “Thank God for export bars”! But those paintings would not have been in Britain in the first place if Spain and France had had export prohibitions. And isn’t the art wealth of the country largely the result of extremely wealthy Brits buying up treasures abroad? These now fill the land’s galleries to an extent that would seem disproportionate to the UK’s share of the population. So who did you say is hogging all the art?

Perhaps the company was misled by all the talk of self-reliance that hung about the Brexit vote. It may have thought the term translates into a willingness to hammer, cut, drill and screw in the process of fixing things around the house. As it turned out, it was actually about screwing up something that worked pretty well on an international scale. Lawrie Bradly Surrey Hills, Victoria, Australia • Thank you, Michael Sheen (23 March), for focusing on action for ordinary individuals, in this case over debt. I have just finished David Hepworth’s excellent Uncommon People, the truth about who rock stars really are. Just plain people. The rest is hype. Replace rock stars with politicians, clergymen, so-called successful businesspersons, and a whole new world opens.

Four of the top five places in the TLS’s ranking of what it dubbed the “New Elizabethans” went to women, with Smith followed by Hilary Mantel, Zadie Smith, Kazuo Ishiguro and Eimear McBride. The project set out, said the TLS’s editor Stig Abell, to avoid the “tendency to fall back on a group of authors who came to prominence a few decades ago”, with writers such as Ian McEwan, Julian Barnes, Salman Rushdie and Martin Amis all failing to make the list. The literary journal said the poll was carried out “in a spirit of mischief”. Writing in the TLS, critic Alex Clark praised Ali Smith’s most recent work: a projected quartet of state-of-the-nation novels that began with the Man Booker-shortlisted Autumn. “It’s not simply that Smith has chosen to write against the clock, it’s that she is simultaneously mapping her abiding concerns – surveillance, power, art and illusion – on to both natural and human-made cycles of change and renewal,” Clark wrote. Those polled were asked to nominate 10 writers whose recent books were “among their most impressive”, and whose future work is “the most eagerly anticipated”. The rest of the top 10 are Colm Tóibín, Nicola Barker, Alan Hollinghurst and Anne Enright, with Sebastian Barry and Jon McGregor tying for 10th place. Clark admitted that the top 10 was “more than tinged with familiarity”, but said that “despite the lack of shocks, it would also – and perhaps this is the point – be hard to argue for the exclusion of any particular writer, nor for there being any lack of stylistic diversity on display”. David Szalay came in at 11, followed by Kevin Barry, Deborah Levy, Tom McCarthy, Sally Rooney, Kamila Shamsie, Rachel Cusk, Gwendoline Riley, Sarah Waters and Claire-Louise Bennett. Rooney and Bennett have both written only one book apiece: Bennett’s short story collection Pond and Rooney’s novel Conversations With Friends. Many respondents, who ranged from editors and agents to academics and writers, told the TLS they would choose a different 10 if asked on another day, wrote Clark, with some bemoaning their inability to suggest writers “beyond the usual suspects”. One unnamed respondent said they were as ready to rank their favourite writers as they were to rank their own children, but persevered after considering “the dominance of a group of writers valorised by a generation of literary editors who came of age, as it were, simultaneously with those writers”. Clark admitted the “challenges” the novel currently faces, from “the collapse of literary fiction’s ability to generate significant revenue” highlighted by a recent Arts Council England report to author Will Self’s warning in the Observer that the novel is “doomed to become a marginal cultural form, along with easel painting and the classical symphony”. “Put simply, if the novel is borked, then does it matter who’s good at it?” she asked. “Why do we bother, either writers or readers? The answer is simple: it would be too boring not to.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/05/aimee-willmott-hannah-miley-commonwealth-games-swimming-gold-max-whitlock-gymnastics","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T12:07:00Z","webTitle":"Aimee Willmott applies her own science to beat Miley to Commonwealth gold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/05/aimee-willmott-hannah-miley-commonwealth-games-swimming-gold-max-whitlock-gymnastics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/05/aimee-willmott-hannah-miley-commonwealth-games-swimming-gold-max-whitlock-gymnastics","fields":{"headline":"Aimee Willmott applies her own science to beat Miley to Commonwealth gold","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Few swimmers have a greater understanding of how to tease the best performance out of themselves than Aimee Willmott, who has written an academic paper on the subject. Willmott’s dissertation, published in the European Journal of Sport Science, considers the effect clothing worn between a warm-up and competition can have on performance. She concludes that wearing the right garb can give a 0.59% boost in performance, which may not sound significant but in a sport such as swimming the finest margins decide medals. Accordingly, Willmott touched the wall only 0.26sec ahead of Hannah Miley to claim one of Team England’s six gold medals on the opening day of the Commonwealth Games on Australia’s Gold Coast. On a humid evening at the Optics Aquatics Centre, Willmott followed her own advice and togged up until the last possible moment before the 400m medley final. “I did five years of uni and finished last year and did my study based on how hot you are before you swim determining how fast you swim,” said Willmott, who graduated with a degree in sport and exercise science from the University of East London. “I practise what I preach. I dressed up really warm and was so hot before with the nerves and the crowd combined.” Willmott and Miley were stroke for stroke until the final 15m of the race when the red cap of the Teeside swimmer poked in front and she denied the Scotswoman a hat-trick of Commonwealth titles. It completed a remarkable comeback for Willmott after she was forced to relocate her training base from the London Aquatics centre to the University of Stirling when the elite programme at the home of the 2012 Olympics was abruptly shelved. She doubted she would even make it to the Gold Coast after sustaining a series of injuries that shook her self-belief. “After the 12 months I’ve had with two broken ribs, a bashed elbow and knee surgery it was just a huge sigh of relief to get here,” she said. “To just do the business is incredible.” “The injury setbacks were really bad to the point where me and my parents couldn’t even have a conversation because I was just so stressed,” she added. “When you break your ribs, you can’t really do a lot so from swimming twice a day and gym, to the programme in London closing down and sitting on a sofa for eight weeks it was really hard to deal with. I’ve learned a lot, gained a lot of confidence and got the enjoyment back. I’d lost that a little bit before.” Her victory came before a fourth gold of the day for the England team, this one for James Wilby, who beat the defending champion Ross Murdoch from Scotland into second, to win the men’s 200m breaststroke. There were two other golds in the pool for England, for Paralympic champion Ellie Robinson in the women’s S7 50m butterfly and Tom Hamer in the men’s S14 200m freestyle. The honour of England’s first gold of the Games went to the visually impaired cyclist Sophie Thornhill and her tandem pilot Helen Scott who won the women’s sprint. Later, England claimed silver in the men’s team sprint and men’s team pursuit. The double Olympic champion Max Whitlock won the first of a possible three golds as England’s men won the team gymnastics event. The team of Whitlock, Nile Wilson, James Hall, Courtney Tulloch and Dominick Cunningham were utterly dominant, taking the title a massive 10 points ahead of nearest rivals Canada. The team event doubles up as qualification for the individual disciplines and Whitlock competed only on the floor and pommel horse, the two apparatus on which he won gold at Rio 2016. His complex floor routine, which has undergone a facelift since Rio, scored 14.8 before he returned to the pommel horse for a top score of 15.150, putting him in pole position for double gold in those individual events. Anna Hursey, the 11-year-old table tennis player from Wales, continued a remarkable rise to prominence by winning her first doubles match. She was making her Commonwealth Games debut but there was no hint of nerves as she and partner Charlotte Carey brought Wales their only win as India claimed the five-rubber series 3-1."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/02/gaza-march-palestinians-israel","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T15:09:51Z","webTitle":"The Gaza march is a wake-up call to the world | Tareq Baconi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/02/gaza-march-palestinians-israel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/02/gaza-march-palestinians-israel","fields":{"headline":"The Gaza march is a wake-up call to the world","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On Friday, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip embarked on what they called the “Great March of Return”. In their thousands they walked and chanted metres away from the electric fence that has kept 2 million Gaza residents penned in for more than a decade. They planned to sit there, in a flimsily built tent-city, until Nakba day, on 15 May. That day marks the 70th anniversary of the Nakba, or “catastrophe” – when the marchers, their parents or their grandparents, fled or were forced to flee their homes upon the creation of the state of Israel. Friday also marked another anniversary for Palestinians: Land Day. On that day in 1976, Israel’s soldiers and police opened fire on its own Palestinian citizens as they protested about the expropriation of their land by the government, killing six of them. Yet another impetus for this march is the US government plan to relocate its embassy to Jerusalem on 15 May, legitimising Israel’s violation of international law – in this case its illegal annexation of East Jerusalem. But perhaps the greatest driver of this march is the tragedy of the Gaza Strip itself. Under an Israeli-Egyptian blockade for more than 10 years, Palestinians have experienced electricity shortages and a water supply crisis, with only a very few able to leave the tiny coastal enclave. They have been subjected to military assaults that make daily life seem like a post-apocalyptic vision. Rather than address the political issues that underpin Gaza’s misery, the US and Israel recently embarked on a humanitarian mission to alleviate suffering in Gaza while paradoxically sustaining the blockade. That is because Israel believes it can manage the situation in the Gaza Strip indefinitely, while also maintaining control over the remainder of occupied territories. With this march, Palestinians in Gaza are reminding the world that they cannot be “managed”. They and their fellow Palestinian refugees continue to hold rights under international law. UN resolution 194 affirmed the Palestinian right of return. The march has given rise to competing narratives. Civil society organisers put out statements to the effect that this event was not affiliated with any political party and that it was a peaceful act calling for the right of return. In response, the Israeli government issued talking points calling the march a “hostile provocation” by Hamas. Rather than peacefully protest the inhumanity to which they are subjected, Palestinians are expected to maintain “calm” on Israel’s southern front. In response to news of the march, Israel positioned snipers with live ammunition and “riot dispersal gear” behind the safety of one of the most securitised fences in the world. The march remained predominantly peaceful, with some reports of stone-throwing and tyre-burning. Nonetheless, Israel responded with lethal force. Some 1,000 Palestinians were injured and 16 were killed. Israel believes that it is within its rights to defend its borders in this way. But Gaza is not a separate nation neighbouring Israel. It is a territory under occupation. Even though Israel withdrew its settlers in 2005, it continues to maintain effective control of the strip. Palestinians in Gaza marched not towards the border with Israel, but rather towards the fence that has kept them segregated and imprisoned. Diplomats all over the world might shrug away the right of return as a right that cannot be exercised. Yet for the people on the ground, addressing the injustices of 1948 remains at the heart of their quest for freedom, justice and equality. As the funerals that took place in Gaza this weekend attest, protest against Israeli repression often ends in tragedy. While it is difficult to advocate further popular resistance in the context of an inevitably violent response, Palestinians should nonetheless reflect on the power of civil disobedience in asserting their inviolable individual and collective rights. Peaceful marches in the West Bank, in East Jerusalem, in Israeli cities and in neighbouring countries may be one way to compel the world to challenge Israel’s oppression of the Palestinian people. • Tareq Baconi is a policy member at al-Shabaka: The Palestinian Policy Network, and the author of Hamas Contained: The Rise and Pacification of Palestinian Resistance"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"travel/2018/apr/05/top-10-affordable-hotels-hostels-b-and-bs-in-amsterdam","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T05:30:40Z","webTitle":"Top 10 affordable hotels, hostels and B&Bs in Amsterdam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/apr/05/top-10-affordable-hotels-hostels-b-and-bs-in-amsterdam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/apr/05/top-10-affordable-hotels-hostels-b-and-bs-in-amsterdam","fields":{"headline":"Top 10 affordable hotels, hostels and B&Bs in Amsterdam","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Max Brown Canal District This three-star hotel is actually a trio of listed buildings and is in a quiet, picturesque spot where the Herengracht and Brouwersgracht canals meet.

As Gary Rowett, the visiting manager, said: “An ugly performance – it didn’t matter how we played and how we got the result. I couldn’t give a monkeys if we didn’t look attractive. The win is a massive boost.” Both sides were coming off demoralising Good Friday defeats: Derby endured a 4-1 home hammering by lowly Sunderland and Preston a defeat by the same score at Sheffield Wednesday. Those losses were hardly a boost in the bid to secure a top-six berth, with Derby in particular bother having failed to win in their previous eight games. With only two points between the sides this was a chance for either team to kick-start a late run. Alex Neil, the Preston manager, made two changes, selecting Chris Maxwell in goal and Greg Cunningham at left-back, while Rowett stood down five Derby players as Andre Wisdom, Alex Pearce, David Nugent, Joe Ledley and Tom Huddlestone came in. After an opening in which Preston threatened Scott Carson’s goal Nugent skimmed the ball along the turf into the area but the home team cleared. Neil’s men were instantly back in control. Callum Robinson, the left‑sided forward, hit a diagonal pass into Tom Barkhuizen but his first-time volley was tame. Neil’s men were proving more urgent. A Browne surge took him near to Carson and seconds later Sean Maguire had a shot blocked from close‑in by Ledley. A cold day at a sparsely filled Deepdale was not being warmed by the fare on offer. Play got bogged down in the middle third, passes smacked into opposition and the ball hit air copiously. When Robinson roved down the left and sent in a cross that missed everyone for a goal-kick this was a fair summation of the contest. A promising break from Derby foundered when Nugent found Matej Vydra and his control failed. At the other end a Robinson effort was saved well by Carson’s feet – the closest yet to a goal. This changed on 36 minutes when Wisdom felled Browne in the area. The same player stepped up for the penalty but hit the ball on to Carson’s right post and wide. Rowett said: “I said to the players at half-time – we’ve got to snatch that now, the lifeline of a missed penalty.” So they did via Lawrence’s impressive winner. Shortly after half-time the former Manchester United player fired his free-kick sweetly past Maxwell to send the travelling contingent into jubilation. It also left Nugent with a broken nose. “I’ve got a big lump – he caught me when he was trying to run away as we were celebrating. I’ll probably have two black eyes but it’s all worth it,” the No 9 said. Derby came close to a second when Andreas Weimann’s cross was narrowly missed by a flailing Nugent. Better from Preston came when Barkhuizen forced a corner though they failed to capitalise. A golden chance for the equaliser arrived when the ball fell for Paul Huntington but from near the penalty spot the centre-back smacked the ball over. Towards the end the Derby substitute Casey Palmer placed an attempt inches wide before Preston’s Paul Gallagher blasted high from yards out. It left Neil ruing what might have been. “Results are what matters at this stage of the season,” he said. “Margins are so fine. We had the chance to unlock and change the match [with the penalty] and we didn’t take it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/03/democrats-arizona-special-election-hiral-tipirneni","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T11:00:14Z","webTitle":"Democrats see glimmer of hope in land of Sheriff Joe Arpaio before special vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/03/democrats-arizona-special-election-hiral-tipirneni","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/03/democrats-arizona-special-election-hiral-tipirneni","fields":{"headline":"Democrats see glimmer of hope in land of Sheriff Joe Arpaio before special vote","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Republicans have run Phoenix’s West Valley for as long as Bill Bercu has lived there. “Democrats didn’t bother with the west side because it’s all old farts like me and they are all Republicans,” said Bercu, 67, a retired university professor who chairs a local chapter of the Maricopa County Democratic party. “But that’s changing, fast.” After upset victories in Alabama and Pennsylvania, Arizona’s special election to replace Trent Franks, an arch-conservative who resigned amid a sexual misconduct scandal last year, is drawing national attention as a gauge of Democratic enthusiasm ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. The state’s eighth congressional district, described as “so red it’s burgundy” by an Arizona Republic columnist, is home to the “sun cities”, a cluster of retirement communities that served as an unshakeable base for the hardline sheriff Joe Arpaio during his nearly 25 years in office. Trump won the district by 21%. “The question isn’t if the GOP will retain the seat,” said Mike Noble, a Republican pollster in the state, “but how much does [Debbie] Lesko win by?” As the 24 April contest approaches, Bercu said signs of political change are everywhere. In January 2017, he convened a meeting in a small room behind a funeral parlor in Sun City. A “miracle” happened: organizers ran out of seats. Democratic energy has only “grown exponentially” since, he said. Last week, at least 200 Democrats – and a handful of independent voters – attended a meeting in a high school auditorium to listen to Hiral Tipirneni, the Democratic candidate. “We’ve gained a lot of ground,” Tipirneni told them. “We definitely have good traction. And it seems that maybe we’ve put a little fear into the hearts of the Republicans.” Tipirneni, a former emergency room doctor and political newcomer who was inspired to run for office after the 2016 election, is the first Democrat to contest the seat since 2012. She faces Lesko, a former state senator who championed legislation allowing Sun City residents to drive golf carts on the road. When the bill was passed, the community feted officials including Lesko with a 100-golf cart parade. The seat came open in December, when Franks resigned over reports he offered to pay a female staffer $5m to give birth to his child. In a 12-way primary, Franks endorsed Steve Montenegro, a former state senate leader. But it was revealed that Montenegro, a married Christian minister, exchanged nude photos and flirtatious texts with a staffer. Republicans were relieved when Lesko won the nomination. And yet the party’s national committee recently injected more than $280,000 into the race – a sign, Democrats say, that the GOP is worried. “If you look at that national wave of momentum, Arizona is no different,” Tipirneni told the Guardian. “Our Democratic base is energized. And what’s amazing is that we didn’t realize how many Dems were there just waiting for somebody to step up and represent them.” Barrett Marson, a spokesman for Lesko, countered that a lack of investment by national Democrats was more telling than any Republican commitment. “This is not a district that Democrats have contended in or participated in in many years,” he said, “and their spending in the current race I think demonstrates that they understand it’s not winnable.” In a poll by Lake Research Partners, released by Tipirneni, Lesko held a 14-point lead. Nearly 60% of respondents said they approved of Trump. On campaign signs, Lesko says she is “standing with the president”. She also backs Trump’s demand for a border wall and touts the benefits of Republican tax cuts. But standing by Trump isn’t always easy, even a district where Trump remains popular. During a debate, Lesko, herself a survivor of domestic violence, said accusations of sexual misconduct against the president should be investigated. In an interview with the New York Times, she said she had misspoken. Marson, her spokesman, said Lesko meant that claims should be taken seriously but was in “no way” calling for a formal investigation. Lesko is also facing allegations that she violated campaign finance law by steering funds from her state senate account to a campaign Super Pac. She has denied wrongdoing. Tipirneni has cast herself as a moderate willing to work across the aisle and strongly disputes the charge that she is “too liberal” for the district. She supports “commonsense” gun control measures, a public health insurance option and comprehensive immigration reform. The district is 41% registered Republican, 24% Democrat and 33% unaffiliated. Democrats are targeting newer suburban communities on the western outskirts of Phoenix, hoping to win over independents and disaffected Republicans. “We know that conventional wisdom doesn’t apply because look at all of these other places where the numbers really didn’t affect the eventual outcome,” Tipirneni said. “There’s a lot of reason to think that Arizona can absolutely be next.” At the Democratic meeting last week, Bob Wall, 78, from Glendale, said he planned to vote for Tipirneni but struggled to remember her name. So he’d rewritten the lyrics of a British first world war marching song, It’s a Long Way to Tipperary. By the close of the meeting, attendees belted: “We are marching for Tipirneni … it’s the right way to go.” Such enthusiasm among Democrats could spell trouble for Arizona Republicans running in the midterm elections this fall, Noble said. But as for the upcoming special election, he said, an upset was unlikely. He compared hopes of a Democratic win to a scene in Dumb and Dumber in which Jim Carrey’s character, Lloyd Christmas, asks the woman of his dreams the odds they will end up together. “One in a million,” she says. Christmas’s face lights up. “So you’re telling me there’s a chance?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/02/football-league-clockwatch-championship-league-one-and-two-action-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T15:59:34Z","webTitle":"Football League: Sunderland 1-3 Sheffield Wednesday, and more – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/02/football-league-clockwatch-championship-league-one-and-two-action-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/02/football-league-clockwatch-championship-league-one-and-two-action-live","fields":{"headline":"Football League: Sunderland 1-3 Sheffield Wednesday, and more – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Charlton 3-1 Rotherham Fleetwood 2-0 Bristol R MK Dons 1-2 Blackburn Oldham 2-1 Blackpool Peterborough 2-0 Northampton Shrewsbury 3-2 Oxford Southend 4-0 Gillingham Accrington 1-0 Notts County Carlisle 0-1 Lincoln City Coventry 2-6 Yeovil Crawley 1-1 Swindon Crewe 2-2 Port Vale Exeter 2-1 Cheltenham Forest Green 1-2 Colchester Luton 2-1 Mansfield Stevenage 4-1 Barnet Wycombe 2-1 Grimsby Bristol City 0-1 Brentford Burton 1-1 Middlesbrough Preston 0-1 Derby Ipswich 2-2 Millwall QPR 4-1 Norwich City Sunderland 1-3 Sheff Weds Brilliant left-handed save by Bialkowski to deny Millwall a winner at Portman Road. Injury-time to play there ... In League Two, Marc Richards has dug out his 10th Swindon goal to nab an equaliser at Crawley. In League One, Oldham have taken the lead at home to Blackpool through Eoin Doyle. Britt Assombalonga bags his first goal in 15 matches and, after a dire display, Boro are looking good to come away with at least a point. At Portman Road, George Saville rattles the post for Millwall. Josh Brownhill makes an acrobatic clearance off the line to deny Maupay a quickfire second at Ashton Gate. Brentford very nearly had a second there. Meanwhile, Millwall squander a chance at Portman Road, as we move into the final 10 minutes there. City defenders back off and the substitute striker drills low and home. And with that, Middlesbrough – who are losing at Burton – retain their top-six spot, for now at least. Meanwhile, on-loan Bournemouth striker Sam Surridge has added a fifth for Yeovil at Coventry. That’s quite the rout. Crikey, QPR are in the mood this afternoon. Elsewhere, Exeter lead Cheltenham 2-1 thanks to a goal by Jordan Storey. Barnet have pulled a goal back at Stevenage but is that too little too late? Sunderland are heading back to the bottom of the Championship. Great play by Adam Reach, who fizzes in a dangerous cross, which is eventually stabbed home at the back post by Atdhe Nuhiu. A massive goal in League Two, with Luton taking the lead at home to Mansfield. Nathan Jones’s side seize on a goalkeeping error. In League One, Shrewsbury have been pegged by Oxford who now trail 3-2 at the New Meadow. Charlton are cruising 3-0. Big penalty shouts at the Stadium of Light with Barry Bannan sliding in on Lynden Gooch, just seconds after Lee Cattermole slams a Sheffield Wednesday post. Sunderland want and need to find an equaliser. Can they do it? It’s going to be one helluva finale. His first goal in over a year is very bad news for Chris Coleman. In League Two, Scott Kashket has his first goal of the season for Wycombe, who now lead Grimsby 2-1 at Adams’ Park. At the bottom of the table, Barnet are 3-0 down at Stevenage, who seem to be enjoying life under Dino Maamria. OK, this is getting silly now. George Saville, the former Wolves midfielder gets Neil Harris’s side back on track. A goal glut at Portman Road. Luton, meanwhile, are level in League Two. Ian Holloway’s side have established some breathing space. Funny old game, eh? Sunderland draw level at the Stadium of Light. That is a big blow for Chris Coleman’s side, who are heading back to the foot of the table as it stands. Elsewhere, Charlton have doubled their lead over Rotherham and Adam El-Abd has pulled Wycombe level at home to Grimsby Town. Martyn Waghorn has his second and three minutes, and, suddenly, Millwall’s bubble has been burst. All to play for at Portman Road. Matt Smith nods in. Angus Gunn, the Norwich goalkeeper, will probably not want to be seeing it again any time soon. In League Two, Zoko has his second of the afternoon Yeovil are 4-1 up at Coventry. In other words, they are in dreamland. It is a real goalmouth scramble but Mick McCarthy’s side are level. Can Millwall get in front to nip back into the play-offs? As things stand, Bristol City are heading into the top six. Jon Nolan has doubled Shrewsbury Town’s lead at home to Oxford and, at this rate, they’re heading above Wigan until Paul Cook’s side take on his former employers, Portsmouth, later this evening. Meanwhile, Coventry have pulled a goal back at home to Yeovil. Great work by Tom Bayliss kickstarts a move finished by Max Biamou. Game on with 40-odd minutes to play. And we’re back under way for a big 45 minutes. Hats off to Nottingham Forest, whose match at home to Barnsley was postponed this afternoon: Championship Bristol City 0-0 Brentford Burton 1-0 Middlesbrough Ipswich 0-1 Millwall QPR 1-1 Norwich City Sunderland 0-0 Sheff Weds League One Charlton 1-0 Rotherham Fleetwood 0-0 Bristol Rovers MK Dons 0-2 Blackburn Oldham 0-1 Blackpool Peterborough 2-0 Northampton Shrewsbury 1-0 Oxford Southend 4-0 Gillingham League Two Accrington 1-0 Notts County Carlisle 0-1 Lincoln City Coventry 0-3 Yeovil Town Crawley 1-0 Swindon Crewe 1-1 Port Vale Exeter 1-1 Cheltenham Forest Green 1-1 Colchester Luton 0-1 Mansfield Stevenage 1-0 Barnet Wycombe 0-1 Grimsby Two big goals for teams with promotion ambitions: Blackburn are 2-0 up at MK Dons, with Adam Armstrong nabbing his second, and 10th for the club. At Carlisle, Matt Green has poked Lincoln in front in League Two. Ah, that didn’t last long. In League One, Blackpool lead at Oldham while Carl Winchester has nudged Cheltenham in front at Exeter. Also in League Two, Mansfield lead at Luton. Great work by Ben Marshall, whipping a ball in from the left and there is Jake Cooper to nod home. In the third tier, things are looking rosy for Lee Bowyer’s Charlton – still feels weird saying that – who lead Rotherham 1-0 at the Valley. In League One, 2007’s Michael Kightly has Southend in cruise control at Roots Hall, where they now lead Gillingham 3-0. So ... fifteen minutes in, Yeovil are three goals to the good at Coventry. Alex Fisher – the striker who drove down from Motherwell after signing at the end of January to play Manchester United the same evening – has his second of the afternoon. He only arrived in January but Adam Armstrong is proving a contender for Tony Mowbray’s signing of the season. After taking a while to settle, the Newcastle striker has scored his ninth goal in as many matches since February. Blackburn lead at MK Dons. A flurry of big goals elsewhere: Peterborough lead Northampton 2-0 in League One and Southend have doubled their lead against the Gills. In League Two, Yeovil have done the same at Coventry thanks to Francois Zoko, their evergreen skipper. Mark Hughes – no, not that one – has given Accrington the lead at home to Notts County. Elsewhere, in League One the defender Michael Turner has given Southend the lead at Roots Hall against Gillingham. That’s his third goal of the season – and a priceless one too, as Nigel Clough’s men, the bottom club look to secure a second successive season in the second tier. Sixty seconds in at the New Lawn, Colchester are one-up against Forest Green Rovers, thanks to Drey Wright. Elsewhere, Yeovil lead 1-0 at Coventry. And, just like that, the three o’clockers are under way. Some headline Championship team news: Aden Flint is back from a three-game suspension for Bristol City at home to Brentford, while Ollie Watkins returns up front for Dean Smith’s side. Jonny Howson moves into the Middlesbrough starting line up, while at Portman Road, Millwall are unchanged as they look for a seventh straight away win. In League Two, Kevin Nolan names Shola Ameobi and Jon Stead on the bench at league leaders Accrington Stanley. Gary Rowett questioned whether some of his Derby County squad lacked the “bottle when the chips are down” but they have shown some mettle to record victory this afternoon. Billy Bodin had a half-hearted effort saved by Scott Carson late on but Preston never showcased the belief that has propelled them into the play-off picture. Three defeats from their past four matches might put pay those slim top-six hopes. Up at Deepdale, Preston and Derby are into the final 15 minutes. Tom Lawrence’s second-half free-kick remains the difference between the sides, as Gary Rowett’s side look to return to winning ways. That goal seems to have lifted Lawrence, while Kasey Palmer is on now too, in place of Matej Vydra. Championship Bristol City v Brentford Burton v Middlesbrough Ipswich v Millwall QPR v Norwich City Sunderland v Sheffield Wednesday Sheffield United v Cardiff (19.45) League One Charlton v Rotherham Fleetwood v Bristol Rovers MK Dons v Blackburn Oldham v Blackpool Peterborough v Northampton Shrewsbury v Oxford Southend v Gillingham Portsmouth v Wigan (17.30) League Two Accrington v Notts County Carlisle v Lincoln Coventry v Yeovil Crawley v Swindon Crewe v Port Vale Exeter v Cheltenham Forest Green v Colchester Luton v Mansfield Morecambe v Cambridge Stevenage v Barnet Wycombe v Grimsby Parish notice: a few matches have not survived the weather. Nottingham Forest v Barnsley Bradford City v Walsall Doncaster v AFC Wimbledon Scunthorpe v Plymouth Chesterfield v Newport After today, for many teams, there will be as few as six league games left. For some it is already too late, but the magnitude of this Easter Monday cannot be downplayed by the likes of Middlesbrough and in-form Millwall, both chasing the top six, and Sunderland, at the other end of the Championship table. Successive victories for Chris Coleman’s side would be conducive to the most unlikely of great escapes. In the early-kick off, Derby lead at Preston with 30 minutes to play thanks to Tom Lawrence’s goal at Deepdale. After eight winless games, they badly need to reignite their tilt at the play-offs. In League One, the tasty match is the Paul Cook derby between Portsmouth and Wigan later this evening while Blackburn travel to MK Dons before that. Plymouth, meanwhile, travelled to Scunthorpe looking to keep their somewhat ridiculous run going but the match succumbed to the adverse weather. As for League Two, the league leaders Accrington host Notts County, Grimsby face a tricky test at Wycombe while Luton welcome Mansfield to Kenilworth Road."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/apr/02/new-zealand-v-england-second-test-day-five-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T06:22:17Z","webTitle":"New Zealand hold England to draw on final day of second Test – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/apr/02/new-zealand-v-england-second-test-day-five-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/apr/02/new-zealand-v-england-second-test-day-five-live","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand hold England to draw on final day of second Test – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I suppose that’s an appropriate end to a trying winter for England. But today is more about New Zealand - a resourceful, likeable, sometimes brilliant side who fully deserve this victory. On behalf of all the OBO writers, thanks for your company all winter, and for keeping us sane during the small hours. It feels a long time ago that James Vince made 83 on the first day of the Ashes at the Gabba. Bye! Kane Williamson speaks “It was an amazing day of Test cricket. I want to thank Joe and his team - that was a really hard-fought series. We didn’t get off to a great start but the guys showed a lot of steel. Ish Sodhi and Neil Wagner were just phenomenal.” Joe Root speaks “We threw absolutely everything at them. I’m very proud of the way we went about it. We had some great support as well. Fair play to New Zealand; they played very well. We let ourselves down in the first innings of the first Test, but apart from that we played some good cricket. We need to take some of the good stuff from this week into the summer. We’d have loved a third Test - I think everyone would. Those five days were a great advert for Test cricket.” Trent Boult is the Player of the Series “It’s a phenomenal way to end the season; it’s been great fun. I’m sure we’ll celebrate it well tonight.” Tim Southee is the Man of the Match “It’s very special to win a series against England. We’ll savour it for a long time.” Ish Sodhi speaks “I’m rapt to be part of a series win. Waggy is a fighter when he bowls and he dragged me along. There were tough periods when they bowled bouncers but it was a pretty true wicket. I was disappointed with my performance with the ball so to be able to contribute is massive for me. All I could hear was the Barmy Army at the end, their songs will be ringing in my head for a while.” That was a glorious last day’s play. England took four wickets in the first hour but could only take four more in the rest of the day. New Zealand threw it away with some dodgy attacking strokes and then grabbed it back in the final session. England lose the series with a fair amount of honour, although they have set an unwanted record of 13 overseas Tests without a win. Ish Sodhi walks off to a huge ovation. He had a stinker in his day job, with the ball - yet he might be Man of the Match for an immense 56 not out from 168 balls. Bad light stops play before another ball can be bowled, and New Zealand have beaten England at home for the first time in 34 years! Wagner has gone, caught bat pad off Root. He reviewed it to waste time, a very smart move. England probably have three balls to take the last two wickets. Wagner gets a standing oivation for an innings of seven from 103 balls. 124th over: New Zealand 256-7 (Sodhi 56, Wagner 7) A long hop from Malan is cuffed for four by Sodhi. New Zealand have lost only one wicket in the last 56 overs, which tells the story of a famous rearguard. Few England fans will begrudge them this victory. 123rd over: New Zealand 252-7 (Sodhi 52, Wagner 7) Wagner plays out another over from Leach. That takes him to 99 - balls faced, that is. And he looks like he could go all night. He only needs to survive another eight minutes. 122nd over: New Zealand 252-7 (Sodhi 52, Wagner 7) Root off, Malan on. Sodhi flogs him over midwicket for four to reach a marvellous fifty from 158 balls! His grandkids will hear plenty about 3rd April 2018. 121st over: New Zealand 248-7 (Sodhi 48, Wagner 7) England can actually get more than two overs in, because there are around 15 minutes remaining of the final hour. They just don’t look like taking a wicket, though. This pitch, inspired by Mac Millings XI, has gone to sleep. Wagner survives another maiden from Leach, including an optimistic appeal for a bat-pad catch. New Zealand have scored one run from the last nine overs. 120th over: New Zealand 248-7 (Sodhi 48, Wagner 7) Yet another bowling change from Joe Root, who brings himself on to replace Jimmy Anderson. The umpires may have told him it’s too dark for the pace bowlers. Another maiden from Root, who even tries a bouncer with his last delivery. This game is done. New Zealand deserve their series victory after a thoroughly heroic rearguard. 119th over: New Zealand 248-7 (Sodhi 48, Wagner 7) Leach has switched around the wicket to Wagner, with seven men and Bairstow around the bat. England no longer look like taking a wicket, I’m afraid, and Wagner serenely plays out another over from Leach. He has made seven not out from 87 balls. 118th over: New Zealand 248-7 (Sodhi 48, Wagner 7) James Anderson goes to the well one last time, replacing Dawid Malan. He gets some inswing to Sodhi, who continues to defend as if a series victory depended on it. A maiden. Four overs to go. 117th over: New Zealand 248-7 (Sodhi 48, Wagner 7) Broad off, Leach on. Wagner survives a desperate LBW appeal from the first ball of the over. England have no reviews left, though it was missing leg stump anyway. Another maiden. This is an immense rearguard from Sodhi and Wagner. 116th over: New Zealand 248-7 (Sodhi 48, Wagner 7) Malan continues to Wagner, who looks so calm despite all the pressure. After five defensive strokes, he pushes a single off the last delivery to keep the strike. Six overs remaining. 115th over: New Zealand 247-7 (Sodhi 48, Wagner 6) Stokes is replaced by Stuart Broad, so there’s still no sign of Jimmy Anderson. Sodhi pushes a short ball desperately close to Stoneman, who is on his knees at short leg. He moved his hands up instinctively and couldn’t then get them down in time as the ball died on him. Had he stayed low he would probably have taken the catch. 114th over: New Zealand 247-7 (Sodhi 48, Wagner 6) And now for something completely different: the part-time legspinner Dawid Malan is coming into the attack. He has five men and the keeper around the bat for Wagner, who is beaten outside off stump by a brilliant googly. It’s yet another maiden, the 41st of the innings. New Zealand are eight overs from glory. That’s one word for it. 113th over: New Zealand 247-7 (Sodhi 48, Wagner 6) No joy for Stokes, who tries both over and around the wicket to Sodhi. It’s been an immense performance from Sodhi, who has 48 not out from 138 balls. He is hit on the thumb by the last delivery and receives a bit of treatment between overs. 112th over: New Zealand 247-7 (Sodhi 48, Wagner 6) In this situation, and for different reasons, I’d like to see Anderson, Broad, Stokes, Leach, Wood and Malan have a bowl. Why can’t Joe Root just bowl absolutely everyone? The man who is actually bowling is Broad. Wagner flicks to fine leg for four and fends a brutish short ball to safety on the leg side. Another one goes by. New Zealand are so close to a landmark series win. 111th over: New Zealand 243-7 (Sodhi 48, Wagner 2) Ben Stokes comes into the attack for the first time today. The weather is holding up, with the sun reappearing overhead. Sodhi survives an LBW shout - too high - and that’s about it. A maiden from Stokes. There are a maximum olf 11 overs remaining. 110th over: New Zealand 243-7 (Sodhi 48, Wagner 2) Wagner has made two runs from 57 balls - not quite Geoff Allott, but still pretty special in the circumstances. Sodhi gets away with another false stroke, fencing a short ball from Broad just over the head of Wood in a deepish slip position. He is still to look a bit tired mentally. What a match this has been. 109th over: New Zealand 242-7 (Sodhi 47, Wagner 2) Jack Leach is on, with Wagner on strike. He is beaten on the inside by a big-spinning delivery that hits him on the body, and then survives an optimistic LBW appeal after padding up. It was missing off stump, though England have no reviews left anyway. “It’s a theory of mine that for a captain to succeed over the long-term, he needs to quickly identify a core group of 5-6 players that he can rely on for the entire duration of his captaincy,” says Kandukuru Nagarjun. “The great (Imran, Ranatunga, Ganguly, Chappelli, Lloyd, Border, Taylor) and the good (Morgan, Ponting, Waugh, Sammy) seem to have done this. In his year in charge, Root hasn’t been able to do that. With the exception of Bairstow, there’s no one you might say can be relied upon for the next five years. Not even Stokes, for obvious reasons. Woakes and Wood may have regressed. None of the batsmen has really kicked on. So whether Root has any talent for captaincy or not, I fear his era won’t be a notable success.” Yes, I’d agree with that. You would hope he’ll be able to depend on Hameed and Stokes, but that’s still not really a spine. It feels like England have been in transition for about four years, and there’s no sign of that ending. 108th over: New Zealand 242-7 (Sodhi 47, Wagner 2) Stuart Broad replaces Jack Leach. England are overdoing the short stuff a little; almost every delivery is back of a length. When Broad does pitch it up, Sodhi edges a loose drive over the slips for four. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: acccccccccccccccccccccccccch! 107th over: New Zealand 238-7 (Sodhi 43, Wagner 2) A lifter from Wood finds the shoulder of Sodhi’s bat, with the ball looping agonisingly over gully for a single. Wood has not had much luck in this spell. That’s drinks, which means there are a maximum of 15 overs remaining. But it’s getting a lot darker. 106th over: New Zealand 237-7 (Sodhi 42, Wagner 2) For the first time in the innings, Leach has a full over at Wagner. After some good defensive strokes, Wagner is beaten by the final delivery. A maiden. 105th over: New Zealand 237-7 (Sodhi 42, Wagner 2) The light is still fine - everyone thought we’d be off by now - and Wood has switched ends. Sodhi fences a snorter just past the diving Anderson at gully. I think he got his fingers to it. Root is literally on his knees at silly point, trying to get as low as possible so that he can dive onto the pitch if necessary. There are 16 overs remaining. 104th over: New Zealand 235-7 (Sodhi 41, Wagner 1) Root rushes through an over to Wagner, presumably so that Leach can change ends. Sodhi and Wagner look exasperatingly comfortable. “One quick question: obviously it’s not been a great winter with batting failures and an over-reliance on two ageing bowlers (actually, just one, really),” says David Horn. “How should we evaluate Joe Root’s captaincy in this context? He’s not got a great team, but it doesn’t look like he’s got the best out of them either.” He’s had some nice, eye-catching fields but this still doesn’t feel like his team and I’m still not sure what type of captain he is. I think he’s done okay. It feels like he’s still learning, and that we’re still learning about him. 103rd over: New Zealand 235-7 (Sodhi 41, Wagner 1) A maiden from Leach to Sodhi, who looks almost immovable. 102nd over: New Zealand 235-7 (Sodhi 41, Wagner 1) Wood has given everything today. I still think he could pitch it up a bit more but he has been sharp and menacing. Wagner cuts into the off side and turns down a run. New Zealand have decided that Sodhi will take the spin and Wagner the pace. GET BEN STOKES ON. PLEASE. 101st over: New Zealand 235-7 (Sodhi 41, Wagner 1) Leach replaces Root and induces a wild, weird hack at fresh air from Sodhi. “Where did that come from?” says the commentator Ian Smith. Another maiden. “Coming towards the end of the (winter) season and they’ve been working you hard,” says Brian Withington. “Any chance you’ve lined yourself up a bit of R’nR’? Maybe a spot of care-taking at an out of season mountain hotel somewhere remote - put the finishing touches to that novel you’ve been planning? Just watch out for twins cycling down the corridors (and leave the axe behind).” This will be me at around 9pm tonight. 100th over: New Zealand 235-7 (Sodhi 41, Wagner 1) Sodhi flicks Wood just wide of the diving Vince at square leg; then Wagner fences just short of Cook at silly point. Ach! The clouds are starting to gather again. England are running out of time. 99th over: New Zealand 234-7 (Sodhi 40, Wagner 1) Joe Root replaces Jack Leach and starts with a couple of poor deliveries that Sodhi slaps for four. Not a great over, all told. 98th over: New Zealand 225-7 (Sodhi 31, Wagner 1) This is a bit one-dimensional from Wood, with lots of short balls, but it’s threatening nonetheless. Wagner fends a nasty delivery short of the man at short leg and drops the next ball short of silly point. Well batted. 97th over: New Zealand 225-7 (Sodhi 31, Wagner 1) England would like to have Leach bowling at Wagner rather than Sodhi, who is playing him excellently. Sodhi takes a single off the fourth ball and Wagner comfortably survives the last two deliveries. I’m really surprised England haven’t tried Ben Stokes, even with his dodgy back. This situation is crying out for his force of personality. 96th over: New Zealand 223-7 (Sodhi 30, Wagner 0) This is a zesty spell from Wood, who pins Wagner on the shoulder with a terrific short ball. Another maiden. “Miller’s Crossing contains enough wisdom to apply to every situation in life,” says Phil Podolsky. “‘Do you always know why you do things, Leo?’ - I’ve been thinking about that line for years now. The simple Leo always knows why he does everything he does; Tom, who knows all the angles and plays, is aware that his motivations are more complex than he can articulate, at least before he analyses his actions with the benefit of hindsight. I mean, beautiful.” 95th over: New Zealand 223-7 (Sodhi 30, Wagner 0) There are a possible 27 overs remaining, though we won’t get all of those because of the light. Leach has switched over the wicket to Sodhi, who is beaten by a nice delivery and then sweeps firmly for four. Leach moves back over the wicket for the last two balls; Sodhi blocks. He has played so well. 94th over: New Zealand 219-7 (Sodhi 26, Wagner 0) The new batsman is Neil Wagner, who digs out a cracking yorker first ball. A wicket maiden from Wood. When de Grandhomme was caught, he whacked his bat into the ground in frustration. Got him! Mark Wood has struck with the second ball of a new spell! Colin de Grandhomme was suckered into a hook that he top-edged towards fine leg, where Jack Leach took a calm low catch. That’s a dreadful shot from de Grandhomme, who had defended so well, and England have fresh hope. 93rd over: New Zealand 219-6 (de Grandhomme 45, Sodhi 26) A maiden from Leach to the strokeless Sodhi. This is an outstanding defensive innings. 92nd over: New Zealand 219-6 (de Grandhomme 45, Sodhi 26) de Grandhomme pulls smoothly for four to bring up an admirable fifty partnership, and top-edges another pull for four next ball. England are struggling. Surely it’s time to bring Ben Stokes on and tell him to write his own script. Broad tries a bit of leg theory to Sodhi, who flicks loosely outside leg stump and survives an appeal for caught behind. England are going to risk their last review. I think this is more out of desperation than expectation. Yes, he missed it by a mile. England are all out of reviews. 91st over: New Zealand 210-6 (de Grandhomme 37, Sodhi 25) Jack Leach replaces James Anderson, who has the usual immaculate figures: 25-7-37-1. England will hope the new ball bounces more than usual for Leach. But his first over is blocked calmly by de Grandhomme, who seems to have morphed into Trevor Franklin. 90th over: New Zealand 210-6 (de Grandhomme 37, Sodhi 25) Broad continues to the dogged Sodhi, who flicks off the pads for four. Nah, it’s not happening. “Perhaps a drawn game, either through lack of wickets or bad light, would be in the best medium- to long-term terms interests of the England team,” says Jason Ali. “Individuals and organizations only instigate major change when the pain they are experiencing is so intense they are crying. My feeling is that a victory in this Test would lead to those in charge going ‘things are not too bad’, thus we’ll very likely end with more of the same for the coming 12 months. Losing two away series would necessarily force people to take stock.” I take your point but I’m not sure it would. They have been pretty slow to react to the failings of the last few years. I think it will take a home series defeat (maybe to India this summer) for major change to occur. 89th over: New Zealand 206-6 (de Grandhomme 37, Sodhi 21) The light is fine, for now, but England have not looked like taking a wicket with the second new ball. I would get Leach and Stokes on. “ACA have referred to the Australian cricketers’ ‘extraordinary contrition’ and that they should get their bans reduced,” says Ian Forth. “This reminds me of John Turturro in Miller’s Crossing. ‘All I have to do is blub and you won’t kill me’.” Look into your heart, Cricket Australia! 88th over: New Zealand 204-6 (de Grandhomme 35, Sodhi 21) de Grandhomme clouts a pull for four off Broad to bring up the 200. England need to change something. If I were idly trying to tempt fate, I’d probably suggest they will never, ever take another wicket in Test cricket, ever. 87th over: New Zealand 199-6 (de Grandhomme 30, Sodhi 21) Good judgement from de Grandhomme, who leaves a ball from Anderson that bounces just over off stump. Just a single from the over. These two batsmen look very comfortable. “Well,” says Adam Hirst, “I suppose a damp squib finish would be a massive improvement on the rest of the winter. Huzzah!” 86th over: New Zealand 198-6 (de Grandhomme 29, Sodhi 21) There’s very little happening for Anderson and Broad. It might not be long before Joe Root goes back to Jack Leach. I’d be tempted to give Ben Stokes a burst off the short run. “Mac Millings missed Peter Sleep,” says Kandukuru Nagarjun. “Maybe the Australian spinner of the late ‘80s was too prosaic for Mac, but he could bat at 10 in the XI.” 85th over: New Zealand 197-6 (de Grandhomme 28, Sodhi 21) England appeal unsuccessfully for a catch down the leg side when Sodhi flicks at Anderson. There was a noise but replays confirm it was ball on pad. There’s a short break in play while Sodhi has treatment to his arm, where he was hit by Broad in the previous over. This is becoming very frustrating for England. In other news, here’s some other news. 84th over: New Zealand 196-6 (de Grandhomme 27, Sodhi 21) Stuart Broad replaces Mark Wood. His first ball is flicked fine for four by Sodhi, who then wears a short ball on the arm. He is playing a gem of an innings. It’s worth repeating that New Zealand haven’t won a series against England since 1999, and they haven’t won one at home since 1983-84. This is kind of a big deal. 83rd over: New Zealand 192-6 (de Grandhomme 27, Sodhi 17) James Anderson’s second ball after tea is a cracker that beats Ish Sodhi’s reverse curtain rail. There’s still no sign of movement, though, which will annoy England like a dodgy espresso. One from the over. “In 30 years of watching, listening to and playing cricket, I had never heard of cow corner until today,” says Matt Deasey. “It’s a marvellous name, any idea how I could not be aware of it?” Absolutely none. You’re welcome! The Mac Millings XI “My goodness, Rob, you’ve been putting in quite the very many shifts lately - how do you do it?” sniffs Mac Millings. “Now, I’m not one to try and undermine you, but (by mere coincidence) here is my All-time You Are Feeling Very Sleepy XI. I must be tired, too - one of them’s not even a cricketer! Nick GoodKnight Zzzzzaheer Abbas Inzamam-ul-Knaqered Exhausted Dexter Faf Duvet Plessis Harry “Forty” Winks VVS Relaxman Listless Ames Snoreman Cowans George Pillohmann Alan Mullullaby.” That’s one of the great Millings XIs. But after the way he batted before tea, Sluggish Sodhi won’t be happy to miss out.

The code you need is RZIFESUJ. 82nd over: New Zealand 191-6 (de Grandhomme 27, Sodhi 16) Crikey, Mark Wood is going to continue with the new ball ahead of Stuart Broad. That’s quite a decision from Joe Root. Sodhi gets away with a leading edge from a very full delivery before de Grandhomme pumps a drive through mid-off for four. Surely Broad will replace Wood after tea. That’s the end of a fascinating afternoon session, and an increasingly frustrating one for England. With the light closing in, they don’t have long left to win this match. See you in 15 minutes for the last session of this long, life-affirming winter. 81st over: New Zealand 184-6 (de Grandhomme 23, Sodhi 13) James Anderson takes the second new ball. There’s not much sign of movement in his first over, which is defended comfortably by de Grandhomme and Sodhi. 80th over: New Zealand 182-6 (de Grandhomme 22, Sodhi 12) Wood bowls around the wicket to Sodhi with the funkiest of fields: two men at gully, leg slip, leg gully, short leg, short square leg and short midwicket. Sodhi jumps inside the line of the short stuff and digs out the yorkers. Well played. A maiden, and time for the second new ball. There are seven or eight minutes until tea. I think this is slipping away from England. 79th over: New Zealand 182-6 (de Grandhomme 22, Sodhi 12) This is horrible for England, because they don’t know how much time they have left. A race against time is nerve-racking enough without time playing silly buggers. JUST GIVE IT TO US STRAIGHT, TIME: HOW LONG IS LEFT? Leach replaces Root and rushes through a forgettable maiden to de Grandhomme. After a loose start, de Grandhomme is winning the battle to control his baser attacking instincts. 78th over: New Zealand 182-6 (de Grandhomme 22, Sodhi 12) Wood continues. I would bowl Leach here, purely to save time and get to the new ball. At least Wood comes off a short run. Sodhi fences a good delivery not far wide of Stoneman at short leg. Ach, this is turning into a really frustrating period for England. “After the pain and suffering of this winter/summer tour (depending where I happen to be) it will be a relief to get this over with,” says Jeremy Bunting. “Two rather dull questions to you: is Leach a discovery or just overlooked? And (a chance for you to rant) surely there is too much International cricket with its commercialisation and money-grabbing. How can England be successful if they are knackered?” Yes, everyone knows the schedule is a scandal. No time for ranting, there’s a light meter to scrutinise! Leach is a slightly complicated case; he would probably have played earlier – or at least been in the squad – but for the doubts over his action. It’s been an encouraging debut and he should start the next Test against Pakistan, though England will also consider Moeen Ali’s excellent home record. 77th over: New Zealand 177-6 (de Grandhomme 18, Sodhi 11) Some clouds are starting to gather, which is not remotely good news for England. They need to get to the new ball as soon as possible. Root is running back to his mark after every delivery. Bumble, on commentary, reckons England will get no more than 10 overs with the new ball because of bad light. 76th over: New Zealand 176-6 (de Grandhomme 17, Sodhi 11) Neil Wagner is padded up, which suggests Tim Southee might not be fit to bat. He was suffering with a virus yesterday. Mark Wood, meanwhile, replaces Jack Leach and is pulled round the corner for a single by de Grandhomme. Sodhi then digs out a lovely yorker. Four overs until the second new ball. 75th over: New Zealand 174-6 (de Grandhomme 16, Sodhi 10) This is good stuff from Root, who turns one past the inside edge to hit de Grandhomme on the pad. England go up for LBW but he was outside the line. A maiden. These are almost bonus overs for England, so quickly is Root bowling them, because we know time will catch up with England at some stage in the evening session if the match is still going on. 74th over: New Zealand 174-6 (de Grandhomme 16, Sodhi 10) Leach beats Sodhi with a gorgeous delivery from around the wicket that curves in and spits away off the pitch. “That is a NUT!” says one of the England fielders, Bairstow I think. 73rd over: New Zealand 172-6 (de Grandhomme 16, Sodhi 8) There are 49 overs remaining, though we probably won’t get all of them in. Root, who is running back to his mark between deliveries, bowls an over to Sodhi in double-quick time. 72nd over: New Zealand 171-6 (de Grandhomme 16, Sodhi 7) Replays confirm that my eyes are knackered: that delivery from Root to Sodhi was missing leg stump and bouncing over. Leach hurries through another over. He and Root are threatening to take wickets and hurrying England to the second new ball. 71st over: New Zealand 169-6 (de Grandhomme 14, Sodhi 7) Root appeals unsuccessfully for LBW and a bat-pad catch in the same delivery to Sodhi. The LBW shout looked really good to my knackered eyes, but England chose not to review. 70th over: New Zealand 165-6 (de Grandhomme 14, Sodhi 3) Sodhi is dropped by Stoneman at silly point, a sharp chance off a leading edge. He has missed a few chances in this innings. Leach is bowling nicely - this has been a really promising debut - and his last ball to Sodhi is inside-edged just wide of leg stump. “Afternoon Rob,” says Phil Withall. “I’ve been on hold to my work’s IT department for 18 minutes so far and have used that time to work out that Anderson, Muralitharan, Kumble and Warne have bowled enough deliveries to complete 288 full days of Test cricket or, to put it another way, 57 Tests. Remarkable achievement.” 69th over: New Zealand 162-6 (de Grandhomme 14, Sodhi 0) A maiden from Root to de Grandhomme. 68th over: New Zealand 162-6 (de Grandhomme 14, Sodhi 0) Those who remember the nightmare of Danny Morrison will not be counting poultry, but England have a great chance of winning this game. The new batsman is Ish Sodhi rather than Tim Southee, presumably because of his superior defensive awareness. Jack Leach has taken a huge wicket! He switched ends and struck with his third ball when Latham top-edged a sweep towards deep backward square leg, where James Vince charged in and dived forward to take a superb low catch. 67th over: New Zealand 162-5 (Latham 83, de Grandhomme 14) Thanks Tom, hello everyone. On the 35th day of a long Test-match winter, England may finally be about to win a game. They need five more wickets and will have a new ball in 13 overs’ time. Joe Root is coming into the attack after the drinks break. His first ball is a beauty that gates de Grandhomme and bounces over the top of off stump; de Grandhomme responds by scrunching a boundary through the covers. There is plenty of rough for Root outside off stump, and another sharply spun delivery brings an unsuccessful appeal for LBW. That’s a very encouraging start from Root. 66th over: New Zealand 156-5 (Latham 83, De Grandhomme 10; target 382). Wood continues his line of attack at Latham - short-ish and round the wicket, and the batsman continues to fend him off or duck the bouncers. There’s a bit more variable bounce out there now, mind. Another maiden and that’s drinks. And with that, I shall hand you over to Rob Smyth, who will describe the remainder of England’s winter. Thanks for your company and comments. Bye. 65th over: New Zealand 156-5 (Latham 83, De Grandhomme 10; target 382). Another slightly iffy shot from De Grandhomme, driving uppishly at Leach but being slightly foxed by the spin out of the rough and slicing through the vacant gully region. Another good over from Leach. 64th over: New Zealand 154-5 (Latham 83, De Grandhomme 8; target 382). Wood continues to probe away at Latham with that slanted round-the-wicket angle, but the opener has answered every question put before him today, and continues to do so here. A maiden. 63rd over: New Zealand 154-5 (Latham 83, De Grandhomme 8; target 382). The expected reversion to spin sees Leach return to the attack, and De Grandhomme offers up a half-chance with a sliced drive that lands just - just - in front of the man at point, who I think is Root. You’d have to give that as an opportunity not taken though. 62nd over: New Zealand 152-5 (Latham 83, De Grandhomme 6; target 382). We’ve had no spin in this session yet, but Wood’s brought his own variety (and, of course, a wicket) and he continues for now. De Grandhomme isn’t one to hold back though, and a controlled pull brings him a single that takes the hosts to 150. Latham’s legside flick then adds another two to the total. 61st over: New Zealand 149-5 (Latham 81, De Grandhomme 5; target 382). Anderson charges in at Latham with an assertive offside-heavy field, and a rare-as-hen’s-teeth half-volley is punished with a perfectly timed cover drive for four. He’ll deserve a hundred. 60th over: New Zealand 145-5 (Latham 77, De Grandhomme 5; target 382). Another worrying moment for New Zealand as Wood’s ferocious short ball is gloved up in the air by Latham but it sails beyond Bairstow and lands safely. They run three. Wood goes round the wicket at the right-handed De Grandhomme, who turns one away for another single. Latham picks up another single. It’s an untypically expensive over, not that that matters massively, as it was a decent one that kept both batsmen on their toes. 59th over: New Zealand 140-5 (Latham 73, De Grandhomme 4; target 382). The Sky team were just comparing Latham’s rearguard here with Matt Prior’s draw-salvaging one in Auckland five years ago before Watling’s wicket fell, and you can certainly see him still at the crease at the end, in one circumstance or another. Latham adds another to his total with a push to extra-cover. Anderson rounds off a decent over with a quicker ball that almost gets past De Grandhomme’s bottom edge. 58th over: New Zealand 139-5 (Latham 72, De Grandhomme 4; target 382). Wood replaces Broad and serenades Watling with some chin music straight away - well, six-inches-above-his-head music to be strictly accurate. But his willingness to mix it up reaps dividends when he induces a reckless flick to legslip from Watling, stepping outside off, to end the partnership. That was a bit of a brain-fade in any circumstances. De Grandhomme is promptly off the mark with a four. Watling falls into Wood’s trap, making room outside off-stump and flicking it to Anderson at leg slip. It’s a much-needed breakthrough for England and another fateful moment of sloppiness from the hosts. 57th over: New Zealand 135-4 (Latham 72, Watling 19; target 382). It’s not quite happening for England in this session yet – not that Broad and Anderson are doing much wrong (though they’re not finding the sought-after zinger), it’s just that Latham and Watling are coping comfortably, more so than New Zealand have at any point in this innings. Another maiden from Anderson, his seventh. 56th over: New Zealand 135-4 (Latham 72, Watling 19; target 382). Latham comes perilously close to playing the sort of uppish lazy legside clip that did for Raval first up, but his timing and placement are better and he gets three instead. Watling then produces a shot of the day contender, meeting a full delivery with a pitch-perfect straight drive down the ground for four. Fun fact: the last ball of the last over took Jimmy Anderson to the highest total of legitimate deliveries in Test cricket delivered by any seamer. 55th over: New Zealand 128-4 (Latham 69, Watling 15; target 382). Latham unfurls a neatly timed back-foot drive through the covers off Anderson for three. Jimmy’s getting some good reverse now but Watling’s defences are up to it. In the background, three sunbathing England supporters on the grass banks appear to be fast asleep. If I can stay awake here in cold wet London, they can. 54th over: New Zealand 125-4 (Latham 67, Watling 15; target 382). It’ll be the old firm initially in this session, with Broad resuming at the other end. His first ball is just a fraction wayward and Latham duly nudges it to fine leg for a single. It’s not quite as on the money, this over, as Broad was earlier in the day but he still looks likely to make stuff happen. 53rd over: New Zealand 124-4 (Latham 65, Watling 15; target 382). Anderson returns to the attack, and gives Watling a bit of a hurry-up by jagging his third ball into the batsman’s midriff in a tight maiden that Watling is happy to defend. It’s still bright and sunny in Christchurch but those overs will still need to be got through at a fair old lick. Cricket is about to happen again. A lunchtime email from Sachin Paul, on England’s bowling stocks: “For me, Wood just doesn’t do enough for a third seamer. See the role Cummins or Morkel play in the other test that’s going on. If we are to go back to anything resembling our glory days of the Strauss era, we need a Bresnan-like container in there.” To be fair, injuries have always denied Wood a decent run of matches, and you might have hoped Woakes would be that container after his stellar summer in 2016 but he’s struggled away from home in particular since then. I like Wood think we can expect a few more debutants in that role in the coming months (my own big hope, and I have a county-based bias on this I admit, is Jamie Porter). 52nd over: New Zealand 124-4 (Latham 65, Watling 15; target 382). Wood bowls the last over before the break, round the wicket again and straight and true at the left-handed Latham, but the New Zealand opener has been near-flawless this morning while watching some of his colleagues get out to poor shots. He dabs a short ball outside off-stump down past backward point for two and deserves to make it through the session unbeaten. New Zealand’s survival hopes may rest on him. England might have wanted one or two more wickets after such a sensational start, but they’re handily placed nonetheless, and have bowled well. Right well those of you in New Zealand amble off for a cold beer or some such, I’m off for a cup of tea and a biscuit. See you for the afternoon session. 51st over: New Zealand 122-4 (Latham 63, Watling 15; target 382). Runs! Some of your actual The Queen’s Runs, Watling clipping Stokes through midwicket for two. The remainder of the over is accurate and varied and gets the respectful dot balls it merits. 50th over: New Zealand 120-4 (Latham 63, Watling 13; target 382). Ever since I said New Zealand might exceed 100 runs in this session they’ve stopped scoring, Latham opting for blocks and leaves off Wood, who’s extracting some presentable pace and bounce. There’s a sense this is just winding down for lunch at the moment. 49th over: New Zealand 120-4 (Latham 63, Watling 13; target 382). England could do with another wicket before lunch, and Root brings Ben Stokes on to see if that might do the trick, as it so often has before. He starts with a maiden, but a so-so one, as maidens go. He finds reverse swing but not pinpoint accuracy. 48th over: New Zealand 120-4 (Latham 63, Watling 13; target 382). The Barmy Army trumpeter serenades Wood with the Blaydon Races as the Durham man charges in, switching to around the wicket at Latham and inducing an uncertain edge with one that jags away from him just a fraction. It doesn’t carry to slip though. It’s the highlight of another good over, which is a maiden. 47th over: New Zealand 120-4 (Latham 63, Watling 13; target 382). A rare loose over from Leach, and more productive sweeping from Latham, this one down to fine leg and fumbled over the ropes for four. Another single puts Watling on strike, and he too finds the boundary, piercing the field with a square cut. 46th over: New Zealand 111-4 (Latham 58, Watling 9; target 382). Mark Wood gets his first bowl of the day, and begins with a bouncer at Watling. He then has a vigorous lbw shout after swinging one into the right-hander’s pads but it was going down legside. A decent first over, and a maiden. 45th over: New Zealand 111-4 (Latham 58, Watling 9; target 382). Latham can sweep to all areas, and he takes Leach on with a sweep beyond wide mid-on for four before being slightly taken aback by some low bounce to one outside off-stump that thuds his shins. England post another man out on the sweep, Stoneman at deep square leg, but Latham sees out the over. New Zealand have a decent chance of scoring more than 100 in this session, which is quite sprightly for an expected last-day dig-in. But they’ve lost four wickets of course. 44th over: New Zealand 107-4 (Latham 54, Watling 9; target 382). Watling’s flick to square leg off Anderson is misfielded, which enables the batsmen to rotate the strike for the first time in a while. Latham rotates it again with a nudge off his slips for one more, to ensure he continues to monopolise Leach’s attentions at the other end. “That stat about Jimmy got me thinking about the best Test bowing records after 32,” continues Tom Bowtell. “Turns out Jimmy’s only 12th in the list, but he pretty much matches Ambrose and McGrath, which supports his case for being a late-career great. Sir Richard Hadlee’s figures after 32 are ridiculous.” It is indeed easy to forget that much of the first half of Anderson’s career was spent discussing the “good Jimmy/bad Jimmy” dichotomy. 43rd over: New Zealand 105-4 (Latham 53, Watling 8; target 382). Review! Big shout for leg-before from Leach as he pins Latham in front with one that drifts back considerably. And England send it upstairs. But ball-tracking shows it going down leg comfortably. Bairstow looked to be the most voluble advocate for that decision - will it come back to haunt him, and England? A maiden. 42nd over: New Zealand 105-4 (Latham 53, Watling 8; target 382). It suddenly feels like you can’t mention reverse-swing without prompting the world to clutch it pearls, but it’s beginning to be in evidence here, though Watling is able to deal with it when Anderson over-pitches, clipping a fine boundary through the onside. 41st over: New Zealand 101-4 (Latham 53, Watling 4; target 382). A rare edgy moment for Latham against spin as he thick-edges a fine ball from Leach just wide of Stoneman short leg, who dives the wrong way. Latham is then beaten outside off-stump by a beauty. This is what you want to see though - a front-line spinner bowling to attacking fields. 40th over: New Zealand 99-4 (Latham 52, Watling 3; target 382). So Anderson gets another go at Watling – who he dismissed in the first innings with his best ball of the whole winter - and manages to still find enough movement both ways to keep him honest. An uncertain flick of a full-length delivery for two is the only scoring stroke of the over. 39th over: New Zealand 97-4 (Latham 52, Watling 1; target 382). Leach v Latham is shaping up to be a defining battle of the day - perhaps the defining one. The former is finding more unpredictable turn now while the latter has looked the most accomplished player of spin, and he demonstrates the fact by bringing up his 50 with a firm sweep to the deep square leg boundary for four. Watling gets off the mark with a push to mid-on. 38th over: New Zealand 91-4 (Latham 46, Watling 0; target 382). A change of ends for Anderson, who come on for Root. Latham takes a flicked single on the legside, before a similar nudge off his hips brings Nicholls two. But Nicholls lets himself down with a loose drive to Cook at slip to give Anderson his first wicket of the innings. Watling comes in – he held it together for New Zealand in the first innings; can he do so again? Anderson returns and strikes! Slanting one away from Nicholls, who edges a lazy drive to Cook at slip. 37th over: New Zealand 88-3 (Latham 46, Nicholls 11; target 382). Leach has a silly mid-off and short leg brought in for Nicholls and gets some decent turn out of the rough into the left-hander. He finds his edge too, though unfortunately for the bowler he doesn’t find Stokes at slip, who’s a fraction slow onto it and it runs away for two. But that was an extremely good over, probably Leach’s best yet, so no cause for despondency. All gone a bit quiet on the email front: has everyone piled round John Starbuck’s to tuck into his Talisker? 36th over: New Zealand 86-3 (Latham 46, Nicholls 9; target 382). Nicholls carves out another couple off Root, who’s not yet asking enormously fiendish questions of the batsmen but is keeping them honest enough. England hurrying through the overs here, which slightly raises faint hopes of getting through all our outstanding overs today. 35th over: New Zealand 83-3 (Latham 46, Nicholls 6; target 382). Latham gets forward and sweeps Leach emphatically over square leg for four and ends the over with a well-judged cut past backward point for another boundary - he’s looked confident against spin. Latham could be the key man here. 34th over: New Zealand 75-3 (Latham 38, Nicholls 6; target 382). Iffy finger or no, Root brings himself on, to give us spin at both ends. It’s accurate enough, if less threatening than Leach, though Nicholls can get off the mark with a two thanks to a misfield at point, and then follows it with a square cut for four, punishing the one really bad ball of the over. 33rd over: New Zealand 69-3 (Latham 38, Nicholls 0; target 382). Leach, buoyed by becoming the first English bowler under 30 to take a wicket in this match, continues, and he’s got his pecker up now, finding those rough-ish areas outside the left-hander’s off-stump. They don’t do anything dramatic but force Latham to be cautious and defensive, especially when the last two balls of the over shoot up at him and with greater pace. Good stuff. 32nd over: New Zealand 69-3 (Latham 38, Nicholls 0; target 382). This is still looking like a new-ball spell from Broad, movement and swing aplenty. Latham’s trying to push the score along though, taking two followed by a hurried and risky single that is almost punished by the sub fielder Livingstone (on for Cook). “Evening Tom.” Morning Tom Bowtell. “It’s been great to see Broad roar back in this Test. Here’s some more encouragement for him/hope for England fans: Broad’s currently 31 and 282 days old. Since he was 31 and 282 days old himself, Jimmy Anderson has taken 187 Test wickets at 21.31.” The question of whom Broad might bowl in tandem with once Anderson’s gone remains unanswered mind. 31st over: New Zealand 66-3 (Latham 35, Nicholls 0; target 382). Leach induces a slightly risky uppish sweep on the legside from Taylor but it drops safely and brings a single. Latham sweeps more convincingly for another, but Taylor’s not reading the spinner half as well and perishes, caught at square-leg by Cook. The left-handed Nicholls comes in and fends off a good final ball of the over. A much better over from the Somerset man. Jack Leach has his first Test wicket. Taylor sweeping unconvincingly into the hands of Cook at square leg. England are purring. 30th over: New Zealand 64-2 (Latham 34, Taylor 12; target 382). Broad continues, and continues to look fired up, but Latham is careful and watchful. A fine over, and a maiden. Michael Atherton makes the point that England’s five slips, which are shorn of Joe Root due to his finger problems, do look absurdly close together and that the slip cordon has chopped and changed a fair bit over the winter. 29th over: New Zealand 64-2 (Latham 34, Taylor 12; target 382). Leach gets brought into the action early, replacing Anderson, and his first ball, short outside off, gets the treatment from Latham - a square cut for four. Another push brings two. There are close catchers in behind the stumps and on the legside but space on the off, which enables the opener to add another single. A bit of a warm-up of an over there, but we’ve a long day ahead. Possibly. 28th over: New Zealand 57-2 (Latham 27, Taylor 12; target 382). Broad jags a shortish ball back into Latham who does well to nudge it away square on the legside for a single. And then … ANOTHER DROP: Taylor pushes hard at one outside off and edges it low to Vince at third slip. It’s not an easy chance but it should have been taken, and it’s two runs instead. And the next one’s four, a decent outswinger thumped through the covers by Taylor to the boundary. Broad is unhappy. This is why AB Parker was taking all sorts of risks back there. It was another good over mind. 27th over: New Zealand 50-2 (Latham 26, Taylor 6; target 382). Latham’s single off Anderson takes New Zealand to 50. Jimmy maintains a probing line and length though there are already worries in the commentary box about the state of his shoulder. One more day to go … 26th over: New Zealand 49-2 (Latham 25, Taylor 6; target 382). Broad is accurate again, and there’s no question now that this is going to be purely a game of attack against defence from hereon in. There’s zip, there’s bounce, there’s accuracy. But Taylor’s an assured opponent and he gets off the mark with an effortless push down the ground for four, only for Broad to come back at him with a beautiful away swinger that Taylor gets nowhere near. A tentative squirt on the legside for two completes another excellent over. 25th over: New Zealand 43-2 (Latham 25, Taylor 0; target 382). Anderson opens up at the other end, to five slips for the left-handed Latham, as England scent further blood. He starts with a no-ball but other than that finds some decent movement in the air and off the seam, and some bounce too. And there’s just the one run from the over. “Game over,” roars AB Parker, making himself personally responsible should England fail. “Game. Set. Match. Broad is awesome.” 24th over: New Zealand 42-2 (Latham 25, Taylor 0; target 382). Broad gets first use of the ball and delivers a staggering opening, taking wickets with a bad ball and a belter with the first two deliveries of the day. Taylor dabs away the hat-trick ball and sees out the over. “Are you and Rob and everyone else going to have an End of Tour party, even if it’s only virtual?” asks John Starbuck, standing on the virtual doorstep pretending to be a mate of the host, “I’m drinking Talisker, if it helps.” Whether that’s a request for someone to get a round in, or a boast, is not clear. Anyway, our party’s started already. And another! Williamson is out first ball, and this one’s a snorter, just back of a length, jagging away via the captain’s edge to the keeper. Stuart Broad is on a hat-trick with the third ball of the day. Astonishing, Broad strikes first ball! And it’s a nothing delivery really - clippable and and on or outside leg-stump, but it’s flicked straight to Stoneman at midwicket, and England have a dream start The players are on their way out … Chris Bates emails from the ground: “Less dew this morning than several other days. Do you know who took the decision not to start half an hour early today? Beggars belief. Surely should have announced an early start and delayed then if necessary. Bearing in mind the clocks went back here at the weekend it would have been the same time start as Friday and Saturday. What’s changed since then? Cricket really appears to be run by complete idiots at times. Anyway enjoying a great time in Christchurch. Fabulous ground so should stop moaning I suppose.” Nah, moaning is the essence of all sport, at scenic grounds and uglier ones alike. And talking of England’s support in New Zealand … My sources in the crowd at Christchurch report: “We are sat on the Grassy bank at Hegley Oval. There is no dew and it’s warm and cloudless at the moment. Crowd is a bit thin and it’s mostly England fans here. Hoping for a good day.” It looks like a nice morning in Christchurch anyhow, from my expert vantage point in front of a screen in That London. Nice enough for them to be playing right now, perhaps, rather than the evening gloom. A chipper Jack Leach, in pre-session TV chat, quips about getting first use of this new-ish ball. He’ll have a role to play certainly, particularly against the left-handers. Anyway, while we wait, here’s Tom vd Gucht: “Bit of a boring cricket based thought I’m afraid, but whilst faffing around during Pointless earlier today, I had a cursory glance at Test debutants from the 00s and the last ten years and was struck by how few of the players selected since 2010 have kicked on to play integral roles in the test side in comparison to the previous decade. “In the 00’s, 18 out of the 44 players given a debut went on to have a substantial Test career of more than 20 Tests (I’ve included Simon Jones and Tim Bresnan as they slipped out of contention due to injuries) whilst only 6 of the 38 selected since 2010 have managed to crack test cricket and two of those have been dropped for this match. “Is it because the selection panel now has too many county stalwarts, like Mick Newell, rewarding county pros who have ‘earned’ their chance based on years of county graft whilst before Fletcher was more interested in whether he felt players had ‘it’ - the indescribable quailities needed to make it at the highest level, spotted in the likes of Tresco. Or were we just lucky to have a rich crop of talent coming through during that period? It seems a bit sad that players with the talent of Morgan and Buttler haven’t kicked on in tests too.” Not sure really. England have had particular problem areas in recent years rather than across-the-board failure, which neither fast-tracked academy youngsters or county stalwarts have cracked - notably opening batsmen and front-line spinners. The question of how much first-class cricket is actually being played, and when and how, seems ever-pertinent. The England twitter feed does its bit to gee people up by invoking one of the finest Tests of this decade: Evening/morning everyone. Welcome to the final day of English cricket’s perpetual winter, and one that presents England with a fighting chance of a first away win since that rather nervy win in Chittagong a year and a half ago, when Gareth Batty, no less, was their leading wicket-taking spinner. The spinner upon whom England will rely to take wickets today is a debutant, though Jack Leach has been due his debut for a while, yet it’s just as likely the tourists will expect a bulky share of today’s heavy lifting to be done by Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson, who have taken all but two of the New Zealand wickets to fall in this series. Though perhaps Ben Stokes might, if possible, pluck something out of the bag, as he did on that last victorious away occasion in Bangladesh. To win this, New Zealand need to surpass their record run-chase, made at Christchurch in 1994 against an attack containing such hapless no-marks as Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram. But an attritional draw will suit them just fine, and that’s probably the likeliest result after yesterday’s truncated final session and the general autumnal vibe about the place. And Hagley Oval – with its kids playing on the outfield during breaks while nerdy adults inspect the wicket, its spectators lounging on grass banks – exudes an unmistakable air of England’s premier autumn-based competition, the County Championship. The pushing of red-ball cricket to the seasonal margins is not just an English phenomenon. Though my co-commentator Smyth did quip earlier that sooner or later Edgbaston will stage a Boxing Day Test, a proposal with possibly alarming commercial potential - a shivering, boozed-up Hollies stand in Santa suits may yet be the future (If anyone from the ECB is reading this, pretend you read none of this). Anyway, play is due to start at 11.30pm British so-called Summer Time (10.30am local time). And an intriguing day awaits. So stay up, snuggle up and go nowhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/02/trump-caravans-migrants-immigration-daca","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T00:27:04Z","webTitle":"Trump claims 'caravans' of migrants in Mexico mean US 'is being stolen'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/02/trump-caravans-migrants-immigration-daca","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/02/trump-caravans-migrants-immigration-daca","fields":{"headline":"Trump claims 'caravans' of migrants in Mexico mean US 'is being stolen'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Mexican government has stopped a caravan of Central American migrants trying to reach the Mexico-US border as their presence in the country brought blistering attacks from the US president, Donald Trump. In a statement issued on Monday night, the interior ministry and foreign relations ministry said the migrants had improperly entered the country and would be subject to administrative procedures. “Under no circumstances does the government of Mexico promote irregular migration,” the statement said. Approximately 400 caravan participants have already been removed from the country, according to the government. Adolfo Flores, a BuzzFeed journalist covering the caravan, reported some of the migrants, such pregnant women and those with disabilities or chronic conditions, might be issued humanitarian visas. Everyone would have 10 days to leave the country or they could request a 30-day stay, during which time they could request permission to remain. Organisers expected some of the participants to continue travelling north, though some would likely apply for asylum in Mexico. Trump returned to the offensive on immigration on Monday, when he repeated a claim that “caravans” of migrants from Central America are threatening to enter the US via Mexico. He also demanded: “Act now Congress, our country is being stolen!” “Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large ‘Caravans’ of people enter their country,” the president tweeted. “They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws. “Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT, but the weak Dem laws don’t allow them to do their job. Act now Congress, our country is being stolen!” Trump’s use of the term “caravans” – also made in a sequence of tweets on Easter Sunday – had been reported on by Fox News, Trump’s preferred cable network. The “nuclear option” he referred to would be a reform of Senate rules to allow major legislation to pass with 51 votes rather than the current 60. The Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has shown no sign of acceding to Trump’s repeated demand. Mexico’s interior minister, Alfonso Navarete Prida, told reporters on Monday: “It is absolutely incorrect to say that there is no effort in Mexico to regulate, support and mange migratory processes.” Flores reported on Friday: “For five days now, hundreds of Central Americans – children, women and men, most of them from Honduras – have boldly crossed immigration checkpoints, military bases, and police in a desperate, sometimes chaotic march toward the United States. Despite their being in Mexico without authorization, no one has made any effort to stop them.” Organisers said some 1,300 people were participating in the caravan. Mexican immigration officials routinely detain and deport hundreds of thousands of Central Americans, who in recent years have streamed north to escape horrific violence in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Mexico deported 16,278 individuals in the first two months of 2018 – 97% of them were Central Americans. The migrants’ paths through Mexico are perilous. Criminal gangs, often acting in cahoots with crooked public officials, prey upon migrants, often extorting them or kidnapping them for ransom. Shelters run the length of the country, offering migrants a place to eat, rest and wash and tend to their wounds as they head north. The operators of these shelters expressed wariness with the caravan currently winding its way through southern Mexico, saying such attempts at moving migrants through Mexico often turn into targets for criminal groups. Jorge Andrade, a spokesman for the shelters, says “polleros” – human smugglers – and other organised crime members have infiltrated previous caravans. People pretending to be migrants, meanwhile, joined in and started extorting actual migrants. “It’s a real logistical challenge, in addition to security questions,” Andrade said. During a 2014 caravan that Andrade accompanied, “we realised that we had been infiltrated by people from organised crime, whom we could identify.” Many of the participants in caravans inevitably are offered humanitarian visas, which allow them to temporarily remain in Mexico, or they file asylum applications. Alex Mensing, project coordinator for Pueblos Sin Fronteras, which was accompanying the caravan, says the shelters in Mexico “do important work and caravan members have benefited from their services”. He added that migrants participating in the caravan would receive legal advice upon reaching the city of Puebla and some would likely seek asylum in Mexico. “The people in the caravan are much, much less vulnerable to human rights abuses,” Mensing said. On Monday, Trump widened his attack, tweeting: “DACA is dead because the Democrats didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon … No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!” Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or Daca, was an Obama-era programme that shielded undocumented migrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers, from the threat of deportation. “The [Trump] attack on Daca was designed to pit Central Americans against Mexicans and to put immigrants in the United States against immigrants who are trying to exercise their right to seek asylum in the the United States,” Mensing said. Trump announced the cancellation of Daca last year. No replacement has been instituted but court orders have maintained protections for recipients. Trump claimed on Sunday that “a lot of people are coming in because they want to take advantage of Daca, and we’re going to have to really see”. In fact, to be eligible for Daca, applicants must have lived in the US continually since 15 June 2007 and come to the country before their 16th birthday. Applicants must also either be in school, or have graduated high school, or have been honourably discharged from the US military or coast guard. Trump’s decision to quash any remaining hopes of a Daca deal drew criticism on Sunday. John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio who is seen as a possible primary challenger to Trump in 2020, tweeted: “A true leader preserves &amp; offers hope, doesn’t take hope from innocent children who call America home. Remember, today is Easter Sunday.” Trump rejected one deal with Democrats that would have funded a border wall, which he promised throughout his campaign for the White House would be paid for by Mexico. He has recently suggested the military could pay for the wall, a prospect experts said was extremely unlikely. Later on Monday, Trump returned to the North American Free Trade Agreement, a favourite target which in his Sunday tweets he had threatened to “stop”. “Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA,” he wrote, adding: “With all of the money they make from the US, hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!” Polls in Mexico show people south of the border support Nafta, but don’t see themselves as big winners from the trade deal, which also includes Canada. Regarding possible motives for Trump’s latest outburst, which also took in Amazon, NBC and CNN, news outlets reported White House sources as saying Trump has been told his base thinks he has softened on immigration. The president has also been beset by damaging stories, from developments in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian election interference and alleged collusion between Trump aides and Moscow, to adult film actor Stormy Daniels’ claim that she had an affair with the billionaire in 2006. Controversies over ethics and spending are affecting members of the Trump administration, including the housing and urban development secretary, Ben Carson, and the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt. On Sunday the former Veterans Affairs secretary David Shulkin told network television he was fired last week, rather than resigning as the White House claimed. Shulkin, who opposed the privatisation of VA operations, blamed political appointees for his downfall."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/02/how-will-we-cope-when-the-last-middle-class-man-slumps-to-the-ground","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T16:35:59Z","webTitle":"How will we cope when the last middle-class man slumps to the ground? | Suzanne Moore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/02/how-will-we-cope-when-the-last-middle-class-man-slumps-to-the-ground","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/02/how-will-we-cope-when-the-last-middle-class-man-slumps-to-the-ground","fields":{"headline":"How will we cope when the last middle-class man slumps to the ground?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The last male northern white rhino died last month, and a memorial was held. David Attenborough spoke about the end of this subspecies. Prince William is prone, like his father, to making pro-rhino speeches. Two female northern white rhinos survive and, with sophisticated IVF methods, it’s possible more will be produced. One can but hope. I imagine it will be like this when the last middle-class man slumps to the ground. Why did we not do more to save this endangered species, we will ask ourselves? Royalty will be shipped in. We thought they would lumber on. We didn’t realise the environment we were forcing them to live in was becoming impossible. How could these creatures even mate after #MeToo? How could they forage for food when women went to work all the time? How could they survive when women demanded to be paid equally, and to not be attacked? The brave ones who feel totally muzzled somehow do manage to speak out occasionally. It is difficult for them, the way they are silenced, even though they have newspaper columns, academic posts, TV and radio programmes. How are they to get a word in? They manage, just about. Up steps the latest victim, poor Niall Ferguson, author, history professor and lover of empire, who wrote in the Sunday Times that he had to endure a “disproportionately vitriolic response” for organising a conference that featured only white male historians. How he has suffered, I can only imagine. Jordan Peterson, another minor academic, became major simply by outlining how wrong we are to talk of the various ways in which western culture has been deemed oppressive to women. Excuse me, but didn’t Camille Paglia do that 20 years ago? To such men, any notion of inclusiveness, or of the dread “diversity”, becomes a threat. The very presence of women, except as tokens, is difficult and somehow invasive for such men. Never mind the debate over trans women in women-only spaces, the issue here is really one of any women at all in any space. The brand of truth-telling these battle-scarred men are revered for situates men as both always naturally in control but as now having to fight for their position. For young men who feel belittled, these guys are heroes. A dodgy reading of history combined with some dubious evolutionary biology is used to justify a strange new phenomenon: victim-envy. Victimhood is now the prize and they will beat off the opposition to claim it. The double bluff is extraordinary. Identity politics is pooh poohed as an Olympics of oppression, yet the suffering of the white man is now the biggest of all. This is the group that shouts loudest about being unable to voice its feelings. The identity politics is certainly succeeding. Steve Bannon understood it well enough to utilise it to help Donald Trump win. Is it any wonder Bannon is also concerned with the power of the #metoo movement? The call to victimhood of this “endangered” species is heard everywhere, from Nigel Farage to John Humphrys to Jeremy Clarkson to Piers Morgan. These men who dare to speak out are everywhere in public life, at the top of every organisation, having meetings about how to employ more women. They are forced into this by Europe, modernity or some godawful HR directive. They like to say they care about FGM or the massacre of the Rohingya, but see complaints about equal access or equal pay as white noise. Their lot is pitiful. How can they flirt, employ the best man for the job or even have a laugh? They are truly victimised and so they call out to each other, these great white males, as if they were on their last legs. Who will help them survive and reproduce? Who will listen to this most downtrodden of all identities? The entire establishment. For they are it. The political nous of remainers remains practically zilch If I wanted to design a political campaign to actively turn off the average punter, or at least make them feel indifferent, who would I cast? Tony Blair, obviously. He can’t go anywhere without being called a war criminal. Then there’s his henchman Alastair Campbell. I might throw in AC Grayling for a bit of arrogance and Nick Clegg for a bit of haplessness. And a lord or two. Adonis maybe. And yet somehow this supergroup are the figureheads for the anti-Brexit lobby. Is it any wonder it’s happening ? I don’t doubt the sincerity of their views, but the tone is completely wrong – the refusal to understand the cultural reasons for the leave vote, the intoning of the economic arguments over and over again, the valorising of an EU that seems happy to see the Catalan president in prison or massive youth unemployment in Italy. The leaders of both our major parties are signed up to Brexit. The Glastonbury crowds who chant “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn” seem neither to know nor care about that part of his agenda. This is a deeply inconvenient truth, but the fact is, if “the youth” have not woken up to that yet, it seems unlikely they will soon. And if they organise, then surely their leaders will not all be guys in their 50s? While every day, remainers laugh, mock and tell us what fools the Brexiters are – and, yes, some are – the political nous of remainers remains practically zilch. Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas always makes good sense to me, but the rest too often appear to be yesterday’s men fighting yesterday’s battles while attempting to stand on a moral high ground that does not exist for them. That ground was exploded in Iraq. They are tied to the past, not the future. In honour of Anna Campbell, and her father The G2 interview with Dirk Campbell – the father of Anna Campbell, who died fighting with the Kurdish forces in Syria – was immensely moving. Anna was clearly a massively engaged, caring and political young woman who chose what she wanted to do. As a parent of course I would be horrified if any of my daughters put themselves in such danger. But I also know that sometimes you must let go. Her father knew she was going to a war zone, but now says he did not know enough about it. He is proud of her: “I don’t think I had any right to stop her. She was a 26-year-old woman. I had to trust her.” For that I respect him and her memory enormously."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/may/18/radical-kindness-belgian-town-fostering-vulnerable-people-tradition","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T06:36:12Z","webTitle":"'Care BnB'- the town where mentally ill people lodge with locals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/18/radical-kindness-belgian-town-fostering-vulnerable-people-tradition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/18/radical-kindness-belgian-town-fostering-vulnerable-people-tradition","fields":{"headline":"'Care BnB'- the town where mentally ill people lodge with locals","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Maria Lenaerts was seven years old when she came home from school one day to find a stranger at the kitchen table. It was September 1942 in Nazi-occupied Belgium. The young man looked afraid. He did not say a word to her. “He was sitting at the table like this,” she recalls, hiding her head in her arms. “He didn’t understand anything.” This was her first encounter with Jefkae Harbant, then an 18-year old with a learning disability and no place to call home. He was born in the French-speaking part of Belgium and did not speak a word of Dutch. Neither Maria nor her parents knew any French. Despite the language barrier, Maria’s parents, who were cattle farmers in the Flemish lowlands, had decided to take the young man in. This was not only an act of wartime charity, but came from a centuries-old tradition of stretching out a hand to people on the margins of society. For hundreds of years, residents in the Belgian town of Geel have been giving a home to strangers with severe mental health problems or learning disabilities. This is not a bed for a night or a few weeks. Many boarders stay with the same family for years, often decades. Somehow a tradition from the age of Chaucer has survived and evolved into part of Flanders’ state healthcare system. In 2018, 205 people are Geel boarders, although home care is now only for those with mental health problems, not learning disabilities. In an age that is more aware of the crushing toll of mental illness, the homecare system has made this small town near Antwerp a curiosity. One in four people will experience mental health problems in their lives, according to the well-known World Health Organisation estimate, while a majority say their pain is deepened by stigma. Geel’s model of acceptance and “radical kindness” – to cite one medical journal – has stirred interest around the world. Academics and journalists have flocked to the small Flemish town searching for inspiration from an “innovation” that is 700 years old. Geel traces its boarding tradition to the 13th century, when people with all kinds of illnesses made a pilgrimage to the local Saint Dymphna’s church. According to the brutal legend, Dymphna was an Irish saint who was murdered in the town. Pilgrims travelled many miles to her church in Geel, searching for miracle cures. When there was no more room in the church sick bay, locals gave them a place to stay. The Geel homecare tradition was incorporated into the state in the 19th century, eventually ending under the umbrella of the Psychiatric Care Centre (OPZ). Most boarders have severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia or personality disorder. “They have a long history of disease and referrals. They are not capable of living alone,” says Mieke Celen, a psychiatrist at OPZ, who oversees the matchmaking process between foster families and patients. Foster families are never told the patient’s diagnosis, although they do get warning about behaviour that they might expect: can they live with someone who smokes or walks around the house during the night? Dr Celen says few relationships break down. One study of 17 foster relationships over five years, by the Belgian academics Eugeen Roosens and Lieve Van de Walle, found that only two families dropped out of the programme during the period. Geel’s medical professionals say the system makes a lot of sense. Boarders have better outcomes than patients in hospital: they take less medication and have fewer acute episodes, says Celen. Success means “having a life as normal as possible”, says Wilfried Bogaerts, an OPZ psychologist. “The programme is about life. It is not a miracle cure, it is not a magic system, but it is about finding this person the right place to live at the right time. “Very often there is a severe chronic problem that cannot be cured completely, so we try to make the best of it. We accept the limitations but then try to make the life of a boarder as good as possible.” For advocates, Geel’s forte is seeing the person, not a bundle of stigmatised labels straight from a medical textbook. Boarders are given responsibilities in the household, says Bogaerts: “They take care of the dog, go to the shop, do the dishes … so patients are needed and wanted.” For some observers, there is not enough evidence that the scheme really works. “There has been very little evaluation about the impact of this,” says Professor Sir Graham Thornicroft at King’s College London. “In terms of outcomes for individuals, we don’t know about readmission rates, or satisfaction rates, or quality of life, or things we would normally want to assess for people with long-term needs.” Jefkae Harbant is exceptional, even by the standards of Geel family care. When the Guardian visits, his 94th birthday is only a few days away. A cake has been ordered. Friends invited. There will be a family party. He still remembers the day he arrived on the family farm nearly 76 years ago. “He was not afraid, but it was difficult for an 18-year-old boy who came to an unknown environment,” recounts his care worker, Michelle Lambrechts, who acts as an interpreter. Maria is now 82 and has lived with Jefkae nearly all her life. When her father died in 1982, she became his foster “mother”, even though she is younger. After decades under the same roof, legal formalities have melted away. He is really a brother, she says, speaking through an interpreter, sitting in the house she has lived in all her life. There was was never a question that he would leave the family. Harbant’s foster father is Maria’s husband, Jules Teunkens, a retired glass-factory worker, now 86. Maria and Jules married in 1957. A 60th wedding anniversary mug bearing their black and white younger selves is sitting on a shelf crowded with bric-a-brac. While her husband worked at the factory, Maria Lenaerts brought up their three children and worked on the family farm. And Jefkae helped, milking the cows and tending vegetables. The family are rarely apart. Although social services offer respite care for holidays, Harbants does not like to stay at the hospital, recounts Lambrechts. “When Jefkae went to the ward, he cried a lot. He cries and he cries for hours because he doesn’t want to sit on the ward – he wants to be at home.” The number of families who take in boarders is in sharp decline, as Geel’s rural, churchgoing traditions fade into the past. More women are working. Fewer people farm the land. The traditional foster family is disappearing. Demand from patients is also falling. People with severe mental health problems no longer face the stark choice of hospital or boarding; many are opting for other kinds of residential care. Geel reached its peak on the eve of the second world war, when 3,736 borders lived in the town. The numbers have been falling ever since and the decline has accelerated in the last two decades: in 2006 there were 46o borders, today 205. Younger families are proving hard to attract. The OPZ thinks the Geel model can survive, but would like the state to increase payments to families from the current maximum of €600 (£535) a month. “The openness of the community is pretty high,” Bogaerts says. “We should compensate families more so it is more attractive.” Maria Lenaerts would recommend taking in boarders, yet she doubts that the system fits with how people live now. “It won’t last,” she says. “People have a lot of activities and recreation – they don’t have time.” None of her children or grandchildren have taken in any boarders.

The ban makes exemptions only for musical instruments containing a small percentage of ivory, some antiques, and museum objects. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, described the trade in ivory as “abhorrent” and said: “Ivory should never be seen as a commodity for financial gain or a status symbol, so we will introduce one of the world’s toughest bans on ivory sales to protect elephants for future generations.” No date has yet been set for the introduction of the legislation. A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it would be done “when parliamentary time allows”. A study last summer of records under the convention on international trade in endangered species (Cites ) suggested that between 2010 and 2015 Britain was the largest exporter of legal ivory in the world. The number of elephants in the wild is believed to have declined by almost a third in the past decade, and an estimated 20,000 a year are killed to meet the global demand for ivory. Some campaigners have been seeking a blanket ban, but Charlie Mayhew, the chief executive of the African wildlife charity Tusk Trust, described the exemptions as pragmatic. “The ban will ensure there is no value for modern-day ivory and the tusks of recently poached elephants cannot enter the UK market,” he said. “We welcome the fact that ministers are sending such a clear message to the world that the illegal wildlife trade will not be tolerated and every effort will be made to halt the shocking decline in Africa’s elephant population in recent years.” Tanya Steele, the chief executive of WWF-UK, said the ban would make Britain a global leader. “Around 55 African elephants are killed for their ivory a day, their tusks turned into carvings and trinkets,” she said. “But if we want to stop the poaching of this majestic animal, we need global action. We hope the UK will continue to press countries where the biggest ivory markets are, most of which are in Asia, to shut down their trade too.” There were more than 70,000 responses to the consultation, 88% in favour of the proposals, making it the largest consultation exercise carried out by Defra. The present law, in common with those of many other countries, bans the sale of raw elephant ivory of any age but allows trade in ivory objects worked before 1947 without any certificate – causing inevitable problems over the date of manufacture – and post-1947 objects with a certificate. The new law will ban the trade in most ivory objects of any age. The exemptions will be for musical instruments made before 1975 with an ivory content of less than 20%, and objects made before 1947 with less than 10% ivory. There will be a further exemption for antiques at least 100 years old, deemed “the rarest and most important objects of their type”, with the judgment made by specialists including museums. In addition, portrait miniatures on thin slivers of ivory at least 100 years old will be exempt. There will also be an exemption for accredited museums in the UK and internationally. Campaigners say the illegal trade in banned wildlife is estimated to be worth up to £17bn a year, and the legal international trade in ivory has exploited varying regulations in different jurisdictions. China permits trade in “relics” without a specified age, and the US exempts objects over a century old, as well as those with less than 50% ivory. Matthew Hatchwell, the director of conservation at the Zoological Society of London, said: “Legal domestic ivory markets are intrinsically linked to the illegal ivory trade that is driving the current poaching crisis. With almost 20,000 elephants poached in the last year, it is vital that countries take significant steps such as those outlined by the UK government today to close their markets and help make the trade in ivory a thing of the past. “No one in the UK today would dream of wearing a tiger-skin coat.

Also dubbed emo rap or SoundCloud rap, this is an offshoot of mainstream hip-hop characterised by quietly mournful or noisily distorted production, rapped over by pan-racial MCs whose aesthetic is of a skate punk given an unlimited budget for accessories at Claire’s. Face tattoos are de rigueur – one minor rapper in the scene, Arnoldisdead, has one of Anne Frank covering his entire right cheek – and the lyrical fixations are drugs and coldly pornographic sex. These are topics covered in rap since day one, but are now paired with an awareness of the spiritual vacuum in these pursuits, as rappers reference anxiety, loneliness and depression, before self-medicating again. The amorality isn’t necessarily just a pose: XXXTentacion, whose new album reached No 1 in the US last month, will soon be tried on domestic abuse charges of sickening violence, while 6ix9ine, whose rainbow-coloured teeth make him look like a poorly storyboarded slasher film protagonist, has pleaded guilty to the “use of a child in a sexual performance”. Adam Grandmaison, who has done a huge amount to advance the scene via his No Jumper media brand, has denied accusations of sexual assault. Meanwhile, the scene’s love of prescription opiates claimed a victim in 21-year-old Lil Peep, who died in November of a Xanax and fentanyl overdose. Perhaps the moral panic is justified. But even the most troubled parent would have difficulty denying the melodic catchiness of this new breed – indeed, that’s what weaponises the lyrics. The most obvious example is the quite operatically idiotic Lil Pump, whose track Gucci Gang has been streamed hundreds of millions of times. The appeal of its playground-chant chorus to children was most obviously underscored in a viral video of a Florida school disco, in which a parent exclaims “Oh my God!” as a brood of eight-year-olds chant “My bitch love do cocaine” – presumably outraged at Pump’s abuse of verb conjugation as well as his documentation of drug-taking. Into this toxic yet often irresistible scene enters Lil Xan, a one-man distillation of its inanity and very occasional brilliance. He has already been dismissed by older rap fans for calling 2Pac “boring”. His cute, cherubic looks paired with his lobotomised demeanour, inevitable face tattoos and attitude to education – “I can’t sit down for seven hours a day and listen to some old bitch talk about shit I ain’t ever gonna need” – add up to an almost cliched image of the kid you hope never dates your daughter. A 21-year-old high-school dropout and former Xanax addict who named himself after his beloved painkiller, he has since renounced the drug. On Betrayed, included here and his biggest hit yet with more than 150m plays on both YouTube and Spotify, he warns: “Xans gon fake you, Xans gon betray you.” But by keeping the Lil Xan name, he continues to bask in, and advance Xanax’s edgy glamour, and his uncalibrated moral compass leads him down some other dubious and boring paths. I can confidently report that there are no good lyrics on this album. The only bit of wordplay seems to be “I’m so cold I think I need a sweater”, while the royalty cheques for Betrayed have presumably started coming in, as Gucci flip-flops and diamonds are expounded upon at length. There’s a flicker of interest as he claims “all my friends are enemies” on Deceived, but neither this, nor his journey out of Xanax addiction, is examined, merely remarked on. His disparagement of women is so frequent that there now can’t be a single one in his life that he hasn’t said “fuck that bitch” about. Bad lyrics don’t necessarily matter in pop-rap, and his intermittent facility for hooks means that some of the tracks succeed nonetheless – Wake Up will have you mumbling “I wake up, I throw up, I feel like I’m dead” all day – and there is some fine, gothic production from Mike Will Made-It and others. But Xan often struggles to create a unique timbre – Diamonds references XXXTentacion’s flow, while Far is uncannily similar to Post Malone – and he is shown up by his more talented guest stars, such as Rae Sremmurd, who help make Shine Hard the album’s best track. Lil Xan serves a purpose. At the risk of sounding like a funky supply teacher earnestly preaching from a flipped-around chair, rap is America’s folk music, constantly taking stock of the nation. Some rappers vocalise its troubles, but others, like Lil Xan and his SoundCloud brethren, reflect them – their violent misogyny, torpor and inarticulacy reveals as much about a rudderless generation as, say, Kendrick Lamar does. But that doesn’t mean it’s good to listen to. Like the much-memed Simpsons quote from Principal Skinner, it’s tempting to say the children are wrong about this."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"crosswords/quiptic/960","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T23:00:42Z","webTitle":"Quiptic crossword No 960","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quiptic/960","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quiptic/960","fields":{"headline":"Quiptic crossword No 960","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/02/labour-antisemitism-more-widespread-than-thought-momentum-says","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T18:19:25Z","webTitle":"Labour antisemitism more widespread than thought, Momentum says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/02/labour-antisemitism-more-widespread-than-thought-momentum-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/02/labour-antisemitism-more-widespread-than-thought-momentum-says","fields":{"headline":"Labour antisemitism more widespread than thought, Momentum says","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Momentum has warned its supporters that accusations of antisemitism in Labour are not rightwing smears or conspiracy, saying unconscious anti-Jewish bias is “more widespread in the Labour party than many of us had understood even a few months ago”. The group accused the party of failing to deal satisfactorily with the problem and said it had begun a process with external groups of developing antisemitism awareness training for Labour members. The highest governing body of the grassroots group, a key force behind Jeremy Corbyn, agreed the statement over the weekend by email, the Guardian understands. It says political opponents of the Labour leader have been using the problem opportunistically, but that should not be an excuse not to tackle it. The statement was agreed by the 26 members of Momentum’s national coordinating group, which includes Christine Shawcroft, the former chair of Labour’s disputes panel, who resigned from that role and her place on the party’s national executive committee (NEC) after it emerged she had defended a council candidate accused of Holocaust denial. New elections are taking place for Momentum’s NCG, which also includes the Momentum founder, Jon Lansman, with ballots sent out on Monday. It is understood Shawcroft has decided not to run for re-election but remains a director of Momentum. Momentum said it “acknowledges the anger, upset and despair within the British Jewish community at the numerous cases of antisemitism in the Labour party” and said it was disappointed in the party’s “failure to date to deal with them in a sufficiently decisive, swift and transparent manner”. The statement said: “Accusations of antisemitism should not and cannot be dismissed simply as rightwing smears nor as the result of conspiracies. “Current examples of antisemitism within the Labour party are not only a problem of a few, extreme ‘bad apples’, but also of unconscious bias, which manifests itself in varied, nuanced and subtle ways and is more widespread in the Labour party than many of us had understood even a few months ago.” However, Momentum’s national coordinating group said it was possible both to accept that antisemitism was a problem on parts of the left while also accepting that Corbyn had been attacked “using this issue as a way to undermine his leadership”. “The actions of others do not reduce our responsibility to challenge antisemitism whenever and wherever it occurs,” the statement added. Shawcroft had previously used a Facebook post to insist the issue was “being stirred up to attack Jeremy”, before resigning from the NEC. Meanwhile a letter to the Guardian signed by more than 40 senior academics called for an end to “Corbyn’s trial by media” over antisemitism. Momentum’s coordinating group statement said the anger about antisemitism reinforced the need for a new programme of political education in Labour, which could examine unconscious bias that would “move people away from conspiratorial thinking and towards a systematic understanding of how society and capitalism works”. The group said it was also reviewing its own constitution and complaints procedures as a “practical commitment to stamping out antisemitism and all forms of discrimination”, and disseminating further guidance to local groups. Lansman, a veteran leftwinger who stood but then withdrew as a candidate to replace Iain McNicol as Labour’s general secretary, was himself the subject of antisemitic attacks after he decided to stand against Unite’s Jennie Formby for the role last month. During the process, Formby said the attacks were “disgraceful and must stop … this sort of abuse has no place in the Labour party”. Another key Corbyn ally, Rhea Wolfson, a Jewish Momentum activist who is also a member of Labour’s NEC, said on Monday she had also been frustrated with the slow pace of tackling antisemitism complaints. Wolfson said Formby, who was appointed to succeed McNicol, would make the issue a top priority. “There is very clearly a real issue, a huge piece of work that needs to be done in the Labour party, around modern antisemitism and giving people the tools to recognise when legitimate criticism of Israel crosses the line into antisemitism,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Momentum’s statement was greeted with caution from some groups. The Jewish Labour Movement’s Ivor Caplin said Momentum had been “part of the problem” by allowing expelled or suspended activists to organise in local movements and said it had “belatedly woken up to the challenges.” “We now need action not words across the wider Labour movement and that includes Momentum whose leaders sit around Labour’s top table,” he said. Richard Angell, director of Labour’s centrist pressure group Progress, said the group needed to tackle any abuse from supporters on Momentum Facebook or Twitter pages. “They need send a clear message to individuals with Momentum symbols in their social media profiles to ‘delete their tweet or delete their twibbon – you do not speak for us’,” he said. It emerged on Monday that another Labour local election candidate had been suspended after apparently sharing Facebook posts urging people to question the Holocaust. Roy Smart, a candidate in Tunbridge Wells, appeared to share links to a site in 2015 calling itself a “Holocaust Deprogramming Course”. Another post from September 2017 said: “People being allowed to question if the Holocaust happened is not the same as being a Holocaust denier.” Labour has suspended Smart pending an investigation and will choose a new candidate for the council seat. A party spokesperson said: “Labour takes all complaints of antisemitism extremely seriously, [these are] fully investigated and appropriate disciplinary action taken in line with our rules and procedures.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/shortcuts/2018/apr/02/planet-of-the-apians-nasa-develops-plan-to-launch-marsbees","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T14:14:54Z","webTitle":"Planet of the apis: Nasa develops plan to launch 'Marsbees'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2018/apr/02/planet-of-the-apians-nasa-develops-plan-to-launch-marsbees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/shortcuts/2018/apr/02/planet-of-the-apians-nasa-develops-plan-to-launch-marsbees","fields":{"headline":"Planet of the apis: Nasa develops plan to launch 'Marsbees'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Name: Marsbees Age: Embryonic.

No, these are being developed by Nasa and Japanese scientists. Again, I have seen this movie. It does not end well. They are going to fly out from a mobile base – probably a rover like Curiosity – map terrain, take samples and search for signs of life. That all sounds very borderline-sentient of them.

They were one of 25 proposals shortlisted from 230 submitted to Nasa’s Innovative Advanced Concepts programme, which receives $125,000 each and nine months to make them ready for phase II. Has anyone made a joke about the winners getting quite a buzz out of it? No one would possibly demean themselves so. No, quite right. Umm … who were the other successful applicants?

I’m gonna need to know a little more about that last one. Oh, it’s simple – it becomes a ball when it needs to roll over ground, a flying thing when it needs to be airborne and torpedo-shaped when it hits liquid. What a time to be alive! Let’s hope.

The former England international Tamsin Greenway believes that with New Zealand, the world’s No 2 side, faltering of late it is time for the Roses to finally bloom on the international stage. Greenway, now director of netball at the UK Superleague champions Wasps, predicts the Silver Ferns will not make the gold-medal match on the final day of competition at the Games which is widely expected to feature the world and Commonwealth champions, the Australian Diamonds. Greenway “thinks and hopes” it could be the improving England Roses – led by the captain, Ama Agbeze – who will play for the gold medal. If that happens it would be the first time since netball was introduced to the Games in 1998 that the final is not a trans‑Tasman affair. England have won only Commonwealth bronze – in 1998, 2006 and 2010. The Diamonds and Silver Ferns have also dominated the sport’s other benchmark event, the Netball World Cup, taking gold or silver in all but one since it began in 1963. But Greenway, a pay‑TV pundit, says the Roses must take the chance to leapfrog a faltering Kiwi team, who lost twice against the world No 4 side Jamaica in two days last month after being defeated by Australia late last year. “You can’t entirely write them off but given the performances we’ve seen in the last six to eight months I would be amazed if they turn it around in the Commies [Commonwealth Games]. I think, and hope, it will be an Australia versus England final – but be wary of Jamaica, too, they could sneak in there,” she says. Greenway says it is time for England to make a “real impact” at a big tournament, after missing out on a medal altogether at the 2014 Games in Glasgow, despite pushing the top two in preliminary matches. “A medal, any medal, isn’t a success for the Roses any more. We’ve got to believe, at some point, we can make the final. We can finish top of the group and make the final, but everyone should also be worried about Jamaica too, as they are capable of beating anyone on their day. You certainly don’t want to play Jamaica in a semi-final.” England, who are in the Silver Ferns’ pool in the preliminary rounds, come into the Games after some of the best results in their history, including wins against South Africa and New Zealand which helped them to their best finish in the Quad Series. The squad includes the 33‑year‑old Geva Mentor, playing in her fifth Games, the midcourter Jade Clarke, who will compete at her fourth, as well as Agbeze, Eboni Beckford-Chambers and Jo Harten, all at their third Games. Also in the team are the experienced Kadeen Corbin, Serena Guthrie and Helen Housby, as well as Natalie Haythornthwaite, Jodie Gibson, Beth Cobden and Chelsea Pitman, all at their first Games. To be successful on the Gold Coast, Greenway says the Roses coach, Tracey Neville, needs to find her best seven and back them. “I think at the last World Cup it cost us, as we changed our lineup against the three big teams. Make a decision about centre: is it Serena [Guthrie] or Jade [Clarke]? Stop messing around – get the combination right and get them playing together, build the trust.” The performances of Mentor, who plays alongside the Australian goal machine Caitlin Bassett at the Sunshine Coast Lightning in the Australian domestic league, and Harten, who Greenway thinks should play back at goal shooter, will be pivotal to England’s chances. Greenway says the squad is well prepared for the pressure of the Games and will not be intimidated by the “big girls” of the game, unlike previous generations of Roses, because players such as Mentor, Harten, Guthrie, Housby and Pitman play regularly in the world’s best domestic league, Super Netball in Australia. “When I was first playing for England I played on [the Australian great] Liz Ellis and it was something like her 100th cap and we got pumped by 40 goals. We used to play against that calibre of player maybe once or twice a year. But all that has changed, the scene is so different now. “The development of the game in Australia has been brilliant for international netball and now everybody, especially those countries which have players who play Down Under, is starting to catch up. The Roses won’t be intimidated, there’s just less fear.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/2018/apr/06/annotated-solutions-for-prize-27471","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T11:00:33Z","webTitle":"Annotated solutions for Prize 27,471","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2018/apr/06/annotated-solutions-for-prize-27471","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2018/apr/06/annotated-solutions-for-prize-27471","fields":{"headline":"Annotated solutions for Prize 27,471","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A meat-tea TEAM EAT (cycling) rana/Rana double def [large frog/Hindu prince] B superb SUPER B(owl) Zagreb Z + BARGE (anag) C croc miCROCosm (hidden) Joe Public JOE (Louis) + PUBLIC D noticed NOT ICED succeed double def E fiancee cryptic def masquerade MADE SQUARE (anag) F belief BELIE/F(ellow) spoof O in FOPS (rev) G reposing re-posing (hom) striking double def H oath A HOT (anag punish youtHS IN UProar (hidden rev) I graffiti (Steffi)GRAF/FIT/1 Karachi CHI on KARA J Amritraj TRIM RAJA (anag) [Vijay Amritraj, b. 1953] Jessie J JESS/IE/J(angling) K candlewick double def schoolwork WORK after SCHOOL L Elul E(nglish)/L(ectures)/(j)UL(y) Raphael double def M false alarm FAL/SEAL/ARM theorem THE + MORE(anag) N Khan triple def [Sadiq Khan] moorhen HORMONE (anag) O carpaccio double def Pizarro PRIOR A/Z (anag) P end stop N(oon) in POET’S D(aughter) (anag) penmanship IN M(alta) HAPPENS (anag) Q Iraq QA(ta)RI (rev) Sadiq SAD&lt;(I(ndependent)&gt;Q(uerry) [Sadiq Khan (N)] R illustrator ILL-US(e)/TRA(i)TOR thin air THIN + AIR S mince pies double def [cockney rhyming slang] recess double def T disobedient DIS(r)OBED + 1/TEN (anag) sportscast S  S + CAST U prie-dieu EURIPIDE(s) (anag) shiatsu (matin)S + HIATUS (anag) V Nabokov NAB/OK/O(ld)/V(olume) Negev archiVE GENerally (hidden rev) W pshaw!

Sir Julian King, the European commissioner for security, wants “a clear game plan” on how social media companies are allowed to operate during political campaigns to be ready for the 2019 European elections. The European commission’s digital strategy, to be outlined this month, has been given new impetus by the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which whistleblowers revealed that the data of 50 million Facebook users ended up in the hands of political consultancies for use in Donald Trump’s US election campaign and the UK’s EU referendum. In a letter seen by the Financial Times, King wrote that the “psychometric targeting activities” such as those of the data analysis company are just a “preview of the profoundly disturbing effects such disinformation could have on the functioning of liberal democracies”. King, the UK’s final European commissioner, is calling for limits on the harvesting of personal information for political purposes, more transparency on the internal algorithms that internet platforms use to promote stories, as well as disclosure by technology companies of who funds sponsored content on their websites. His ideas are set out in a letter to Mariya Gabriel, the digital economy commissioner, who is leading the EU’s response to fake news. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has already promised a law to ban fake news during election campaigns. On Monday, Malaysia became one of the first countries in the world to introduce such a law, despite being urged by the UN not to rush the measures. Under the legislation, offenders could be sentenced to up to six years in prison. It has prompted fears of a clampdown on free speech before a general election. King has previously called on the EU to redouble its efforts to debunk “pro-Kremlin disinformation”, and cited the work of the EU’s counter-propaganda unit, the East Stratcom taskforce. Set up in 2015 after Russia’s invasion of Crimea, the taskforce produces the EU’s Disinformation Review, a website that says it has found 3,500 cases of deliberately misleading news. Critics say this work risks undermining freedom of expression and publishers’ rights. “The EU Disinformation Review seeks to control the right to freedom of expression by labelling publishers as ‘disinformation outlets’ and their content as ‘disinformation’, creating a chilling effect on the work of journalists that is central to democracy,” states a complaint by a group of lawyers to the EU ombudsman, published this week. Led by Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU law at HEC Paris business school, the group argues in a 13-page submission that the EU does not have a coherent method for deciding whether a publication is producing disinformation. The EU is also criticised for not giving publishers any notice of their complaint, meaning individual bloggers and publishers are subject to “arbitrary and capricious administration”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/02/port-talbots-once-grand-plaza-cinema-due-for-major-revamp","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T12:58:54Z","webTitle":"Port Talbot’s once-grand Plaza cinema due for major revamp","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/02/port-talbots-once-grand-plaza-cinema-due-for-major-revamp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/02/port-talbots-once-grand-plaza-cinema-due-for-major-revamp","fields":{"headline":"Port Talbot’s once-grand Plaza cinema due for major revamp","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The sad hulk of the Plaza in Port Talbot, an imposing listed, but derelict, cinema where local boys including Richard Burton, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Michael Sheen were regular filmgoers before going on to become Hollywood stars, could come back to life as a council-owned community hub – but not a cinema. The Plaza was built in 1939. A local landmark, it was Grade II listed in 1999 for its striking art-deco design and largely unaltered interior. It originally had more than 1,000 seats. Like many other giant auditoriums of the golden age of cinema, it was converted into a bingo hall in the 1980s, before being revived for a few years as a cinema, with prices as low as 50p to try to build audiences. However, the opening of a six-screen multiplex on the outskirts of the town spelled the end for the Plaza and it showed its final film, The Prince of Egypt, in January 1999. Last year, Sheen made Port Talbot Paradiso, an affectionate documentary about the cinema, for BBC Radio 4, with contributions from contemporaries including Rob Brydon and the opera singer Rebecca Evans. It was described as a “place where dreams could flourish and imagination thrived”. The building sat empty and decaying for years before the local authority bought it in 2009 to secure its future. The council is seeking an operator to take the building on, suggesting it could house a hall, fitness centre, cafe, shops and an office. Councillors are optimistic that a £5.5m redevelopment grant will be available from the Welsh government. Steve Hunt, a cabinet member on Neath Port Talbot council, said it had been a long and difficult journey, “but to bring back the building in any capacity is the way forward”. In an television interview with Melvyn Bragg, Hopkins recalled regular visits to the Plaza as a formative influence on his boyhood, and watching stars such as Humphrey Bogart. “I was escaping, I think, from my sense of being a kind of clodhopper … I wanted to go to America, I had this dream of going there for years and years from a little kid, and I think it was because of this,” he said. Many local people have fond memories of the glory days of the cinema. Stan Leyshon, a pensioner, said: “Every kid dreamed of being a screen hero, but for Burton and Hopkins, it all came true.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/02/uk-criminal-justice-system-meltdown-violence-rising-government","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T10:54:11Z","webTitle":"The UK justice system is in meltdown.

When will the government act?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Britain’s criminal justice system is in disarray. The head of the crown prosecution service, Alison Saunders, is resigning amid rows over failed convictions. The head of the Parole Board has been forced to resign over the Worboys case. London’s murder rate has overtaken New York’s, with fatal stabbings in Britain at their highest level since 2010. Prison violence and suicide are rising. If this was local government, Whitehall would have sent in commissioners to sort it out. The rule of law demands that justice be separated from politics. That is clearly not happening. Saunders’s department has been inundated by pressure from politicians to take a tough line on sex cases, from domestic violence and rape to harassment and historical abuse. In some regions as much as one-third of court time is now consumed by such cases, which can be of intense complexity. The CPS has been trapped time and again by failing to follow rules of disclosure to defence lawyers. But it lacks competent staff. Its budget has been cut by a quarter since 2010, another political “intervention”. The Parole Board suffers a similar plight. While the Worboys case appears an error of judgment, it has hit a parole service still reeling from botched semi-privatisation in 2015; 70% of districts were subcontracted to private operators whose objective is to save money. The justice ministry as a whole is being cut by 40% over the current decade. The legal aid budget has been reduced by almost a half. Most serious is London’s now rising rate of violent crime. Whether or not a cut in police numbers leads to a rise in crime is controversial – in New York the opposite is the case. What is clear is the rise in violence in London’s toughest neighbourhoods. At the weekend the metropolitan police chief, Cressida Dick, declared a return to more aggressive “stop and search” in violence-prone areas. She openly blamed social media for allowing gangs to “posture” on the web, and drive their followers from “slightly angry” to “fight” in an instant. Will nothing induce government to confront the social media giants? If they were the “mainstream media” they would be instantly prosecuted. There was undoubted waste in Britain’s archaic justice system, one example being the duplication of a divided legal profession. The extravagance and delay of Britain’s equally archaic jury system is exorbitant. Much of the cost of justice is due to the obsession of British public opinion with imprisonment. To none of these are ministers prepared to address themselves. But austerity is clearly biting far below any surface waste. It is taking a huge gamble with the nation’s domestic security. Heaven forbid a royal commission, but something has to change. In the first instance it should be the cuts. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist • This article was amended on 5 April 2018.

The drop in intensity that followed his words prefaced a pair of sluggish performances in the Champions League semi-finals against Real Madrid, and Guardiola would later openly admit his error. It was probably the biggest mistake of his enthralling three-year spell at the Allianz Arena. Jupp Heynckes is not about to make the same mistake. Three days before the Champions League quarter-final first leg at Sevilla, the coach picked a devilishly attacking line-up to face Dortmund in Der Klassiker on Saturday evening. They swarmed over their opponents, supposedly their most dangerous domestic adversaries, like a pack of wolves left unfed for days. Bayern led before the end of the fifth minute of the match, with Robert Lewandowski – inevitably – expertly sweeping in a pass from the outstanding Thomas Müller. Dortmund were reprieved when VAR ruled out a second by Franck Ribéry, still inside the first 10 minutes (curiously, Lewandowski’s marginal offside position for the opener went undetected), but still trailed 3-0 by the 23rd minute and left the pitch at the interval shell-shocked, after a quick one-two punch from Lewandowski and Ribéry made it five at the halfway point. It all worked out perfectly for Bayern who, by refusing to take it easy in the first half, could do just that in the second before their trip to Andalucía. Heynckes was able to give a breather to David Alaba, the excellent James Rodríguez and Ribéry. Joshua Kimmich, whose importance was underlined in that he was a rare first-choice player awarded a rest, came on for the second half to whizz around Peter Stöger’s dispirited team, and he laid on Lewandowski’s hat-trick goal late on with an intrepid burst on the outside. OK, maybe it didn’t work out quite perfectly. That would have involved Schalke dropping the points against Freiburg earlier in the afternoon which would have made the title mathematically certain for Bayern. Instead, the 2-0 win for Domenico Tedesco’s side, which strengthened their grip on second place at Dortmund’s expense, meant the kings must wait for the short trip to Augsburg on Saturday to be crowned. That felt like a minor detail on a day when everything else went so well. Whether Heynckes will employ such an offensive line-up at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán is open to question, but one wonders how many teams could resist Bayern in this form. As well as Müller, Lewandowski and Ribéry (who bamboozled poor Lukasz Piszczek on the left), James suggested he could be the side’s creative fulcrum in the post-Ribéry and Robben era, with a goal and two assists from the left of a three-man midfield. Sporting director Hasan Salihamidzić was noncommittal when pressed by journalists on whether Bayern would take up the permanent option on the Colombian’s services at the end of next season but playing like this, it seems a formality. “He had,” wrote Süddeutsche Zeitung’s Benedikt Warmbrunn, “played passes with a fairy-light ease. He had accelerated the game and he had decelerated it, as suited the moment.” Presumed to be at risk after Carlo Ancelotti’s sacking, having been recruited as per the Italian’s wishes, James has excelled under Heynckes. The future is especially germane, with Karl-Heinz Rummenigge confirming after the game that Bayern aim to have Heynckes’s successor in place by the end of April. On the other side this was humiliating for the visitors, and not only because of what happened on the pitch. The wretchedness of their plight even elicited sympathy from Bayern. “One can only hope Dortmund will be on track again next week,” said Müller after the game, “because we need good teams that represent us [the Bundesliga] well on the continent, not this year, but next year. It’s important that Borussia Dortmund find their way back to their old strength.” Former BVB stalwart Mats Hummels went into the away dressing room to commiserate with his old team-mates afterwards, having offered them empathy in front of the media by recalling a dim, distant thrashing by Karlsruhe when in Bayern’s under-17s before, rather less helpfully, recalling his own part in a Dortmund thrashing at Bayern when still at Westfalen. The pats on the head underlined that the time when Dortmund were Bayern’s major competitors, or even major irritants, has been and gone. In his own post-match summary, Stöger sounded like he was closing the door on any hopes of extending his tenure beyond the end of the season. “I’m happy and proud to be able to work here,” said the Austrian, “but my life is not defined by the fact that I’m on the touchline at BVB.” To say that a new coach – even Julian Nagelsmann – could push Dortmund back towards competitiveness is plainly not the case, though, and as sporting director Michael Zorc signed a new deal until 2021 this week, his acknowledgment that “new influences and ideas” are needed should preface a rebuild off the pitch as well as on it, where the squad has talent but looks increasingly uneven. The first domino to be tapped is Matthias Sammer, who will return as a consultant. Reports suggest that Sammer’s role – his first since stepping down from Bayern in 2016 after illness – will be a fairly informal one, meeting the top brass every fortnight to give his opinion on the club’s direction, rather than getting involved in day-to-day operations, and he hasn’t signed a contract – at least for now. Another former stalwart, Sebastian Kehl, is being lined up too. For now, one wonders how much longer Bayern and Dortmund’s meetings can be defined as Der Klassiker. Heynckes, as so often, cut to the quick while endorsing BVB’s recruitment of his former colleague Sammer as “in their current situation,” during his post-match press conference. That Bayern had no rivals in their march towards the title was already clear, and we should not be surprised that they reminded us of that in such brutal fashion. Talking points • Dortmund weren’t the only side to take a 6-0 hiding on Saturday. That fate also befell Cologne; having opened a pathway to a great escape before the international break, they slumped at a rampant Hoffenheim, who have half-an-eye on a Champions League place, being just four points adrift. Effzeh’s performance was “a joke,” said their infuriated goalkeeper Timo Horn, with hard-earned points for Mainz and Wolfsburg now leaving them six away from the relegation playoff spot. • More chuckle-worthy was the manner of Werder Bremen’s winner against Eintracht Frankfurt, as the usually-excellent Lukas Hradecky let David Abraham’s back-header slip into his own net for an extraordinary own goal. That cost Eintracht, with Leipzig’s thrilling 3-2 win at Hannover letting them move into fourth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/03/brexit-weekly-briefing-less-than-a-year-to-brexit-day","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T05:00:08Z","webTitle":"Brexit weekly briefing: less than a year to Brexit day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/03/brexit-weekly-briefing-less-than-a-year-to-brexit-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/03/brexit-weekly-briefing-less-than-a-year-to-brexit-day","fields":{"headline":"Brexit weekly briefing: less than a year to Brexit day","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing.

Top stories Brexit’s “pre-anniversary” was the cue for an avalanche of articles, programmes and series to mark the occasion, none of which – for obvious reasons – could predict with any confidence what Brexit, when it finally happens, might actually look like. But with a year to go until Britain formally leaves the EU, Theresa May toured “the four nations of the union”, taking care to avoid backing Boris Johnson’s claims of a “Brexit dividend” (the IFS, OBR and Treasury all say there won’t be one) or saying whether, having voted remain, she had changed her mind. Britain would be “strong and united” but also “different”, she said, promisingly. First, though, the government has to survive a series of key votes, particularly on the customs union, before parliament’s crunch “meaningful vote” on the final deal, which is expected in October (but could yet be put off till January). In the Lords, nine senior Tories, including two former cabinet ministers, have put their name to cross-party amendments to the EU withdrawal bill, supporting a series of substantial changes to the government’s flagship bill to leave the EU. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, caused consternation among Labour remainers by suggesting an anodyne “blah, blah, blah” accord would “probably” pass the party’s six tests for the final deal, which include delivering “the exact same benefits as we currently have as members of the single market and customs union”. But the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, insisted Labour would “not support a withdrawal deal” if the tests were not met. The party also aims to amend the EU withdrawal bill in the Lords to prevent the government from presenting the “meaningful vote” as a choice between accepting the deal and crashing out without one.

Top comment The Guardian’s finely argued editorial on 29 March – a year before Brexit day – called for an urgent change of course by parliament to avoid a departure “on terms almost certainly decided by a rightwing clique of Tories”: A Brexit that would bring the country together is the softest of soft Brexits. But May decided, without even consulting her cabinet, to go for an extreme model. Only a year is now left until the official moment of departure. The troubling reality is that outside the EU Britain would be worse off in economic terms under every scenario. Leaving the EU will not enhance Britain’s place in the world, it will damage it. Yet without sustained evidence that millions of people have had a change of heart, the case for completely reversing the decision is difficult to make. Here is the paradox: Brexit does not fix the underlying problems that led many people to feel that they simply had to reject EU membership to get some kind of redress from a political system in which they had lost confidence, and the negative economic consequences of Brexit will be felt hardest in places where the leave vote most looks like a cry for economic help. MPs will now have to find a way to leave while mitigating the harm done by leaving. Resisting a course that harms the country is not an offence against democracy. Time is running out. Now is the moment to demand a change of course, before it is too late. Polly Toynbee argued that the Brexit ultras are afraid because their project now looks toxic, but it’s hard to see what can stop it: This fear and loathing from the winners suggests they are not idiots, they can see Brexit is not going well: polls show most people agree. The UK doesn’t hold the whip hand, while foreigners from every continent give pitying looks at a country taking leave of its senses. Remainers have better reasons to be miserable. Daily they scour opinion polls, but the needle is stuck ... I wish there were more than a remote chance Brexit could be stopped, but most voters just want to get on with it. I never stop believing, but let’s face it: only some unimaginable cataclysm can swing public opinion decisively for remain in the very short time left.

It is unexpected enough that one of the best young footballers in Europe has asked to do an in-depth interview before breakfast on a Sunday – even if the fact that the Bayern Munich defender and Germany international speaks fluent English is hardly a shock. Kimmich, who has just turned 23, is more surprising in his willingness to examine the testing periods of an otherwise glittering rise. Joachim Löw, Germany’s manager, has described Kimmich as “one of the greatest talents I have seen in the past decade”. Last week Paul Breitner, who won five Bundesliga titles with Bayern and the World Cup in 1974, dredged up a familiar comparison between Kimmich and Philipp Lahm. “He understands tactics, the phases of the game, and knows when to change the rhythm,” Breitner said of Kimmich. “He has everything to be the second Lahm.” Kimmich’s maturity, tactically and off the field, has marked him out as an almost certain future captain of Bayern and Germany. But rather than looking ahead to the World Cup or Tuesday’s Champions League quarter-final first leg, away against Sevilla, Kimmich explains how he felt when his career stagnated under Carlo Ancelotti last season. He had shown rare versatility while playing as a central defender for Pep Guardiola at Bayern and at right-back for Germany during Euro 2016 – when he made the team of the tournament. He started well under Ancelotti and, as a defensive midfielder, Kimmich scored seven goals in his first 14 games. But Ancelotti is much more conservative than Guardiola and his preference for experience consigned Kimmich to the bench for months. Kimmich winces at the memory. “As a young player the most important thing besides having a very good coach is to play a lot because you improve that way. So it was a very hard time for me. Everybody wants to talk with you and help you. But you have to deal with it alone. I know my family and my girlfriend are there for me. It’s important – especially with my girlfriend – that I talk about other things. But I had football on my mind all the time. “‘What can I do to play? How do I improve?’ I trained longer and harder. Then I would get home and think: ‘Oh, shit, I have to change something.’ It’s very tough for your mind when it’s three months or longer. Now I think differently because sometimes you don’t have the power and you have to accept it. Maybe it’s good to learn this at a young age but you don’t want to suffer too long.” Ancelotti soon lost the trust of the team and Jupp Heynckes replaced him last October. It was striking that Kimmich was one of the first players Heynckes asked to see in a private meeting. He underlined Kimmich’s importance to Bayern – and that trust was key to the player signing a new contract to 2023. “Jupp talked about a few points I have to make better,” Kimmich says. “It’s really important for a young guy to have a coach who wants to improve you and believes in you.” He smiles at his enthusiasm before remembering other difficult moments. “At 14 I went to Stuttgart academy and it was a big dream. But I felt lonely. It also got hard later. At 18 I hoped to play in the second team but the club said I was not strong enough.” Kimmich’s determination was apparent as he insisted on a loan deal to RB Leipzig in 2013. His time at Leipzig, however, was initially challenging. “Ralf Rangnick was the coach and it was the perfect move. But I got injured. It was really hard because I was alone in a hotel and didn’t know anyone. But I grew up fast because you have to be tough if you want to play with big ambitions. I was a stronger person afterwards.” Once Kimmich began to excel at Leipzig Guardiola noted his huge potential. In January 2015, as Kimmich says: “My agent told me a club wants to buy me. I asked him, ‘Who?’ He said FC Bayern Munich. I said: ‘Don’t joke with me.’ I couldn’t believe it because when you’re in the second league it’s not normal Bayern want you. Bayern can buy nearly any player in the world. It was even harder to believe Guardiola wants me.” Kimmich grins in the deserted café as he remembers his first meeting with Guardiola. “My heart was beating very fast and it was a very special moment. I asked him: ‘Why me?’ He told me how he sees me, my style of play and what he likes. He had seen situations where I could develop technically and he said there were other positions I can play instead of defensive midfield. He had watched me in the under-19 European Championships and he characterised me very well. I thought: ‘Wow, this is a man who knows me and my style of play perfectly.’ He also told me I would get my chance with him. This is such a good answer when you’re young and want to compete with the best in the world.” How did Guardiola help Kimmich most in their season together? “There are many things – but Pep showed me completely new spaces in the field. I improved a lot. He cares about your first touch a lot and that you know what to do even before you get the ball. You have to know where your team-mates are, so he wants you to screen the whole field. Pep would talk to you immediately if he recognised something. He also has this amazing view of football. For every opponent he had the perfect master plan.” In one of their last matches, after moving him from central defence into midfield near the end of a 0-0 draw at Borussia Dortmund in May 2016, Guardiola raced towards Kimmich at the final whistle. In front of a crowd of 81,000 and millions on television Guardiola spoke urgently to the then 21-year-old. It looked as if he was berating Kimmich but after the game Guardiola said: “I told him he’s one of the best centre-backs in the world. He’s got absolutely everything.” It was obvious Guardiola exhorted Kimmich to do even better – so what did he really say in those blistering moments? “I played at centre-back and five minutes before the end Xabi Alonso went out and Medhi Benatia came in. Benatia went into my position in defence and I took Xabi’s place in midfield. But I was still thinking like a centre-back. I was playing too deep and Medhi and I were nearly in the same position. Pep shouted at me in the game to move up but I didn’t recognise why. So he told me exactly what he meant before I left the field. “In the first moments I was surprised. But, when you know Pep, this is what you get. Pep wants to tell you immediately to make you better. He wants to tell you there and then. Maybe it looked strange but for me it was great. It showed how much he sees and cares.” Guardiola’s influence on Manchester City has been even more profound. “This shows how special Pep is. In the Premier League there are many clubs that normally compete for the title. But he improves his team so much he’s in another division to the others. Even in the Champions League they played Basel in the last round and won the first leg away 4-0. It’s unbelievable.” The chance of Guardiola and Kimmich meeting again in the semi-finals or even the final of the Champions League remain. For the moment, however, Kimmich is intent on improving further – now that he has settled into playing right-back for both Bayern and Germany. “My favourite position is defensive midfield but now I have a great opportunity to have the same place in both teams. For Germany since the Euros I mainly play as a right defender but sometimes as a centre-back with three at the back. It was not always easy going back to your club as a midfielder. You can lose confidence when you’re not in the rhythm. But whatever position I play I try to fill it with my own style. I don’t only defend. I want to create chances and also maybe score. You have to find the right balance and it’s important for a young player to not copy anyone and to be yourself.” At least comparisons to Lahm are fading – as the maturity and versatility of Kimmich help him stand out as a future great in his own right. “I always wanted to be me and not a Lahm clone or Lahm the second. Of course Philipp was a great player – even when he had a bad game he was still better than the others. There’s a higher consistency in his performances and you want to match that. But you want to play as your own person. People aren’t making the comparison as much any more and that’s better for me.” Kimmich also wants to improve off the pitch and he is learning Spanish. “I have free time and I thought what could I do to improve my mind? It’s hard to study and so A new language was a perfect solution. I’m taking a little break right now but I’ve been learning it for over a year. I can speak a bit with Arturo Vidal and the other Spanish speakers – but it’s far from perfect. Like everything, and football most of all, I can still get much better.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/04/first-dates-review-series-10","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T22:05:31Z","webTitle":"First Dates review – series 10 serves up a comforting mix of the lovable and the cringe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/04/first-dates-review-series-10","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/04/first-dates-review-series-10","fields":{"headline":"First Dates review – series 10 serves up a comforting mix of the lovable and the cringe","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Back for its 10th series in five years, First Dates (C4) rolls on like a juggernaut, spreading fine dining, true love and hurt feelings in roughly equal measure. Along with the spin-off First Dates Hotel, it has also spawned versions in more than a dozen countries, trading under such don’t-mess-with-success titles as Primo appuntamento and Första dejten. And it remains very much a formula not to be tampered with: funny, cringeworthy and beguiling. You have to watch the first half through splayed fingers, but by the end you’re always a little in love with everyone. Nothing about the format changes except the people and, presumably, the daily specials. Fred, the maître d’, is still on hand to reassure the daters, who rotate between nervous, overconfident, gauche, sweet, garrulous and unadvisedly intense. Thirty-year-old J suffers from a not uncommon propensity to pepper his conversation with cheesy chat-up lines. “The eyes are sparkling,” he tells 28-year-old Sophie. “You should give them back to the stars.” “I do not do well with compliments,” Sophie says. It’s not you, love. It’s him. On another table, 50-something Stuart isn’t doing much better. “I like your little mole,” he tells Claire, indicating a beauty mark just below her nose. “It’s not one of them that has big long hairs growin’ out of it.” Stuart’s big secret has already been vouchsafed to viewers: his ex-wife, Mandy, is on a date of her own at a table nearby, with Adam. Married for 11 years and now divorced for nine, there is little hint of where it all went wrong for Mandy and Stuart, who get on so well they were prepared to embark on this excruciating experiment in tandem. That doesn’t make it any less excruciating for their dates, who look profoundly uncomfortable when all is revealed. “That doesn’t make sense,” says Claire. This portion of the episode felt over-engineered. They needn’t have sat the four of them quite so close together. And how likely is it that the two women would excuse themselves at the same time (spinach on tooth and mascara malfunction, respectively), leaving the men alone to make awkward small talk between tables? Back at the first table, J says: “Do you see your mum a lot? Tell her I said thank you.” You’re on a date, mate. The picking-up part has been taken care of. Anyway, Sophie seems to like him, even though he’s not her usual type. She normally goes for bad boys, and they normally go. For all his stupid chirpsing, J turns out to be kind, shy and not quite as happy-go-lucky as he makes out. The tattoo on his arm conceals a disfiguring burn that made him a target for bullies growing up. This is how First Dates works its magic: a casting call of types is thrown together, and over the course of an hour they’re allowed to become more and more human – complicated, silly, a little battered by experience. Even if it’s all down to the editing, it’s still an admirably generous approach. At the start, you’re quite happy to judge everybody for their table manners. But when it’s over you find your heart has cracked wide open, again. The late date – the couple who don’t sit down until more than halfway through the programme – were 21-year-old Morganne and tight-trousered Nathan, two Welsh kids transported all the way to London to find love. “We could have just gone down to Koolers,” says Morganne, referring to a Merthyr Tydfil nightspot that I happen to know was once shortlisted for the distinction of the UK’s most tragic hometown club. Nathan prefers Blisters in Bargoed, but this is the only point of contention between them. Within minutes of meeting, Nathan reveals to Morganne the exact number of tattoos on his bum: eight. “I’ve got all my friends’ names tattooed on my arse,” he says, “for no reason whatsoever.” Morganne’s single objection to Nathan’s comportment came when he poured his digestif into his beer. “What even are you doing?” she shouted. “What even did you just do with your Jaeger?” They were both charming and quite possibly made for one another. I would not hesitate to cry at their wedding. And another thing: if you missed it over the busy Easter weekend, Andrew Scott’s turn in Hamlet (BBC2), recorded “as live” at the Harold Pinter theatre, London, is on BBC iPlayer; just as great and almost “as live”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
