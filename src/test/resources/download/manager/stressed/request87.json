Against this backdrop, Euratom and the UK’s future nuclear safeguarding regime risk being forgotten. As the nuclear safeguards bill - one of the “Brexit bills” announced in the Queen’s speech – makes its way through the parliamentary process, nuclear experts were called to present evidence to MPs. The message from experts is unequivocal – there is no upside to the UK leaving the Euratom treaty. Be it Prospect, the trade union representing civil nuclear experts, EDF Energy, or the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), the sector is united in its message to the government: leaving Euratom is complicated, and the potential consequences could be disastrous for our country. Rupert Cowen, a nuclear expert at Prospect Law, claims the UK is “sleepwalking” to disaster: “If we do not get this right, business stops ... no nuclear trade will be able to continue.” This is not scaremongering. Analysis of the facts shows just how much is at risk by leaving Euratom, and how complex this process is, given the government’s unnecessary, self-imposed deadline. This government must start listening. Euratom, among other things, provides safeguarding inspections for all civil nuclear sites in the UK. Inspectors are employed by Euratom and many are EU nationals. It takes five years to train a nuclear inspector and there is currently a limited pool of qualified inspectors from which to recruit. As Sue Ferns, deputy general secretary of Prospect, said in her evidence to the nuclear safeguards bill committee, “this is a highly skilled, very specialist area, which is why there is such a premium on this source of labour” and this is why we must question the wisdom of the government’s actions so far. The government plans for the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) to take over the role that Euratom currently carries out, but the ONR and the NIA have made clear that new arrangements will not be in place by the time we are due to leave Euratom in March 2019. Asked by MPs whether new arrangements could be put in place within the timeframe, Dame Sue Ion, chair of the Nuclear Innovation and Research Advisory Board, said: “I do not think it is possible.” Should the UK fail to have its safeguarding regime in place by March 2019, nuclear trade would halt, as well as cross-nation technology sharing that some of our nuclear power stations rely on to function. Again, this is not an exaggeration of the problem, or political point-scoring. Put simply, if we don’t have our safeguarding regime in place, our nuclear industry will face major, potentially dangerous, disruptions. Despite protests from government ministers, leaving Euratom at the same time as leaving the European Union is not necessary. Euratom is a separate treaty to our EU membership and it is time the government treated it as such, rather than claiming the two are inextricably intertwined. Our civil nuclear industry and Euratom, like so much of the Brexit negotiations, is incredibly complex and it is absolutely vital that we get these negotiations right. Remaining part of Euratom for a transition period may act as a safety net, giving the industry the time it needs to prepare to leave Euratom, but the EU will demand that European courts oversee the arrangements, which of course crosses one of Theresa May’s negotiating red lines. Releasing the impact assessment that the government has carried out on our nuclear industry would be a step in the right direction, rather than rushing through policy with little scrutiny and condemning Brexit opponents as unpatriotic mutineers. It is time for this government to release itself from unnecessary self-imposed straightjackets, stop focussing on narrow party disputes and start listening and put the interests and the safety of the nation first."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/nov/21/councils-bookmakers-poor-fixed-odds-betting-terminals-planning-permission","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T13:00:21Z","webTitle":"Can councils stop bookmakers’ push into poor areas?

Don’t bet on it","bodyText":"In the runup to Christmas, Bradford’s imposing city centre is littered with festive lights. They give a little cheer to a somewhat run-down Victorian shopping district dominated by building societies, banks, charity shops, and, more recently, a growing concentration of betting shops. There are 11 in barely a 250m radius, with the corner of Broadway and Bank Street the epicentre: a William Hill, a Paddy Power, a Ladbrokes and another William Hill are all next to each other. On the afternoon of my visit they are all busy with people playing on the fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), the machines which have been the focus of a broad alliance of campaigners who say they fuel people’s gambling addictions. At Betfred on Market Street, Sally Hinton (not her real name), a white British woman in her 60s, is playing roulette on a FOBT. “I’m addicted,” she tells me. “I’m trying to stop. I want to stop. I need to stop.” Hinton says she has gambled for years, playing in casinos and bingo halls. But it only got bad when she tried FOBTs. “As soon as I learnt how to play these, I lost £15,000 in two years,” Hinton says. “Anyway, I won £11 today, so I’m up,” she says. Councils, anti-gambling charities, the Church of England, and political parties from Labour to Ukip are united in calls for the £100 stake that can be bet every 20 seconds on these machines to be reduced to just £2. The government is currently considering options to cut the maximum legal stake to between £50 and £2. FOBTs are lucrative: they make up 56% of betting shops’ profit. Since they are constrained by a legal limit of four machines per shop, imposed under the 2005 Gambling Act, bookmakers have opened multiple outlets in the most profitable areas of the country. FOBT players tend to live in neighbourhoods with higher levels of deprivation, unemployment and ethnic diversity according to a 2015 report on the socioeconomic characteristics of machine gamblers for the charity GambleAware. And it found that people who live near a concentration of betting shops are far more likely to become problem gamblers. In Bradford, one of the most deprived local authorities in England, one in three people aged 16-64 are not in work and those that do work earn an average weekly income of just £476, well below the average wage in the rest of the region. The city is home to a total of 62 betting shops, and is the sixth most profitable local authority area for the betting industry outside London. Gamblers there lost an estimated £10.6m on FOBTs in 2015/16, according to figures compiled for the Campaign for Fairer Gambling. Richard Dunbar, a Bradford Labour councillor, argues that the clusters of betting shops in the city centre have had a hugely negative impact on the local community. He believes that they unbalance the vitality of the town by dominating the city centre, and worse, they increase the risk of gambling addiction. Some 430,000 people in the UK are thought to have a serious gambling problem, up from 280,000 in 2012. “It’s an endemic problem,” says Dunbar. “And what are we doing about it? If it were a physical disease sweeping the country, something would happen straight away. So why not with problem gamblers?” In its submission to the government consultation, the Local Government Association, which represents local authorities, asked for councils to have further planning and licensing powers to prevent the clustering of betting shops. As things stand – despite legislation requiring specific planning permission to turn any premises into a betting shop – planning and licensing laws brought in under the 2005 Gambling Act mainly favour the bookmakers. Since the beginning of this year, the Planning Inspectorate in England, which acts as the independent adjudicator for planning appeals, has considered five appeals by bookmakers against planning decisions by Rotherham, Lancaster, Lewisham, Greenwich and Doncaster councils. In every appeal, the local authority’s decision to refuse planning permission was overturned. In each case, the inspectorate cited the lack of conclusive evidence that social harm can be caused by betting shops. In March, Paddy Power won an appeal against Rotherham council to open its first branch in the town centre. The planning inspector in charge of the appeal decision said that “no evidence has been provided to confirm that the proposal would directly fail to contribute to the health of the town centre”. Whereas, Paddy Power had provided sufficient evidence that “relatively high levels of footfall are anticipated”. Ben Johnson, a planning officer from Islington council, in north London, says that the inspectorate is only interested in hard, localised evidence. “They should take a more precautionary approach,” he says, since the evidence for social harm is often too circumstantial, whereas it is easy for bookmakers to give figures on footfall and the new jobs a betting shop would provide. Bookmakers’ appeals are also being upheld due to the absence of a specific local policy on betting shops. The planning inspector is obliged to consider councils’ local development plans. As the government review says: “Having an up-to-date, relevant local plan policy in place will support the local planning authority in the determination of any applications for planning permission”. Yet very few local authorities, even where the proliferation of betting shops is a problem, have a clause for them in their local plans. Take Doncaster. Its Labour MP, Rosie Winterton, urges that “local authorities should be able to take account of wider community, health and poverty issues”. But in September, BetExtra was granted planning permission on appeal to open a shop in the centre of town alongside 12 other bookmakers. The appeal decision noted that Doncaster had no specific policy on the maximum sustainable number of betting shops. This is because the council’s development plan was adopted in 1998, the year before FOBTs were introduced and long before the clustering of betting shops became an issue. Doncaster is currently updating its local plan, and compiling evidence to support a betting shops policy. Asked why it hadn’t included one sooner, a spokeswoman says: “Preparing a new or revised plan is an intensive and costly process. This includes preparation of evidence, adapting to new strategic proposals, a sustainability appraisal, public consultation, submission to government and examination in public.” As Johnson points out, local plans are complex and wide-ranging. “It might not be worth reviewing an existing plan just to add a single policy,” he says. There is currently no statutory requirement to have a local plan or keep it up to date. The London borough of Newham, which has been campaigning against the concentration of bookmakers for years, is the first council in England to include limits to the number betting shops in its local plan, adopted in September 2016. “We have consistently called on bookmakers to stop blighting the most deprived communities with these high-stakes machines but local authorities are hamstrung by a lack of powers,” says Robin Wales, mayor of the east London borough. Newham has a total of 84 betting shops, including 12 on one street. Since 2008, the council has rejected eight betting shop applications. Each one has been overturned by the Planning Inspectorate. The new policy is yet to be tested, but it aims to prevent new shops from locating in areas where there are already three units of the same use within a 400m radius. Yet few councils have followed Newham’s lead. Back in Bradford, since 2008, the council has rejected three betting shop applications. Of these, two were overturned by the Inspectorate. Bradford has not included a specific betting shop policy in its recently updated local plan, instead relying on other planning policies from its area action plan. A council spokeswoman says that it has recently passed a motion to write to the government expressing its concerns, and asking for “greater powers through the planning system to restrict the excessive clustering on our high streets of betting shops with FOBTs”. A Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport spokeswoman says councils already have the necessary powers. “In 2015 new planning laws gave local authorities more power to determine the number of new betting shops opening on the high street. Since then there has been a marked drop-off in the total number of betting shops in the UK.” But the Gambling Commission says the fall in betting shop numbers was just 1.4% in 2016. Martin Tett, the LGA’s environment spokesman, says: “It’s crucial that councils are sufficiently funded to undertake their planning functions because the process of building the evidence base for a local plan is costly and resource intensive. However, there has been a 46% real-terms reduction in spending on planning and development services between 2010/11 and 2014/15, which makes this a greater challenge for many councils.” As Dunbar points out, “The government has cut this council’s [Bradford’s] budget in half in the last 10 years. We have less money to do the things we need to do to protect and serve our citizens. “Look at the gambling industry’s £13.8bn profit (including £1.8bn just on FOBTs). Then look at a council that’s having to cut services left, right and centre. We’re obviously not going to have as much money to service appeals and go against corporate betting industry giants.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/20/fourth-death-at-lincoln-immigration-removal-centre-prompts-inquiry","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T17:40:21Z","webTitle":"Fourth death at Lincoln immigration removal centre prompts inquiry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/20/fourth-death-at-lincoln-immigration-removal-centre-prompts-inquiry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/20/fourth-death-at-lincoln-immigration-removal-centre-prompts-inquiry","fields":{"headline":"Fourth death at Lincoln immigration removal centre prompts inquiry","bodyText":"An investigation has been launched into the fourth death at a Lincoln immigration removal centre in the last year. A 27-year-old Iraqi man died at Morton Hall immigration removal centre on Sunday morning. He is thought to have killed himself. The police have been informed and the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman are conducting an independent investigation into the death. Just a few weeks ago Carlington Spencer, 38, from Jamaica, died at Morton Hall. In January of this year Polish detainee Lukasz Debowski died there and in December 2016 Bal Ahmed Kabia from Sierra Leone died there. There have been 10 deaths in detention centres across the UK in the last 12 months. Detainees expressed their shock at the latest death, saying that they believed the dead man to have been extremely vulnerable. One told the Guardian: “He was a nice lad, very quiet and kept himself to himself. But he had mental health problems and was on suicide watch.” He said that guards were supposed to be checking on the man every 30 minutes. He added that detainees became aware of the incident early on Sunday morning. “I heard an officer say: ‘Oh shit’ and then we were all taken out of our rooms and locked into the pool room for about an hour,” he said. “They carried his body out through the back way in the hope that we wouldn’t see what was going on. We are all treated very badly here, like prisoners, although many of us have not committed any crime.” Detention and human rights organisations condemned the latest death. Celia Clarke, director of BID (Bail for Immigration Detainees) said: “We are absolutely devastated to learn of yet another death in immigration detention. Be in no doubt that this is the hostile environment in action. People we speak to are desperate and vulnerable. It cannot continue. Detention is supposed to be used as a last resort, so why are so many people detained? This broken and cruel system must end.” Emma Ginn, coordinator of Medical justice said: “This death rate calls for emergency measures. The Home Office must take responsibility to protect the life of those in its care. They must immediately close all immigration removal centres and conduct a public inquiry into how conditions have led to this deaths rate.” Corey Stoughton, Liberty’s advocacy director, said that the regime was “devastating” to inmates’ mental health. “It is completely unnecessary state-sponsored suffering,” she said. “We are the only EU country that allows immigration officers to lock people up without any sort of time limit for their release. Some waste years of their lives in violent, chaotic, overcrowded centres, rife with abuse, not knowing when or if they will see freedom again. “It’s been a year since an unannounced inspection of Morton Hall exposed a surge in violence and a threefold rise in self-harm since 2013. How many more people need to die to make ministers pay attention?” The follow-up to the independent review by Stephen Shaw, former prisons and probation ombudsman, into the welfare in detention of vulnerable persons started in September of this year. Shaw visited Morton Hall as part of his review two days before the latest death. A Home Office spokesman confirmed that a 27-year-old Iraqi man had died at Morton Hall on Sunday morning. “Our thoughts are with his next of kin at this sad time,” he said. “As is the case with any death in detention, the police have been informed and a full independent investigation will be conducted by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman (PPO). “We will make no further comment while this is being investigated.” In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

She hoped that the conversations might help elect Hillary Clinton. But some of her most poignant interactions were not about policy. They were about husbands. “We heard women saying that they didn’t want to vote against their husband,” Zrinksi said. “That they weren’t going to vote because they didn’t want to cancel out his vote.” Trump scored a narrow upset victory in the county, which had voted twice for Barack Obama. Trump’s support among women in Northampton probably mirrored his majority support among white women nationally, local pollsters say. That support helped Trump grab the state of Pennsylvania, and the White House. The loss was devastating for activists like Zrinski. But it was also galvanizing, to an extent that has begun to look bad – possibly alarmingly bad – for Trump and Republicans. Because one year after the presidential election, a wave of first-time female candidates stood for state and local office in Northampton County and across the United States – and they won. “It was a huge Republican bloodbath, is the only word I can think of for it,” said Peg Ferraro, a popular Republican who narrowly retained her seat on Northampton’s County council. For the past year, the Guardian has been exploring Trump’s win in Northampton County for our series The Promise. As summer has turned to fall, doubts have grown locally about whether Trump could win the county again, which could have implications for his national staying power. And women are at the center of the story. Democratic and progressive women in Northampton County have been motivated by frustration with Trump, but their feelings of disenfranchisement go beyond the president, they said. “I really describe it as a kind of quiet rage,” said Vanessa Williams, 35, a local activist and organizer. “And you see it explode every once in a while. It’s really come out a lot again with all the sexual assault allegations that are coming out. “Women are just pissed, frankly. They’ve had it. I think up to now it’s been a lot of talk of, ‘There, there, we’ll take care of it, we’ll take care of you’. “And it’s not happening. And women are realizing, I’ve got to step up, I’ve got to take care of myself, I’ve got to take care of my kids.” Psychotherapist Lori Vargo Heffner, 56, has never held elective office, but in November she mounted a successful bid for Northampton County council on the Democratic side. The council controls a budget of $400m and has jurisdiction over important infrastructure including bridges, a nursing home and a jail. “I think women got energized,” said Heffner in an interview in the deep-cushioned office where she counsels clients. “I don’t want to give him the credit. I want to say it was watching Hillary lose. “Watching an intelligent woman, who had every qualification for that office, lose. She seemed to have it in the bag, and still not be able to pull out the win – it was a shock. And I think more women stepped up to say, I’m going to run for this office, even if it’s a small office. And other women emerged to help the people that ran.” Zrinski, 42, won a seat on the county council alongside Heffner, increasing the number of women on the nine-person council from one to three. She spoke with the Guardian over lunch hour at the Apollo Grill in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. “There were people who, when I knocked on a door, said, ‘You’re a woman, I’m voting for you, we need more women in office’,” said Zrinksi, a first-time candidate. “And I heard that theme a lot.” Gains for women and Democrats were not restricted to Northampton County. Women won seven out of seven races for open judicial posts in Pennsylvania. Elsewhere in the US, the representation of women in the Virginia state legislature jumped by almost 50%. Democrats grabbed the New Jersey governor’s mansion on 55% support among women. The city of Seattle elected its first woman as mayor in almost a century. Dana Brown, executive director of the Pennsylvania Center for Women and Politics at Chatham University, said that women made up 38% of all candidates in Northampton County’s 2017 elections – higher than normal, but not high enough. “Those of us who are advocates for women in politics, we would love to see that number obviously increase even more,” Brown said. “But certainly it is a sign that women are indeed filing, running and winning at higher rates in 2017 than they have in previous municipal election years, which is very exciting and promising.” Over breakfast at Billy’s in Bethlehem, Williams said she believes that the set of results has begun to lift the gloom. “People were like, ‘Oh my gosh.’ We actually had wins.” But there’s a question on everyone’s mind: is it enough? Will the movement outlive the moment? Or does this look like another sure-fire victory for Trump’s opponents that turns out to be an illusion? ‘What’s for supper?’ In the eyes of his critics, Trump as president has demonstrated a hostility to women, nominating hardly any women for important positions, opposing healthcare and family policies that women champion and refusing women the dignity of equals. The fact that an ongoing national reckoning with sexual harassment and abuse by powerful men seems to have bypassed the president, who was accused during his campaign by more than a dozen women of having touched or kissed them without consent, only exacerbates the sense of injustice and outrage. There are plenty of Republican women in Northampton County, and Democratic women who voted for Trump, who continue to support the president. They say his 2016 opponent, Clinton, was irredeemably corrupt, and that his offer of economic resurgence was better for women than her offer of identity politics. Ferraro, the Republican county councilwoman, supports Trump, who she says has not been given a fair chance by the media. But she’s not confident that he would win in Northampton again tomorrow. “If I were a betting person, I would say no,” Ferraro said. “It depends who the candidates were. If it were Hillary again, I don’t know – it might be closer. But I’m not sure she could win.” But Ferraro, 76, said a focus on women per se in office was misplaced. “I just do not appreciate the gender thing,” Ferraro said in a phone interview. “I think if they’re qualified, we all have to be judged equally. I think sometimes the perception is that women are a little bit more caring, women are a little bit more honest, trustworthy. But that was years ago, when I ran the first time. We’re talking the 80s. “At this day and age, I think that women have come into their own enough that I’m hoping that we can be looked at for our competence, and our skills – for what we bring to the table. Not just because we’re a women.” Heffner, one of Ferraro’s incoming colleagues, offered an opposing view, saying that women considering a career in public service still face unique challenges. “I think it’s difficult to run for office as a female, and it’s going to sound so sexist, but it is still sexist,” Heffner said. “Because when I get done with a campaign event, I still have to go home and do the laundry. I walk in and my dad goes, ‘What’s for supper?’ I’m still expected to have those traditional roles, beyond my workday. Whereas I know that my colleagues who are male had wives to support them and be home for them, and their wives were at the events with them. “I don’t want to demean my male colleagues. People just have different expectations of women, I think.” ‘You can vote’ Lizzie Morasco, 28, an activist with the progressive group NextGen America, knocked on 2,400 doors before the elections this month, she said. She pointed out that Pennsylvania still has a long way to go in terms of equal representation of women. Just 47 of 253 seats in the Pennsylvania legislature are held by women, or 18.6%, good for a 40th ranking nationally, according to the Center for American Women and Politics. There are no women among Pennsylvania’s 20 members of Congress and zero women among statewide elected executives. Whatever barriers to entry there may be for women in Northampton county politics, they are not visible at a glance on paper. As the former home of Bethlehem Steel, the county has been a capital for industry in the state, but it is also a center for academia, with 11 regional colleges and universities. It matches the national average for women in the civilian workforce and tops the average in household income. It’s an easy day trip to New York City or Philadelphia and back. And yet the barriers are still there, perhaps for the reasons Heffner suggested, or fashioned from deep-seated patterns more difficult to document. More than a year after she went door-to-door for Clinton, Zrinksi’s voice tightened and her face blushed as she remembered talking with women who said they were turning their votes over to their husbands. “You thought to yourself, ‘Don’t you realize that you have a mind of your own, and that you can vote?” she said. “You have the right to vote! Women fought for that right.’ And you think to yourself, ‘If this is what women think in the Lehigh Valley, what do women think in other parts of the country?’” Judging by the election results, a lot of women in the Lehigh Valley, and in other parts of the country, were thinking the same thing. They were thinking it was time to elect more women. But Heffner counseled caution. “I think it’s a very good start,” she said. “But you can’t get locked into the complacency of the win. Because next you have 2018.” Sign up for regular email dispatches throughout the year to hear from Tom and the people of Northampton County"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/20/no-exams-until-mugabe-resigns-zimbabwe-students-mass-boycott","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T17:27:28Z","webTitle":"‘No exams until Mugabe resigns’: Zimbabwe students in mass boycott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/20/no-exams-until-mugabe-resigns-zimbabwe-students-mass-boycott","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/20/no-exams-until-mugabe-resigns-zimbabwe-students-mass-boycott","fields":{"headline":"‘No exams until Mugabe resigns’: Zimbabwe students in mass boycott","bodyText":"University of Zimbabwe students were doing last-minute revision, still savouring memories of the weekend’s jubilant march against Robert Mugabe, when the president went live on state TV to defy the nation and lay out his plans for staying in power. Like most Zimbabweans, they had expected it to be a resignation message from the 93-year-old leader. Mugabe has ruled the country since long before they were born and in recent decades has driven its economy into the ground, to the particular detriment of young people. “We were so angry, that was not cool,” 19-year-old Rouvarashe said of Mugabe’s unexpected defiance. “We were expecting him to step down, those were the magic words.” And so they responded by going on strike, agreeing in a flurry of text messages to boycott exams the next day. They gathered about half an hour before the first tests outside exam halls, singing and chanting “no exams until the president resigns”. None of the scheduled morning assessments went ahead. Skipping tests might sound like the laziest and most self-indulgent of protests, a caricature of student activism, but missing exams puts degrees at risk. For the average student, marks from these exams account for about 15% of their final degree. Young Zimbabweans graduate into a workforce grappling with up to 90% youth unemployment, so risking a lower class of degree is no small sacrifice. But all the students gathered at the protest said the chance of changing the government was more important than their academic prospects. “Its important for me to write an exam, but its also equally important for my nation to be redeemed,” said Admire Matarutse, 27. a real-estate marketing student. He said the students at the heart of the capital felt a responsibility to speak for poorer Zimbabweans who were isolated in rural areas. “As much as we want to get our degrees, as much as we prepared for the exams, what we are doing is important for the rest of the nation too,” he said. “There are some people in villages whose voices are not heard – we need to speak for them.” Other students at the protest shrugged off the economic sacrifice, pointing out that the jobs market was so dire that their degrees felt almost worthless. “Why should we go to school if our brothers and sister graduated before us and are still unemployed,” said Gerald, 19, who said his three older siblings were jobless graduates. “Why should I work hard for a degree?” Much of the anger was directed at Mugabe, who is chancellor of the university as well as leader of Zimbabwe. But students were also frustrated about a doctorate awarded to Mugabe’s wife, Grace, in 2014. A former typist who met the president when working in his office, she is more than 40 years younger than her husband. In 2011 she picked up an undergraduate degree from a Chinese university, having apparently carried out her studies while commuting from Harare. She was awarded the doctorate by Harare University three years later. It was an academic doctorate that requires study, rather than an honorary one bestowed as an award, and three years would be a record rate of study and research even for an outstanding student. But Grace Mugabe was never seen at university, nor did she file a copy of her thesis in the university library as other PhD students must do. “The integrity of this university was compromised when they awarded the degree to Grace,” said Presley Zirereza, a social work undergraduate. “Degrees are not awarded, they are earned. We have never seen her in our libraries or around our school. So that degree must be withdrawn.” Many said they were thrilled by the sudden freedom to protest, after a lifetime in which challenging the government was likely to bring expulsion or worse. “As social workers, we are seeing social action in practice for the first time,” said Zirereza’s classmate Mago Stanislous, 20. “Its part of our curriculum, but it had never been implemented in Zimbabwe before.” The protests are expected to continue if Mugabe refuses to back down. The association of former liberation fighters that helped to organise Saturday’s massive demonstration has already called Zimbabweans back on to the streets. Parliament is expected to start impeachment proceedings on Tuesday afternoon, and the war veterans’ leader, Chris Mutsvangwa, said he wanted to see the city centre brought to a standstill by demonstrators while the legislators meet. “It will be a sit-in until Mugabe’s back is seen by the people of Zimbabwe,” he told journalists on Monday morning. “Mugabe, your rule is over. The emperor has no clothes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/nov/20/mistake-universal-credit-catastrophe-misery","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T18:22:27Z","webTitle":"'It's just mistake after mistake' – stories from the universal credit catastrophe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/20/mistake-universal-credit-catastrophe-misery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/nov/20/mistake-universal-credit-catastrophe-misery","fields":{"headline":"'It's just mistake after mistake' – stories from the universal credit catastrophe","bodyText":"Sue hit her lowest point at the end of 2016. Unable to buy food and behind with her rent, she phoned the finance company about the debt on her car. She and her family live in a town between Bristol and Bath, the kind of place where getting around with three children – not least to the nearest jobcentre, which is nine miles away – makes having your own transport essential. But she hadn’t met her repayments for three months. “The lady on the line said, ‘You sound really down – are you OK?’” she recalls. “She could hear I was distressed. And I basically said: ‘No – I’m going to go upstairs and slit my wrists.’ She said: ‘Don’t do that – stay on the line. I’m going to put you through to someone you should talk to.’ It was a counsellor. And I spoke to them for nearly two hours.” With only £48 a week of child benefit coming in, Sue had effectively stopped eating. “I was trying to make stuff from the food bank last longer. I lived off cereal, so the kids could eat. That went on for three months.” Sue tells me all this in the course of an hour-long conversation in the compact house she and her husband rent from a local housing association. Her three children all suffer from eczema so severe they often have to wear bandages through the night, and their bedding has to be changed daily. Her husband is from west Africa, and has only recently been granted the immigration status that means he can work. Relative to what happened to her family in 2016, however, most of her life now seems to be surrounded by a fragile sense of relief. Sue’s story is just part of the mounting social catastrophe triggered by the new benefit known as universal credit (UC), conceived by the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith. It was designed to replace six working-age benefits (including jobseeker’s allowance and child tax credits) and moulded by George Osborne during his six years at the Treasury. It was piloted in some places in 2013 – and is now reckoned to be five years behind schedule. In Sue’s area, people were pushed into applying for universal credit in May 2016, either because they were new to the benefits system or because they had experienced a “change of circumstances”. In her case, it was the second reason: her eldest son was suddenly denied the disability living allowance he had long received because of the severity of his skin condition (“On the grounds that he was 13, and supposedly capable of looking after himself”), which affected her eligibility to other benefits, and put her in line to be transferred to the new system. “It was presented to me as the only thing I could have,” she says. At the last count, 630,000 people in the UK were receiving universal credit – and that number is growing fast. The media’s portrayal of the mess the system is in has focused on the six-week gap between applying for the benefit and receiving money, which has pushed thousands of people into debt and food poverty, and become emblematic of universal credit’s failures. In 20% of cases, the delay has been even longer. Now, with the budget looming, there have been reports that the gap is to be cut to four weeks; an attempt by the government, perhaps, to try to quieten the outrage, so the roll-out can continue. But even if the system eventually functions better, a month is still a long time to leave people without money (by way of comparison, in 2015-16, government targets for the waiting times for income support, jobseeker’s allowance and employment and support allowance were between 10 and 14 days). And besides, the new system’s failures run much deeper and wider than the question of when people first receive it. The Trussell Trust, which runs Britain’s biggest food bank network, says that in areas where the introduction of universal credit is at its most advanced, demand for its parcels has increased by 30% since April. Across the country, there are longstanding concerns about the new system’s shift from a mixture of benefits paid monthly, weekly and fortnightly, to a once-a-month payment that will make people’s budgeting even more difficult. Lots of people complain about payments that yo-yo up and down, thanks to apparently inexplicable deductions. The fact that what used to be housing benefit is now paid to often struggling tenants rather than housing associations or councils has added to the huge increases in rent arrears caused by the six-week delay. There are rising complaints about how universal credit treats the growing number of people who are self-employed, and those who have come to the UK from other countries. The fact that UC depends on an internet connection makes it very difficult for a lot of people to access, not least because of the government’s closure of hundreds of public libraries. As things stand, people tend to apply for universal credit in the midst of changes in their lives which are difficult enough, and the way the system works all too often makes things immeasurably more trying. As with many of the so-called welfare reforms pushed through over the last seven years, there is a sense of a system full of demands and delays that amount to an impossible set of trap-doors, which sends out the message that needing benefits to live is something that’s not just undesirable, but pretty much impossible. In Sue’s case, her biggest problem was UC’s apparently in-built insistence that her husband had to be part of her claim, despite the fact that his uncertain immigration status had never been an issue when she was receiving carer’s allowance, tax credits and housing benefit. “I kept telling them: we know he’s not entitled to public funds, and we accept that,” she says. “We weren’t making a claim for him. We were making a claim for me and my children. But the people I was speaking to said they were the rules.” Her husband had to go through two lengthy and complicated processes, respectively known as the identity check and habitual residency test. The result was that the time it took to process her application and start paying her the right amount of money went way beyond six weeks, to almost three months. One of her most vivid memories is of explaining what was happening to her eldest son. “I sat down with him, and I was crying my eyes out. I said: ‘I’m so sorry – I’ve got no money at all for anything for Christmas . It was only through our church’s generosity, giving us bits and pieces for the kids, that they actually had presents on Christmas day. None of it was from us.” The day after meeting Sue, I head to Newcastle, the first British city where UC was introduced in full, and where its malign effects have long been obvious. The first place I visit is Cherry Tree View, a purpose-built centre run by the city council that houses people in need of emergency accommodation: people evicted, or forced to suddenly leave their home. Among many other issues, the staff here talk about how rent arrears have gone up, and mounting issues with the way the official loans – or “advances” – available to people struggling with universal credit applications only add to their financial woes. My first appointment is with Paul and Elizabeth Smith, who moved to Newcastle from Fort William in Scotland after he lost a leg because of diabetes. With their 14-year-old son, they moved in with Paul’s mother, who suffers from Alzheimer’sdisease, and who eventually insisted they were evicted , which meant they needed emergency accommodation. At that point, they were also told to apply for universal credit, which meant weeks struggling to buy essentials. Paul is a trained chef, and does his best to work despite his disability; the family now have somewhere to live. But when he talks about their experience of the past year, he wells up. Even with UC coming in, their problems go on. “I’ve just been told we owe £995,” says Paul. “For ‘overpayment’. I’ve told my job coach at the jobcentre, and he hasn’t got a clue. All I can think of is the fact that I got sick pay during the six-week wait. But if that’s the case, what the hell was I supposed to live on? They’ve not given any reason for it. What I’ve said to them is, if they want it, they can have it. We just won’t be able to pay the rent. I’m sick of arguing with these people. I’m sick of arguing on the phone and breaking down.” Robert Petch is a soft-spoken 40-year-old who has reached the end of his tether. He began living in the first-floor flat he shares with his two children on 20 September, but he fell so far behind with his rent that he and his children were evicted from their council house. The impossible financial predicament UC had put him in was a part of the explanation. That was compounded by the senseless way the system treats self-employed people. Robert is a cab driver, a job that, he says, suits his life as a single parent, and doesn’t worsen the sciatica he developed in his 19 years as a postman. His biggest problem is an overlooked part of UC called the minimum income floor: a monthly deduction from his payment, calculated as a multiple of the hourly minimum wage, which is taken from him no matter how many hours he has actually worked, or how much money he has made. Put another way, the UC system takes no account of the reality of his working life – from the time he puts in, to the expenses he racks up, including the weekly fee of £120 he until recently had to pay a cab firm whose books he was on. As amazing as it may sound, all this is built into the logic of the system: to quote from the DWP’s own literature that if you have been self-employed for more than a year and “earn less than the minimum income floor in any month, universal credit will not bridge that gap. This will encourage you to grow your business and make sure it can support you.” Having applied for UC in July, he went through the inevitable wait: “not that much of a problem,” he says, though he also tells me he got used to surviving on beans, toast and cereal, and had to use a food bank to feed his family. He got his first payment in mid-August. “£603 and my rent paid,” he says. “I looked at it and thought, ‘This isn’t so bad.’ But I didn’t understand the minimum income floor. Because when September came round, I got £128.28 to last a month. They’d paid me as if I’d made £1,000 profit. And that month, my car had broken down and my insurance had been suspended. I’d actually made £7.75.” The next month, beyond money to cover his rent, he got £323. By this point, financial stresses and the fall-out from a relationship breakdown meant he had barely worked. “The kids went to live with my mam,” he says. “I went in my room in a sleeping bag and stayed there for two weeks. I didn’t do any housework; I didn’t eat. I was sleeping, and waking up, and taking painkillers – which are quite strong, they make you quite drowsy – and going back to sleep. Just waiting, waiting, waiting, for them to pay us some money. They just make mistake after mistake.” He tells me that for reasons he doesn’t understand, the hours used to calculate his income floor have been switched without warning from 35 hours to 25 hours – the number that is meant to be used for single parents – and back again. He claims that the people he speaks to on the phone have advised him to either stop working altogether or get a different job, but the money he has invested in taxi-driving and the fact that it squares with his responsibilities as a parent make that a bad choice. He also makes a point that goes well beyond his own predicament: he knows lots of taxi drivers in Newcastle who currently get traditional benefits; and if they are pushed on to UC, what will the city do for cabs? Natalie Clasper, 28, moved out of Cherry Tree View earlier this year, after she, her partner and their four children – who are 10, eight, six and two – had to be rehoused because of harassment from someone from their past. The disruption was huge, and made worse by the weeks they spent waiting for UC, and the fact that, with her partner in the midst of long-term unemployment, all she had coming in was £61 of child benefit a week, plus an advance on her first payment that was soon eaten up by rent. For the first month of the wait, she was still living at her former house – and as well as a food parcel from the council, she was helped by her neighbours. “I was like, ‘Don’t tell anyone what you’re doing – just bring it in the back door,’” she says. “Just trying to hide the fact that I was struggling to feed my kids. “I can remember waking up and thinking, ‘God, I’ve got four slices of bread left – shall I make toast, or a sandwich with that?’” she says. “Sometimes, I’d be like, ‘Shall we just lie in bed and watch a film?’ Just hoping they wouldn’t ask for breakfast.” Life wasn’t made easier by the demands of UC’s online system. “It’s very hard. They’d send me a text [telling her she had a new message on her account], and then I had to run all the way down to Cruddas Park library: getting four kids ready and having to walk down, cos I was thinking to myself, I can’t miss this: it might be them changing appointments, or saying, ‘get in touch ASAP’.” What does she make of the plan to cut the wait to four weeks? “That just means I would have struggled for two weeks less,” she says. “Just because it’s four weeks, it doesn’t mean people can cope.” Newcastle’s Citizen’s Advice Bureau (CAB) occupies most of the fourth floor of the city’s main library. The staff here reckon UC now accounts for 20% of the traffic that comes through the doors. “People have issues from very basic stuff – like, ‘how do I log in to the system?’ – to mind-bogglingly complex cases,” says Gayle Purves, an adviser who specialises in inquiries about benefits. “I’m finding it difficult because even the DWP sometimes don’t know.” She and her colleagues use a set of Samsung tablets, on which they help customers log in. It says something about the condition of the welfare state that the £5,000 cost was paid by Comic Relief. I speak on the phone to Patricia, who had been helped by the CAB. Until eight years ago, she had run a successful food business. She then developed both an auto-immune illness, and a neurological condition which doctors recognise, but have found impossible to diagnose. In December 2016, she lost the one contract that was keeping her in self-employment, and applied for UC. “I’d like to say it got better when the payments arrived,” she says. “But I’m still not eating. I’ve dropped down to a size six. Last time I was a size six, I was 15. Every single month, I’m about £400 to £500 short of meeting bills. “I’ve learned that you can make quite a host of things with eggs and flour. You can make drop scones, and pancakes. If you’ve got some potatoes, you can make potato scones, which are awful, but they fill you up. Yesterday, I had two pieces of toast. The day before that, I had two drop scones. Today, I haven’t had anything at all.” She is also being hit by deductions from her monthly UC payments, apparently traceable to an old speeding fine she says was incurred by someone else driving her car. Until now, the debt was being repaid at £5 a month, but since September, the figure has jumped to £103. “I’ve spent hours and hours on the phone trying to get it sorted out,” she says. I’ve spoken to debt management within universal credit, and they say it’s my case worker’s decision. I’ve spoken to Citizen’s Advice, who said it’s my case worker’s decision. My social landlord says the same thing. But the case worker continually says: ‘It’s not my decision.’ It’s just a hugely flawed system.” As darkness falls, I meet Charlie Denemark, 19, who was born in the Czech Republic, but has lived in Newcastle since he was nine. In a strong Geordie accent, he explains the details of his life over the past year. By the sound of it, he is estranged from his parents. For a while, he was homeless, sleeping on friends’ sofas. Thanks to a local charity, he now lives in a small flat, which, he says, lacks hot water or laundry facilities. He has just found a minimum-wage job in a factory, but because he has to meet all his housing costs, he is left with £50 a week for everything else. Three months ago, he applied for UC. Yesterday, he was finally turned down. “I went to the jobcentre,” he says, “and halfway through the interview, the woman said: ‘Hold on – why are you doing this interview? It’s not going to go through.’” On a nearby computer, he signs into to his UC account and shows me a letter explaining the decision. Whoever wrote it has misspelled his name, and mislaid any sense of coherence. It reads: “We’re writing to tell you that unfortunately you’re not entitled to Universal Credit from and including [sic]. This is because we have decided that for Universal Credit purposes only you do not have a right to reside and are consequently not resident in the UK … You cannot retain worker status for more than 6 months, unless you are about to take up employment. The information you have provided does not show that you are about to take up employment.” The next bit is in bold type: “This means that you are a person who must be treated as not in Great Britain. Therefore, you do not have any entitlement to Universal Credit at this time.” He is incredulous. “Where am I then? I’ve lived here since I was nine. I went to school here. It’s my home,” he says: yet another voice, mystified by a broken system, wondering how on earth he is going to get by.

Research by Coutts, the private bank used by the royal family, and researchers at the University of Kent found that 310 UK people and organisations made donations of £1m or more last year. The number of £1m-plus donations increased from 189 in in 2007, when Coutts produced the first edition of the Million Pound Donors report. The biggest single donation last year was made by Lord Sainsbury, the Labour peer and great grandson of the supermarket chain’s founder John James Sainsbury, who donated £40.5m to his charity the Gatsby Charitable Foundation. Sainsbury founded Gatsby, which is named after one of his favourite books, with £5 of his Sainsbury supermarket shares in 1967. Since then, he has given the foundation more than £1bn, which has been dispersed to charities focusing on education, science, public policy and the arts. The Gatsby foundation donated £82m for the construction of the University of Cambridge plant science Sainsbury laboratory and £45m to Cambridge University botanic garden in 2005. Sainsbury was elected chancellor of the university, where he read history and psychology, in 2011. The former science minister was the biggest single donor to the campaign to keep Britain in the European Union, donating £4.2m to the remain side, and he donated £2.1m to Labour and the Liberal Democrats. His family are the 217th richest in the UK with a £560m fortune, according to the Sunday Times rich list. In 2013, Sainsbury and his wife joined the Giving Pledge, the Gates and Buffett-led promise for the world’s richest people to give at least half of their wealth to charity. “The approach of my wife, Suzie, and I to philanthropy is very simple. We do not believe that spending any more money on ourselves or our family would add anything to our happiness. However, using it to support social progress we have found deeply fulfilling,” Sainsbury wrote in his pledge commitment letter. The Coutts report said publicity surrounding the giving pledge had encouraged other wealthy people and companies to increase charitable giving. More than 170 of the world’s richest people, including Mark Zuckerberg, Michael Bloomberg and George Lucas, have signed up. Gates said the pledge was “about building on a wonderful tradition of philanthropy that will ultimately help the world become a much better place”. Earlier this year, Gates donated $4.6bn (£3.5bn) to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the biggest gift so far this year. The Gateses have donated $35bn since 1994. Of the £1.83bn donated in the UK last year, £1bn came from foundations, £511m from companies and £313m from individuals. The amount donated directly by individuals decreased by more than £100m compared with 2015 and was half of that donated in 2007. The number of people donating £1m or more was 43, down from 48 last year but up from the 42 in 2007. Among the individual donors were golfer Rory McIlroy, designer Sir Terence Conran, Gordon Roddick, the husband of late Body Shop founder Anita, and Liccy Dahl, the wife of the late author Roald. McIlory donated all of his €666,000 prize for winning the Irish Open to his Rory Foundation, which aims to support children’s charities and “help kids live better lives”. “I know I’d like to be remembered as for my talents as a golfer, but I also intend to leave my mark through the Rory Foundation,” McIlroy said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/20/japans-ghostly-housing-problem","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T19:16:10Z","webTitle":"Japan’s ghostly housing problem | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/20/japans-ghostly-housing-problem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/20/japans-ghostly-housing-problem","fields":{"headline":"Japan’s ghostly housing problem","bodyText":"Your article (17 November) on why Japanese houses tend to be torn down after a 30-year period was quite informative, but failed to touch on one rather significant point.

There is a widespread superstition in Japan regarding ghosts, and particularly in the cases of suicide or murder – and almost no one will be interested in renting the property. I know of one landlord who decided to tear down and rebuild after a suicide in one of his apartment units because, once he had rebuilt, he no longer had to list the death as having occurred on the property.

The BBC team used a TV rather than a music theatre or studio to review the final mix so they could understand how the natural history programme would sound in a family living room and set the narration, music and sound effects to the appropriate levels. The BBC has faced a significant number of complaints about sound in its programmes, including viewers saying they cannot hear what is being said in drama programmes and music being too loud. The broadcaster has revealed it is reviewing the music in the remaining episodes of the BBC1 drama series Howards End after complaints that it was too loud and overpowered the dialogue. In response to those complaints, the BBC said: “The BBC takes audibility very seriously and the producers thought carefully about the sound and music in advance of transmission. The sound quality and level was carefully checked before the film was shown and it met industry technical standards. “That said, we take comments from our viewers very seriously and are looking at ways to refine the music for the remaining episodes of Howards End.” Blue Planet II features music by the composer Hans Zimmer, as well as sound effects added after scenes were filmed. The BBC has received complaints about the loudness of Zimmer’s score and the added sound effects, but James Honeyborne, the executive producer of Blue Planet II, said the makers of the programme had worked hard to get the right balance. “There’s a lot going on with narration, with music, with sound, and that’s why you mix it to try to get those levels right and an evenly paced television experience. That takes place in a big music theatre,” he told the Radio Times. “But what perhaps people don’t know is that we then huddle around the TV in the corner of this huge room, and we sit and we actually listen to the finished film and do the final mix review on a normal television, because it’s all very well doing it in a big music theatre but at the end of the day this is being made for a television audience, and you need to check that you’ve got everything as right as you can. We absolutely try to get the balance right.” Blue Planet II has been an overwhelming ratings success for the BBC so far. The first episode was the most watched programme of 2017, with 14.1 million people tuning in. Its audience has been larger than those for the rival Sunday night shows Strictly Come Dancing and X Factor, and the programme has been particularly popular with 16- to-34-year-olds. Honeyborne said: “The original Blue Planet series in 2001 was broadcast immediately after the horror of the Twin Towers and people connected with it because of a sense of despair about the world. Is the same thing going on now? “I think you’re right that people do like to escape to natural history, and the respect and love for Sir David [Attenborough, the narrator] is still very much there. He is the master storyteller. “I’m sure there are multiple factors, but at the heart of this I do get a sense, looking at the demographics, that more young people are watching – there’s a key environmental interest by the younger generation coming in to play. It’s interesting that one of the most used words on Twitter and discussions around the first episode was ‘amazed’.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"gnm-press-office/2017/nov/20/the-guardian-receives-greenaccord-international-media-award","type":"article","sectionId":"gnm-press-office","sectionName":"GNM press office","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T14:15:21Z","webTitle":"The Guardian receives Greenaccord International Media Award","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2017/nov/20/the-guardian-receives-greenaccord-international-media-award","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/gnm-press-office/2017/nov/20/the-guardian-receives-greenaccord-international-media-award","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian receives Greenaccord International Media Award","bodyText":"The Guardian has been honoured with the Greenaccord International Media Award.

It is a campaign that is not about Brexit. It is not about our struggling health service or our underfunded schools. It is not about building more houses or reforming social care and yet it is vital for all these things. It is a campaign to save our parliamentary democracy. I will give it my wholehearted support, and I urge you to do so too. The government is already using the EU (withdrawal) bill to grant itself new powers to bypass parliament. Now the recently published trade bill has compounded this attempt to undermine the capacity of MPs to hold the executive to account and scrutinise legislation. It will sign us up to a host of treaty obligations that parliament will be powerless to oppose. I seem to remember that we were told that Brexit was about bringing sovereign powers back to the UK parliament – not to hand them over to Theresa May and the executive. And I am absolutely sure that no one voted to hand over those powers to her trade secretary, Liam Fox. The government’s trade bill is supposed to set the legislative framework according to which all our future trade agreements with other countries will be scrutinised and rendered democratically accountable in parliament. The Institute for Government recommended that the bill should include a guarantee that all future trade deals would be granted a full parliamentary debate and a vote. Yet the government has ignored this and every other recommendation to ensure proper parliamentary scrutiny of our trade relations with other states. Instead it proposes to roll over existing EU trade deals even when they have not been ratified, and to smuggle through future deals via a procedure that is an affront to democracy. Under an archaic gentleman’s agreement called the Ponsonby rule that dates back to 1924, the government will be obliged only to lay the text of a new trade treaty before parliament for 21 sitting days before it passes into law automatically. No need for a debate. Certainly no need for a vote. The government has confirmed that it wants to use this procedure to ratify future trade deals after we leave the EU, as provided for by the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010. The only way for MPs to object to a trade agreement during the 21-day period is via an opposition day debate. Yet there is no need for the government to grant such a debate. In fact, the current government refused to schedule a single opposition day debate between February and September this year. And even if we get a debate and win it, the government does not have to change tack. Under this absurd rule, it only has to write a letter explaining why it disagrees with parliament and insist on its own way. Labour is calling for a thorough overhaul of this procedure. Treaties negotiated with foreign powers create binding obligations on future generations that cannot be repealed in the way that domestic law can. As a consequence, the most rigorous process should be in place to scrutinise such treaties before they ever come to be ratified. Labour believes that every trade deal should come before parliament for a full debate on the floor of the House of Commons, with a vote at the end of that debate. There should also be a new committee with scrutiny powers similar to those currently enjoyed by the European scrutiny committee, which has been able to call the government to account over every trade deal signed at the European level. MPs should be able to debate, amend and approve a mandate for the negotiation of any trade agreement before talks start, based on an independent impact assessment of what social, economic and environmental risks might be expected. And MPs should have access to the consolidated texts of those agreements as they are being formulated, as a basic right of access to the information that they need to do their job of representing their constituents and holding the government to account. This government has a particular aversion to transparency. It was only after months of protest by me and other Labour politicians that Liam Fox finally opened a reading room for MPs to even be allowed to see the text of the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the EU and US. I was the first MP to use the reading room, and I had to hand over my mobile phone and any other recording device as a condition of entry. I was forced to sign a confidentiality clause prohibiting me from sharing any of the details that I read with anyone else. To add insult to injury, the government had stalled for so long that the TTIP negotiations were already over by the time I was given access to the room. More than 120 MPs from across all six opposition parties that sit in Westminster have signed the two early day motions calling for the government to respect parliamentary scrutiny of trade deals. This makes them together the second most widely supported of all 550 early day motions currently before parliament. The campaign I will help launch this week is backed by the public sector trade union Unison as well as Global Justice Now, War on Want and other members of the Trade Justice Movement. It seeks to restore parliament’s sovereign right to decide who we conclude special trade agreements with in the future, and on what terms. Today’s trade agreements touch on so many social and economic aspects of our common life, as well as the protections we afford the natural world. It would be a savage irony if Theresa May’s final political epitaph were to be: “She returned powers to the UK only to leave us with even less democratic oversight than we had in the EU.” • Barry Gardiner is shadow secretary of state for international trade, energy and climate change.

They are unresponsive, not breathing. Do you perform CPR? No doubt you like to think that you would. But what if the unlucky person was a woman? The question may seem redundant, but unfortunately it is not: a study this month found that women are less likely than men to get CPR from a bystander, and are more likely to die. The research, funded by the American Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health, found that only 39% of women who have a cardiac arrest in a public place were given CPR, versus 45% of men. Men were 23% more likely to survive and one of the study leaders, Benjamin Abella, speculated that rescuers may worry about moving a woman’s clothing, or touching her breasts. One idea mooted was more realistic-looking practice mannequins to account for the female torso. It is hard to know what to make of the research, or where to place it in the panoply of ways in which women get short shrift. Medical care – which, at its essence, is about keeping people alive – should, of course, be free of gender bias. Naturally, however, it is not. This is not to discount the ways in which men fare badly within the system, particularly when it comes to mental health. Race and poverty also feed into bias in healthcare – both huge topics in their own rights. But there is no shortage of ways in which women are discriminated against in medicine. This is evident throughout history, from Aristotle’s distinction between the superior male “form” and inferior female “matter”, to the medieval idea that women (“leaky vessels”) were unbalanced due to their wombs. In antiquity, doctors recommended marriage as a cure for female psychological disorders, and the Victorians had an unfortunate habit of committing women to asylums, regardless of evidence of mental illness. Today, while female GPs outnumber male ones (52% to 48%), 55% of registered medical practitioners are male. And the majority of specialists – 66% – are men. For patients, the stereotype runs thus: men are less aware of health problems than women, less attuned to symptoms and they don’t visit the doctor as often as women. In other words, men are silent stoics; women hysterical hypochondriacs. There is evidence for this, to an extent – government statistics published in 2010 showed that women were more likely than men to say they were in poor health, but less likely to die over the following five years. But this does not explain what happens to women when they genuinely need treatment. In 2001, University of Maryland academics Diane Hoffman and Anita Tarzian published The Girl Who Cried Pain, an analysis of the ways gender bias plays out in clinical pain management. They examined several previous studies, including one that indicated women are more likely to be given sedatives for their pain and men given pain medication, and concluded that women were more likely to be inadequately treated by healthcare providers. Several authors attribute this to “a long history within our culture of regarding women’s reasoning capacity as limited”, the paper noted. In the 16 years since the paper was published, has anything changed? Probably not, says Tarzian, a programme coordinator at the University of Maryland’s school of law. “Every time you think things have changed, you look at the news and you think, ‘Hmm, maybe they haven’t.’ It still happens because that attitude people have towards gender is so inherent it’s hard to even be aware of – it’s subconscious.” Julia Buckley, a freelance journalist, can attest to this. Having had chronic pain since her teens, she was dismissed by doctors, told by a dentist she was “making it up” and, when she asked for physiotherapy on her arm so she could return to work, she was told to wait for a year, because she had already had physio on her leg. “I was gaslighted,” she says. “I don’t think I would have been treated that way if I were a man, and the psychological turmoil I was put through made everything worse.” She was finally diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, an inherited condition that affects connective tissue, five years ago, aged 31, and has written a book about her experiences, Heal Me: In Search of a Cure, which is out in January. “Women need to be pushier, and not revere doctors so much,” she says. “I respect doctors, but they’re not infallible.” Tarzian agrees. The traditional medical system disadvantages women, who, unlike men, are socialised to question themselves, she says: “There’s an extra value for women to trust their instincts.” Nowhere is this more evident than when it comes to gynaecological conditions, such as endometriosis. One in 10 women suffer from the disease, but it takes, on average, seven to eight years to be diagnosed. Emma Cox, the chief executive of the charity Endometriosis UK, says that unless women with the disease are trying to conceive, they are often overlooked by doctors. “The attitude is that women are there to have babies,” she says. It took Kaye Sedgwick Jones, a freelance illustrator and designer from Kent, more than 12 years to be diagnosed. In pain and seeking help, she was told by one doctor: “‘It’ll be better when you’ve had a baby’ ... which, when you’re 13, is a weird thing to be told,” she says. When she was finally diagnosed, at age 25, her first reaction was “sheer anger. I was livid. For so many years I was told the pain was in my head.” In September, new guidelines were published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), in a bid to speed up diagnosis of endometriosis. Nice added that the NHS must “listen to women”. Sedgwick Jones, now 36, has decided not to have children, although she once wanted them. An earlier diagnosis, she says, could have made a difference. “I wasn’t taken seriously because I was a young woman,” she says. “I can’t imagine why it is still so difficult for a woman to walk into a GP’s office and say: ‘Help me, I’m in pain.’” Dementia care is another area where women draw the short straw. In 2016, researchers at University College London found that women with dementia receive worse medical treatment than men with the condition. Namely, they make fewer visits to the GP, receive less health monitoring and take more potentially harmful medication than men. “We know very clearly what’s happening, but we can’t clearly explain why from that data,” said Dr Claudia Cooper, who led the study. One factor, she says, could be that women, who live longer than men, are more likely to be alone and thus less likely to have a primary carer to help them. “Two-thirds of people over 80 are women,” she says. “But they are the marginalised majority.” This is a big, unwieldy issue is a discussion that is perhaps too amorphous for some. Health charities the King’s Fund, the Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation, along with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, were all approached for comment for this article but failed to provide anyone to talk to. For Buckley, gender bias in healthcare is an epidemic that needs to be addressed: “People are dying because they are female and doctors are blinded by their gender,” she says. “Don’t assume that women are hysterical. That’s quite basic. Treat everyone as a person.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/nov/20/a-festive-garbage-clam-the-problem-with-ivanka-trumps-thanksgiving-centrepiece","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T16:51:57Z","webTitle":"A ‘festive garbage clam’: the problem with Ivanka Trump’s Thanksgiving centrepiece","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/nov/20/a-festive-garbage-clam-the-problem-with-ivanka-trumps-thanksgiving-centrepiece","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/nov/20/a-festive-garbage-clam-the-problem-with-ivanka-trumps-thanksgiving-centrepiece","fields":{"headline":"A ‘festive garbage clam’: the problem with Ivanka Trump’s Thanksgiving centrepiece","bodyText":"‘Have no idea how to decorate your Thanksgiving table? Problem solved,” read the tweet from Ivanka Trump HQ. But the link to what her website described as a “bold and unexpected Thanksgiving tablescape” looked more like a problem created: a giant clamshell filled with little grey pumpkins, moss, pine cones and driftwood. Welcome to the weird and twisted world of the Thanksgiving centrepiece. At this time of year, US magazines and newspapers are full of articles explaining how to make an annual holiday way more stressful than it needs to be. Included will be lots of tips and instructions for producing a striking and wholly unnecessary table decoration designed to take up space that might be more profitably occupied by food. Thanksgiving centrepieces vary widely in execution, but they’re meant to have an autumn-harvest vibe and they generally contain some combination of flowers, gourds, leaves and pine cones, as if you were recreating a patch of ground and dumping it on a table where people are trying to eat. The centrepiece promoted by Ivanka Trump’s Twitter account (“views expressed are the brand’s own”) was created by the interior designer Allison Domonoske, and was widely and roundly mocked on social media. The shell, brimming over with an artful assemblage of exotic produce, balloon-plant milkweed, green moss, “driftwood that I found at the beach” and what looks like a few handfuls of generic undergrowth, was labelled a “festive garbage clam” by one tweeter. It’s an extreme, but by no means exceptional, example of the form, which always treads a fine line between primary school project and madness. The US obsession with festive decoration is at its height in the long stretch between Halloween and Christmas, and there are plenty of websites dedicated to the idea that if you haven’t spray-painted a dozen pears gold today, you’re just not trying. But if you’re worried about where you’re going to find a giant clam this time of year, fear not: according to Ivanka’s website, “they’re everywhere right now in home decor”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2017/nov/20/roy-moore-sexual-assault-accuser-tells-of-struggle-to-regain-self-esteem","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T16:47:56Z","webTitle":"Roy Moore sexual assault accuser tells of struggle to regain self-esteem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/20/roy-moore-sexual-assault-accuser-tells-of-struggle-to-regain-self-esteem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/nov/20/roy-moore-sexual-assault-accuser-tells-of-struggle-to-regain-self-esteem","fields":{"headline":"Roy Moore sexual assault accuser tells of struggle to regain self-esteem","bodyText":"The woman who first spoke out to accuse Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexually assaulting her when she was 14 said on Monday it took her a long time to get her self-esteem back after she blamed herself for what she says happened. Leigh Corfman was 14 in 1979 when she alleges Moore, then 32, took her to his house, removed most of her clothes, groped her and put her hand on his genitals. He took her back to her home when she told him she was uncomfortable and wanted to leave, but she was emotionally scarred for decades after, she said. Moore denies the allegations. “I felt guilty, I felt I was the one to blame. It took years for me to regain confidence in myself,” Corfman told NBC’s Today show on Monday morning. “I was a child trying to play in an adult world. I had been reading romances and I was expecting candlelight and roses, and what I got was very different,” she said. Corfman said she had slipped out from her home to meet Moore without telling anyone. Moore, then an assistant district attorney, had approached her as she sat with her mother on a bench in the hallway of the courthouse where he worked and struck up an acquaintance. Later, he called and asked her out. “I would not exactly call it a date, it was a meet. At 14 I was not dating,” she said. “I met him around the corner from my house and my mother didn’t know.” Moore, a former judge, is the Republican candidate for the special election in Alabama taking place on 12 December to fill the seat vacated when the Republican US senator Jeff Sessions was appointed attorney general by Donald Trump. But in recent weeks, nine women have come forward to accuse him of a variety of inappropriate behavior ranging from pestering them for dates as teens to the alleged assault on Corfman as a 14-year-old, as first revealed by the Washington Post. Moore denies all the allegations. The Republican party nationally has withdrawn support for him but, although he is behind in the polls, the party in Alabama continues to support him. On Monday, Corfman said that after she agreed to meet Moore, he took her to his house in the woods and put blankets on the floor of the living room. “And proceeded to seduce me, I guess you would say,” she said. After he removed most of her clothing, he left the room and returned in his underwear. He touched her sexually over what remained of her clothing, she said. “He tried to get me to touch him as well. At that point I pulled back and said I was not comfortable and I got dressed and he took me home.” She told some close friends, who advised her to shun him.. The next time he called she made excuses. But the effects of that encounter affected her emotional wellbeing and future relationships, she said. “It took away a lot of the specialness about interactions with men. It took some trust away,” she said. Later, she told more friends and her family. But she still felt guilty and as though the encounter had been her fault. “It took decades for me to let that go,” she said. Several times as an adult and single mother she thought about confronting Moore at the courthouse, but she was afraid it would adversely affect her small children’s lives. Alabama’s largest newspaper on Sunday called for voters to “stand for decency, reject Roy Moore”. The revelations have come during an apparent watershed for revelations of sexual misconduct of public figures. The careers of film mogul Harvey Weinstein, comedian Louis CK, actor Kevin Spacey and others have been rocked in recent weeks.In the fallout there have been widespread allegations against unnamed members of Congress and an apology from Democratic Senator Al Franken for assailing a female journalist during his comedy career days, as well as accusations by an Olympic gymnast against a team doctor, echoing a litany of past complaints in the sports world. This comes hard on the heels of the fall of senior figures at Fox News for sexual harassment and as the re-trial of TV comedy star Bill Cosby is awaited next year on rape charges. In addition, multiple allegations of sexual predation and harassment against Donald Trump are still stalking the presidency, while his past boasting of getting away with sexual misconduct and intruding on beauty pageant contestants while they were changing, because he was famous, continues to resonate. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said last week that Bill Clinton should have resigned as president, amid a reappraisal of allegations, which he has denied, of sexual misconduct and exploitation during the 1980s and 1990s. Trump has denied all the specific allegations against him by individuals. And he signaled via his spokeswoman last week that Roy Moore should step aside in the race “if these allegations are true”. But Trump also needs the Senate seat from Alabama to remain in GOP hands, as he continues to struggle with getting any legislation passed in Congress. While Corfman was talking to NBC on Monday, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, appeared on Fox News’s morning show hinting that voters should still cast their ballots for Moore. “I’m telling you that we want the votes in the Senate to get this tax bill through,” Conway said. Moore has said he does not know Corfman. “I wonder how many ‘me’s he doesn’t know,” she said wryly on Monday. Asked about her political view on the subject, she said: “I have voted as a Republican for years and years and years but this is not political for me, this is personal. It’s very close to my heart,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27369","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T00:00:27Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,369","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27369","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27369","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,369","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/21/i-was-like-a-slave-how-workers-are-trapped-in-a-wage-nightmare","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T19:00:37Z","webTitle":"'I was like a slave': how workers are trapped in a wage nightmare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/21/i-was-like-a-slave-how-workers-are-trapped-in-a-wage-nightmare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/21/i-was-like-a-slave-how-workers-are-trapped-in-a-wage-nightmare","fields":{"headline":"'I was like a slave': how workers are trapped in a wage nightmare","bodyText":"For Muhammad* a 457 temporary visa to work as a cook in Australia turned from a great opportunity into a nightmare of low wages, 55 to 70-hour work weeks and constant fear that he would lose his sponsorship and be deported. Now being helped by Legal Aid in New South Wales, Muhammad is taking his former employer – a cafe owner in Sydney – to court to claim almost $152,000 in back wages, entitlements and superannuation that he says should have been paid. Attempts at mediation have failed and he now faces the prospect of a court battle. Muhammad came to Australia in 2006 from the Indian subcontinent to study marketing and then a masters in accounting. In 2011 he returned to Australia under a 457 visa to work as a chef. The first restaurant in Darling Harbour that sponsored him was good to work for, he said. But then he transferred to another establishment and his problems began. He was initially employed to work 38 hours a week on a wage of $52,000 a year. But it soon became apparent his employers expected many more hours from him. The cafe/restaurant opened at 7am and closed at 9pm. Often he was expected to work split shifts or without a lunch break. He found himself expected to work six, even seven days a week. “I was like a slave,” he said. “They said if I didn’t do the hours they would send me home. They threatened to have me kicked out of the country.” That would have put an end to his plan to seek permanent residency and join his brother and sister in Australia. Muhammad said the other chef, from Nepal, did even longer hours. “If I was sick, they would require me to make up the hours,” he said. “I had three days off sick and had to make them up.” Muhammad also claimed his employers used to demand money back, again with the threat of withdrawing the sponsorship. Pay days were ad hoc and he could go three weeks without being paid. With the long hours he found it almost impossible to look for an alternative job that would sponsor him. “I just tried to keep calm as I knew I would eventually get residency,” he said. Now that he had his permanent status, Muhammad is prepared to take on his former employer. But for many people on temporary visas, their ability to even seek redress is limited. * Muhammad is a pseudonym."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/20/monday-briefing-may-under-pressure-to-justify-40bn-brexit-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T06:28:25Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: May under pressure to justify £40bn Brexit bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/20/monday-briefing-may-under-pressure-to-justify-40bn-brexit-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/20/monday-briefing-may-under-pressure-to-justify-40bn-brexit-bill","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: May under pressure to justify £40bn Brexit bill","bodyText":"Top story: PM to chair crunch cabinet committee meeting Good morning. I’m Martin Farrer and welcome to the Guardian’s daily briefing. Whether you’ve just got up or you’re on your way to work, here are the top stories this Monday morning. Theresa May will chair a crucial cabinet committee meeting today in an attempt to thrash out agreement about the price Britain should pay Brussels to leave the EU. Pro-Brexit ministers such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are understood to be lobbying the prime minsiter to spell out exactly what the country will receive in return for a final divorce payment now expected to be around £40bn – much more than the £20bn May has offered. In particular they want to ensure that Britain secures the best possible deal to negotiate its future trading relationship with Europe. Pro-remain ministers are equally keen to make sure the deal does not lead to a hard Brexit. It comes as the British aerospace industry warns MPs that the failure to agree a trade deal could cost it £1.5bn and the Food Foundation says that healthy eating targets could become unaffordable for millions of low-income families because of Brexit-related higher prices. The triple impact of exchange rates, labour costs and tariffs could add up to £158 a year to the amount a family of four spends on fruit and vegetables, it says. Brexit could also fatally damage the legacy of the Irish peace process – the soft border between north and south that has done so much to transform relations between the two communities. A Guardian editorial today says that Brexit could be “deeply destructive” to the hard-won peace and a “gratuitous act of hostility towards the Irish economy and people”. * * * Cult killer dead – Charles Manson, the cult leader and one of the most notorious murderers of the 20th century, has died in hospital aged 83. Manson was convicted of masterminding the shocking murders of the pregnant actor Sharon Tate and six others in 1969. Members of his cult, known as the Manson Family, broke into Tate’s home in Los Angeles when her husband, film-maker Roman Polanksi, was away and stabbed and shot her and four visitors. The word “Pig” was written in blood on the front door. They killed two more people the next night. After being jailed for life, Manson applied numerous times for parole but without success. Read our obituary of Manson here. * * * I’m staying, says Mugabe – Zimbabwe risks being engulfed by chaos after its president, Robert Mugabe, failed to announce his resignation as widely expected in a televised national address on Sunday night. The 93-year-old autocrat instead set out his new policy plans and ignored calls to quit from his ruling Zanu PF party, street protesters and army generals. Mugabe said “we cannot be guided by bitterness” and said he thought the army coup last week “did not amount to a threat to our well-cherished constitutional order”. The president, who has been in power for 37 years, could now face impeachment when parliament reconvenes on Tuesday amid fears that he is trying to provoke the army into forcing him out of office in the hope of triggering an intervention from his allies in the government of regional power broker, South Africa. Read this dispatch from Emma Graham-Harrison in Harare on the fiery Zanu PF meeting that hoped to usher in the post-Mugabe era. * * * No blame for attacks – Internal inquiries will clear MI5 and the police of any blame in failing to prevent the terror attacks that took place in Manchester and London earlier this year, the Guardian has learned. The official reviews were carried out by the security agency and the police themselves but were overseen by a barrister. MI5 received information about the Manchester attacker, Salman Abedi, which could have been given a higher priority but the review said that conclusion benefited from hindsight and there was nothing to suggest that clear chances were missed to stop any of the attacks that killed 36 people. The reviews recommend a new computer algorithm to detect terrorist activity and better collaboration between agencies. * * * Degree of anger – Glynis Breakwell, the vice-chancellor of Bath University, is facing calls for her to resign after it was revealed that she received two separate pay increases for the current academic year. Breakwell, a world-renowned social psychologist, was already the highest paid vice-chancellor in Britain with a salary and benefits package worth £451,000. But a freedom of information request has revealed that she received the 1.1% national pay award and an extra 2.8% from the university’s remuneration committee to nudge her up to £468,000. Former Labour education secretary Lord Adonis said the new increase was a “disgrace” and said she should quit. * * * Dunham says sorry – Girls actor Lena Dunham has apologised after initially defending a writer on the show, Murray Miller, who was accused of raping actor Aurora Perrineau when she was 17. Dunham had said that she was “confident” Miller’s case was one of the 3% of sexual assault cases that was misreported. Miller has denied the allegations. Lunchtime read: Cracking the classroom code Politicians are quick to highlight the growing digitalisation of the economy and what it means for our domestic and working lives. But John Harris thinks it’s a national scandal that our children are not being prepared for this new reality. He highlights that despite then-education secretary Michael Gove’s call for a revolution in the teaching of computing, more than half of England’s schools still do not offer computer science GCSEs. Only 11% of pupils ended up sitting the exam at the last count. Our columnist says we need young people who can “hack, code, and find out what might lie beyond the Facebook era. Without them, we will sink.” Sport Following the victory over Australia, Eddie Jones has challenged his England side to make further history by clinching a record third consecutive Six Nations title next year and has given his strongest indication yet that Dylan Hartley is set to continue as captain. Britain’s elite athletes “have fewer rights than an Uber driver” and desperately need an independent watchdog to protect them, the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee has warned. David Moyes has appealed for unity among West Ham United supporters after watching his new team slump to a 2-0 defeat at Watford in his first match, leaving them marooned in the relegation zone. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has revealed the career threatening injury he sustained in April was more than the “significant knee ligament damage” that Manchester United characterised it as being at the time. Grigor Dimitrov edged out David Goffin in a thriller to win the World Tour Finals title in London and give a remarkable tennis season the denouement it deserved. And days after claiming credit for ensuring that three UCLA college basketball players were released after being arrested for shoplifting in China, Donald Trump tweeted that “I should have left them in jail!”. Business The euro fell sharply on Asian markets overnight after talks in Germany to form a coalition government collapsed. The single currency lost 0.4% against the pound to sit at €1.124, and fell 0.6% against the yen and 0.5% on the US dollar. Two influential parliamentary committees have today called on the government to change the law to protect workers in the gig economy and close the loopholes that allow “irresponsible companies to underpay workers”. The papers It’s Monday. This normally means a mixed bag of stories on the front pages. But there is one theme in the “broadsheets” at least – Mugabe. The Times leads with the defiance of Zimbabwe’s still-president saying that he used a rambling speech to cling on to power. The Telegraph says the old despot “stunned the world” with his TV appearance and that street protests would now continue. The Guardian splash headline is “Chaos in Zimbabwe after Mugabe refuses to resign”. The Sun has a double package of I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here and a story about British Gas prices on its front. The utility is to scrap its standard electricity and gas tariffs after a campaign by the paper. The Mail says some universities have been hiring private investigators to snoop on the wealth of ex-students in the hope that they can then be targeted for donations. The Mirror splashes with news that former Conservative defence ministers have issued a call to stop army cutbacks, saying the UK is being made vulnerable.

New Zealand PM regrets 'yarn' about Trump","bodyText":"New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has expressed regret over gossiping about a meeting with Donald Trump after it was reported the US president may have mistaken her for Justin Trudeau’s wife. Ardern was visibly uncomfortable when asked about reports that she had revealed details of the encounter at the East Asia summit in Vietnam last week to a friend who later went public. The friend – comedian Tom Sainsbury – revealed in a radio interview that Ardern had told her Trump was “not as orange in real life” and that he had been confused about her identity. Sainsbury said: “[Ardern] said that Donald Trump was confused for a good amount of time in thinking that she was Justin Trudeau’s wife.” Ardern, when questioned about this, said she did not want to turn the issue into a “diplomatic incident”, or discuss everything that occurred behind the scenes. But the prime minister, whose appearance at the high-profile summit was her first major international test since being elected, stressed that when she was formally introduced to Trump he seemed to know who she was. “Second-hand someone observed that they thought that it happened, but in all my interaction, certainly President Trump didn’t seem to have confused me when I interacted with him. But someone else observed this,” Ardern said, explaining the incident. Ardern would not reveal who the person was who observed the alleged case of mistaken identity, but said it was not someone in her team, nor was it a New Zealander. Ardern said she had told the “full story” of the incident to two people in New Zealand, but would not budge when asked to share the full story with TVNZ host Jack Tame, who questioned her for six minutes on the topic. Ardern then said she would not make the same mistake of sharing a backstage “yarn” again – as Chinese whispers had brought the story to the attention of the media, which was not her intention. “I’m in a circle, I am with someone else, I did not hear the full conversation, they observed what they believe to be mistaken identity, I didn’t pick that up. I then had an interaction that suggested he [Donald Trump] knew who I was, that was at the point where I was properly introduced which probably cleared it up.” Ardern said. Tame continued pressing Ardern on whether she had told the full truth regarding the incident, or whether she had misled New Zealanders. Ardern responded: “Jack, at this point I don’t want to give away every single element of conversation I have with another world leader, because I accept that things happen behind the scenes, that I’m not always going to give the full details around. “Tom’s a mate of mine. I shared a story with him, he shared it with someone else, I can see how that then spirals ... it is a trifling matter. “It was a bit of a funny yarn, something that I don’t want to cause a diplomatic incident over. “I think I should never have recounted the story.” Ardern said. This is not the first time Ardern has revealed unusually sensitive information about her dealings with the US president. In a wide-ranging interview with Newsroom last week, Ardern described how she joked with Donald Trump when they first met, telling the US president: “No one marched when I was elected.” She said the president didn’t seem to take offence, but only realised later that the remark could have backfired."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/20/five-a-day-eating-targets-will-be-unaffordable-for-millions-after-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T00:01:14Z","webTitle":"Five-a-day eating targets 'will be unaffordable for millions after Brexit'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/20/five-a-day-eating-targets-will-be-unaffordable-for-millions-after-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/20/five-a-day-eating-targets-will-be-unaffordable-for-millions-after-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Five-a-day eating targets 'will be unaffordable for millions after Brexit'","bodyText":"Five-a-day eating targets for fruit and vegetables could become unaffordable for millions of low-income families as a result of Brexit-related food price rises, a report says. The Food Foundation says that already-feeble consumption rates of healthy food in the UK could nosedive under Brexit because the triple impact of exchange rates, labour costs and tariffs could add up to £158 a year to the amount a family of four spends on fruit and vegetables. The thinktank warns that the poorest families – which spend the biggest proportion of their household budget on food – will be hardest hit, and calls for an expanded healthy food voucher system to help boost household nutrition in deprived areas. Attempts by the Department of Health to encourage people to eat more fruit and vegetables – a key strand of its strategy to reduce the burden on the NHS of diet-related illness, such as obesity – would be undermined by Brexit food price rises, the report adds. “Inflation resulting from unfavourable exchange rates, the rising costs of seasonal labour and a heavy tariff bill resulting from a ‘no-deal Brexit’ scenario combine to mean that purchasing a variety of fruit and vegetables on a daily basis could become unaffordable for millions of British households,” it says. Currently just 8% of children aged 11-18 achieve government targets of consuming five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. Just 27% of adults aged 10-64 reach the five-a-day benchmark, as do 35% of adults over the age of 64, the report says. The warning comes amid rising concerns over the nutritional impact of austerity measures and welfare cuts on the poorest families. The UK has the second highest rates of food insecurity in Europe, with about 4 million adults struggling to put healthy food on the table on a regular basis. Earlier this year, Food Standards Agency (FSA) data showed that 17% of UK adults worried about food supplies running out before they had enough money to buy more, while 8% said they experienced hunger or went whole days without eating because of a lack of money. Under a no-deal Brexit, the price of achieving five portions-a-day for a typical family of four would go up from £37.58 a week to £39.76 a week (from £1,954 a year to £2,067). The cost for that family of consuming at least seven portions a day – as recommended by health experts – would be £2,894 a year. Meeting that target would account for almost half of the entire food budget of the poorest 10% of the population, the foundation says. Eating at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke and cancer. In the UK, the poorest families are significantly more likely not to achieve the targets than wealthier households. The foundation estimates that at least 33 of the UK’s 50 most popular fruit and vegetables would be directly affected by new trade rules with the EU. Almost half of all vegetables and 83% of fruit is imported, while homegrown produce is highly dependent on EU migrant labour. Policy measures to increase production of homegrown fruit and vegetables such as apples, broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes could ease the impact on UK household food budgets, it says. It calls on the government to invest in horticultural production by: Putting in place measures to secure seasonal labour. Offering capital grants to farmers to expand production of key crops. Introducing guidance to ensure British-grown fruit and vegetables are prominent in meals served in schools, hospitals and jails. “The government faces a clear choice to boost British harvests of fruit and veg or the NHS will reap the consequences,” said Anna Taylor, the chief executive officer of the Food Foundation. The foundation is an independent thinktank set up by former Conservative MP Laura Sandys."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/19/zlatan-ibrahimovic-injury-more-severe","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T22:30:12Z","webTitle":"Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s long-term injury was ‘more severe than revealed’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/19/zlatan-ibrahimovic-injury-more-severe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/19/zlatan-ibrahimovic-injury-more-severe","fields":{"headline":"Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s long-term injury was ‘more severe than revealed’","bodyText":"Zlatan Ibrahimovic has revealed the career threatening injury he sustained in April was more than the “significant knee ligament damage” that Manchester United characterised it as being at the time. The Swede made his comeback in the 4-1 win against Newcastle United at Old Trafford on Saturday, entering proceedings on 77 minutes as a replacement for Anthony Martial. It was the 36‑year‑old’s first action since sustaining the injury on 20 April playing against Anderlecht in the Europa League. While the problem was considered grave enough to question whether Ibrahimovic would play again, he stated it was actually more dire than previously known. “If people knew the real injury, they would be in shock that I was even playing. It was more than the knee but I will keep it personal – that’s why I choose not to talk of it,” he said. “In my recovery I have not rushed anything; I have been out for six and half months. I have been following protocol and my schedule day by day. The only secret has been working hard. Those close to me know what I have been doing. I was working five, six hours a day. “When it happened I said giving up was not an option. My only focus was on coming back and coming back better. I know it’s my head playing, not my knee; my knee has to follow. With my experience and career I know what I have to do but I feel good. I am very proud of the moment to play again and for everyone around me because I wouldn’t have done it alone. Thanks to the supporters for keeping me motivated, the coach who’s trusted me, the club that believes in me and my family obviously.” Ibrahimovic received a rousing reception. “It was an amazing reaction from fans but I felt it from day one,” he said. “From the first step in the warm-up, with people singing and cheering for you, it’s what keeps you going. This was not a one-man work, it was everyone’s and thanks to them that I am back on field and can play.” Paul Pogba also made his comeback from a hamstring injury and was instrumental in United’s victory. Rafael Benítez’s side took the led through a 14th-minute Dwight Gayle goal before Pogba took over. First he created Antony Martial’s 37th-minute equaliser by driving down the right and crossing for the Frenchman to head home. Then, after Chris Smalling put United ahead just before half-time, Pogba scored United’s third on 54 minutes following a smart Marcus Rashford header. Romelu Lukaku broke a personal seven-game drought on 70 minutes for his 17th of the season as José Mourinho’s team kept the gap to the leaders, Manchester City, to eight points. Of being able to overhaul Pep Guardiola’s side, Ibrahimovic said: “We can chase City. Why is it not a possibility? We are all here because we want to win and we need to because they are first.” On Pogba he said: “I can talk of what Paul brings – big quality. It was like he hasn’t been injured for a month. He brings such big quality, a different quality, and I bring experience and mine. I try to help the guys as much as possible and do what I can.” Marcos Rojo, who sustained a serious knee injury in the same game as Ibrahimovic, also returned to the match-day squad. “This week the manager’s been very happy because he has a full team for the first time this season and as a coach you want those opportunities and alternatives to make changes,” Ibrahimovic said. “We just need to pick and choose. He knows what he is doing even when the number of players are limited because he’s a winner and has been winning every season.” Ibrahimovic believes United can win the title and the Champions League. “I think there is a possibility for everything. We were early into it [side’s development] last year and won two trophies and we are stronger this season. We believe we can do it. To win and get the trophies.” Regarding whether he will extend his one-year contract the forward said: “At the moment I am just thankful I can play football again. I don’t know what the future brings but what happens happens. I am at the age where I can choose what I want to do. I don’t sign five- or 10-year deals. I am just happy to be back playing and doing what I am good at. “José said: ‘Do whatever you want. I trust in you and you know what you have to do.’ So I was not worried. The contract is all paperwork and I do the physical work.” Ibrahimovic did not sign on for United again until August. “Even if I had a contract or not, I needed to train. The other’s up to the other people,” he said. “I knew I would stay because I wanted to stay. The numbers have never been an issue. I could’ve signed a deal after two months but didn’t because I am honest with myself. I want to stay because I can perform.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/20/british-athletes-uk-sport-rights-damian-collins","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T00:01:14Z","webTitle":"British athletes have ‘fewer rights than an Uber driver’ says Damian Collins MP","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/20/british-athletes-uk-sport-rights-damian-collins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/20/british-athletes-uk-sport-rights-damian-collins","fields":{"headline":"British athletes have ‘fewer rights than an Uber driver’ says Damian Collins MP","bodyText":"Britain’s elite athletes “have fewer rights than an Uber driver” and desperately need an independent watchdog to protect them, the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee has warned. Damian Collins MP told the Guardian that the worrying number of bullying, sexism and racism cases inside the UK Sport system was directly linked to the lack of employment rights for athletes and it is not enough to hope for change to happen organically. His comments come as Dame Katherine Grainger, the new chair of UK Sport, admits her organisation has faced “significant challenges” over the past 18 months that can no longer be brushed under the carpet. and Speaking before the UK Sport’s World Class Performance conference, which begins in Manchester on Monday, Grainger said: “I recognise and accept that there have been a number of difficult issues across a range of sports in recent months that have challenged our system, and we have to rise to that challenge. These issues do not take away from the achievements of our athletes and coaches, but neither can we brush them under the carpet or just hope that they go away.” Grainger said UK Sport was conducting a “root and branch review” of its policies following reports of a culture of fear in organisations as diverse as British Cycling, British Swimming, British Bobsleigh and British Gymnastics. “We have to aim to be the best in the world at athlete welfare, culture, governance and integrity just as we aim to be so in performance,” she said. “And we have to be seen to be the best in order to maintain public trust and pride in our achievements.” However, Collins said more must be done to reform the culture of UK Sport – including an independent sports ombudsman, operating outside UK Sport’s control, which he believes is “desperately needed”. “We’ve seen too many cases of sports bodies effectively marking their own homework,” said Collins, whose DCMS select committee has recently investigated bullying and misclassification in paraports and the Football Association’s disastrous handling of the Eni Aluko affair. “There’s basically no outside scrutiny. If there was, they would have better procedures in place.” “One of the big things that has come out is that athletes don’t have very many rights in the face of the governing body of the sport in which they participate,” he said. “In many ways they have fewer rights than an Uber driver has and that has been at the heart of the problem. “Because they don’t really have those rights, the governing bodies have got away with not having the sort of proper grievance procedures that would be normal in a lot of professional workplaces. That is something that needs to change.” As things stand, elite British athletes are not treated as employees by UK Sport but rather as recipients of grants. The sports minister, Tracey Crouch, in her appearance in front of the DCMS select committee last week, stopped short of backing the idea of changing this, calling it a “complex issue”. Crouch did acknowledge that she was considering the ombudsmen idea, as recommended by Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson in a review into the culture of British sport in April. Collins also urged UK Sport to bring in far better whistleblowing procedures. “There has to be a way for people to bring in concerns and at the moment it just doesn’t exist,” he said, pointing out that Crouch had not been able to name a single sport with appropriate whistleblowing procedures when she spoke to the DCMS select committee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27366","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T00:00:14Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,366","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27366","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27366","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,366","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2017/nov/20/labour-slams-universal-credit-as-not-fit-for-purpose","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T08:52:24Z","webTitle":"Labour attacks universal credit as 'not fit for purpose'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/20/labour-slams-universal-credit-as-not-fit-for-purpose","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/nov/20/labour-slams-universal-credit-as-not-fit-for-purpose","fields":{"headline":"Labour attacks universal credit as 'not fit for purpose'","bodyText":"Labour has unveiled a list of demands to improve the rollout of universal credit, seeking to keep up the pressure on Philip Hammond over the issue before Wednesday’s budget. The shadow pensions secretary, Debbie Abrahams, has written to the chancellor demanding changes to UC, which Labour and other critics say is putting people in debt as it is rolled out into new parts of the country. The main request is to reduce the initial six-week wait for a payment under the system, which is designed to replace a range of other benefits such as tax credits and housing benefit. Charities working with claimants have said the six-week wait tends to put people into arrears, especially with their rent, and means they have to seek support from food banks. There has been speculation the government is planning to reduce this period. Abrahams is also seeking an option of fortnightly rather than monthly payments, a change to the assessment period and modifications to ensure that the benefit always rewards people for finding more work. In a separate article for the Guardian, Abrahams said there was increasing evidence that UC “is not fit for purpose – and Labour believes the budget is a chance to fix it”. The original aims of the system – to simplify social security support, ensure people were always better off in work than on benefits and reduce child poverty – were laudable, and had been supported by Labour, Abrahams wrote. “But UC is failing to deliver on its objectives, as we have heard from respected charities including Child Poverty Action Group, Trussell Trust, Citizens Advice and Gingerbread. Even former government advisers, civil servants and UC’s own architects are now critical of the scheme,” she added. The system’s inherent problems were made worse by benefit cuts imposed in 2015, she added. “As it is being rolled out, universal credit is pushing people into debt and rent arrears, with many people in social and private rented housing being served eviction notices.” As well as the six-week initial wait, and obligatory monthly payment, Abrahams highlighted UC’s lack of responsiveness to the changes in income of self-employed people. “The problem is that this is assessed on a monthly basis, with no discretion for the natural peaks and troughs of self-employed work, or indeed for the niceties of the occasional holiday,” she wrote. “Should they take a Christmas break, many self-employed people may suddenly find they have not met the [Department for Work and Pensions] work requirements, and be sanctioned as a result. “If you’re thinking this doesn’t affect you, I’m sorry to say that might change, with the government planning to roll out ‘in-work conditionality’. This would require people who are working to report to the jobcentre and demonstrate they are seeking more hours, or face their UC support being cut.” Most serious, Abrahams warned, were cuts to benefit levels, citing a forecast from the Child Poverty Action Group that reductions to UC would put a million more children into poverty by 2022. Hammond could begin to fix the situation in the budget, Abrahams said, by reducing the six-week wait, allowing rent to be paid directly to landlords, allowing payments to be split between partners, improving flexibility for self-employed claimants and restoring the cuts to work allowances. “Anything less won’t make UC fit for today’s labour market,” she wrote. “Anything less will sentence a million more children to be brought up in poverty. Anything less will mean that this prime minister’s promise to tackle ‘burning injustices’ is no more than empty rhetoric.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2017/nov/20/markets-rattled-euro-dax-bunds-german-coalition-talks-collapse-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T19:35:37Z","webTitle":"Markets edgy as German president demands responsibility after coalition talks collapse – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/nov/20/markets-rattled-euro-dax-bunds-german-coalition-talks-collapse-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/nov/20/markets-rattled-euro-dax-bunds-german-coalition-talks-collapse-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Markets edgy as German president demands responsibility after coalition talks collapse – as it happened","bodyText":"A late PS.... Could Germany be heading for new elections? Philip Oltermann reports from Berlin: Angela Merkel has indicated that she would rather have fresh elections than try to rule in a minority government as the collapse of German coalition talks posed the most serious threat to her power since she became chancellor more than a decade ago. Merkel, who has headed three coalitions since 2005, said she was “very sceptical” about ruling in a minority government and suggested she would stand again as a candidate if elections were called in the new year, telling public broadcaster ARD she was “a woman who has responsibility and is prepared to take responsibility in the future”. More here: Time for a recap. European investors are bracing for fresh upheaval after Germany’s coalition talks collapsed overnight. With Angela Merkel’s position as chancellor looking less secure, analyst are predicting further volatility – and possibly losses in the weeks ahead. Right now, the euro has lost 0.3% against the US dollar, to $1.176. It has also lost ground against the pound, which is up 0.6% at €1.127. The markets were jittery after Germany’s Free Democrats walked out of ‘Jamaica coalition talks’ with Merkel’s CDU/CSU bloc, and the Green party. As things stand, there seem to be three outcomes 1) Merkel tries to govern in a minority government, perhaps with support from the centre-left Social Democrats 2) Fresh elections are held, likely early next year 3) The FDP return to negotiations. President Steinmeier has urged all sides to act responsibly, saying they have a responsibility to do their best to ensure Germany has a stable government. The ball is now in Steinmeier’s court; he must recommend a candidate to be chancellor, which MPs in the Bundestag will vote on. Here’s what might happen next. After suffering early losses, European stock markets are are little higher this afternoon. The possibility that Angela Merkel might not govern as chancellor for several more years has caused some head-scratching in the City. It could make it harder for her to offer Brexit concessions to the UK, or to support French president Emmanuel Macron’s push for European reforms. Wolfgang Bauer, fixed income fund manager at M&amp;G Investments, says the outcome of the German crisis will drive markets in the weeks ahead. If the grand coalition was to be renegotiated and went ahead, this would mean political stability in Germany and support for risk assets like equities and corporate bonds. I expect that the SPD would be able to push through more of their agenda and this might mean further steps towards European integration, reaching out to Macron. If however negotiations between CDU/CSU and SPD fail and we are heading towards a minority government or even snap elections, I would expect to see market volatility increase due to rising political uncertainty in Europe’s economic powerhouse. It would be less likely that any major European integration projects would be pushed forward for the foreseeable future. It is important to note that the tail risk remains and currently it does not seem to be priced in.” A clip of Frank-Walter Steinmeier speaking this lunchtime, complete with subtitles for English readers: Teneo Intelligence have kindly sent over an explanation of how Germany’s political system will proceed, following the breakdown of the ‘Jamaica coalition talks’ last night. A Bundestag vote is the next step As a lesson from the Weimar days, the Bundestag cannot dissolve itself. Neither can Merkel unilaterally provoke early elections via a confidence question. After all, the newly elected Bundestag has never expressed its confidence in Merkel in the first place; she currently serves merely as caretaker. Therefore, the next step is necessarily the attempt to elect a chancellor in the Bundestag. There is no time limit, but Steinmeier must eventually propose to MPs a candidate he deems best placed to win support in the Bundestag – this remains likely to be Merkel, lead candidate of the strongest parliamentary group. Without any coalition agreement in place, she will not receive the required support of an absolute majority of all MPs (355 out of 709) in the first round of voting. 14 day deadline, caretaker government, and Europe In consequence, a 14-day deadline kicks in during which this vote could (theoretically) be repeated multiple times. This, however, is likely only if, for instance, the SPD were to change its mind and opt for another grand coalition. In the meantime, Merkel and her grand coalition cabinet continue to serve as caretakers. Hopes in the UK for a political deal with Berlin on Brexit were unrealistic before but have now become even less likely. The EU’s negotiation guidelines, including the need to pay a sufficient amount of money in the run-up to the December European Council, are still the basis for any deal, now more than ever. Eurozone build-out jointly with France remains a task for the next government, but conversations will remain on ice until the deadlock in Berlin has been broken. How to dissolve parliament and hold snap elections Absent such developments, however, another round of voting must be held within 14 days of the first round. This time, a plurality of votes is sufficient for a candidate to be elected chancellor (i.e., the candidate who receives the largest number of votes is elected). It is then up to the federal president to decide, within seven days, whether to appoint the elected candidate on the basis of this plurality vote. The result would be a minority government. The alternative option for the president is to dissolve the Bundestag and call early elections. These would have to be held within 60 days of the dissolution of parliament. As a result, mid-February would be the earliest possible date for snap polls. The exact timeframe, however, depends on how quickly Steinmeier proceeds in the coming days towards proposing a candidate for chancellor to the Bundestag. Here’s a photo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel meeting with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier today. Over in Brussels, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is testifying to MEPs. Draghi hasn’t mentioned the situation in Germany in his opening statement. Instead, he argues that Europe’s economic recovery is solid and broad-based, but also warns the euro area must be strengthened to help it deal with upcoming risks. As Draghi puts it: The EU Treaties gave the ECB the primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole. This is the best contribution we can make to the welfare of our fellow citizens. Ensuring price stability is a precondition for the euro area economy to achieve a balanced growth path that can be sustained in the long run. But this is not the only condition. Achieving a balanced growth path also requires to strengthen the euro area ability to deal with risks, whenever they will materialise. The current economic outlook provides a unique opportunity to reduce the likelihood of severe shocks by strengthening the economic structures of Member States, with policy actions both on the fiscal and structural side. At the same time, boosting the resilience of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) implies also reinforcing our common institutional set-up so as to prevent and manage shocks. The key part of Frank-Walter Steinmeier’s statement came when he urged all political parties to consider helping to form a new government. The German president said: “All political parties elected to the German parliament have an obligation to the common interest to serve our country. “I expect from all a readiness to talk to make agreeing a government possible in the near future.” Newsflash: German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier is delivering a statement in Berlin now, following his meeting with Angela Merkel. Steinmeier says that Germany faces an unprecedented situation, following the breakdown in coalition talks between the CDU/CSU, the FDP and the Greens. He says he expects all parties to be prepared to help find a solution. He’ll be speaking to the leaders of Germany’s political parties, and the heads of other institutions, to see if a government can be formed. Steinmeier also reminds Germany that the world is watching, saying it is clear that European nations would be concerned if the region’s largest economy can’t form a stable government. And that’s it - he doesn’t take any questions. Germany’s Social Democrats, who came second in September’s election, are sticking to their policy of not joining a grand coalition with Angela Merkel. That’s according to a party document seen by Reuters, which reports: “Given the results of the Sept. 24 election, we are not available for entry into a grand coalition,” read a SPD paper due to be discussed by party leaders that was obtained by Reuters. “We are not afraid of new elections.” European stock markets have now recovered their earlier losses as traders await news from the Merkel-Steinmeier talks. Political analyst Nina Schick suggests the political uncertainty could last for months, though, meaning traders will remain nervous. Here’s our latest report from Berlin. Angela Merkel’s political difficulties could be bad news for the UK over the Brexit talks. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, reckons it will be hard for the chancellor to give Britain any concessions, as she’ll have to take a ‘pragmatic’ approach. She will be preoccupied with domestic issues and unable to assume a leadership role in the EU. She was expected to return to the European fray as the leader of Germany and push for a faster more pragmatic approach which would be more favourable to the UK. However, she will now be mired in domestic political difficulties and will not have the time or the perceived authority to take a lead in Europe. The vacuum will be filled in part by a more pro-EU stance by Mr Macron. Analysts at Citigroup say the euro is being propped up by several factors - including the lack of clarity over German politics right now. Over in Berlin, Angela Merkel arriving for a meeting with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at Bellevue Palace, his official residency. Merkel will brief Steinmeier about the state of the coalition talks (nicht sehr gut!). Steinmeier is then expected to give a statement around 2.30pm local time (1.30pm GMT) Euro volatility has risen this morning, suggesting that traders are more nervous about Europe’s prospects. But...we’re nowhere near the levels seen in April, when Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen were battling for the French presidency, as this chart shows: Kathleen Brooks of City Index suggests the markets may be underestimating the risks from Germany. Volatility spiked ahead of the French election, which turned out to be a boon for markets as Emmanuel Macron was easily elected President of France. The market got the level of risk wrong back in April, and were overly worried, could they be wrong this time and be overly complacent? How this saga plays out in the coming days will be crucial for European traders. It’s not beyond the realm of possibility that Germany could end up being the biggest political hot potato for the Eurozone this year. A quick reminder of the result of September’s election shows why Angela Merkel is in a bind. Having only won 246 out of the 706 seats in the Bundestag, the CDU/CSU needs coalition partners to form a stable government. However, the maths is tricky, as the SPD isn’t willing to join another grand coalition. That leaves four smaller parties; but ideological disagreements mean a formal deal with either the left-wing Die Linke or the far-right AfD isn’t feasible. So a deal with the Greens and the the FDP was the only option. Christian Odendahl of the Centre for European Reform reckons the SPD could help prop up a minority administration. Here’s a chart of the euro’s sharp moves against the US dollar this morning: However, the euro is still down 0.5% against the pound, at €1.125. A flurry of headlines from Germany are helping the euro to claw back some of its earlier losses. The Free Democrats have apparently signalled that they could support a minority government made up of the CDU-CSU bloc and the Green party. FDP parliamentary director Marco Buschmann told the Bild newspaper that: “If there are good initiatives, then we are available.” The prospect of Angela Merkel holding onto power seems to be reassuring investors, even though nothing is clear at this stage. Dutch foreign minister Halbe Zijlstra has warned that the collapse of German coalition talks last night is ‘bad news’ for Europe. Zijlstra told reporters in Brussels that: “Germany is a very influential country within the EU so if they don’t have a government and therefore don’t have a mandate it’ll be very hard for them to take positions.” (thanks to Reuters for the quote) Peter Thal Larsen, European editor at Breakingviews, sums up the situation: Political economics professor Henrik Enderlein says Angela Merkel has been “seriously weakened”, with no easy way forward. The possibility that Angela Merkel could be forced out of the German Chancellery will worry the City, says Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investing at interactive investor. “European equity markets have picked up where they left off last week, heading lower after the FDP walked out of German coalition talks. Angela Merkel has been the glue that has held the European Union together for the past 12 years, a stable force in turbulent times. Chancellor Merkel is also one of the few European politicians who has demonstrated she may be prepared to compromise with Britain, rather than run the risk that Prime Minister May is replaced by a hardline Brexiteer. With almost unsurpassed political experience, markets will want Germany to find a quick solution, preferably one that leaves Mrs Merkel in situ. Get up to speed every day with our morning email! Ulrich Speck, senior research fellow of the Elcano Royal Institute think tank, says the collapse of the Jamaica coalition talks could be a major moment in German politics, and beyond. The pound is gaining ground against the euro this morning, up 0.25% at €1.1235. Angela Merkel will meet with Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, later today to discuss the situation. Steinmeier is a leading figure in the left-wing Social Democrat party - who came second in September’s election but refused to enter another Grand Coalition. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services suspects that a minority government made up of Merkel’s CDU/CSU and the Green party might have decent survival prospects, as the SPD could support much of its legislative programme. He adds: As a point of historical note, there is no precedent for fresh general elections so quickly after the previous one. I would not want to second guess this situation, but with Steinmeier being president, and the risk that any or all of the CDU, SPD and FDP take a hammering if fresh elections are held, it might be the compromise outcome. Germany’s DAX stock index has fallen by half a percent at the start of trading in Frankfurt. Postal operator Deutsche Post, financial group Deutsche Bank and industrial giant Thyssenkrupp are leading the fallers. But...energy provider RWE have jumped by almost 4%. That’s because German’s Green party would have pushed for coal-fired power plants to be shut down had they joined a coalition. Other European markets have also dipped into the red. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, fears that Angela Merkel’s failure to form a new government could drive markets lower. With this bombshell development heightening concerns over political instability in Europe’s largest economy and sparking speculation of fresh elections, the Euro may be in store for further punishment. Although Europe’s encouraging macro fundamentals may offer some background support to the Euro long term, political risk has the ability to trigger further selloffs in the shorter term. Germany’s coalition conundrum puts the whole future of Europe into doubt, says Dean Turner of UBS Wealth Management. He told Bloomberg TV that: The clear risk is that if Angela Merkel was not going to continue as chancellor, what would that mean for Europe? With Emmanuel Macron elected in France, the push to rebuild the Franco-German alliance, to restructure Europe and make new reforms would be put into question. The FT’s Tobias Buck has a good explanation of why Merkel and the Free Democrats couldn’t reach a coalition deal. Among the core differences was the issue of refugee and asylum policy and, in particular, the issue of whether refugees should be allowed to bring their families to Germany. In 2016, at the height of the Syrian refugee crisis, Berlin suspended that right. But the freeze on family reunifications runs out next year, raising the prospect of a spike in new arrivals. The Bavarian CSU, the sister party of Ms Merkel’s CDU, was determined to prolong the suspension, broadly backed by the CDU and the FDP. The Greens, in contrast, insisted that refugees must be allowed to bring their spouses and children into the country, citing humanitarian reasons. Other areas of disagreement were Germany’s response to climate change and the Green demand to shut down a significant number of coal-fired power plants, which are among the biggest producers of carbon dioxide emissions. Tax policy, too, was a bone of contention, with the FDP demanding a rapid phase-out of the so-called solidarity tax that is raised to fund the economic development in eastern Germany. Our correspondent in Berlin, Philip Oltermann, says Merkel’s position as Germany’s leader is now under scrutiny, following the collapse of coalition talks. He writes: With talks now seemingly over, Merkel could seek to form a minority government, either with the FDP or the Greens, and gather support from other parties on individual policy votes. The Social Democrat leader, Martin Schulz, whose party has played junior partner to Merkel in the German government for the past four years, ruled out the possibility of another grand coalition under his leadership. “The voter has rejected the grand coalition,” Schulz said at a party conference in Nuremberg on Sunday. Once all other options are exhausted, Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, could dissolve the current parliament and call fresh elections. To get there, however, Steinmeier would need first to set into motion a complicated process that would involve a parliamentary vote on Merkel’s role as interim chancellor. While the debate in Germany over the past few weeks has mainly focused on policy differences between the parties, it is likely to soon shift to the chancellor, and the question of whether or not she still commands sufficient power to hold together a strong government. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Oh Mutti! German politics has been plunged into new uncertainty overnight after Angela Merkel’s attempts to form a new coalition collapsed. Overnight, the pro-market Free Democratic Party walked out of talks with Merkel’s CDU-CSU group, and the leftwing Green party. Despite weeks of talks, the FDP, the CDU and the Greens weren’t able to carve out an agreement on migration and climate change. This seems to have scuppered Merkel’s hopes of building a ‘Jamaica coalition’, following September’s election. Investors are watching with considerable interest to see how Merkel reacts. Will she try to lead a minority government, which could hamper her efforts to push through legislation on issues like refugees policy, or Brexit.... Alternatively, she could push for new elections. But that has risks too -- embroiling Germany in a second campaign with no certainty that Merkel’s party would do any better than last time (when her majority fell sharply). The financial markets have already reacted, sending the euro down almost half a cent against the US dollar to €1.175. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says the FDP’s decision to quit coalition talks could have a “considerable impact” on European politics, and the markets. “News emerging from Germany that Angela Merkel has failed to form a coalition within deadline has thrown the country into a state of political disarray for the time being, which could have a detrimental effect on the eurozone as a result. “Germany is renowned for being the economic powerhouse of Europe in recent times, and has consistently contributed to its growth in the first three quarters of this year. Despite the single currency remaining strong for now and the eurozone stimulus programme going to plan, the ECB may choose to approach the situation in Germany with caution until political matters becomes clearer. The German stock market is also expected to drop this morning, as traders in Frankfurt brace for more turmoil. German politics may hog the spotlight today, as there’s not much else in the calendar. ECB president Mario Draghi will give his views on the state of the eurozone after lunch, when he appears before the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In the UK, we’ll be enjoying the build-up to Philip Hammond’s budget on Wednesday.

He is obviously a good mate of mine. I played alongside him for a long time and now coach him at Harlequins and what we saw at Twickenham were the fruits of Danny maturing as a player as he has got older. He has worked really hard on seeing the space in behind and when the opportunities are there in the big games, he really nails it. A recent Premiership match against Sale stands out in my mind – he was spot-on at identifying that space. He has that ability to put the ball over the top and put it on the money, as we saw at Twickenham. It was clear that against Australia he added a little bit more tempo, he got the ball away nice and quickly and you could see the team go to another level. He played on the fact that Australia were mentally and physically a bit all over the place and sucked of energy. He got England into another gear, the floodgates opened a little and he capped it off with a great try. Looking for space in behind and nailing those kicks – as we saw for the tries for Jonny May and Jonathan Joseph – has been a big work-on for Danny. At Quins we are playing with a lot more width and that means Danny needs to get in there and get the pass away a lot more. A big part of his game is his running strength and we don’t want to take that away from him but I think it will make him a better player, having the ability to get the pass away and choosing the right time to put the ball in behind, then choosing the right time to run – it all combines to manipulate the defence a little bit more. He is such a dangerous runner around those fringes and, of course, you want to see more of it because it’s fantastic to watch. But being able to mix it up, pick and choose his times to go or to kick and pull the defence around can be such a string to his bow because he’s got a fantastic offensive kicking game. He has worked really hard on that and has a knack of seeing the space and putting the ball exactly where he wants to. His box-kicking has really improved, too, and that is another sign of his maturity. That has also been a big work-on for him. He’s really improved in that area and it makes him a more well-rounded No9, a guy that can do a bit of everything. He knows when to do things at the right time, which was epitomised against Australia. There was space in behind and he saw it. He didn’t need to run; he didn’t need to pass. All he needed to do was put the ball where it needed to be, with good communication and awareness, and then you get the results. Make no mistake, Danny might be a brilliant finisher as Eddie Jones calls them but he would still love to be starting for England. That desire is still as fierce as ever. No one wants to be sitting on the bench for his country – I did it for years and hated it – but the important thing is that you know your role. You are always disappointed for a little while but you have to park that and make sure that during the week you know exactly what you need to do when you come on. Then you’ve got to be constantly watching the game, feeling the game, seeing how it changes, getting a sense of the intensity of both sides and what is needed. It is a big role for these guys coming on now because they do change games. Danny is fantastic at it but there is still that drive to get that starting spot and, if he keeps coming on and performing like he did on Saturday, he is going to put a lot of pressure on Ben Youngs and cause Eddie a headache. I definitely felt, though, that the timing was right for the bench to make an impact. It escalated pretty quickly from a tight, intriguing game for those first 60 minutes because Australia ran out of steam and that was down to the relentless physicality of England. Against Samoa on Saturday I’d expect there would be some changes because it is the perfect time to give some of the players on the fringe a start. Danny is not on the fringe; he’s a big part of the squad. and very experienced, But it is a chance for him to show what he can do and for other guys as well. We are two years out from the World Cup and Eddie needs to see some of the others playing some top-level rugby. All of a sudden it will be the Six Nations, a tough tour of South Africa and then you are 15-16 months away from the World Cup and you don’t want to be thinking then about building combinations. It is the perfect opportunity to test some guys who should be there, in and around the World Cup squad, to see how they cope under a bit of pressure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/20/american-music-awards-a-listers-absent-and-women-underserved-in-night-of-missed-opportunity","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T06:41:00Z","webTitle":"American music awards: A-listers absent and women underserved in night of missed opportunity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/20/american-music-awards-a-listers-absent-and-women-underserved-in-night-of-missed-opportunity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/20/american-music-awards-a-listers-absent-and-women-underserved-in-night-of-missed-opportunity","fields":{"headline":"American music awards: A-listers absent and women underserved in night of missed opportunity","bodyText":"“This year, perhaps more than any in recent history, we needed the power of music to help us escape the news of the day,” announced Jamie Foxx during the cold open to the 2017 American music awards, before introducing Pink and Kelly Clarkson’s somber rendition of R.E.M.’s Everybody Hurts. “We needed that power to help us heal from hurricanes, wildfires, hate, and hatred-fueled violence.” On a night that celebrated the achievements of pioneers including Whitney Houston and Diana Ross, while conferring its awards upon a slew of young white men including Niall Horan, Shawn Mendes and the Chainsmokers, the 45th annual American music awards oscillated between rejecting and reaffirming 2017’s national political moment. While there were no statements as dramatic as Green Day’s searing, Trump-bashing 2016 AMA performance, the 2017 AMAs made it clear from the beginning that the evening was going to serve in part as a reaction and response to the news today. The show, promised the host, Tracee Ellis Ross, was going to be “filled with earth-shattering women”. But Lady Gaga was the only woman to win an award all night (favourite female pop/rock artist) and, outside of her category, Julia Michaels and Halsey were the only women among the 30-plus nominated artists. It was hard at times to tell whether the AMAs’ message of female empowerment was a genuine progressive declaration or simply a way to cover up the appalling gender imbalance in the show’s nominees. The AMAs is a fan-voted awards show whose nomination process is derived from “key fan interactions … including album and digital song sales, radio airplay, streaming social activity and touring”, according to the organisation. Absent the sort of industry gatekeeper quality of the Grammys, the AMAs serve in a sense as pop music’s id: a competing spectacle that lets the Top 40 zeitgeist run rampant. In theory, the spectacle is a pure reflection of commercial trends unfettered by the type of aesthetic curation that causes the Grammy’s to prioritize Adele over Beyoncé. That could make for a refreshing show of unpretentious pop purity, but this year’s AMAs were absent of many of the most surprising and distinct personalities that have defined this year in music. It was no surprise that A-listers like Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar and Sam Smith were nowhere to be found, but the utter absence of 2017 chart-toppers such as Cardi B, Migos and Luis Fonsi made for an evening of music that failed to capture the year of pop spectacle it claimed to represent. Even Post Malone, who’s song Rockstar has spent more than five weeks at No 1, was relegated to the audience. Equally baffling was the absence of Sam Hunt, whose Body Like a Backroad was by some metrics the most popular single in modern country music history and a top 10 pop crossover in its own right. That said, there were a number of noteworthy moments throughout the night, from Pink’s acrobatic performance of Beautiful Trauma to the electrifying US television debut of the seven-piece South Korean boyband BTS, to Selena Gomez’s understated (if potentially lip-synced) rendition of her new single Wolves, to Christina Aguilera’s deeply reverent, high-drama tribute to Whitney Houston. Elsewhere, Shawn Mendes and Niall Horan delivered rote versions of their latest hits, and Khalid’s promising performance of Young Dumb &amp; Broke was ruined by a forced pairing with Imagine Dragons that recalled the Las Vegas band’s equally incongruous pairing with Kendrick Lamar at the 2014 Grammys. Performing via video from her concert in Washington DC, Lady Gaga served as the show’s elder-stateswoman of 21st century pop, delivering a fiery take on her current single The Cure. Later on, Mike Shinoda delivered an emotional speech when the surviving members of Linkin Park dedicated their award for favorite alternative rock artist to the band’s late frontman, Chester Bennington. But the evening’s high point came last, when 73-year-old Diana Ross accepted her lifetime achievement award – complete with filmed testimonials from Taylor Swift and Barack and Michelle Obama – with a heartwarming and crowd-pleasing medley of hits including I’m Coming Out, Ease on Down the Road and The Best Years of My Life, before inviting her extended family on stage to accept her award and close the broadcast. But apart from a smattering of promising performances, the 2017 AMAs felt like a missed opportunity: instead of highlighting the most interesting and compelling new sounds, styles and stars that have emerged throughout the course of they year, the show doubled down on an excessively safe and predictable slew of blue-eyed balladeering heartthrobs including Nick Jonas, Horan and Mendes, whose vision of pop feels less urgent than ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2017/nov/19/xbox-one-x-upgrade-console-video-games-gadget","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T00:03:45Z","webTitle":"Xbox One X review: a perfect pitch to a demanding demographic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/19/xbox-one-x-upgrade-console-video-games-gadget","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/nov/19/xbox-one-x-upgrade-console-video-games-gadget","fields":{"headline":"Xbox One X review: a perfect pitch to a demanding demographic","bodyText":"Its creators claim it is one of the most powerful gaming consoles on Earth, now the newly launched Xbox One X from Microsoft is after a new accolade - to beat its rival Sony to dominate Christmas wishlists and the hearts of video game players. Microsoft’s new console, a substantial upgrade to the original Xbox One released in 2013, comes almost exactly a year after Sony delivered a similar performance boost with its PlayStation 4 Pro. Things didn’t used to be this way. Although format wars between gaming platforms have always raged – Commodore versus Spectrum, Sega versus Nintendo, Microsoft versus Sony – the hardware available in each generation was something fixed and immutable. A new games machine would give developers a set platform to create and optimise software on, sometimes for up to a decade, while players would benefit from having a reliable device they knew they wouldn’t have to upgrade, as is common in PC gaming. Microsoft and Sony’s move to mid-generation upgrades marks a shift away from that model, and changes how the market around them works. Merely reformatting consoles is nothing new – the practice can be traced back at least as far as Sega’s Master System II in 1990, which refashioned the angular original. Yet the trend now sees consoles within the same “family” getting revamped releases with improved specs, allowing manufacturers to cater to their most demanding users. The Xbox One X is Microsoft’s pitch to that exacting demographic, delivering the most significant console upgrade ever. It raises performance by more than four times the base model’s computing power, and allows true 4K (a higher resolution) gaming thanks to a speedier processor, improved graphics output, and more and faster memory. It also packs in support for 4K Blu-ray, then crams it all into the smallest physical shell any Xbox has ever seen. It’s an impressive achievement. “There’s a certain class of customer who really wants the premium experience, and that’s what Xbox One X is designed for,” says Albert Penello, senior director of Xbox console marketing. “The visual upgrade of moving from 1080p to 4K is going to have a bigger impact on the overall experience than they might be expecting. Eight milllion pixels, four times the pixel count, the level of detail and crispness in these games is really remarkable.” The push for 4K is key to understanding the appeal of Xbox One X. The home cinema market is in the midst of a revolution: according to analysis firm IHS Markit, by the end of 2017, 3.7m UK households will own a 4K TV, rising to 12m by 2021. This would account for almost half of all TV-owning households in the UK, yet the first Xbox One was designed only for full high definition – screens with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels. Although last year’s Xbox One S introduced support for 4K Blu-ray and video, it wasn’t capable of rendering games in the new standard. Xbox One X begins to correct this, with select games receiving updates to enable full 4K output. This means the games that Xbox One owners already possess will not only run on the Xbox One X if they upgrade, but be actively improved by the new hardware. New games can be expected to offer 4K from scratch, too. Examining the likes of Gears of War 4 and Rise of the Tomb Raider on an Xbox One X (provided by Microsoft for review) reveals a noticeably better experience. Visual elements such as textures, lighting, and filtering are all enhanced, while HDR – high dynamic range, which delivers better contrast, brightness, and a wider colour palette – provides an almost palpable improvement. Even without a 4K set, Xbox One X is a worthy upgrade. Using a technique called supersampling, where additional visual information is downsized onto a lower resolution screen, players can expect to see improvements in picture quality, even on a 1080p television. Increased processor power and loading times also mean you’ll be playing games rather than waiting for them to start, while 8GB of speedy flash memory reserved exclusively for the operating system makes the console more responsive overall. If Xbox One X has a killer app at launch, it’s racing sim Forza Motorsport 7. A hyper-realistic driving game, not only is it arguably one of Microsoft’s most accessible exclusive titles, it’s also one that best shows off the console’s power, with meticulously modelled supercars and painstakingly recreated real-world locations to race around. While the flagship title is compatible with any previous model of Xbox One, it was developed in concert with the new machine to take full advantage of its power. “Our architect is on the same committee that’s deciding what hardware goes into something like the Xbox One X,” says Dan Greenawalt, creative director at Forza developer Turn 10. “We actually give our game engine straight over to the platform team, so they’re able to build using our engine, then test their hardware and new features.” “We wanted the game to offer the same basic gameplay on all the versions of Xbox One,” he says. “But if you’re on Xbox One X, you’re going to get heat shimmer, higher resolution textures, more advanced shaders, better lighting models, all these things that come in and give you greater immersion, without actually changing the gameplay dramatically.” With both Microsoft and Sony opting for mid-generation console upgrades (third pillar Nintendo, as ever, is walking its own path with the tablet-like Switch and so far avoiding 4K), it raises the question of whether players can expect such trends to continue. The answer may lie outside gaming, where the smartphone market sees regular hardware refreshes. Indeed, Penello thinks that is a better model to follow, and offers a clue to Microsoft’s thinking with Xbox One X. “It’s really consumers driving this change,” says Penello. “It has increased exponentially. It’s truly remarkable to see the level of hardware innovation over just the last two years [and] consumers are used to making different decisions about technology performance today.” “[With] smartphones, you can get one with a faster processor or bigger screen, and customers do a pretty good job of figuring out what is important to them. Gaming consoles have existed in a very particular way for over 40 years, one fixed platform for up to 10 years. I don’t think [consoles] are going to go to the model that’s quite as frequent [as phones] but I think this is the right thing to do for gaming.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/16/letter-when-tom-paley-played-the-polska","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-16T17:39:32Z","webTitle":"Letter: Tom Paley played the polska","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/16/letter-when-tom-paley-played-the-polska","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/16/letter-when-tom-paley-played-the-polska","fields":{"headline":"Letter: When Tom Paley played the polska","bodyText":"The performances of Tom Paley invariably included at least one polska, a type of Swedish fiddle music of which he was particularly fond.

Demonstrating its complete subservience to Prime Minister Hun Sen, the Cambodian supreme court ruled to dissolve my political party, the Cambodia National Rescue party (CNRP). It also banned me and more than 100 of my colleagues from politics for the next five years. As the only opposition party capable of mounting a serious challenge to the ruling party in national elections – scheduled for July – the CNRP posed a threat to the continuance of more than three decades of Hun Sen’s brutal, strongman rule. The mounting fear of losing in a genuine vote motivated this decision and spurred an unprecedented crackdown that has seen my party’s president, Kem Sokha, imprisoned; prominent NGOs and media outlets shuttered; and over half of CNRP lawmakers – including myself – forced to flee the country. In pursuing this course, Hun Sen has proved himself nothing more than a dictator bent on remaining in power, no matter what the costs. And make no mistake: the costs are great. Elections next year will be a farce, and the system is devolving into de facto one-party rule. In acceding to the CNRP’s dissolution, the supreme court has served as a handmaiden to democracy’s destruction, robbing it of any remaining public confidence and further undermining Cambodia’s already weak institutions overall. Under continued conditions of severe repression, we can expect to see further corruption and human rights abuses, such as rampant land grabbing, with no justice for victims. The mounting anger of the Cambodian people and rising feeling that there is no recourse will feed social instability and imperil Cambodia’s prospects for continued economic growth. This is a tragedy not only for Cambodia, but for all those nations who have worked for decades to help rebuild the country, after many years of genocide and civil war. We were finally getting to a stage where there was a real political opposition, where the voice of the people could be heard, and where – we hoped – a change of government could come through the ballot box. That all ended on Thursday, and with it the belief of millions of Cambodians that they had the power to decide their future. The international community’s response to previous attacks on democracy has been part of the problem. Despite years of mounting warning signs, Hun Sen’s behaviour has been repeatedly rewarded with more aid and few, if any, serious red lines. This fed a feeling on the part of the regime that it could act without consequence. The response now must be unequivocal. The international community should withdraw any support for elections and refuse to observe or sanction the vote unless the CNRP and all political parties are allowed to compete on a fair playing field. Governments should also suspend technical assistance to the ruling government, which has consistently demonstrated that it has no intention of addressing corruption or strengthening institutions. They must also impose targeted sanctions aimed at top-level individuals in Cambodia who are ordering, perpetrating and facilitating this systematic dismantling of Cambodia’s democracy. I had been hesitant to call for these measures in the past. I maintained a belief that the government would eventually reverse course and gradually open up to greater democracy. I held out hope that the ruling party could be persuaded to embrace a genuine culture of dialogue. But my hopes have been repeatedly dashed, and the time has come for more substantive action. The dreams enshrined in the 1991 Paris peace accords, which ended many years of civil war, are being crushed. The international community was instrumental in securing that agreement, and if Cambodia is to succeed, the international community needs to step up again now. This is an opportunity to show that democratic values and human rights still matter, in Cambodia and across the globe. Democracy may have lost this week, but it was not a knockout blow. Democracy will not die in the hearts of the Cambodian people. The government may have officially dissolved the opposition party, but it cannot do the same with the 3 million Cambodians who voted for change in the last elections. It cannot erase the 1.5 million Cambodian migrant workers abroad, who long to return to a country that is democratic, prosperous and free. It cannot abolish the hopes and expectations of Cambodia’s 10 million young people, who dream of a promising future, free from corruption and oppression. The people of Cambodia deserve a chance for their voices to be heard.

Here’s a plan to bridge the bitter Brexit divide","bodyText":"Britain is a broken country badly in need of a plan to piece it back together. It is now almost 18 months since the vote for Brexit exposed the deep schism between leavers and remainers, but there is one thing on which both sides should be able to agree: the status quo is not an option. Before anybody gets too starry-eyed about turning the clock back to June last year, it is worth running through a few relevant facts about the state of the nation on the eve of the referendum. Britain was running a record current account deficit, growth was being pumped up by an overheating housing market, factories were still producing less than before the start of the financial crisis, and people in the poorest parts of the country were being targeted with deep cuts in welfare benefits. The national picture disguised a growing north-south divide. Only in London and the south-east are earnings, when adjusted for inflation, higher than they were 10 years ago. Research by the Centre for Cities thinktank has shown that London and its satellite cities have higher levels of productivity than Germany, but there is a 44% gap between the south-east and the less productive cities in the rest of the country. Work by researchers at Sheffield Hallam University points out that old industrial Britain is still suffering from the consequences of the closure of factories and pits three or four decades ago. These communities have higher levels of unemployment and higher concentrations of people on disability benefit, and have suffered much more grievously from government welfare cuts. Unsurprisingly, they were also strongly in favour of leave. North of the line that runs from the Severn estuary to the Wash, Brexit was the culmination of a 40-year process of de-industrialisation and casualisation of work. It was a protest about dead-end jobs, and about run-down communities being lorded over by London, talked down to and bossed around. The current state of the Brexit negotiations has raised hopes among some remainers that they might still prevail in a second referendum once the terms of the deal are known. But there is no guarantee a second referendum will have a different result unless the underlying grievances are tackled. What’s more, it would be playing with fire to try to reverse the result without doing so. Why? Imagine that the remainers have their way: a second referendum is held, and there is a different result, say 52%-48% the other way round. The clock is turned back to the Britain of 22 June 2016, life goes on as normal in London and the prosperous university towns, and the problems of the precariat are quietly forgotten. In these circumstances, the leavers of 2016 feel they have been betrayed. They grow even angrier, even more bitter. They are susceptible to the idea that the economic and political systems have both been rigged against them. Having failed to get change through the ballot box, they look to those offering less peaceful solutions. The same challenge, of course, faces the leave camp. It has promised the people of Stoke, Hartlepool, Doncaster and all the other places that voted to leave that life will get better. So far, the only alternatives have come from the right: either a low-tax, low-regulation Singapore-on-Thames model, or Theresa May’s empty promises to those “just about managing”. It is time for the left to come up with some ideas. Here are a few to get the ball rolling. Unlike the overcrowded south-east, the north is not short of homes, but its housing stock is often run down and energy inefficient. So there should be a nationwide programme to improve insulation, starting with cities in the north. Such a scheme would cut fuel bills, reduce carbon emissions and provide well-paid jobs for local people. This, though, would not be enough to reverse decades of the hollowing out of local economies. For that to happen, the state needs a new national investment bank, and to use it to channel funds into traditional manufacturing sectors – such as engineering, and food and drink – where they need modernising, and to identify the growth sectors of the future. Industrial strategy, after a hiatus lasting more than 30 years, is back in vogue and a government white paper is due out next week. Its aim should be to make sure Britain excels in the fourth industrial revolution: developments in artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, 3D printing and quantum computing that are going to transform the global economy. The UK is well placed to flourish in many of these areas, but there is a danger that the benefits will go overwhelmingly to the golden triangle of London, Oxford and Cambridge. To prevent this happening, the government should identify a university in each of the big northern cities to take the lead in one of the new technologies: driverless cars in Birmingham, say, or new materials in Manchester. Academic funding, tax breaks, state aid and public procurement should all be used to establish industrial clusters and develop domestic supply chains. If the north is to thrive, it will need substantial improvements in its infrastructure. The money that has been earmarked for the HS2 rail link, connecting London with the north, should be spent instead on HS3 – linking Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and Hull with Newcastle. As currently planned, HS2 is an expensive way of sucking talented people out of the north. HS3 would encourage them to stay. Tackling the north’s productivity gap also means addressing its skills gap. One reason companies are reluctant to move out of the south-east is that they are unsure they can get the people they want: schools in the north and Midlands lag behind those in the south; levels of adult literacy and numeracy are poor; and there is a mismatch in further education between the courses being provided and the skills employers are demanding. Steps are already being taken to attract talented teachers, but clearly more needs to be done, such as greater investment in adult and further education, and a salary premium for teachers prepared to move north. The north resents the south and with good reason. There was a time in the 19th century when the balance of power was in favour of the big northern cities. Nowadays, London is at the centre of everything: the country’s financial hub, media capital and centre of political power. So some bold decentralisation is needed: allow local governments to raise and keep more of their own money; ensure that a new national investment bank is based not in Canary Wharf, but on the banks of the Mersey or the Humber; and move parliament, as the MP Frank Field suggests, to Leeds or Manchester. Above all, be bold. It normally takes exceptional times – witness 1945 or 1979 – to prompt radical change in Britain. Brexit is just such a moment, and its potential should not be wasted. Remain or leave, a package of housing, jobs, infrastructure, skills and devolution should be put together to reboot Britain’s economy and heal the geographical divide. It would be the New Deal for the North. • Larry Elliott is the Guardian’s economics editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/nov/30/hera-lindsay-bird-i-still-dont-think-of-poetry-as-a-serious-career-option","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T15:00:16Z","webTitle":"Hera Lindsay Bird: poet of exploding helicopters and dick jokes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/30/hera-lindsay-bird-i-still-dont-think-of-poetry-as-a-serious-career-option","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/nov/30/hera-lindsay-bird-i-still-dont-think-of-poetry-as-a-serious-career-option","fields":{"headline":"Hera Lindsay Bird: poet of exploding helicopters and dick jokes","bodyText":"It is an ungodly hour on a Wednesday morning and Hera Lindsay Bird’s disembodied head is telling me about the time that she wet herself at a supermarket checkout. “It was one of the great humiliations of my life,” she says, over Skype from her home in Wellington, New Zealand. The reason I’m dragging it up again is because it is referenced in the first poem of her debut collection, the self-titled Hera Lindsay Bird, which came out to acclaim in New Zealand in 2016 and is released in the UK this month. “To be fourteen, and wet yourself extravagantly / At a supermarket checkout,” the poem Write a Book begins, “As urine cascades down your black lace stocking / And onto the linoleum / Is to comprehend what it means to be a poet / To stand in the tepid under-halo / Of your own self-making / And want to die.” This sets the tone for the rest of the collection, which is presided over by a voice that is simultaneously sharp and confiding, sardonic and lugubrious, and peppered with references both gothic and pop cultural. “It’s a contemporary book of long, metaphor-laden love poems filled with exploding helicopters, outdated 90s sitcom references, and dick jokes,” the 29-year-old says, when asked to sum up a book that contains items such as Keats Is Dead So Fuck Me From Behind, and Monica, a five-page rant about the character from Friends and much else besides, (choice lines from the latter include “to be able to maintain a friendship / Through the various complications of heterosexual monogamy / Is enormously difficult / Especially when you take into consideration / What cunts they all were”). Both these poems went viral, gaining so much attention from overseas that her New Zealand publisher had to almost immediately reprint the book, which is now being picked up in the UK by Penguin. “It still doesn’t feel real,” she tells me. “I still don’t really think of poetry as a serious career option.” She continues to work in a bookshop four days a week, though she is famous enough now for strangers to send her their sex poems. I ask her if she offers feedback and she makes a face. “My friend thinks I should make a book of them,” she says. Much of the focus and interest in Bird’s work has related to what you might call the “confessional” nature of her poetry, a word she dislikes. “I think the word that often people use is narcissistic, and it’s not that I disagree with that – probably all confessional poetry is in its way narcissistic,” she says, “but to me there is kind of a generosity there as well, because the most exciting thing is to read about people’s lives, and even if you’ve got someone like Frank O’Hara, or any of the great poets, they are kind of self-obsessed in their own way. “So it’s kind of funny when people talk about young women’s writing as being narcissistic. I mean how many novels are there about a middle-aged professor having an extra-marital affair with a young co-ed?” Bird was born into a liberal family (she was conceived when her parents were living in a commune) who “couldn’t give a shit about the sexual content of her poems”. She started writing poems aged six, which she tells me in a critical tone that is not wholly satirical were overlong and mostly about horses, swans and moonlight – but it took many years and a writing gap in her teens to settle into a voice. Growing up, her dad introduced her to literature, and she discovered Emily Dickinson, surrealism and the New York school. She cites Dorothea Lasky, Chelsey Minnis and Kimmy Walters as some of her favourite poets, but also prose writers such as Wodehouse, not to mention Lorrie Moore and Lydia Davis. She completed an MA in poetry from Victoria University of Wellington and had an offer of publication immediately, but threw her whole folio out. “I felt like I had only just started writing the kinds of poems I wanted to,” she said. “It’s not that the poems in it were awful or anything, but you only have one chance to put out your first book,” she said. “I needed more time and space.” She acknowledges the generational aspects to her poetry, particularly the references to the 1990s of her childhood. “That’s why I decided to name my book after myself, because of that whole 90s celebrity culture of singers like Janet Jackson and Britney naming their albums after themselves.” She also points out that New Zealand is “like 10 years” behind the UK in terms of cultural references. Bird is quieter in (virtual) person than on paper, but just as dry. Though she says she writes mainly for the page, some readers tell her they only warm to her poems once they hear them read. I imagine that her readings are very funny, but there is also pain and darkness in her verse, and a kind of gothic relishing of negative emotions that is humorously histrionic. Her imagery conjures antique lockets “filled with pubic hair”, “fucking in a casket”, and “doing a line of sherbert off a toilet seat”. I love her poetry for its total lack of pretension, and that fact that at times it is delightfully, deliciously stupid, as these excruciating, highly emotional moments in life so often are. “People think I am taking a lot of risks when I talk about sex, but I feel really free to write about that stuff,” she says. “I think it’s just that the concept of risk is so intensely personal. For me, I get more embarrassed reading a really sincere love poem out in front of hundreds of people than I would one about a blowjob.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/16/why-american-gastronomy-owes-so-much-to-france","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-16T12:57:56Z","webTitle":"Why American gastronomy owes so much to France","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/16/why-american-gastronomy-owes-so-much-to-france","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/16/why-american-gastronomy-owes-so-much-to-france","fields":{"headline":"Why American gastronomy owes so much to France","bodyText":"From Justin Spring’s new book The Gourmand’s Way: Six Americans in Paris and the Birth of a New Gastronomy, I discovered that the first vital stitches of my own adult destiny were actually part of a much greater and grander tapestry. In identifying the six larger-than-life, food-and-wine-besotted Francophile Americans, who – along with English and French colleagues – launched the US culinary evolution, Spring explains how I myself came to be a food-and-wine besotted American writer living in Paris. It is due to the elegant writings of those six characters – AJ Liebling, Alice B Toklas, MFK Fisher, Julia Child, Alexis Lichine and Richard Olney – that the US went from being a country where the axis of eating was good nutrition to one that today spins so assiduously around the pursuit of gastronomic pleasure. But first: a brief cheat sheet on the players. Liebling, a native New Yorker, wrote about Paris and France for the New Yorker magazine before and after the second world war, with a special ardour for Gallic gastronomy. Toklas, the lover of writer Gertrude Stein, penned an eponymous cookbook that became a counter-culture classic and goaded the country towards its current mania for “farm to table” eating. Fisher, a wry essayist whom Spring correctly scolds as a “fabulist” for the wobbly memory of her popular memoirs was, for better or worse, another authoritative voice to the American masses on the glories of French food. Julia Child needs no introduction, since she penned the cookbook that became America’s aspirational tome in the kitchen for several decades, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and was also one of the first television cookery stars. Lichine, perhaps the weakest link in this chain (Elizabeth David might more logically have occupied his place in this book) was a savvy wine merchant and writer looking to make some money, which he did, by educating the doltish US palate in all things viniferous. Lastly Olney, an Iowa farm boy whose self-taught passion for French food and wine led him to become a distinguished columnist and cookbook author. He is the dark star – perhaps the most interesting one of all – in this constellation. The often brilliant and frequently droll writings of this sextet provided the foodie generation, led by Alice Waters, with the sextant needed to plot a new way of thinking about food in the US. With cooking disparaged as drudgery in the 50s and early 60s by mercenary food writers such as Poppy Cannon, who penned recipes like one for tinned chicken with tinned black cherries flambéed in rum, housewives were urged to embrace an array of industrially produced convenience foods that would allow them to spend less time slaving away in the kitchen. In different ways, these six said no to all of that, instead extolling the daily pleasure of cooking with fresh, seasonal produce, the way they do in France – the gastronome and vinophile’s Shangri-La. This idea – the ineluctable gastronomic grandeur of Gaul, first reached me on a warm June day in Westport, Connecticut, in the 70s. My high-school friend and I – aged 15 – were having lunch with his mother and her new lover at Bon Appetite, a restaurant recently opened by two women who had studied cooking in Paris. Just past noon, a wispy blonde woman in a calico apron came to our table with a plate of carved carrot, courgette and celery spears to be dipped into the ramekin of herb-flecked fromage blanc beside them, and another small faience bowl of radishes piled up around a little green glass dish of strangely grey-coloured salt. “The radishes wake up so nicely with just a little turn in the French sea salt,” she said and withdrew. “Well, shall I wake up a radish then?” said Mrs Wertheim, my friend’s mother’s lover, and we laughed. Then, a stilted silence, which I broke with a question. “I wonder how you could ever get the salt out of the sea?” I said, and the other three looked at me with stark horror. “Are you serious, Alec?” My mind spun. I was. Water is wet. Salt is dry. So how could you do it? “They probably heat the sea water in cauldrons, Alec, so that it evaporates and leaves the salt behind. There are also some places in France where this occurs naturally in shallow salt pans by the sea,” said Mrs Wertheim with stony authority. To describe this occasion as psychologically loaded would be putting it mildly, since my high-school friend and I had headed to this lunch after another fumbling sexual encounter in the back seat of my family’s station wagon. The two women were waiting for us when we arrived, and the bemused expression on the face of Mrs Wertheim, a kohl-eyed textile designer with a heavy New-York accent, made me almost certain she knew why we were late. But then we were no more intended to know these married women were lovers, whom my mother had first innocently introduced as bridge partners a few months earlier, than they were to know the same thing about us. If the soft fart of a cork slipping out of a bottle of rosé sealed this truce of omission, my fascination with the restaurant provided me with more than enough earnest conversational fodder to feign persuasive ignorance of our twinned passions. And this undertow of sex had already framed this meal as excruciatingly exciting even before the blonde woman returned and propped a chalkboard menu up on a bentwood chair next to our table. With my timid suburban appetites only nascently aroused, I hadn’t yet overcome my deep and, for a New Englander, perverse aversion to seafood, so I ordered the sorrel soup and the roast chicken. The vivid green potage with a swirl of sour cream tasted strangely but intriguingly like a copper penny, while the chicken left me dumbstruck. Even the mesclun salad was amazing, a colourful toss of tiny leaves and even a couple of nasturtium flowers, which I wrongly assumed were inedible, perhaps even poisonous. But they weren’t. The single best thing I ate that day, though, were several small, potent, dark-green leaves that had a shockingly delicious flavour all on their own. I learned that they are called arugula in the US (and rocket in Britain). I left the table craving more, much more, and also determined to learn about food and cooking, which – unbeknownst to me at the time – would set me up for the same kind of quest blazed by Spring’s sybaritic sextet. And rather like me, as it turned out, their deep delectation of food and wine was also driven by an omnivorous sensuality that encompassed everything from great art and music to good sex, and lots of it. Two months after this lunch, you see, I went to Europe, en famille, for the first time and, if a month of pasta and two weeks of schnitzels made me very happy, this trip really gained serious traction for me when our train from Basel pulled into the Gare de l’Est in Paris early on a sweltering August morning. The queue at the cab rank was hopeless, so my mother decided breakfast was the answer, and in the space of a croissant that shattered into crumb when I touched it and the handsome waiter’s waft of frankly male sweat, I knew it would be Paris for me – and so it was.

The late 70s have been commodified, just as the swinging 60s were. John Lydon is now a Brexit-praising expat (although the veteran polemicist might just have been promoting his book earlier this year). So much sputum has passed under the bridge. Born in a heady swirl of controversy, battles raged over punk’s essence from the start. What should it be called? Who, if anyone, was in charge of anarchy? Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren always insisted it was all his own Machiavellian-situationist art prank. Lydon has always lasered the notion with his cerulean stare. And what of the thousands of ordinary suburban teens punk touched? Were they swindled or liberated? It is easy to oversimplify the fight over punk’s soul as a tussle between the theorisers and the destroyers, but two very different books chuck more petrol on the fire. The Bollocks Diaries comes out of the Pistols’ bunker and traces a timeline through 1977, the year of their landmark debut album, with cuttings, flyers, studio logs and gob-sized commentaries. A reviewer might ordinarily raise an eyebrow at this cut-and-paste job. Yet it seems apt. Cutting and pasting is none more Jamie Reid (the visual arm of the Sex Pistols’ attack on decency, who really was inspired by the situationists). This material was previously available on a high-end box set, but the interviews were specially commissioned rather than lifted from previous sources. The Bollocks Diaries bullishly presents the Sex Pistols as a working band who laid down bass overdubs, got hepatitis and, frequently, beaten up, all the while surfing the chaos they only occasionally controlled. The Malcolm McLaren telegram that informed Melody Maker of Glen Matlock’s sacking is reproduced (“WENT ON TOO LONG ABOUT PAUL MCCARTNEY STOP”). After chewing their way through most of London’s uncomprehending record companies and pocketing significant cash, the Pistols landed at Virgin. Investors Review magazine named the group young businessmen of the year and put them on their cover. Being understood didn’t suit the Pistols, either. As punk chronicler Fred Vermorel – now a PhD, but then the co-conspirator who introduced McLaren to Vivienne Westwood – notes: “[Virgin boss Richard] Branson was a canny old hippy who knew all those art school games and wasn’t going to be fazed by anything. Once the Pistols got involved with Virgin… no one got really angry.” Were the art school games of canny old hippies behind punk? Sometimes, but perhaps more in theory than practice. An essay in Punk Is Dead: Modernity Killed Every Night by fanzine writer Tom Vague retraces McLaren’s appetite for destruction back through the situationists, the lettrists, psychogeography and a tiny late 60s Notting Hill faction called King Mob (a reference to the Gordon Riots of 1780). Authors Richard Cabut and Andrew Gallix have skin in the game; Cabut is an ex-punk (“In the summer of 1977 I am 17 – perfect”) who became a playwright, while Gallix is at the Sorbonne and edits a free-ranging literary webzine called 3:AM (“whatever it is, we’re against it”).The book’s title (Modernity Killed Every Night) quotes Jacques Vaché, friend to the surrealist André Breton. But Punk Is Dead isn’t end-to-end cultural theory; there’s a lot on clothes. Three strands unfurl – papers, essays and first-person accounts. Cabut and Gallix have included historical documents – such as Penny Rimbaud’s 1977 essay, Banned from the Roxy, newly annotated by the Crass drummer – while Gallix argues that punk started ending when it acquired a name. Jon Savage is here, and Ted Polhemus and Vermorel (again). As that list attests, punk can be a tiresomely Boy’s Own narrative, to which former Slit Viv Albertine’s 2014 memoir was a potent corrective. With the exception of Judy Nylon’s introduction and the reminiscences of go-go dancer turned drummer Dorothy Max Prior, however, this collection is let down by its dearth of female voices. Perhaps the notion to take away from both books – indeed from punk itself – is the one of endless possibility. As an interview with the punk turned philosopher Simon Critchley attests, punk unleashed ideas. It palpably changed suburban teenage futures, rather than ending them. • To order The Sex Pistols 1977: The Bollocks Diaries (Cassell Illustrated, £25) for £21.25, or Punk Is Dead: Modernity Killed Every Night by Richard Cabut and Andrew Gallix (Zero Books, £17.99) for £15.29 go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

As well as helping people turn their lives around, they’re also reducing the number of preventable referrals to social services. One mother, a single parent under enormous stress, tackling benefit and employment problems, says the Team Around the Family in Schools (TIS) initiative has been her “lifeline”, adding: “Someone cared – and I feel very fortunate.” TIS, the winner of the learning and development award in the 2017 Guardian Public Service Awards, sits within Swansea council’s established Team Around the Family (TAF) division, originally set up to work with families with needs that cannot be met by a single service. TAF trains staff in schools to “begin to recognise and tackle early-stage social challenges facing their pupils”, and ensure “the right support at the right time”, to vulnerable families, the council explains. Training – covering areas such as parenting, domestic abuse, mental health and safeguarding – is offered to headteachers, pastoral workers and teaching assistants. So far, the results have been impressive; in its first year there were 286 referrals from schools to TAF and the council’s family partnership team. Now in its third year, and with dedicated resources embedded in schools, that figure has dropped to 88 for the first nine months of the year. The TAF waiting list is now down to nil and the £130,000 annual TIS budget has proven to be cost-effective, as it relieves pressure on more complex services down the line. To date, 607 families and children from 63 primary schools have been supported by TIS. TIS was set up to address the long waiting list for a TAF referral, which, in turn, was putting pressure on early intervention social work services. Too many children awaiting support were also ending up in child protection or statutory services. Collaboration and partnerships have been crucial to the success of the scheme, as has making the initiative sustainable, says manager Sue Peraj, who spearheaded the project. While some schools were reticent to begin with, when the training began to bear fruit for families, schools and social work capacity, the scheme grew. “We’ve seen a reduction in escalation of need and a reduction in referrals,” Peraj says. “Schools are wanting more training.” Other councils have been in touch to learn more about the results, she adds. Headteachers have praised the programme as an innovative response to a difficult problem. “I cannot speak more highly of the service in its aim to help others in times of crisis,” says one. “TIS really has made a difference to our community.” Testimonials from families also suggest the initiative hits the mark. “After four sessions with TIS on understanding and managing emotions, I saw a big difference in my son,” says one parent. “He now seems happier in himself and not so worried.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/nov/15/indigenous-groups-win-greater-climate-recognition-at-bonn-summit","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-15T16:11:46Z","webTitle":"Indigenous groups win greater climate recognition at Bonn summit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/15/indigenous-groups-win-greater-climate-recognition-at-bonn-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/nov/15/indigenous-groups-win-greater-climate-recognition-at-bonn-summit","fields":{"headline":"Indigenous groups win greater climate recognition at Bonn summit","bodyText":"Indigenous groups claimed a victory at the UN climate talks in Bonn on Wednesday as governments acknowledged for the first time that they can play a leadership role in protecting forests and keeping global temperatures at a safe level. Long marginalised and often criminalised in their home countries, the “first peoples” – as they often refer to themselves – also achieved breakthroughs in terms of official international recognition of their rights, autonomy and participation in negotiations. This represents considerable progress for the world’s 370 million indigenous peoples, whose territories are estimated to contain 20% of the world’s tropical forest carbon and often have to defend it against encroachments by loggers and farmers. “This is a victory for indigenous peoples who have always been fighting for recognition of our rights as a way to protect forests and tackle climate change. This is a big advance,” said Juan Carlos Jintiach of Coica, a group representing indigenous communities in the Amazon. For much of the past 20 years, indigenous groups have been a disgruntled, fractious presence on the fringes of climate talks who were primarily portrayed as victims, but this has gradually changed along with a growing body of research showing that respect for the territorial rights of communal land is one of the most cost-effective ways of sequestering carbon. The 2015 Paris accord recognised the contribution of indigenous knowledge in dealing with climate change, but the document approved in Bonn this week goes further by acknowledging that countries “should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities.” It also proposes greater participation of indigenous communities in “leadership roles” and mentions this will have budget implications, opening the possibility that they could be covered by the Green Climate Fund. “This shows that the international community increasingly recognises the way indigenous peoples and local communities manage their lands and territories can be an important climate change solution, because they help to protect forests and other natural resources. Now for the first time the UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] is establishing concrete mechanisms, with funding to support those efforts,” said Penny Davies of the Ford Foundation. In a sign of the change in status, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was scheduled to meet indigenous representatives in Bonn on Wednesday. China, which is keen to appear as a climate leader, has also softened its position on indigenous rights, long shaped by Beijing’s concern about separatist movements in Tibet, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. Governments should now be obliged to talk to indigenous communities when drawing up national climate targets, though their influence remains to be seen. Former Brazilian environment minister Izabella Teixiera welcomed the move and hoped it would have positive domestic as well as international implications. “Indigenous rights are really important to move towards a fair, low-carbon planet,” she said. “I hope this can also help us avoid backsliding on this agenda in Brazil.” Clare Shakya of the International Institute for Environment and Development said new mechanisms for indigenous participation should not be used to channel their voices away from the main debate. “This is an important step forward but only if it really does mean that indigenous and local communities are listened to and their knowledge recognised,” she said. “This decision is an opportunity to make sure that they drive the solutions to tackling climate change. Throughout this climate meeting numerous representatives from developing countries have said how top-down responses to addressing climate change actually marginalises them. Today’s decision is a chance to change that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/18/england-jermaine-mcgillvary-png-world-cup-rugby-league","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-18T10:00:29Z","webTitle":"England’s Jermaine McGillvary ready for World Cup bruises against PNG","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/18/england-jermaine-mcgillvary-png-world-cup-rugby-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/18/england-jermaine-mcgillvary-png-world-cup-rugby-league","fields":{"headline":"England’s Jermaine McGillvary ready for World Cup bruises against PNG","bodyText":"Following a group stage of ups, downs and an overwhelming sense of room for improvement, the return of Sam Burgess for Sunday’s World Cup quarter-final against Papua New Guinea offers England belief that perhaps the best is yet to come: and how they will need it. Burgess’s return from the knee injury suffered against Australia happily coincides with the beginning of the knockout stage and while the quarter-finals were straightforward for England to negotiate four years ago against France, the story could be markedly different in Melbourne. To suggest rugby league is a way of life in Papua New Guinea would be an understatement. The only nation that has rugby league as its undisputed national sport, its passion for the game is emphasised by the fact well over a quarter of the population will be glued to TV sets on Sunday . There are stories of locals walking miles to play and fans scaling mountains to see their heroes live. In PNG, rugby league is not only a game, it is everything – and how thankful England will be that they are playing them in Melbourne, not the tropical climate of Port Moresby. The three sellout fixtures in the PNG capital during the group stage have created the most colour and perhaps the biggest positives for a tournament which, in certain areas of Australia, has struggled to command mainstream attention. In PNG the World Cup is all people are talking about. There is a possibility the world may see much more of PNG in the coming years whatever happens against Wayne Bennett’s side. The long-term goal is a side competing in Australia’s elite competition, the NRL. Its strongest domestic side, the PNG Hunters, played in the second-tier Queensland Cup this year as a test of their ambitions – and they won the competition. “PNG are unbeaten in the World Cup so far and full of confidence,” the England wing Jermaine McGillvary said. “You’re going to cop a few bruises against them when you play; they’ve always been physical but now they’ve got some top-level experience and some real talent.” England players have never needed to burrow through jungle to get to training as youngsters but just as PNG have caught the eye throughout the tournament on and off the field, so has McGillvary – with his story also worth not neglecting. The 29-year-old did not spend his teenage years playing academy rugby before being promoted to Huddersfield’s first-team; he spent his evenings and weekends working in a warehouse. Rugby league was not on his radar until his friend and now Huddersfield team-mate Leroy Cudjoe convinced him to give it a go. Huddersfield signed him and, after a couple of loan spells in the lower leagues, McGillvary now finds himself a try-scoring sensation for club and country. “I’ve come a long way,” he said. “A lot of people have helped me to reap the rewards but I’ve made a lot of sacrifices, too. I guess I’ve seen those sacrifices bear fruit in the last few years.” McGillvary’s tournament was in doubt following a biting allegation by the Lebanon captain, Robbie Farah. He was acquitted after only three minutes at a hearing last week, leaving the focus to be on his performances – which have attracted admirers aplenty in Australia. Is he interested in the NRL? “It’s something I may look at but it’s not really entered my mind before,” he said. “I’m happy at Huddersfield and I’ve never looked to try to get out. There’s never been any interest.” Another strong performance to help England into the semi-finals and there may be more people taking notice of McGillvary. World Cup quarter-final: England Widdop; McGillvary, Watkins, Bateman, Hall; Brown, Gale; Hill, Hodgson, Graham, S Burgess, Whitehead, O’Loughlin. Interchange Walmsley, T Burgess, Currie, Roby. Papua New Guinea Mead; Olam, Ottio, MacDonald, Lo; A Boas, W Boas; Meninga, Segeyaro, Page, Martin, Minoga, Aiton. Interchange Baptiste, Amean, Albert, Griffin. Fiji stun Kiwis in World Cup quarter-final New Zealand are out of the World Cup after Fiji edged a try-less game to book a semi-final date with Australia. The Kiwis, finalists in the last three tournaments, looked a shadow of their former selves and Fiji took advantage to claim a 4-2 victory in an error-strewn first meeting between the sides. Fiji dominated the first half in Wellington but were too slow and laboured to break the Kiwis down as they failed to add to Apisai Koroisau’s penalty. The Bati could not make the most of Jordan Rapana’s sin-binning and only held a slender advantage heading into the closing stages after Shaun Johnson and Taane Milne exchanged two-pointers. But that proved to be enough as they held on to reach a third successive semi-final. New Zealand, who lost star forward Jason Taumalolo to Tonga and were without Jesse Bromwich and Kevin Proctor for disciplinary reasons, made a bright start to the tournament but Tonga knocked the stuffing out of the 2008 champions and Fiji finished them off. No side scored more points than Fiji in the group stage and they thought they had taken a fifth-minute lead through Brayden Williame, only for replays to show the Catalans Dragons player had failed to ground the ball. New Zealand had made a shaky start following their shock defeat by Tonga and they were relieved to be just 2-0 down after 20 minutes with Fiji only having Koroisau’s penalty to show for their early dominance. The Kiwis lost back-rower Joseph Tapine to injury to cap off a miserable first 40 minutes but they were still well in the game at half-time. Johnson got New Zealand on the board after Fiji were penalised for dissent but the Kiwis were immediately on the back foot again after Rapana was sent to the bin for a professional foul. New Zealand came through the 10-minute period unscathed after Williame had a try ruled out for a double movement. But any hopes they would build on that effort were dashed as Milne accepted the offer of two points after more Kiwi indiscipline. New Zealand were gifted late field position after Kevin Naiqama lost the ball on his own 40-metre mark but Fiji knew the game was won when Brad Takairangi failed to reach Rapana’s kick. Press Association Tonga cling on to edge out Lebanon Tonga survived an almighty scare to reach their first World Cup semi-final with a tense 24-22 win over Lebanon. The Pacific Islanders were a shadow of the side that beat New Zealand in their previous game and were grateful for a contentious decision by English video referee Ben Thaler to disallow a Lebanese try for their victory. The Cedars fought back from 16-6 down to get within six points by half-time and thought they had drawn level when centre Adam Doueihi went over on 45 minutes only to be denied by an obstruction ruling that looked harsh.

The commitment was welcomed by environmental and wildlife groups, though they stressed that any eventual measures would need to be ambitious and coordinated. An estimated 12m tonnes of plastic enters the oceans each year, and residues are routinely found in fish, sea birds and marine mammals. This week it emerged that plastics had been discovered even in creatures living seven miles beneath the sea. The introduction just over two years ago of a 5p charge on single-use plastic bags led to an 85% reduction in their use inside six months. Separately, the environment department is seeking evidence on how to reduce the dumping of takeaway drinks containers such as coffee cups through measures such as a deposit return scheme. Announcing the move on plastics, the Treasury cited statistics saying more than a million birds and 100,000 sea mammals and turtles die each year from eating or getting tangled in plastic waste. The BBC series Blue Planet II has highlighted the scale of plastic debris in the oceans. In the episode to be broadcast this Sunday, albatrosses try to feed plastic to their young, and a pilot whale carries her dead calf with her for days in mourning. Scientists working with the programme believed the mother’s milk was made poisonous by pollution. The call for evidence will begin in the new year and will take into account the findings of the consultation on drinks containers. Tisha Brown, an oceans campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said the decades-long use of almost indestructible materials to make single-use products “was bound to lead to problems, and we’re starting to discover how big those problems are”. She said: “Ocean plastic pollution is a global emergency, it is everywhere from the Arctic Ocean at top of the world to the Marianas trench at the bottom of the Pacific. It’s in whales, turtles and 90% of sea birds, and it’s been found in our salt, our tap water and even our beer. “The Treasury’s announcement is only a statement of intent, but it recognises the significance of the problem and the urgent need for a solution. There is a long way to go, but hopefully this is the beginning of the end for single-use plastic.” Jeff Knott, head of nature policy for the RSPB, noted how Blue Planet was “seeing attention turned to the manmade threats the marine world faces”. He said: “Sadly our marine life is in trouble. Through the mismanagement of our waters with fishing, pollution and littering we are seeing declines in many important marine species as well as those that depend on them. “A tax on single-use plastics is a welcome move, but we must also recognise more needs to be done to tackle the often less visible threats.” After the Brexit vote, Knott said, the UK had “a strong interest in demonstrating global leadership in tackling this international problem that impacts not just on our shores and our overseas territories but every coastline around the world. However, this must be part of a bigger package of measures that also looks at overfishing, lack of protection, climate change and pollution.” Mike Barrett, director of science and policy for the wildlife charity WWF, said: “Too often birds, fish, turtles and whales are found dead having eaten plastic. Plastic is suffocating our seas. “Any action to tackle single-use plastic is a good thing, but we must ensure any action is truly ambitious if we want to make the real difference needed to help save the planet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/18/west-bromwich-albion-chelsea-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-18T17:04:10Z","webTitle":"Tony Pulis on the brink after four-goal Chelsea hammer West Brom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/18/west-bromwich-albion-chelsea-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/18/west-bromwich-albion-chelsea-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Tony Pulis on the brink after four-goal Chelsea hammer West Brom","bodyText":"The message was loud and clear as the home supporters spelt out to Guochuan Lai, the club’s Chinese owner, exactly what they think of Tony Pulis. Anger and frustration has been bubbling away here for a while, yet this was the afternoon when patience finally snapped. “We want Pulis out,” was chanted repeatedly by a fanbase that is no longer willing to tolerate the sight of him in charge of a team in freefall. “You’re getting sacked in the morning” and “Tony Pulis, your football is shit” also reverberated as Chelsea brutally exposed the brittle confidence in a side that has now won two of their past 21 Premier League matches and collected 12 points in the process. It is relegation form and Pulis appears powerless to arrest the slide. Lai had scheduled this visit around six weeks ago but it could not have been more timely and it was tempting to wonder what was going through his mind as he watched such a listless performance on the pitch and listened to the scathing criticism of Pulis from the stands. Pulis’s position felt untenable come the end and the 59-year-old sounded like a man who is resigned to his fate when he attended the post-match press conference, The empty seats before the game told a story – faith was lost in these parts a long time ago – and so did the sight of many others leaving with 27 minutes remaining. Eden Hazard had just scored his second and Chelsea’s fourth as they coasted to a fourth successive Premier League victory. This had turned into an exercise in damage limitation for Albion long before half-time. Chelsea were 3-0 up after only 38 minutes and, as well as the Premier League champions played at times, it was alarming to see a team managed by Pulis defending so shambolically. There was so much time and space for Chelsea to exploit and the visitors were not going to pass up the opportunity. Álvaro Morata continued his excellent start to the season, netting Chelsea’s first from close range and setting up the second for Hazard, taking his tally to eight goals and four assists in the league. Marcos Alonso then scored Chelsea’s third, taking advantage of some appalling marking from a set-piece, before Hazard added the goal that reflected the gulf in quality between the two sides. Antonio Conte will have few easier afternoons in the dugout. “The game became easy because we started very well,” said Chelsea’s manager, who senses that his team are finding some form. “Last season we won 13 games in a row and I must be honest, in this league it’s not simple to have this type of run, because every game you have to play with great concentration. But four wins in a row is important for us and our confidence. We started this season with many problems but we are trying slowly to find the right solution.” Morata certainly seems like the answer up front. The Spaniard’s opening goal was routine enough but it was an exquisite flick he produced from Cesc Fàbregas’s pass to set Hazard free for Chelsea’s second. Hazard rounded Ben Foster with the minimum of fuss, rolled the ball into the empty net and already, with 23 minutes gone, it felt like there was no way back for Albion. That feeling was reinforced when Alonso added the third. Fàbregas, who was involved in three of Chelsea’s four goals, delivered a free-kick from wide on the left and it is no exaggeration to say that there was no defender within five yards of Alonso, who volleyed high into the roof of the net with the angle against him at the far post. Toothless up front, overrun in midfield and wide open at the back, Albion were all over the place and it was no surprise when Chelsea grabbed a fourth. Fàbregas’s fine lofted pass released Hazard in behind and the Belgian twisted away from Ahmed Hegazi before dispatching a low shot into the bottom corner. The game was up for Albion. And it surely is for Pulis, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/22/why-the-communist-manifesto-and-marx-are-still-relevant-today","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T17:34:15Z","webTitle":"Why The Communist Manifesto and Marx are still relevant today | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/22/why-the-communist-manifesto-and-marx-are-still-relevant-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/22/why-the-communist-manifesto-and-marx-are-still-relevant-today","fields":{"headline":"Why The Communist Manifesto and Marx are still relevant today","bodyText":"Yanis Varoufakis’s eloquent reminder to us of the continued relevance of The Communist Manifesto (A manifesto for right now, 20 April) is not only a fitting snub to those who had predicted the “end of history” but also an implicit call for us to re-examine the ideas of Marx and Engels in the light of the present crisis of capitalism as a model for global development. The Guardian itself will be exhibiting cartoons and caricatures of Marx (selected from an international competition organised by the Ken Sprague Fund) in the foyer of its headquarters from 23 April until 13 May. Your cartoonist Martin Rowson has just published his own inimitable version of the Communist Manifesto. And there is a major conference examining Marx’s ideas with international speakers at Soas on 5 May – the 200th anniversary of Marx’s birth. John Green Secretary, Ken Sprague Fund • “Liberty, happiness, autonomy, individuality, spirituality, self-guided development are ideals that Marx and Engels valued above everything else,” writes Yanis Varoufakis. He is profoundly mistaken. The ideals he lists are those indispensable to the workings of capitalism, and there are many capitalist ideologues who would be prepared to stand alongside him and chant their virtues. Yes to the defence of human rights – but to talk to the dispossessed in terms of “authentic human happiness and freedom” is to disorient and disarm them in the face of the forces that are really in command. The Communist Manifesto is unremittingly focused not on the unity of “the people” but on the divisions within a social formation that pits one class against another in a struggle to the death. Dr Malcolm Read Belper, Derbyshire • Yanis Varoufakis is right to underline the continuing relevance of The Communist Manifesto’s analysis of capitalism. It was read by very few people in 1848 when it was first published, but Marx and Engels were then engaged in the other side of the equation from the theory of the Manifesto – practice. In 1848, revolutions rocked Europe and beyond, challenging the rule of capital in a way that has rarely been seen since. Both Marx and Engels played an active role in events, which ended with Marx appearing in Britain as a political refugee. Home secretaries in those days were a little more relaxed about such things than they have been in recent times.

Amid Brexiter threats of a leadership challenge, the former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury committee, said party rebels should be careful what they wished for. “This sabre-rattling is not coming from the section of the party that I represent. It is coming from the pro-Brexit section of the party and is deeply unhelpful,” she said. Government hopes of avoiding a hard border in Ireland either through technological innovation or regulatory alignment have been set back after they were rejected during preliminary negotiations in Brussels. That has led to speculation that May is preparing to concede on a customs union, which has been a red line since the prime minister’s conference speech in October 2016. Reports over the weekend suggested a “wargaming” exercise into the consequences of a concession showed that not even leading Brexiters such as Michael Gove, the environment secretary, or Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, would resign. But a source close to Gove reiterated his opposition: “Michael believes respecting the referendum result means taking back control of trade policy. He fully supports the prime minister’s position that this means leaving the customs union.” Although the loss of other pledges in negotiations have been reluctantly accepted, such as the promise to reclaim control over fishing quotas from March 2019, accepting continued membership of a customs union would be of a different and much larger scale. Downing Street sources dismissed the idea. “The position remains very clear: we don’t think staying in a customs union is the right thing to do and it isn’t government policy to do so,” a spokesperson said. Any customs union makes it effectively impossible to negotiate free trade deals with other countries – one of the government’s key ambitions and a central justification for leaving the EU. But a meaningful vote on remaining in the customs union is likely in the next few months. At least 10 Tory backbenchers have signed an amendment to the trade and customs bill supporting continued membership. Morgan is one of the 12 select committee chairs who are backing that policy in a potentially difficult debate in the Commons on Thursday on customs union membership. She said it would be an opportunity for a calm debate about the reality of leaving the customs union based on the evidence that select committees were hearing as they investigated its potential impact. “If every time we debate these issues or pass an amendment all we end up with is this hysteria and leadership speculation, that is not in Britain’s interest,” she said. “The majority of the party would not entertain a leadership contest at the moment and those who want to ... should think very carefully if they really want to intervene in the negotiations in the way a leadership contest would.” Labour MP Chuka Umunna, and pro-remain Tory Anna Soubry have tabled amendments to the trade and customs bill, due to be debated on Thursday, that would make staying in the customs union a legal objective of the government. In the House of Lords, the government is braced for more defeats as peers begin a second week of votes on the EU withdrawal bill on Monday. Last week, 24 Tory peers backed the customs union amendment. The most difficult vote on Monday is likely to be on the EU charter of fundamental rights. The government nearly lost a vote in the Commons on a similar amendment, which seeks to incorporate the charter into the legislation. It is one of the few major aspects of EU law that has been left out. The government argues that the rights it protects are already covered by UK law, but it also says the charter provides more protection than is needed. Campaigners fear that means the government will seek to dilute the rights. Peter Goldsmith, who as Tony Blair’s attorney general was involved in drafting the charter, said it was only excluded from the withdrawal bill because of an ideologically driven hatred of the EU. The government is vulnerable on the issue, with Tory rebels such as the former attorney general Dominic Grieve only dropping their opposition when the bill passed its earlier stages after ministers pledged to publish a review of the rights conferred by the charter and set out their view. The published review eventually amounted to an extended criticism of the EU charter. In remarks that indicate Grieve may yet lead a revolt in the Commons, he said it would be unacceptable for rights to be left unprotected while waiting for the government to come forward with new legislation to make up for the loss of EU law. “I want to see how the government responds,” he said. “I understand that in the longer term we need a new system, but it’s a mistake not to leave the protections intact for now.” The equalities and human rights commission insists the charter is essential to safeguard individual rights effectively and adapt to changing circumstances. The charter includes a general right to non-discrimination, protection of a child’s best interests and the right to human dignity, none of which are properly protected by existing UK law."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27498","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T23:00:06Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,498","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27498","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27498","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,498","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/22/verne-troyer-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T13:45:43Z","webTitle":"Verne Troyer obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/22/verne-troyer-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/22/verne-troyer-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Verne Troyer obituary","bodyText":"In his comic trilogy of Austin Powers movies, Mike Myers created and starred as several characters, including Powers, a groovy 1960s photographer-cum-secret agent, and his nemesis, the cackling but sweetly naive Dr Evil. For the second and most successful outing, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999), Dr Evil was joined by a cloned sidekick, Mini-Me, an exact replica of himself in miniature played by the actor Verne Troyer, who has died aged 49. The character was originally killed off at the end of that film, but his popularity at early test screenings earned him a reprieve and he returned for the final instalment, Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002). There are no straight men in the Austin Powers movies – each actor gets a chance to be funny, or at least to be humiliated amusingly – and Troyer, who stood 2ft 8in as a result of cartilage-hair hypoplasia, received a large chunk of the audience’s laughter, not to mention goodwill. The Spy Who Shagged Me showed him committing acts of violence disproportionate to his size: at one point, he lifts Austin and spins him around above his head. But Myers and the director, Jay Roach, later realised that it was more effective in slapstick terms to show the character as victim rather than aggressor, thrown around like a doll or booted across a room. In the third film, Austin kicks Mini-Me into a hotel mini-bar. The men threaten one another with bottles – Austin’s a regular-sized one, Mini-Me’s a miniature – before Austin catches him in a pillow case and smashes it against tables, walls and cabinets. Later, the character becomes Austin’s own sidekick, dressing correspondingly in blue velvet suit, frilly shirt and Harry Palmer specs, and passing lewd Post-it notes to Beyoncé Knowles. Born and brought up in Centreville, Michigan, Verne was the son of Reuben and Susan, who were both factory workers. They were average-sized, and when Verne was young belonged to the Amish community: “They never treated me any different than my other average-sized siblings. I used to have to carry wood, feed the cows and pigs and farm animals.” The family also used a horse and buggy rather than a car, though borrowed an aunt’s when Verne had an infection and needed to be taken to hospital quickly, and left the religion while he was still a child. He was working as a telephone customer service assistant when a friend put him in touch with the makers of Baby’s Day Out (1994), who were looking for a stand-in and stunt double. This led to roles in the simian-based romp Dunston Checks In (1996), the science-fiction comedy Men in Black (1997), Terry Gilliam’s adaptation of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) and How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000). Troyer can also be seen in a Santa Claus costume fighting Arnold Schwarzenegger in Jingle All the Way (1996). The popularity of the Austin Powers films, and Myers’s particular facility with comic language, ensured that the phrase “Mini-Me” entered common usage, just as “Not!”, “Schwing!” and “We’re not worthy!” from his Wayne’s World movie had done before. This longevity guaranteed Troyer’s permanent association with the role while also restricting other casting possibilities. He played Griphook the goblin in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (2001), but never found another part as memorable as Mini-Me. He starred in pop videos by Madonna, Moby and Ludacris. Though he had a speaking role as an ice-hockey coach in Myers’s The Love Guru (2008), that picture was a commercial and critical disaster. He was reunited with Gilliam on The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009), the film on which Heath Ledger was working at the time of his death. Troyer’s appearance in Werner Herzog’s My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done (2010), executive-produced by David Lynch, was “nonsensical” according to Variety magazine, and only one of the many bizarre elements in this tale of a man who slays his mother with a sword. He then starred in the unloved British TV comedy spin-off Keith Lemon: The Film (2012). Troyer’s private life was marked by alcoholism, depression and occasional scandal; no cause for his death was announced immediately. His marriage to Genevieve Gowman, who modelled as Genevieve Gallen, was annulled in 2004. Four years later, he sued the celebrity site TMZ for disseminating a tape showing him having sex. Turns on reality TV shows, including Celebrity Big Brother, Celebrity Wife Swap and The Surreal Life (which he described as “garbage”) did little to boost his career or his spirits.

With a statue of suffragist Millicent Fawcett set to become the first of a woman in London’s Parliament Square on Tuesday, analysis from the Fawcett Society Sex and Power Index has shown that men still overwhelmingly dominate positions of power in every sector of society. The figures show that women make up only 6% of FTSE 100 chief executives, 16.7% of supreme court justices, 17.6% of national newspaper editors, 26% of cabinet ministers and 32% of MPs. “When we see this data brought together it is both shocking and stark – despite some prominent women leaders, men haven’t let go of the reins of power and progress is painfully slow,” said Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society. “Equality won’t happen on its own. We have to make it happen. That is why we are calling for time-limited use of quotas and making all jobs flexible by default.” She called for legislation that would force companies to advertise all jobs on a flexible basis unless there was a business reason for them not to be. The organisation is also urging the government to enact section 106 of the Equality Act, which requires political parties to report the diversity of their candidates. Despite the law no data is collected and there is no monitoring of party representation regarding disability, ethnicity or gender. Reflecting of the length of time it took to get a statue of a woman in Parliament Square, Smethers added: “It is no coincidence that male-dominated decision-making has to date commemorated so few of the great women in our history. We have to correct this imbalance for future generations and we have to ensure that women today can overcome those persistent structural barriers, which hold all of us back.” Figures from the Fawcett Society also show that black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) and disabled women are further excluded from decision-making positions. BAME women are 7% of the UK population, but just 4% of MPs and there are no BAME female chief executives of companies in the FTSE 100. There are only two women MPs in the Commons who identify as disabled. Caroline Criado-Perez, who launched the campaign to have a statue of a woman erected in Parliament Square, said the battle for equality was far from over. “If Millicent Fawcett were alive today, I wonder what she’d think about how far we’ve come,” she said. “The past hundred years for women have been momentous and have left us more liberated than ever before – at least in law. But equality on paper isn’t the same as equality in real life, and as the dismal figures outlined in this report reveal, we still have a long way to go.” Revealing the gender breakdown in politics, the Fawcett Index reveals that women make up 26% of cabinet ministers, and 34.5% of those who attend cabinet. Labour fares better - achieving gender parity in the shadow cabinet. Women lead 33% of select committees and make up 26% of the House of Lords. In local government, just 17% of council leaders are women, compared to 33% of councillors. Women make up only 11% of combined authority representatives and 17.5% of police and crime commissioners. None of the six directly elected metropolitan mayors are women. In public life only 16.7% supreme court justices are women, and for university vice-chancellors the figure stands at 26%. While 62.5% of secondary school teachers are women, only 38% of schools have a female head teacher, and 31.6% of NHS trust chairs are women. Women are also under-represented in the arts, according to the analysis, making up 65% of theatre audiences but only 39% of casts and 28% of playwrights. Women are over-represented in some areas though: they make up 91% of prostitute characters and 91% of housekeepers on screen. Only 21.7% of gallery and museum chairs are women, and 34% of directors. Just 2.7% of statues in the UK depict women. The Fawcett Society is calling for arts funding to be be tied to proactive gender-equal representation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/22/chelsea-v-southampton-fa-cup-semi-final-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T16:25:36Z","webTitle":"Chelsea 2-0 Southampton: FA Cup semi-final – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/22/chelsea-v-southampton-fa-cup-semi-final-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/22/chelsea-v-southampton-fa-cup-semi-final-live","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea 2-0 Southampton: FA Cup semi-final — as it happened","bodyText":"Dominic Fifield’s match report has landed, so I shall leave you with that. Thanks for your company today, bye! Antonio Conte speaks! “To reach two FA Cup finals in a row is not easy. I’m pleased for our fans, who deserve this win the most. Now it’s important to try to finish the league season as strongly as possible and then to think about the final.” Mark Hughes speaks! “We’re disappointed. The response to conceding so early in the second half was very good. We didn’t get any luck. Their keeper made a glaring mistake [for the disallowed goal]. I would have thought that was a clear example of where VAR should be used. There was a clear handball as well by Giroud. They didn’t refer that either. So we feel a little bit hard done by. But we were up against great quality and conceding the first goal made it difficult.” The general conclusion is that Mr Laws is not a football man, and that’s why Southampton’s goal was disallowed. Re: the disallowed goal, Graham Poll says that goalkeepers are protected by the laws if their feet are off the ground in the six-yard box. In essence, you can’t touch them. Olivier Giroud on his slalom solo goal “My second passion is actually skiing! I just tried to dribble a little bit and I had a bit of luck, but that’s what I wanted to do. I’m very pleased for the team as we’ve done a great job. Wembley is like my garden and I love to play here.” Eden Hazard speaks! “We fully deserved to win. I thought we played a very good game, especially second half, and created a lot of chances. At half-time the manager just told us to keep the ball and to play our game. We scored beautiful goals, especially Olivier. Now we go to the final.” There’s a lot of talk about Southampton’s goal that never was, with Austin penalised for a foul on Caballero when the score was 1-0. Graham Poll on BT Sport thought it was a clear foul in accordance with the laws of the game. But what do the laws know? In other news, you will not believe the score at the Etihad. Peep peep! Chelsea are through to yet another FA Cup final on 19 May, where they will meet Jose Mourinho and Manchester United. That’ll have a dignified build up. They were the better team at Wembley, with Eden Hazard at his mesmeric best, but Southampton also had chances in a very entertaining second half. Olivier Giroud scored an extraordinary solo goal 28 seconds after half-time, with the substitute Alvaro Morata sealing it late on. Do stay with us for some post-match reaction. 90+1 min There will be five minutes of added sweat and toil. 89 min This is over. Southampton know it. Chelsea know it. Even educated fleas know it. 87 min The tireless Austin swings a snapshot over the bar. 86 min McCarthy makes an excellent save from Morata, who could have had a hat-trick in the six minutes he’s been on the field. 84 min It’s all happening! Austin hits the post at one end, and then Morata’s shot is cleared off the line by Hoedt! 83 min So much for striker stereotypes: Giroud scored a Morata goal and Morata has now scored a Giroud goal. Chelsea will play Manchester United in the FA Cup final. The substitute Morata makes an instant impact, heading into the net from Azpilicueta’s cross. They have been such a deadly combination this season. 80 min A loose ball breaks to Auston just inside the area, but his volley is too close to Caballero. Chelsea make their last change, with Alvaro Morata replacing the goalscorer Olivier Romarioud. 79 min “I like Giroud, but I’ve never quite been able to figure him out,” says Matt Dony. “He’s always been very willing to go for the spectacular, but it often goes awry. When it comes off, though, he can look magnificent. Is he a fantastic player, who sadly doesn’t consistently hit the heights? Or does he just attempt enough ‘Wow’ moments that some are bound to work out, law of averages and all that. He definitely does rock the classic film-star good looks, though.” 78 min Another Southampton change: Manolo Gabbiadini replaces Bednarek. Southampton are going for it. 77 min More great play from Hazard, who makes space on the right before driving a low cross into the area. Cedric’s attempted clearance hits Yoshida and loops just over the bar. 76 min Another Chelsea change: Fabregas off, Pedro on. 75 min Graham Poll, on BT Sport, says it was a clear foul by Austin on Caballero. So there you go. 74 min McCarthy leaps to make a cracking save from Hazard’s fierce rising shot. I can’t keep up with this. 73 min Caballero almost drops the ball into his own net, though a foul had been given against Austin so it wouldn’t have counted. I’m not sure it was a foul - and it might have been over the line as well. Oh VAR where art thou? 72 min How did Caballero save that?! Redmond belted a low right-footed shot from 25 yards that seemed to have squirmed under the keeper, but it ended up going for a corner. I have no idea what happened there. It was like an optical illusion. 72 min Hazard has been comically good today. 71 min Hazard does a Rabona cross. Yoshida heads it away. 70 min This is Southampton’s best spell of the match. It might just be that necessity is the mother of invention; or it might be that Tadic is on the pitch. 68 min Southampton appeal for handball and a penalty when Austin’s flashing header hits Giroud. All they get is a corner. It did hit Giroud’s arm, which was away from his body, and I’m surprised VAR wasn’t used there. The case for Giroud is that he was only a couple of yards away from Austin, but his arm was in an unnatural position and it was worth another look. 66 min Tadic plays a good pass out to Bertrand, who gets to the byline but overhits his cross. That was a better move from Southampton. 65 min Hoedt is booked for a lunge at Hazard. 64 min Chelsea make a change to beef up their midfield. A disappointed Willian is replaced by Bakayoko, and walks straight down the tunnel in a huff. 63 min Southampton make a double change: Dusan Tadic and Nathan Redmond replace Shane Long and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. 62 min Long goes over in the box after a slight shove from Cahill. I don’t think it was a penalty but it was a bit risky from Cahill. 59 min Giroud looks okay to continue, and has a chance to play Willian through on goal. His pass is blocked. 58 min That goal from Giroud is so good. I’ve never seen a goal quite like it, though there was a touch of Romario in the way he sat everyone down. 57 min Romeu, already booked, crunches Giroud, who goes down in a lot of pain. It was a fair tackle but he caught Giroud’s ankle in his follow through. Giroud is really struggling. 55 min Lemina is booked for a foul on - you got it, stud - Hazard. 54 min Long misses a great chance to equalise! Austin’s lovely dummy allowed him to run through on goal, but his touch around Caballero was comically heavy and went straight out for a goalkick. 50 min Romeu is booked for a foul on Hazard. 48 min Southampton appeal for a penalty when Long goes down after a good tackle from Fabregas. No need for VAR. Chelsea break superbly and Hazard whips a lovely curling shot just wide of the far post. It was a fantastic goal. Giroud was found in the area by Hazard and showed brilliant skill to slalom through as defenders slid all around him. He just walked past the lot of them, and the keeper McCarthy, before poking the ball into the net as he fell over. By that stage an army of Southampton defenders were also on the floor, stripped or their dignity and their clean sheet. “It’s like the Grand National,” says Glenn Hoddle on BT Sport, who calls the goal “a chicane”. That was a ridiculous demonstration of skill and composure in a space the size of a phonebox. Honestly, that was the best goal Romario never scored. Giroud scores after 28 seconds of the second half! 46 min “Daft team that Hughes put out,” says Steve Hoare. “Relies too much on the wing backs for creation. We have JWP, Davis, Boufal, Redmond, Tadic... surely one of them has to play?” I suppose he is trying to stay in the game for as long as possible and let human nature take over in the final quarter. But I would have at least one of them in the team. There’s so much talent in that squad; I can’t believe they are going down. 46 min Peep peep. Chelsea begin the second half. Half-time chit-chat “It doesn’t seem that VAR so far is being used for outrageously blatantly bad decisions; there doesn’t seem to be the concept or equivalent of the ‘Umpire’s Call’ in cricket,” says Adam Roberts. “The ‘wobbly line’ offside decision (Mata’s goal) is particularly good example. Even after several viewings, ‘experts’ still disagreed. A perfect time for an umpire’s call ruling.” It’s almost like it hasn’t been thought through properly. The commentator Arlo White suggested thickening the offside line to create that element of ‘umpire’s call’. I like that idea. Half-time business Chelsea have been much the better team, without creating many clear chances. See you in 10 minutes for the second half of this football festival. 44 min The match is sleepwalking towards half-time. It’s been a half to remember, but only if you are into mental self-harm. 43 min “I almost miss the violent stylings of West Brom’s Hegazi amid all ths dazzling Chelsea running about with the ball stuff,” says Ian Copestake. “His delivery of a punch so weak that it could have been passed off as a sign of affection shows how out of touch the modern footballer has become from the days of hard Ron ‘hard’ Harris, etc.” 41 min Yoshida is booked for a foul on Giroud. 39 min A chance for Giroud. He made a complete mess of an attempted flying volley from Fabregas’s cross, but the ball bounced straight up in the air and he was able to launch into another acrobatic volley. This time he connected well and it flew just wide. 38 min With the square root of bugger all happening on the pitch, this is probably an opportune time to remind you that, if necessary, the match will go to extra-time and penalties. 34 min Southampton have the look of a team who are waiting to be put out of their misery. They need to change something because this system isn’t working. I’d be tempted to get Tadic on at half-time. 33 min Willian’s corner from the left is flicked on at the near post by Azpilicueta and flashes right across the face of goal. 32 min “Teams’ substitutes’ benches seem to have taken on the look of a dock in a court, filled with those suspected of various misdemeanours and publicly awaiting their fate,” says Ian Copestake. “I’d be unsurprised if Jimmy McNulty was seen hovering in the background of the Chelsea bench.” The Wire is a bit of an old reference point, grandad. I’ve moved on to Homicide: Life on the Street. 31 min A fierce long-range shot from Willian smacks Cedric in the face, after which he visits the canvas. He seems fine. 30 min Chelsea work the ball across the field to Azpilicueta, whose long-range shot deflects behind for a corner. 29 min “Is VAR being used in this game?” says Edouard. “I hope so, because I want to talk about VAR today. For some time now I’ve been frustrated that no one has considered a “challenge” system for video replay akin to tennis. I would adapt it like this: each team has one “challenge” per game (or even per tournament). If a challenge is issued, we go to video replay. If the challenge is correct, decision overturned, and the team keep their right to challenge. If it turns out they were wrong to challenge, they lose their right to challenge from then on. The idea being, of course, to incentivise teams to only complain about clear-cut mistakes and keeping video replay to a minimum. Who would have the final say on when to issue a challenge is the tricky part (team captain ? Manager? etc.) Yes, it is being used today. The system you suggest works well in cricket but that and tennis are more stop-start than football. I’m not sure it would work in football. Basically, the whole needs more thought before it is used in top-level football, because somebody is going to chin a referee at the World Cup. 27 min “MBMs two days running?” says Adam Roberts. “Have you upset someone?” Only myself. 26 min Hazard plays a one-two with Fabregas, scoots past Bednarek and slams a cutback towards Giroud at the near post. He can’t react quickly enough, under pressure from a defender, and shins it wide. It wasn’t much of a chance but it was lovely play from Hazard. 25 min Southampton have their first shot, a long-range effort from Lemina that is comfortably saved by Caballero. 24 min There’s a lack of creativity in the Southampton team, with Tadic on the bench, and their passing so far has had little purpose. 22 min A very quiet period in the game. 19 min Southampton have done well to survive that early battering and will hope to start feeling their way into the game. Hazard and Willian, buzzing behind Giroud, do look very dangerous though. 17 min Southampton enjoy a couple of minutes’ grace in the Chelsea half. 14 min Willian clips the free-kick onto the roof of the net. McCarthy had it covered. 13 min Kante is fouled just outside the area by Bednarek. Southampton are under relenteless pressure and this free-kick is in a perfect position for Willian... 12 min Fabregas’s low cross finds Hazard, who takes the ball in his stride and is about to score from close range when Yoshida slides in to make a fantastic tackle. 11 min Southampton are struggling to get out of their half. The pace of the game is relatively slow, perhaps because of the heat, though it speeds up whenever Hazard gets the ball. 9 min “No BT Sport in my TV package, so I’m relying on you to provide news of a comprehensive victory,” says Matt Loten. “It’s very important to me, as a Portsmouth fan, that Southampton don’t one-up our glorious run to the 2010 FA Cup final whilst also getting relegated from the Premier League. Besides, cup finals are so often a let-down, so surely at the very least we need the guaranteed entertainment of an irate Mourinho trying to pull out Conte’s hair plugs on the sidelines after a Giroud header secures Chelsea a scruffy 1-0 win in extra time?” 8 min Chelsea look really sharp, Hazard in particular. 7 min Willian hits the woodwork for the 487th time this season. Hazard surged at the heart of the defence and pushed a good ball to Willian on the right of the box. He moved the ball onto his left foot and whipped a shot that beat McCarthy before clanging off the top of the bar. 5 min Hazard spins neatly away from Lemina 25 yards from goal and hits a scorching rising drive with his left foot that whistles past the angle of post and bar. Great effort. 4 min “Hi Rob,” says Steve. “With all the talk about how the Champions League is a holy grail, don’t you think that offering a Champions League spot to the FA Cup winner, instead of fourth place, would restore interest in the competition. Somehow to me it seems more appropriate for someone who actually won something to get into the champions league instead of a fourth-place team...” I’d bring back the Cup Winners’ Cup, so I’m probably not the best person to ask. But yeah, why not? Sod it. 3 min Hojbjerg plays a one-two with Long and is tracked excellently by Kante. 2 min “I understand why Giroud has started but he clearly does his best work as a Plan B as opposed to being a Plan A,” says Shivam. “Also not a fan of “cup goalkeepers” starting in semi-finals. You play your best team - no loyalties.“ I agree with both points, particularly the first. Football is in the dark ages when it comes to using substitutes. 1 min Southampton kick off from left to right. They are in red-and-white Rank Xerox; Chelsea are in blue. The players are in the tunnel, ready for action. It’s soccer o’clock! Mark Hughes speaks! This competition wasreally good for me as a player, so I suppose I tap into those memories when I speak to the guys. It’s a chance for them to make their mark – they’ve got to embrace it. If we can play like we did last week and cut out a few mistakes, we think we can go very, very close.” Antonio Conte speaks! “We must be focussed on this game. We did very well to come back against Southampton last weekend, but this competition is unpredictable and we must pay attention today.” It’s a busy day in the Premier League. Stoke lead Burnley 1-0, while Jacob Steinberg is enjoying a thriller between Arsenal and West Ham. Team news There are no real surprises in the Chelsea team, with Olivier Giroud picked ahead of the woebegone Alvaro Morata. Southampton have switched from 3-4-2-1 to 3-5-2, with Charlie Austin up front alongside Shane Long. Pre-match reading Chelsea (3-4-2-1) Caballero; Azpilicueta, Cahill, Rudiger; Moses, Kante, Fabregas, Emerson; Willian, Hazard; Giroud. Substitutes: Eduardo, Christensen, Zappacosta, Bakayoko, Barkley, Pedro, Morata. Southampton (3-5-2) McCarthy; Hoedt, Yoshida, Bednarek; Cédric, Romeu, Lemina, Højbjerg, Bertrand; Austin, Long. Substitutes: Forster, McQueen, Tadić, Redmond, Ward-Prowse, Gabbiadini, Carrillo. Referee Martin Atkinson. Hello. Chelsea have been stuck in their own version of Groundhog Day – win title, lose plot, sack manager, repeat – but Antonio Conte could provide a variation on that theme by winning the FA Cup on his way out. We know Conte is going to leave this summer. But winning a trophy would put a pleasant, alternative spin on second-season syndrome – especially as it would involve beating his nemesis Jose Mourinho at Wembley. First, Chelsea have to take care of a Southampton team who are in contention for the Wigan Athletic double – FA Cup glory and relegation. They would also love to play United in the final, not least as it would set the DeLorean to 1 May 1976. Chelsea are clear favourites today. They came from 2-0 to maim Southampton’s survival hopes eight days ago, and looked sparky in winning at Burnley on Thursday night. Southampton are a decent side, and it makes no sense that they are going down, but a win today would be a big shock. Kick off is at 3pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/apr/23/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T14:00:03Z","webTitle":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/apr/23/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/apr/23/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","bodyText":"Welcome to this week’s blog. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Elizabeth Hay’s Late Nights on Air has transported PatLux: I have just returned from a vicarious visit to Canada via Elizabeth Hay’s gentle and exquisitely beautiful Late Nights on Air. There are so many layers and themes to the novel and I particularly enjoyed the poetic prose in the section towards the end where four colleagues journey together through the frozen July wilderness. And safereturndoubtful has been digging into Japanese literature with The Sailor Who Fell from Grace With the Sea by Yukio Mishima: It is noir, based in Yokohama, and about an adolescent boy’s relationship with his mother as she embarks on a new relationship with a sailor. The boy’s group of friends behave in an unpredictable and troubled manner. It is a relatively short and haunting tale of masculinity that (published in 1956) relates to US occupation, Japan’s loss of status and the anger of youth. It can hardly be described as a beautiful book, as there are several disturbing scenes, but the setting and language make the images it conjures quite memorable. Elsewhere, a reminder that splendid as Tips, Links and Suggestions may be, other sources of book recommendations are available. Robert Rudolph explains: I first heard of Richard Preston’s The Hot Zone from a sales clerk at a department store on the 18th. I left the store shortly after 9:00 PM, went to the nearby book store, and was some 52 pages into the book by closing time. It’s a remarkable medical detective story, dealing with an outbreak of an unidentified form of Ebola. The book came out in 1994, and I kept asking myself why I’d never heard of a story this good until now... and I’ve already reread parts of it. But then again, it’s hard to beat contributors like paulburns, and his epic ongoing series of posts on John le Carré. Last week it was A Delicate Truth: A rendition on Gibraltar involving British armed forces, an FO observer and a private American organisation funded by Republican Christian Fundamentalists goes horribly wrong. The novel is about the cover up and the effect on some of the survivors (and includes a charming depiction of rural life in Cornwall.) A few years later two of those survivors and an FO bureaucrat decide to blow the whistle. From then on it’s a race between those wanting to maintain the cover up and those wishing to go public. As usual with le Carré, the suspense is masterful, the bureaucrats self-protecting, private industry and the Americans awful. Elsewhere, SydneyH has set aside Zola’s Germinal: It isn’t as bad as my first impression of it, but the prose in my copy isn’t very good. It seems likely that it’s partly a translation issue. The first rank cliché in my Oxford copy is “still as a statue” on page two, and the simile is repeated, with slight variations, twice in part 1, which is where I’ve finished. The Penguin softens it a little bit, saying instead “stood waiting with the immobility of stone”. When Bonnemort uses the phrase “kick the bucket” in the Oxford to describe a near-death experience, Penguin chooses “pop my clogs”. The translator’s note in my copy said that they wanted to reconcile the text with twentieth-century English language, which could mean that they have deliberately used the more common expressions. I also cringed early on with the comparisons of the mine to a monster, and some of the melodramatic descriptions: “the wind wailed past them like a cry of hunger and fatigue torn from the bowels of the night”. It’s a shame, because Nana was wonderful. I’ll take it as a lesson to be wary about impulse-buying translated novels on sale. Let’s end on a brighter note. MildGloster loves A Visit from the Goon Squad by Jennifer Egan: Which is completely addictive, which I can’t stop reading. 220 pages in two hours. Interspersed, interrelated stories from chapter to chapter; connected characters, though years between the action. It’s almost irrelevant – maybe impossible – to give a synopsis, because it doesn’t matter: I suppose it’s about modern America but that makes it sound boring, which it isn’t. People and their relation to one another is more it, a shifting kaleidoscope of correspondence. What I’m trying to say is: it’s really, really good. Lovely. Interesting links about books and reading BBC Radio 4’s In Our Time takes on Middlemarch. Writers discuss writing under the influence. Donald Trump is good for something, after all: books sales. What is James Comey reading? (Oddly, he doesn’t mention Fire And Fury ...) A gallery of Edward Gorey cover designs for classic books.

The former cabinet minister Sayeeda Warsi made it clear it was the policy itself that was at fault, rather than the way officials had implemented it, while senior Labour figures called on Rudd to resign. Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, said it was hard to imagine a worse outcome from the policy brought in through a series of new laws from 2010 to create a hostile environment towards illegal immigrants. “How much worse can it get? People have died, they have lost their jobs, and people working in the National Health Service all their lives are suddenly not even entitled to go to the National Health Service,” she said. “It couldn’t be worse and yet the home secretary thinks ‘I can apologise and it will be alright’. Well, it won’t be.” The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, backed Thornberry’s position. “If we are going to restore any sense of integrity to politics, they have to resign,” he said. “The home secretary now should accept her responsibilities, just as Theresa May said when we were in power.”The prime minister has apologised and pledged to pay compensation in an attempt to end the row over the injustices meted out to children of Windrush-era migrants who had been unable to produce the documents demanded by the Home Office to establish their right to remain. She and Rudd have, however, repeatedly blamed officials for the way the implementation of a policy they insist was the right one. James Brokenshire, an immigration minister between 2014 and 2016, told ITV’s Peston on Sunday the situation was heartbreaking, but that as a minister he had consulted widely and made changes to the way the policy was to work. “We put together a panel of experts, bringing together people from the equalities sector, homeless charities, local authorities to help support work around this and actually made changes to the way some of the things were done,” he said. Warsi, a former Conservative party chair and cabinet minister, said on the same programme that it was a failed policy caused by the party’s obsession with bringing down net migration. “I think we were all responsible. I would hold myself responsible as part of the government,” she said. “What happened unfortunately during those years and has continued is that we had an unhealthy obsession with numbers. We were wedded to unrealistic targets, targets that we still haven’t met unfortunately a decade on – and yet we continue to remain wedded to targets. “And what we ended up with was, I think, the unintended consequences of the policy we are now implementing.” Warsi’s remarks, which reinforce criticisms made before the weekend by the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who chaired the cabinet subcommittee on immigration from 2010 to 2015, undermine Rudd’s insistence in her statement to the Commons last week on blaming officials for thinking about policy rather than people. Conservatives are likely to draw attention to Labour’s own commitment in government to creating a hostile environment, a phrase first used by Alan Johnson when he was home secretary in the last year of the Gordon Brown government, but campaigners insist that cracking down on illegal immigration could be done with better border checks rather than internal policing of status alone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/23/melbourne-city-eye-shedding-a-league-albatross-as-pieces-come-together","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T18:00:29Z","webTitle":"Melbourne City eye shedding A-League albatross as pieces come together","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/23/melbourne-city-eye-shedding-a-league-albatross-as-pieces-come-together","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/23/melbourne-city-eye-shedding-a-league-albatross-as-pieces-come-together","fields":{"headline":"Melbourne City eye shedding A-League albatross as pieces come together","bodyText":"Melbourne City began the A-League season beating Brisbane Roar 2-0 at AAMI Park and in an act of neat symmetry they repeated the scoreline to open the finals. But between two seemingly identical scenarios lies considerable progress. That first incarnation of Warren Joyce’s vision performed with a stultifying aversion to risk. Six months later a much-changed and now settled core group of players appear emboldened and assertive. City are now 90 minutes from a maiden grand final, and barring a miracle elsewhere they are poised to debut in the Asian Champions League. Just four of the XI that ran out on 6 October 2017 started on 20 April 2018 following a season in which 26 players have been auditioned. Joyce has brought in his own men in the form of proven A-League performers Oliver Bozanic and Dario Vidosic, and both have had a laxative effect on City’s ball movement. Dean Bouzanis’ distribution fits the City Football Group playing model Joyce is charged with delivering, and the talismanic Bruno Fornaroli has returned to fitness. The key pieces of the puzzle have been teenagers Daniel Arzani and Nathaniel Atkinson. That pair advance City’s dual objectives of winning football matches and exposing talent with the potential to benefit the CFG mothership. Arzani in particular is the embodiment of why CFG invested in Australian football. In the short term his hip-hop strut and Ronaldinho mimicry will benefit Melbourne. In the medium term he is destined to be hothoused elsewhere in the empire. In the long term CFG hopes he progresses into Manchester City’s calculations, but failing that they would not be disappointed with another Aaron Mooy-sized dent in their Financial Fair Play obligations. Brian Marwood, CFG’s global football boss, made clear to Guardian Australia that in Melbourne results and young player development represent “twin pillars” of ambition. Negotiating this balancing act enhances Joyce’s achievements and in so doing sets the template for seasons to come, a consistent supply of academy graduates complementing seasoned pros in the CFG mould topped off by a dash or two of something more exotic. It is an approach that has its critics. The FFA chairman has flagged foreign ownership of A-League clubs as a risk that needs mitigating by his continued presence at the head of the game, while further down the pyramid there’s discontent at the disruption to the talent-development pecking order. With CFG leading the charge behind the scenes for an independent A-League and greater club representation on the game’s congress (City vice-chairman Simon Pearce is on the Congress Review Working Group), they have work to do if they want to convince sceptics that what’s good for City is good for the Australian game as a whole. As with Mooy before him, Arzani is fast personifying CFG’s argument that by raising standards they are maximising the potential for young Australians to develop; in turn improving the A-League and W-League, and enhancing the national sides. Those standards are set at City’s $20m academy in northern Melbourne, a class-leading environment where coaches like Joyce want for nothing as they set about polishing rough diamonds like Arzani. Joyce and Arzani make an odd couple; the Oldhamer drill sergeant and the gum-chewing millennial. But it is a relationship that is working, reinforcing the decision to employ Joyce, with his track record in youth development, ahead of more glamorous managerial contenders. “It’s good because he [Joyce] grounds me,” Arzani told Guardian Australia. “He lets me know the things I need to work on, he doesn’t just give me the fluff, the good stuff. He’s very straight out with everything which I appreciate a lot because that’s how my dad was growing up. “Positive reinforcement you can get from anyone. I could go on social media and read good stuff about myself all day. If I call my dad he’s going to tell me the reality of how I played, or if I go to a room with Warren he’ll tell me if I wasn’t at the back post in the 67th minute when I should have been there. That’s the reality of the game. You can’t be happy with yourself, you’ve got to keep improving.” There remains obvious room for improvement elsewhere at City. Marquee signings continue to underwhelm, be it Marcin Budzinski this season, Nicolas Colazo last, or Robert Koren before him. Tim Cahill was a worthwhile experiment but for all he did for the A-League’s mainstream exposure he did not improve his team’s best XI and his presence on the bench added a weekly albatross to AAMI Park’s flock of seagulls. Perhaps as a consequence of this lack of pizzazz crowds are stubbornly below expectation, another glaring issue requiring attention. But they are problems for next season, one that should begin with grounds for more optimism than at any point in franchise history with Melbourne more in step with the CFG mission than ever before."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/22/virgil-van-dijk-liverpool-roma-champions-league-west-brom","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T21:30:33Z","webTitle":"Virgil van Dijk confident Liverpool will be back to their best against Roma","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/22/virgil-van-dijk-liverpool-roma-champions-league-west-brom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/22/virgil-van-dijk-liverpool-roma-champions-league-west-brom","fields":{"headline":"Virgil van Dijk confident Liverpool will be back to their best against Roma","bodyText":"Virgil van Dijk has admitted Liverpool let their standards slip against West Bromwich Albion but is adamant Roma will prove a welcome and contrasting proposition at Anfield on Tuesday evening. His manager, Jürgen Klopp, described Saturday’s 2-2 draw as “useless” for both teams but Van Dijk has urged calm and his team-mates to seize the opportunity in front of them in the Champions League, with passage to the final in Kiev on 26 May at stake. Liverpool squandered a two-goal lead at the Hawthorns after struggling to cope with set pieces late on but Van Dijk is confident they will rise to the occasion in the semi-final first leg. “We need to do better,” he said. “You have to tell each other the truth you cannot be nice and happy when we want to achieve so much as a team and a club. A draw is not good enough but there is no reason to panic. There is no need to stress.” Asked if Liverpool’s standards dropped after goals from Danny Ings and Mohamed Salah, who scored his 31st Premier League goal of the season, had put them in control. Van Dijk said: “I think so. [But] I don’t worry at all. They [West Brom] are fighting for their lives so in the end they are very direct, balls into the channel, work hard, trying to get fouls and free-kicks and we didn’t cope with that how we should have. To concede two goals from set pieces as well where we have always the same roles to do and we didn’t do that. So it is disappointing but I am not worried at all.” Klopp used the trip to West Brom to make five changes, with Roberto Firmino among those starting on the bench, while Daniele De Rossi and the Roma top-scorer Edin Dzeko will arrive on Merseyside refreshed after being rested for their comfortable 3-0 win over Spal on Saturday. After witnessing Roma’s extraordinary comeback against Barcelona to advance from the quarter-finals on away goals, Liverpool, who will hold their pre-match team meeting on Monday, will not be taking anything for granted against the Serie A side. “It will be hard work and we need to be ready for anything and then obviously the tough game in Rome,” Van Dijk said. “That will be a hard one as well, but we need to enjoy that because not many players, teams come to this stage and have the chance of getting to a final. We will prepare as well as we can and see what happens. “I have not played against Dzeko before but everyone knows the result against Barcelona. They are a very good team and we have to be ready. I don’t fear anyone. We play a different style to Roma. It will be a different game to this one. The system we played at the end today won’t be the same.” Klopp cut an agitated figure at full time on Saturday, gesticulating with Joe Gomez and Ragnar Klavan, both of whom are unlikely to feature against Roma, with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dejan Lovren expected to be restored in defence. Andrew Robertson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are also expected to return. While Klopp acknowledged a point at West Brom was not the worst outcome, he hopes his players can use any frustration as a catalyst to help them build a first-leg lead. “I don’t have to tell them that was not good enough, we can do better,” Klopp said. “It is Roma and it will be a completely different game. I like the attitude of the boys. I am sure the boys will be ready.” Asked how Roma would differ from West Brom, Klopp replied: “They have set pieces as well but they don’t play only set pieces. Their boys play sometimes on the ground and then you can play football.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/22/kelly-odwyer-forced-to-admit-banks-royal-commission-was-needed","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T04:27:14Z","webTitle":"Kelly O'Dwyer forced to admit banks royal commission was needed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/22/kelly-odwyer-forced-to-admit-banks-royal-commission-was-needed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/22/kelly-odwyer-forced-to-admit-banks-royal-commission-was-needed","fields":{"headline":"Kelly O'Dwyer forced to admit banks royal commission was needed","bodyText":"Kelly O’Dwyer has been forced to admit consumers will benefit from the banking royal commission, while repeatedly refusing to concede the government was wrong to delay it. Asked almost 10 times whether the government should have ordered a royal commission into the banking industry earlier, the minister for revenue and financial services refused to answer, repeatedly deflecting the question. In an awkward and tense exchange with the host of the ABC’s Insiders, Barrie Cassidy, O’Dwyer claimed the government had “been alive” to the issues within the banking industry for sometime, but had needed to act in a “sober and deliberate” manner. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon That was despite the government having ordered royal commissions into Labor’s pink batts scheme and trade unions very quickly upon taking power. “If you want to go over the political entrails, Barrie, let me say this … the first person who called for a royal commission [into the banks] was actually Mark Butler in the Labor party when Labor was in government. “The big scandals that happened, Great Southern, Storm Financial, happened when Bill Shorten was the financial services minister and had direct responsibility,” she said. “He was almost three years into the job. Labor did virtually nothing. We acted on coming into government. We put in place a financial system inquiry. We have been instituting the vast bulk of all of those recommendations. “You know it is a bit rich for people to claim that we should have acted earlier, when, in fact, they had the opportunity, and when we, as a government, have been very sober in the way we’ve gone about it. “And we are actually getting results for consumers. We care about consumers.” But O’Dwyer said the government had no plans to exclude the banks from its planned $65bn company tax cut, despite the revelations from the inquiry. Crossbencher Derryn Hinch refuses to support the legislation without a bank exemption. “You are trying to conflate two issues, that I think should not be conflated,” O’Dwyer said. “It is good for our economy to actually, I mean, it’s more than just the banks who are actually part of the economy here, as well.” Labor’s shadow finance minister, Jim Chalmers, said the government was reading the room incorrectly. “They’ve learnt nothing from all the scandals we’ve heard and still can’t bring themselves to say: ‘We were wrong to run a protection racket for that royal commission for so long,’” he told the ABC. “They will want to hand a billion-dollar tax cut to the four big banks which are at the centre of the rorts and rip-offs in the system.” The Turnbull government was forced to order a royal commission into the banks late in 2017, after a group of National MPs publicly confirmed they would cross the floor to support colleague Barry O’Sullivan’s private’s members bill. With the Greens and Labor having already given support to a royal commission, Malcolm Turnbull announced the inquiry as a “regrettable but necessary action”. The Hayne inquiry has since uncovered systematic failures within Australia’s financial services industry, including admissions from AMP that it had regularly lied to the corporate regulator about why it charged customers’ fees for no service, and the Commonwealth Bank’s admission it charged fees to dead clients. Scott Morrison, who had also argued against holding a royal commission into the banks, claiming it would damage the banking industry’s reputation internationally, confirmed tougher penalties for misconduct were on the way. However late last week, he too refused to concede the government had got it wrong by resisting pressure to establish a royal commission for almost two years, declaring calls for an apology to be “political point-scoring” by Labor. Both Barnaby Joyce and Tony Abbott had publicly admitted they were wrong to oppose a royal commission for so long, as have the heads of the Big Four banks, who have apologised for past actions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/22/the-guardian-view-on-friendly-bacteria-an-ally-against-plastic","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T17:20:48Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on friendly bacteria: an ally against plastic | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/22/the-guardian-view-on-friendly-bacteria-an-ally-against-plastic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/22/the-guardian-view-on-friendly-bacteria-an-ally-against-plastic","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on friendly bacteria: an ally against plastic","bodyText":"Evolution never sleeps. Before 1970 there can have been no significant bacteria that ate plastic, because there was not enough of that plastic in the world to sustain a population. But in 2016 a group of Japanese scientists discovered a new species, Ideonella sakaiensis, in the samples they were sifting from a bottle-recycling plant, that was able to attack and eat PET, the plastic used in most bottles, almost all of which ends up in landfill or dumped at sea, where it may last for centuries. Everything that rots in nature does so because it is being eaten by bacteria. Most plastics – among them PET – were considered totally impervious to bacterial attack, making them almost indestructible unless burned or crushed. So a bacterium that can consume even one kind of plastic could become a desperately needed ally in the struggle to stop the oceans being choked with plastic waste. What has captured the imagination of the world is that a subsequent group of scientists, who were trying to understand on a molecular level how I sakaiensis breaks down and digests plastic bottles, found the enzymes that it uses and made a slightly different version of one to see what would happen. The new enzyme is much more efficient than the version found in nature, and works on more kinds of plastic. This kind of molecular tweaking of substances, already found in nature, is at the root of another recent scientific breakthrough, the Crispr-Cas9 technique for genetic engineering. It offers some hope that we can use technology to moderate and even to some extent to reverse the impacts that earlier technologies, such as those that make it easy to manufacture billions of tons of plastic, have had on the world around us. This is going to be essential. The mass production and use of plastics has had such an effect on the Earth that some scientists, speculating wildly that there will still be people around to care about such things in the unimaginably distant future, have proposed the detection of plastic deposits as the best signal of the Anthropocene, the era in which human activity becomes the most powerful factor affecting life on Earth. One of the things this story shows is that our environment is not static and never has been. It is a dynamic system, in which changes of every sort have unintended consequences – PET was widely adopted partly because it seemed to have no ill effects on human health, at a time when no one asked how we would ever get rid of it – and every action produces an unexpected reaction, so that some bacteria learn to be resistant to antibiotics while others learn to feed off plastics. Even plastics have their uses to clean up pollution: they are used as sponges to clean up oil spills, although Australian scientists have just discovered a blend of sulphur and cooking oil that promises to work even better. There is no simpler world to which we can retreat – and for the sake of our children, we will simply have to manage these things better than our parents’ generations did."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/23/ugly-bump-incidents-the-latest-reminder-for-fans-to-cool-our-bloodlust","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T18:00:28Z","webTitle":"Ugly bump incidents the latest reminder for fans to cool our bloodlust","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/23/ugly-bump-incidents-the-latest-reminder-for-fans-to-cool-our-bloodlust","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/23/ugly-bump-incidents-the-latest-reminder-for-fans-to-cool-our-bloodlust","fields":{"headline":"Ugly bump incidents the latest reminder for fans to cool our bloodlust","bodyText":"The poet Robert Frost once wrote that the afternoon knows what the morning never suspected. But there was nothing poetic about the bump that left North Melbourne’s Shaun Higgins lying unconscious in the middle of Etihad Stadium less than 12 hours after he and his wife welcomed the arrival of their first child, Rosie Joan, earlier that morning. As the new father was strapped into a stretcher, his neck in a brace as trainers dabbed the blood from his face, you were reminded that the job of an AFL footballer is not the same as most other work. The night before, Geelong’s Scott Selwood was concussed in an ugly collision with Port Adelaide’s Lindsay Thomas, who appeared to choose to drop his shoulder and bump Selwood, rather than get the ball. Geelong coach Chris Scott said that while the game had done a good job of stamping out such incidents, the bump that collected the Cats midfielder was serious, and that Selwood was “a sick boy”. “It was pretty clear right away that he wouldn’t be able to come back,” said Scott. Geelong premiership captain Cameron Ling was a little less diplomatic, referring to Thomas’s hit on Selwood as “a dog act”. Both incidents ensure that “the bump” will this week (again) become a talking point, and we will again be reminded of the place that the bump holds in a game where the past sometimes seems to exist merely to be reinvented as a romantic fable, and where fans identify with toughness and sacrifice. While the bump is a touchstone from another era, it is still considered an integral part of our indigenous game, albeit one that is not as brutal and sporadically violent as its glorified past. But what does it mean in an era when players are more organised as a profession? Earlier this week, Higgins announced that he would skip the match — take a day off work — if his wife went into labour. “My priority is the birth. If the baby comes on game day or the hours around game time, then I’ll miss but I’ll prepare to play and let mother nature run her course,” said the 187-game veteran. “It’s an easy decision, to be honest. It’s one game out of an entire career for something that’s once in a lifetime.” It’s an entirely reasonable thing to say, particularly in the context of the modern-day workplace. Unless of course you are Brian Taylor, who more and more feels obliged to give us something of himself. “Skype it. Just Skype it up and you won’t miss a trick and there’s no reason to miss the big day,” Taylor said during Triple M’s The Midweek Rub. It remains unclear whether BT was referring to the birth of a child or a round of football as “the big day”. Although, hopefully Higgins recorded the birth of his first child, as his memory of it may not be all that clear. While Taylor may sound more like an exhausted volcano than a voice of wisdom, his comments nevertheless reflect the expectations that many diehard fans place on those that they “pay good money” to watch play. Next month, a book titled Game Misconduct: Injury, Fandom, and the Business of Sport by Nathan Kalman-Lamb will be published. While advanced excerpts focus on ice hockey, it is hard not to draw parallels with Australian Rules. First, professional hockey is a particular kind of social institution that encourages players to play through injuries because the sport markets itself as a site of toughness. Indeed, this is how hockey distinguishes itself from many other sports, like soccer for example. Hockey is the sport where players put themselves through anything. Fans come to the games because they identify with this toughness and sacrifice. This is what makes a game seem real and meaningful and important. Thus, the labor and stoicism of the athletes does social reproductive work for the fans by validating and legitimizing their investment in the game, even if players do not directly do it for this reason, but rather because of an employment imperative. This week, more than any other, we will hear those words “toughness and sacrifice” referenced in reverential tones. As awful as the Selwood and Higgins incidents on the weekend were, and as much as the new competition committee (which replaces several AFL groups, including the laws of the game committee) and AFL Players Association will come under pressure to review it, the bump is so embedded in our game that will take years to change. Not only is it inherent to our investment in the game, it is also connected to generations of footballers placing pressure on each other, infusing the belief that toughness is an important badge of honour and integral in being a good teammate. And in that environment a footballer will almost always obey the rule that’s in front of them over the one written in a book somewhere. While Higgins made the decision to play aware of the risk, and as much as he didn’t see it coming – and after one hour’s sleep he literally didn’t see Hawthorn’s Ryan Burton coming – had he known that he would spend the afternoon in a different hospital to his wife and newborn, he would have taken the afternoon off. If this weekend achieves nothing else – because the bump is going nowhere for now, and there’s not much more the AFL can do than suspend players for it – maybe some of us will be a little less demanding in asking our players to take one for the team."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/22/manchester-city-v-swansea-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T17:45:30Z","webTitle":"Manchester City 5-0 Swansea: Premier League —  as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/22/manchester-city-v-swansea-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/22/manchester-city-v-swansea-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City 5-0 Swansea: Premier League —  as it happened","bodyText":"Here’s Jamie Jackson’s match report. Bye! Kevin de Bruyne: “I don’t score a lot of goals inside the box. I get more opportunities to shoot from far away. You try it. You know you have a clean strike, you feel it. It is the first time for me [to be a champion] and it feels nice. I was with my family, I was playing mini-golf with my son [when City were confirmed as champions].” Kevin de Bruyne: “It was a very nice feeling. We wanted to perform in this game. The fans enjoy it if you give the effort and play the way we did today.” Manchester City made 1015 passes today. They are the first Premier League to break the 1000-pass barrier. They also had 83% possession. Swansea’s final four games are: Chelsea (h), Bournemouth (a), Southampton (h), Stoke (h). They should be capable of doing the necessary. Here’s the updated Premier League table. The fans are still on the pitch. The trophy will be presented when Manchester City host Huddersfield in a fortnight. As for Swansea City, they were never in it. They’d have sent West Brom down with a victory and would also have more or less condemned Stoke and Southampton to relegation. They still have a bit to do, although they are four points above the bottom three and will be confident of getting the job done. There wasn’t much they could do today. The victory takes Manchester City up to 90 points, 16 points clear of Manchester United. They need two more wins to break Chelsea’s record points tally from 2004-05. They visit West Ham next week. So. There is a good-natured pitch invasion. Fans are celebrating with the players. Benjamin Mendy is loving it. That’s your lot! 90 min+1: Gundogan shoots over from just inside the area. 90 min: There will be two added minutes. Gabriel Jesus finally gets his goal. Yaya Toure lifts another peach of a ball into the area. Jesus peels away from Mawson, waits for the ball to drop and then loops a clever header beyond Fabianski. They are scarily good. 87 min: Toure lofts a ball over the top. Kompany’s timed his run to perfection but he ends up dinking the ball into the air and lobbing it over the bar. He can’t believe he’s missed. 84 min: “Elano might have been fun but I’m not sure he’d have had the right attitude for Pep,” says Jack Lee. “But, how good would Kinkladze have been?” Or Berkovic. 83 min: Foden dribbles down the left, all quick feet and impish movement, and sends a cross into the six-yard box. Jesus heads straight at Fabianski. It’s not been the Brazilian’s day. 82 min: Mendy tries an ambitious volley. Straight at Fabianski. 80 min: Danilo belts one over from 20 yards. 79 min: Toure sends a free-kick straight into the wall. Swansea break, Abrahams bustling down the right, but Clucas completely mishits his volley from the striker’s cross. 75 min: The hugely popular replaces Benjamin Mendy replaces Fabian Delph. It’s his first appearance since that awful knee injury. Tammy Abraham, meanwhile, has replaced Martin Olsson. 71 min: Phil Foden replaces Raheem Sterling. We just need to see Benjamin Mendy now. 69 min: Mawson almost scores an own-goal, directing a corner on to the left post. Swansea will be happy if they get away with 4-0. 67 min: Kyle Bartley replaces the injured Federico Fernandez. 65 min: Sam Clucas replaces Ki Sung-yeung. And Yaya Toure is on for the marvellous Kevin de Bruyne. Gabriel Jesus takes the penalty off Ilkay Gundogan. Brave move - and he’s feeling a little embarrassed when Fabianski tips his low shot on to the right post. The Swansea goalkeeper gets no luck, though. The ball spins across the goal and Bernardo Silva is there to gobble up the rebound. 62 min: Silva plays a pass to Sterling. His first touch is a bit heavy, but it lures Fernandez into a lunging tackle and he brings Sterling down. 58 min: De Bruyne charges into the area from the right and drives a low ball into the six-yard box. Jesus is waiting for a tap-in, but Van der Hoorn cuts it out. 56 min: How good would Elano be in this team? 55 min: That reminded me a bit of Elano’s free-kick against Newcastle in 2007. What a goal! De Bruyne takes a couple of touches, looks up and absolutely spanks a superb shot past Fabianski from 25 yards, the ball whizzing off his right foot and soaring into the top-right corner! What a phenomenal player! 51 min: De Bruyne cuts inside from the left and tries to catch Fabianski out at his near post, only to brush the side-netting with his clever shot. 48 min: De Bruyne dribbles inside and sees his shot blocked. The ball squirms through to Sterling, but he’s offside. 46 min: Swansea get the second half underway. BREAKING: MANCHESTER CITY ARE REALLY GOOD AT FOOTBALL. 45 min: Mawson bustles forward and bounces a low shot at Ederson from 25 yards. 44 min: This is a keep-ball exercise for City. It has all the intensity of a training match now. 42 min: This isn’t a contest. Swansea know they haven’t got a prayer. 40 min: Olsson’s booked for diving. 39 min: “Is Sterling a good goalscorer or is his woeful finishing just rendered unimportant by virtue of playing in a team that create 4000 chances a game?” says David Flynn. “Can’t help but feel he might not be as lethal in the World Cup with Henderson and Dier feeding him.” Do City create so many chances because of Sterling’s movement? 35 min: De Bruyne knocks a pass through to Jesus, who shoots straight at Fabianski from a tight angle. 32 min: De Bruyne lashes one goalwards from 25 yards, but Fabianski pushes his stinging left-footed effort out. Sterling is offside when the rebound reaches him. 30 min: Mawson clumsily pushes Sterling in the back. No penalty. The ball eventually reaches Bernardo, who curls straight at Fabianski. 29 min: A lull. 25 min: A stat comes up showing that City have completed 292 passes already. 24 min: Olsson’s free-kick from 25 yards hits the wall and loops into City’s area. The ball’s eventually volleyed out for a Swansea throw. 22 min: City’s football is gorgeous. Swansea can’t live with them. Sterling spins on the right and sprays a pass out to Delph, who cushions a cross-shot wide on the volley. 20 min: This is an exhibition. But remember what happened the last time City were 2-0 up at home! 18 min: That was Raheem Sterling’s 23rd goal of the season. But is he as good as Jordon Ibe? And repeat. Swansea are sliced open on the left again, Delph playing a stunning one-two with the stunning David Silva, before fizzing a low cross into the six-yard box. Sterling is there for an easy finish from close range. Enjoy your afternoon, Swansea. 15 min: Swansea have barely had a touch. City aren’t taking their foot off the gas. They are after that points record. Chelsea’s tally of 95 from the 2005-05 season is what they need to beat. 14 min: De Bruyne’s cross hits Mawson and goes behind for a corner. 13 min: Kevin de Bruyne, though! This is so good. This is why they’re champions. The ingenious De Bruyne stabs a wondrous, bending pass through to Sterling with the outside of his right boot. Sterling controls and turns a pass back to Silva, who takes the ball in his stride before drilling a low, angled shot past Fabianski! Pep is pleased. 10 min: Craig Pawson inadvertently cuts out a Gundogan pass. Swansea need the referee’s help. City are all over them. The champions continue to probe, Silva releasing Bernardo on the right. The youngster’s low cross is shuffled behind for a corner, which comes to nothing. 9 min: Possession watch: Manchester City 84%-16% Swansea City. 7 min: Olsson skips past Danilo on the left. Then he boots a hilariously dismal cross straight into the crowd. 4 min: City have started sharply. Bernardo slips a pass down the right, but De Bruyne’s cross is too close to Fabianski. 2 min: De Bruyne flicks a cross in from the right, looking for Jesus, but Fernandez heads it away. Peep! Manchester City, kicking from left to right, get the game underway. The atmosphere is triumphant and celebratory. Some Queen song’s being blared around the Etihad. The players are in the tunnel. Here they come! Swansea are out first, their players forming a guard of honour for the champions, who are greeted by tremendous noise once they make their entrance. “Welcome to the home of the Premier League champions” is one banner. On Sky, Raheem Sterling tells Thierry Henry that this has been the hardest week of training during his time at Manchester City. There’s been no let-up from Pep Guardiola. Manchester City make two changes to the side that beat Tottenham at Wembley. Danilo and Bernardo Silva come in for Kyle Walker and Leroy Sane. Swansea make one change from the side that drew with Everton. Mike van der Hoorn replaces the injured Luciano Narsingh. A Swansea win would relegate West Brom and take them seven points above the bottom three. Stoke, who are 19th, are in need of a miracle after drawing with Burnley earlier this afternoon. Man City: Ederson; Danilo, Kompany, Laporte, Delph; Gundogan; B Silva, De Bruyne, D Silva, Sterling; Jesus. Subs: Bravo, Walker, Sane, Mendy, Otamendi, Toure, Foden. Swansea: Fabianski; Van der Hoorn, Fernandez, Mawson; Naughton, King, Ki, Carroll, Olsson; Jordan Ayew, Andre Ayew. Subs: Abraham, Dyer, Nordfeldt, Routledge, Clucas, Bartley, Roberts. Referee: Craig Pawson. Hello. Let the celebrations begin! Unless Swansea City, still in need of points to ward off relegation, can defecate all over Manchester City’s title party.

It happens during a monologue about a group of white, male commuters on a bus, and it drops into the play like a perfectly aimed stone smashing a glass house. There is no better place than the office to dissect the worst of people’s behaviour, and Johnson does just that to unsettling comic effect, in a piece set in the consulting rooms of smug Chicago surgeon Williams (Bo Poraj). Williams wants to be rid of Jaclyn (Tanya Moodie), a black secretary who is returning to work after an absence, and he manipulates the eager-to-please Ileen (Elizabeth Berrington) into spying on her colleague. But Jaclyn has good reasons not to give up her job without a fight. There is much to enjoy and and much to squirm about in this comedy, which zips along and is just as manipulative as the characters are. Jacyln behaves in a manner that may have you wondering whether the racist Williams has good reason for dismissing her, and she has her own prejudices towards Muslims and her Mexican neighbours. The way white privilege operates is neatly skewered, as is IIeen’s failure to police her imagination. So it’s a pity that, in exposing the increasing paranoia and madness of racism, Johnson’s plotting becomes so contrived. Fortunately, both Moodie and Berrington bring psychological acuteness and sharp comic timing to their roles. The show doesn’t quite fulfil its initial promise, but at its best it’s as sharp as a shard of glass. •Rasheeda Speaking is at Trafalgar Studios, London, until 12 May.

Well done to Jacob for manning the blog for the game. Will the rest of Wenger’s reign be so positive? We will find out on Thursday. On the upside for West Ham, Stoke were held at home by Burnley, so will struggle to stay up now. Paul Doyle was at the Bet365. Moyes thought his team were good for a point until Rice ducked under Ramsey’s cross. Asked whether 4-1 was a fair result, Moyes said: “The last 10 minutes it might have been but before then we were good for a point. “The young should have headed it away, why he ducked I have no idea. “We’re distraught for the team, as I thought the team effort was incredible. “I am more disappointed in the last five minutes but maybe I had too many attacking players on.” Our man Daniel Daniel Taylor was at the Emirates. Read his report: Wenger has spoken to a slightly less croaky Shreeves. “I think we are at the moment top of the home league. We constructed patiently our win in the first half, it was tough to find space. “From the second half onwards we looked like we could score as we found more space. “At 1-1 you could see we were wobbling or not and the second goal killed them.” Regarding the Elneny injury, Wenger said: “It doesn’t look good on his ankle.” The Frenchman was also pretty diplomatic on his future and whether he jumped before he was pushed. “Look, I have nothing to add. I think it was in my statement what I wanted to say. Apart from that, I have nothing to say.” Lacazette showed that he can be clinical in front of goal, once again. His efforts will be a great boon for the Frenchman and anyone who arrives to manage him in the summer, knowing how much attacking prowess Arsenal have to offer. Poor Joe Hart. He made two absolutely stunning saves but his game will not be remembered for conceding late goals and Ramsey’s cross into the net. I would argue that was the fault of Declan Rice - no goalkeeper is expecting their defender to duck out of a header on the edge of the six-yard box. It was a very strange decision from the young centre-back, one he will not make again. Henry doing some more criticism of the Arsenal defence, pointing out no one bothered to see where Arnautovic was in the box. It was pretty poor from the back four. Maybe that will change next season... Aaron Ramsey has spoken to a very croaky Geoff Shreeves on the win. “We took a bit of time to get going; it was very hot out there, but I don’t want to make excuses.” On Wenger’s imminent departure: “Obviously, it’s really tough to take. He’s believed in us, backed us and given us all these opportunities. I owe him a lot and he deserves everything he gets. “We’re not thinking about who’s coming in next and it’s all about doing it for him and hopefully we can end up with a cup.” A final one for the list... Well...it was all quite easy in the end for Arsenal. Aubameyang make a very positive after coming on. Would have been a touch underwhelming if Wenger began his long good with a defeat. They were helped by the second goal coming from a Rice mistake but Arsenal were on top at that stage. That’s all from me. Will Unwin will take you through the post-match reaction. It’s Arsene Wenger’s day! And nobody can really have any complaints about that. Unless you’re David Moyes. 90 min+2: Lacazette, on a hat-trick, almost dribbles through. Instead he lays it back to Xhaka, who sidefoots a decent chance over. West Ham have badly run out of steam. They are six points above the bottom three with four matches left and aren’t quite safe yet. 90 min: There will be four added minutes. “There’s only one Arsene Wenger!” the Arsenal fans chant. Ramsey dribbles into the area from the left, beating Zabaleta with ease, and cuts it back to Lacazette. He eludes one challenge before slamming a low shot past Hart. Arsenal have turned on the style! 88 min: Calum Chambers replaces Danny Welbeck. 87 min: Arnautovic is booked for barging Aubameyang over. 86 min: Andy Carroll replaces Arthur Masuaku. Arsenal are enjoying themselves now. Welbeck plays a one-two with Xhaka and finds Aubameyang. He moves it on to Lacazette, whose shot from the right zips off Cresswell and flies past the unfortunate Hart. 84 min: That defending was so bad it’s enough to make you think Rice was paying tribute to latter-day Wengerball. This is a farce. Arsenal counter down the right, Aubameyang tearing down the right. His cross is headed away by Rice, but Ramsey picks the ball up on the left. He curls a cross into the six-yard box and this time Rice decides to duck under it and leave the ball to Hart. One problem: Hart isn’t telepathic and he was unable to stop the cross from drifting into the far corner! Oh dear. A total breakdown in communication, Rice showing his inexperience, and Arsenal have the lead again! 80 min: There’s more mayhem in the West Ham area, Hart unable to gather a loose ball, Ogbonna unable to hack clear, but Ramsey and Lacazette can’t bundle the ball in. West Ham survive. 79 min: Arsenal are enjoying a lot of possession at the moment. West Ham can’t get out. A clearance falls to Welbeck. He curls one towards the far corner from the left, but Hart flies to his left to brilliantly push it away! That looked a certain goal! What a goalkeeper! 78 min: The crowd’s a bit quiet. You can hear the shouts of encouragement from the West Ham bench. “Get out him to, Cheikh ... Get it out, Arthur ... Bring me, Marouane Fellaini.” 76 min: The camera lingers on Andy Carroll, allowing us to gaze at the Geordie hunk for a while. 74 min: Mustafi goes through the back of Hernandez. He’s booked. He isn’t very good, is he? 73 min: Koscielny attacks Xhaka’s corner, but Hart gathers the loose ball. 72 min: Xhaka lines one up from 25 yards, steps round Noble and forces Hart to tip his low effort wide of the left post. Excellent save. 71 min: The West Ham fans are singing about Carlton Cole, as you do. 70 min: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang replaces Alex Iwobi. 68 min: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will be on soon. You have to wonder if Wenger ever wanted him. 65 min: Ashley Barnes has made it Stoke 1-1 Burnley. Masuaku surges down the left and crosses towards Arnautovic. Ospina comes flying out to punch away, but West Ham keep pressing. Kouyate sees a shot blocked. The ball eventually comes to Lanzini, who manages to poke it to Arnautovic, free on the left. He takes a touch and then he rams a brilliant low shot past Ospina, the power too much for the Arsenal goalkeeper to handle! Oh Arsenal. 63 min: Zabaleta’s chipped cross forces Koscielny to glance away from Arnautovic. The ball comes to Masuaku, who wins a corner on the left. Lanzini’s corner is headed away but West Ham keep pressing, a spell of head tennis ending with Arnautovic volleying over. 62 min: Maitland-Niles is booked for a late tackle on Noble. 61 min: A free-kick to West Ham on the right. Lanzini whips it in and almost combines with another substitute, only for Hernandez to head over. That was a good chance for a player of Hernandez’s finishing ability and he knows it. 60 min: Manuel Lanzi replaces the ineffective Edimilson Fernandes and Javier Hernandez replaces the disappointing Joao Mario. 58 min: West Ham are about to introduce Manuel Lanzini and Javier Hernandez. 57 min: Iwobi pops up on the right and cuts the ball back to Ramsey, who sweeps a shot wide. Meanwhile a replay of Monreal’s goal shows that the dozy Masuaku was standing on the post and simply stepped aside, leaving it to Hart, who was furious. Absurd defending. He could have cleared it. 55 min: Arsenal are rampant now. West Ham are all over the place. They’ve not recovered from going behind. Lacazette gets a shot away from inside the area, but it’s blocked. Then Ogbonna heads a dangerous cross behind for a corner. 53 min: Arsenal fancy this now - which is nice of them - and Iwobi drives into the area from the right, only to ruin a promising run with a poor cross. A corner to Arsenal on the left. Xhaka sends it towards the penalty spot and the unmarked Monreal arrives to volley the ball low to Hart’s right! Wenger in! 50 min: West Ham take a useless corner over on the left and Arsenal break. The visitors are caught short as Arsenal break and Zabaleta takes emergency action, sending Welbeck flying. He’s booked. 48 min: Lacazette’s chipped cross is chested down by Welbeck, who gets away with a little shove on Zabaleta, but Monreal shoots straight at Hart. Which isn’t usually the worst idea, but the West Ham goalkeeper holds on to this one. 47 min: Sky’s Geoff Shreeves has been told by Arsenal’s medical team that Mohamed Elneny appears to have rolled an ankle, which is encouraging news. 46 min: West Ham get the second half underway. Wenger is late emerging from the tunnel. Disgrace. Arsenal’s next manager? “For me, Wenger is the Paul McCartney of football,” says Simon McMahon. “In the same way that the person who wrote Eleanor Rigby and Hey Jude also ended up writing Ebony and Ivory and The Frog Chorus, the man in charge of the ‘98 double winners and the Invincibles has also presided over the risible shower of the past few seasons. Doesn’t lessen the earlier achievements though.” “As a Yank introduced to European football during the 2001-02 season, I joyfully recall how good some of Arsenal’s attacking bands have been and acknowledge that I missed Arsene’s first great team,” says Daniel Finucane. “But Ozil has to make the cut. The guy is pure class, winner of three Cups, and the subject of one of Wenger’s classic quotes. Then again, it’s almost fitting that he’s been overlooked yet again.” There is a not a single player who deserves to be left out for Ozil. Pires? Ljungberg? Parlour? Overmars? Puh-lease. Elsewhere it’s Stoke 1-0 Burnley at half-time. Here’s how the Premier League table looks at the moment. Muted applause. 45 min+5: Xhaka feeds a pass to Ramsey, who turns and shoots wide. 45 min+3: Masuaku slides in on the left and diverts the ball to Arnautovic. The Austrian scoots into the area, but his cross is cut out at the near post. Masuaku takes over and forces Iwobi to concede a corner. Mario knocks it low to the near post and the ball seems to come off Ogbonna and go behind. Lee Mason awards another corner. 45 min+2: “As Elneny goes off, thoughts turn to another name we shall miss - have been missing - Santi Cazorla, who might have made Wenger’s last two years less arid,” says Charles Antaki. 45 min+1: There will be five added minutes. 45 min: Elneny’s taken off on a stretcher. He’s pulled his shirt over his face and appears to be in considerable pain. It appears to be a serious injury. Ainsley Maitland-Niles replaces the Egyptian. 44 min: Elneny, who’s still down after that collision with Noble, is having a brace put on his left leg. 42 min: Elneny’s afternoon might be over. Wenger is giving instructions to Ainsley Maitland-Niles on the bench. 41 min: West Ham get a couple of crosses into the Arsenal area. Both are overhit. Nothing happens. Play is eventually stopped because Elneny’s down, giving Lee Mason a chance to book Xhaka for an earlier foul on Masuaku. 38 min: Xhaka’s corner is headed away at the near post. Arsenal will probably find a way through at some point, but much of this half has been a good reminder of why Wenger’s leaving. 36 min: “I was a little young to appreciate Wenger’s earliest side, which is slightly surreal for someone who’s nearly 30, so he’s effectively the only Arsenal manager I’ve ever known,” says Matt Loten. “My strongest personal association with Wenger’s Arsenal, however, will always be a game that I never saw. During the Invincibles season, the Gunners famously turned up at my club, Portsmouth, for a league game, and turned us over 5-1, with Thierry Henry donning a blue shirt at the end and clapping the home support for the atmosphere they generated. “I wasn’t at the game, but my father was, and for the rest of his days he will never tire of describing how good that Arsenal side was that day. In a half-century of supporting Portsmouth, he’s never seen a finer display of pure footballing brilliance. I’ve never seen a side which inspired not just respect, but such unbridled joy in fans of opposing sides. Every time I think back on Arsene’s reign in the year to come, I will think of that: the pure joy that any football fan experienced every time they sat down to watch Wenger’s greatest teams.” 35 min: Bellerin charges down the right and crosses to the far post. Welbeck heads over. “Think you’re placing too much importance on winning vs. skill in your Arsene 11s - especially if the only qualifier for being ranked ahead of Fabregas is being a senior player in a double-winning side,” says Jay. Did you ever see Petit? In addition to Jacob’s fine work on this classic, we also have Rob Smyth talking about Chelsea v Southampton in the FA Cup semi-final, if you’re that way inclined. 34 min: Xhaka curls the free-kick powerfully round the wall, but Hart gets two strong fists to the shot and pushes it to safety. 33 min: Welbeck’s brought down by Rice outside the area. The ball runs through to Lacazette, who’s offside, so Lee Mason brings it back and awards Arsenal a free-kick. 31 min: Welbeck scuffs a shot wide from 25 yards. Arsenal look weirdly anxious. The Emirates is quiet. 29 min: The pace has slowed. There’s not much happening. It feels like a good time to say that The Invincibles are overrated. 26 min: Ramsey is down after being caught by Kouyate. 25 min: Arsenal haven’t tested Joe Hart yet. Wenger out! Here’s a decent effort from Welbeck, though, a low drive that zips just wide from 20 yards. 23 min: Welbeck plays a one-two with Iwobi and tries to hurtle through. Masuaku steps in, but his tackle is feeble and Welbeck’s able to keep possession. He turns and finds Bellerin, who leans back and sidefoots over. 21 min: The pesky Arnautovic runs on to another long ball, holds off Mustafi and lays it back to Fernandes, who skies a volley from 20 yards. “What surprises me is that Conte isn’t mentioned at all,” says David Dein (not that one). “He knows the Premier League, is almost certainly available, is a nice guy and would know exactly what the Arsenal squad needs both in terms of personnel and coaching. I would expect him to be able to hit the ground running more than anyone else.” 20 min: Arsenal try to settle themselves down and Iwobi almost opens West Ham up with a pass through to Lacazette. The striker turns, but he’s tackled by Ogbonna at the vital moment. 18 min: “Van Persie over Anelka,” says Edward Ricketts. “Did the business for longer (despite injuries), a more complete player and very good goalscoring record in a weaker team than the one Anelka played in. Your take?” But he didn’t win the league or score in an FA Cup final. Van Persie achieved very little under Wenger. Anelka destroyed defences for two consecutive seasons and was close to winning consecutive doubles. 16 min: Masuaku darts down the left and wins a corner off Bellerin. Mario whips it into the six-yard box and Kouyate, who scored here in 2015, shoulders the ball on to the roof of the net. Arsenal don’t look sure of themselves at the back. Meanwhile Badou Ndiaye has made it Stoke 1-0 Burnley. 15 min: West Ham are threatening to ruin Wenger’s afternoon. Arnautovic hassles Arsenal on the left this time and again he manages to wriggle clear. He has more space this time and he’s allowed to run into the area. Then he opens up his body and tries to bend one into the far corner, only for Ospina to beat the Austrian’s effort to safety. Arsenal could do with waking up. 13 min: West Ham threaten again, Arnautovic prodding a long ball on to Mario, who darts forward before fizzing a low shot towards the bottom left corner. Ospina gets down well to save. That was an encouraging moment for the visitors and they’re at it again soon after, Arnautovic bursting on to another long punt and breaking into the area from the right. Mustafi slides in to deny him, though. 11 min: West Ham enjoy their first proper spell inside Arsenal’s half. Arnautovic slips a pass inside to Joao Mario, who suddenly spots a huge space in the middle of the home team’s defence. Fernandes can’t control the Portuguese midfielder’s pass, though, and Arsenal get away with it. “Imagine that Wenger A team back 5 all aged between 28 and 32,” says David Acaster. “They might get a few games between them in this summer’s WC. I would swap Fabregas in for Petit. Imagine a passer like him making the bullets for Ljunberg, Bergkamp, Pires and Henry to fire. It would leave a lot of work for Vieira but they’d always score more than the opposition. Lovely player Petit mind.” Petit was a senior player in a double-winning side. Fabregas won one FA Cup. 9 min: Monreal lopes into space down the left and wins another corner, Zabaleta cutting out his cross. Xhaka takes it again, an outswinger this time, and Koscielny rises above Kouyate and heads just wide of the right post. Joe Hart would not have saved it. Wenger turns away in disappointment. “Any chance Collins has a spare for Joe Hart?” parps Ian Sargeant. 7 min: Xhaka’s corner’s headed away at the near post. “Slightly surprised by your omission of Sanchez from your Wenger A and B teams,” says Fred Mikardo-Greaves. “I’d say he has the edge over Anelka. Thoughts?” Anelka was a key player in a double-winning side. Sanchez was the best player in a team of underachievers. No contest. 6 min: Elneny’s pass deflects off Cresswell and goes behind for the first corner. Xhaka will take it. “Could not disagree more - Wenger saw tidal wave coming and Emirates was solution,” says George Meikle. “And I think it worked- it is basis for other revenue streams that feed off fan base. Horrible but necessary if you are going to be Top Four. My Chelsea are on way out - until the Bridge is redone, we won’t have clout needed. Winning comes after smart application of clout- both are required, just see Man City vs. Man U.” 5 min: I suppose Steve Bould could drop out. 4 min: Aaron Ramsey, who’s probably the best player in this Arsenal 11, goes on a power surge through the middle. But he’s crowded out by a posse of West Ham defenders. 3 min: James Collins, West Ham’s hamstrung centre-back, is in the away end this afternoon. 2 min: Correction: I see empty seats. That’s amazing. Why would you willingly miss this game? Peep! Arsenal, in their red and white, get the game underway. They’re kicking from left to right in the first half. West Ham are in their navy away strip. Here come the teams! The sun is shining on north London and there’s a fine atmosphere inside a packed Emirates. “Football should be an art” reads one banner. Can Arsenal find some of the old magic today? You’ll notice that there’s no room for any post-Invincible in my two Wenger 11s. That says it all. Wenger’s A team: Seaman; Dixon, Campbell, Adams, Cole; Ljungberg, Petit, Vieira, Pires; Bergkamp, Henry. Wenger B team: Lehmann; Lauren, Keown, Bould, Winterburn; Parlour, Gilberto, Fabregas, Overmars; Anelka, Wright. I hate putting Overmars in the B team. David Moyes speaks! “We’d like some more goals, but we have goals in the team. But we know we have to be hard to beat. I don’t think the announcement of Arsene leaving helps us. I would expect the supporters to get behind them. But we need to be ready for that. The only thing is they have a big semi-final coming up on Thursday. Make sure we get close to them when we can.” “Am I the only person wondering why Benitez hasn’t been mentioned for the Arsenal job?” says Alex Brown. Benitez is a very good outside shout (even though he seems to have no chance of getting it). He’d give Arsenal the organisation they so desperately need and, unlike Wenger, he has a good record in Europe. But he’s also a tricky character who’s prone to falling out with his bosses and he doesn’t really fit the profile of what Arsenal want. “I’ll miss Arsène’s Frenchisms,” says Charles Antaki. “As articulate and admirably fluent as he was in English, he never quite untangled French from English grammar and idiom. Today’s “I want to do my job well until the end” and “I am in this job for a long time” are all too fitting valedictories.” Look, Charles, we live in a society where people use top, top Frenchisms. Arsene Wenger has had some memorable bouts with West Ham down the years. I’m thinking of an Overmars-led destruction in 1997; a penalty shootout victory with 10 men in the FA Cup in 1998; Di Canio versus 11 men in 1999; Henry’s thunderbolt at Upton Park in 2002; the Pardew shoving match; the Andy Carroll game in 2016; a memorable 0-0 draw at the London Stadium in December. What’s today’s MBM riff? How about you ... send me your favourite memories of Nelson Vivas Arsene Wenger? Thierry Henry is asked about whether he’ll throw his hat in the ring. “I am not in or out. I am nowhere. The other day I spoke with my heart because I love Arsenal. I will never back down from a challenge. But we have some people who should come out and talk about Arsenal Football Club. That’s not my job. My phone didn’t ring.” There is laughter. Gary Neville steps in to point out that Henry has a job as Belgium’s assistant coach. The former Manchester United defender says that Arsenal should be thinking about former players: your Henrys, your Bergkamps, your Artetas ... your Bendtners. On Sky, Gary Neville and Thierry Henry both think that the situation has not been handled enough clarity. They are asking what’s coming next. Henry says there is too much speculation and has called for Arsenal’s board to tell the fans more. And here’s David Hytner on what it was like to cover Arsene Wenger. We’ve had some great content on this website since Friday. Here’s Daniel Taylor’s offering. An email! “For all the well deserved praise for the positive things that Wenger brought to English football, we shouldn’t overlook some of the negative things that he at least emphasised, even if he didn’t introduce them,” David Wall says. “Consider the Emirates stadium for instance. Wenger was instrumental in pushing for the move , designing the stadium, and so on. But the crucial motivation behind that was a money-making one. At the time the move was planned arsenal were competitive, and far from suffering from the smaller capacity of Highbury against premier league rivals. But Wenger pushed against that, in favour of a stadium that prioritised matchday revenue rather than atmosphere. It’s not a big step from that to the targeting of a top four finish for the income it brings over actually trying to win anything, and so on. Of course, Wenger didn’t introduce the profit first motivation, but he certainly contributed to its prominence now.” Arsene Wenger speaks! “First of all I am focused on the game. At the end of the day my job is to win the next game and we have to make a separation between the feelings and emotions that come with such a decision as well as with the job and I want to do my job well until the end. I am in this job for a long time. I have gone through very difficult times so you learn to deal with difficult situations.” Arsenal’s manager is asked about his decision to step down with a year left on his contract. “I will come out on that a bit later but at the moment it is important to focus on what matters. That means the results in the next games. After the game we have another game. After the season maybe. I believe that what is interesting for people is to know who’s in charge of the club and team. I dedicate my whole life to making this club a solid club with strong foundations and I always said I want to leave the club with an opportunity for the new guy to come in to find a solid and ambitious club. I will focus on the game. My life is to win games. That is what I will do. I hope the team will deal with positive emotions. We have had some adversity and I think in last the games I would like the team to be supported well. We have had a good season at home. We want to finish the season well.” Arsene Wenger is wandering around the corporate area at the Emirates and shaking a few hands. He’s smiling. He’ll have his serious face on soon enough, though, because there’s a game to be won. Arsenal need to react after last weekend’s defeat at Newcastle and Wenger has made a few changes. Petr Cech, Joe Willock, Calum Chambers, Rob Holding, Mohamed Elneny and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang drop out, David Ospina, Hector Bellerin, Laurent Koscielny, Aaron Ramsey and Danny Welbeck come in. Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Jack Wilshere are out and it seems that Mesut Ozil has been rested before Atletico Madrid on Thursday. West Ham, who are six points above the bottom three, are unchanged. David Moyes, the man who will replace Wenger at the end of the season, keeps faith with Joe Hart despite the erstwhile England No1’s mistake against Stoke. Arsenal: Ospina; Bellerin, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Xhaka, Elneny; Iwobi, Ramsey, Welbeck; Lacazette. Subs: Mertesacker, Aubameyang, Holding, Chambers, Maitland-Niles, Macey, Nelson.

On days like this, after all, it’s better to remember the good times more than anything else. And Arsenal have known plenty under Arsene Wenger. Problem is, though, all good things have to come to an end at some point and the truth is this has been a long time coming. From 1996 until 2004, Wenger was one of the greatest managers English football has ever seen. The first part of his reign was so full of wonder that even neutrals look back on it fondly. Yet the second part, the post-Invincibles decline, has been maddening to watch and that is why there was no real surprise when the announcement came on Friday morning, even if the timing came as a jolt. Of course, it sounds like Wenger would have carried on if he’d been given the chance. But Arsenal were finally prepared to be ruthless. The evidence had become impossible to ignore. Or, more pertinently, the empty seats had become impossible to ignore. It wasn’t the anger, the Wenger Out wars and the YouTube rants wot swung it, it was the apathy after years of stagnation, of seeing that intoxicating and innovative early blend of pace, power, authority, skill and ingenuity slowly give way to something softer and more delicate, an idealised version of Wengerball that ultimately proved too indulgent and unfocused. Title challenges fizzled out because the football was too careless and three FA Cups in four years, though enjoyable, only papered over the cracks. The league was even lost to Leicester in 2016 and it would be cruel to go over the various humiliations in the Champions League. The others caught up and then they overtook Wenger, leaving him looking like yesterday’s man and Arsenal out of their precious place in the top four. It was time. Change, at long last, is on the way. But we can worry about what comes next later. We don’t have to worry about this not really being like United saying goodbye to Ferguson, who went out on the top. Not now. Today is a chance for Arsenal fans to remember the legend known as Le Professeur, for these underachieving players to pay tribute to their manager by hammering West Ham. With a Europa League semi-final against Atlético Madrid to come, there can still be a happy ending. It would be a fitting way to bow out. Because those with long enough memories will remember that there really was a time when Arsene Knew.

Research for the National Union of Students finds that student expenditure routinely outstrips income from loans, leaving many whose parents cannot afford to subsidise them without the means to pay for basics such as food and heating. Fees for halls are often unaffordable for those struggling on maintenance loans, with many universities setting rents above inflation to generate additional income, the study claims. It quotes the results of a freedom of information request by the University of East Anglia students’ union, which found that more than 20 higher education institutions generated more than £1,000 profit per bed space a year. One student said they had to find an additional £700 on top of their maintenance loan to pay for their accommodation alone. “This pricing policy risks segregating working-class students in lower-cost accommodation from others who have access to additional funds from their families,” the report says. Working-class students – who are most likely to be employed in a job that requires more than the recommended 15 hours a week of work while studying – also struggled to afford to participate in social events with their wealthier peers, leaving them feeling ostracised. One student said they were expected to pay £200 to join a junior common room for their halls of residence to be included in social activities. Worcester students’ union submitted evidence from one contributor who said: “[If you are] working-class you are shunned by students too … It’s ridiculous. I remember feeling inferior to everyone else because I wasn’t pretty enough, I didn’t dress nicely enough, I had pack[ed] lunch rather than canteen food.” An annual survey by the University of Bristol students’ union found just over a third of respondents had witnessed bullying, harassment or discrimination based on a person’s economic or class background. The NUS report, Class Dismissed: Getting in and Getting on in Further and Higher Education, goes on to point out that dropout rates from university are highest among working-class students, who are more likely to be debt averse than their wealthier peers, yet can end up paying more. Fees for access courses mean many working-class students pay an additional year of fees to gain qualifications and they can struggle to find a guarantor to rent in the private sector, leading them to use private schemes with higher fees and interest rates. Addressing student poverty and creating equal access to education has been Shakira Martin’s central mission as NUS president. A black, working-class single mother, she explains in a powerful introduction to the report how education has played a transformative role in her life. “I left high school with one GCSE, left home at 16 – living on just £44.50 per week – and became the young mother of two beautiful girls. If you were to tell any of my teachers at secondary school this would be where I am, where I have worked to be, they would have never believed you. But here I am. Against all odds. Further education transformed my life and gave me the second chance I needed. “My hope, and my vision for the UK is that we will arrive at a day where my story is not against all odds. That no working-class person’s story is against all odds. We will no longer be the exceptions to the rule when it comes to success and fulfilment in education. We will be the rule.” The report calls for the introduction of a minimum living income for students in further and higher education; it also recommends the restoration of maintenance grants, the education maintenance allowance and NHS bursaries for healthcare students."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/22/welsh-finance-minister-mark-drakeford-carwyn-jones","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T16:18:34Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn thanks Welsh first minister who quit after ‘darkest times’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/22/welsh-finance-minister-mark-drakeford-carwyn-jones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/22/welsh-finance-minister-mark-drakeford-carwyn-jones","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn thanks Welsh first minister who quit after ‘darkest times’","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has brushed off the idea that the Welsh first minister is leaving office under a cloud after Carwyn Jones announced he was stepping down as the pressure over the death of Carl Sargeant intensified. Corbyn thanked Jones for his “tireless” work as leader of Labour in Wales and said he had been a strong voice for democracy, devolution and standing up for the Welsh people. Asked if Jones was leaving under a cloud, Corbyn said that he was departing with a great deal of affection. However, there is little doubt that Jones’s nine-year spell as first minister will be most remembered for the tragedy of Sargeant, who killed himself shortly after he was sacked by Jones when he faced allegations of harassment. Among the early frontrunners to take over is Mark Drakeford, the finance secretary, who said he was thinking “very seriously” about standing. Another possible candidate is Vaughan Gething, who became the first black minister in any devolved UK administration five years ago. A row is already brewing over how the new first minister will be elected. Shortly before Jones announced he was stepping down, the Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris won the Welsh Labour deputy leadership election through an electoral college system – rather than one member, one vote. Her rival Julie Morgan, whose late husband, Rhodri, was first minister before Jones, lost despite being backed by more party members. There are growing calls for the new leader to be elected under one member, one vote. Corbyn said the method used was up to the Welsh Labour party. Jones, who will leave in the autumn, said he had faced the “darkest times” in recent months. He has been under intense pressure since Sargeant’s death and his position had been made more awkward by the election of Sargeant’s son, Jack, to the Alyn and Deeside parliamentary seat in north Wales. Last week, opposition parties in Wales fiercely criticised the government for blocking the full publication of a report examining claims that news of Sargeant’s dismissal was leaked in the days before his death. A day before Jones’s announcement, lawyers for Jack Sargeant published a letter accusing Jones of causing considerable distress. The main inquiry into the Sargeant affair has not yet begun and Jones promised he would answer every question asked. Jones is an experienced election campaign leader, who has guided Welsh Labour to a string of victories. Together with the Scottish National party, he has played an important role in holding the UK government to account over Brexit. There is a danger that his announcement will weaken that position. Until the Sargeant tragedy, Jones was regarded as a safe pair of hands who may not have been as charismatic or well-known as his predecessor Rhodri Morgan, but appealed to a broad range of voters and Labour party activists. After the defeat of the Labour party in the 2010 UK general election and the resignation of Gordon Brown as prime minister, Jones became the most senior Labour leader in power. Since then, one of his missions has been to protect Wales against the impact of austerity. His government’s record in the devolved areas of education and health have been frequently attacked by political opponents in Westminster, but he has defended his administration robustly. Under his watch, the Welsh assembly has been given power to make its own laws and to raise some tax revenues. Jones, who is married with two children, is particularly proud of a landmark scheme under which people are deemed to have consented to organ donation unless they opt out that has been credited with saving lives. In an interview with the Guardian shortly before Sargeant’s death to mark the 20th anniversary of Welsh devolution, Jones said he believed that Wales was more successful and confident than two decades ago. He said he was also much more confident, buoyed by excellent results in the general election and was still enjoying the top job. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

It was in the 1999 movie Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Mike Myers’s Dr Evil has just been cloned, and does a convulsive double-take on realising that his double is one-eighth his size. Two-foot-eight Troyer comes on in the Bond-villain quasi-Nehru jacket and impassively does the signature little finger to the lips move – worryingly like a precocious infant. An almost-star was born, although Troyer had begun his screen career in 1994 in the movie Baby’s Day Out when he had been the stunt double for a baby. Troyer repeated the Mini-Me role in the Austin Powers sequel Goldmember, had a small part as a goblin in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone – and with dignity and good humour sustained a career in reality television and the professional celebrity industry for almost 20 years. This career spanned a period in which people of restricted height – Troyer had achondroplasia dwarfism – were starting to be regarded differently in cinema and in pop culture. People with dwarfism had always been treated exploitatively, and cinema from its earliest days adopted the robust circus tradition of using them brashly, unsentimentally, and expected them to behave in the same matter-of-fact way. And for many that was at least better than condescending pity. Tales of the Munchkin actors’ drunken behaviour on the set of The Wizard of Oz became legendary. Kenny Baker found his weird vocation in playing R2D2 in Star Wars. Felix Silla was an Italian circus clown who had work in comedies and scary movies (an habitual generic combination for actors with dwarfism). Zelda Rubinstein made an impression in Chevy Chase’s 1980 comedy Under the Rainbow, a 30s-period comedy, set at the time of the filming of The Wizard of Oz. British actor David Rappaport had a very similar career, but was given a chance to shine more than usual in Terry Gilliam’s Time Bandits (1981). But it was Peter Dinklage, Game of Thrones star, who has really escaped the patronising prejudice in a very contemporary way. He has stated that “dwarfs are still the butt of jokes. It’s one of the last bastions of acceptable prejudice.” It was a bigotry that his career has repudiated, although Troyer arguably couldn’t match Dinklage’s acting talent. In a way, Warwick Davis’s career is closer to Troyer’s: he acted in the first Star Wars prequel Phantom Menace and, ironically, replaced him in the Harry Potter franchise, but it was archly playing himself in Ricky Gervais’s TV comedy Extras that made Davis’ name. Davis challenged bigotry with confidence and black comedy, breaking the hush of liberal concern, and that was the same cheerful self-awareness that Troyer tapped into. There is an ongoing debate about the whole idea of “mini-me”: the idea that performers with dwarfism are just being demeaningly represented as comic or horrific miniatures. But Troyer at any rate tackled and subverted that idea — with confidence, with comic gusto and with charm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/23/franchisees-say-they-dont-dare-tell-inquiry-about-problems","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T22:26:37Z","webTitle":"Franchisees say they don't dare tell inquiry about problems","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/23/franchisees-say-they-dont-dare-tell-inquiry-about-problems","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/23/franchisees-say-they-dont-dare-tell-inquiry-about-problems","fields":{"headline":"Franchisees say they don't dare tell inquiry about problems","bodyText":"Franchisees have not made a single submission to a parliamentary inquiry into the sector, and some cite concerns that speaking out would violate agreements heavily weighted in favour of brand owners. The inquiry, established last month by Nationals MP John Williams, was set up to scrutinise the relationship between master brand companies and the small businesses they licence to operate. But franchisees have told Guardian Australia that relationship has been tipped so far out of balance they cannot even contribute to the debate. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning One business owner said the inquiry needed to do more to encourage anonymous or unpublished submissions. “We have an agreement with the master franchise. They don’t come close to keeping up their end of the bargain … but we could find ourselves in trouble for breaching it by even making a submission or talking to [the media]. We are supposed to act at all times in the interest of the brand,” he said. “I’ve been following [stories about franchising], but people who have spoken out so far, they’ve already been driven out of business. They’ve passed the point of no return. We are ploughing on, and while we are still serving customers there’s nothing to be gained. “The master franchise continues to take their royalties, but since we bought the business the support has been less and less, to the point it’s not even clear what they do for us anymore. We think they’re trying to drive us out of business, take it back for nothing, and sell it again. “Sure, I’d like everyone to know they way they have acted, but until I do go broke, I’ll have to deal with that situation myself. Legal action is a better option [than a making a submission]. The ones I feel for are people who have lost so much already they can’t afford to take legal action.” Williams said he was aware that some working franchisees were “a bit gun shy” but said they could request their submission was confidential and not published. They could also give evidence to the inquiry in-camera with no record in Hansard. He said there were stories of people going broke and committing suicide as a result. “Things have got to change,” he said. Submissions to the inquiry close on 4 May. So far, just four have been received. Of those, one is from an academic and three from people involved with master franchises. Elke Meyer, the former credit controller at retail food group, whose job it was to collect debts from franchisees, told the inquiry in a submission that she took note of what she considered “serious issues” during her tenure. “The company’s motto was ‘cash is king’,” Meyer wrote in her submission. “My manager was very clear about this, despite my attempts at making her see it was creating a false economy as it was not sustainable long-term if the franchisees and staff were constantly unhappy and struggling.” Meyer detailed a situation, which she has spoken about previously, where she raised concern that a struggling franchisee was a suicide risk. “When I contacted the family a week later to see how they were going and to ensure someone had contacted them regarding support, the woman advised me someone had rung them, but only to get money from them.” Meyer also raised concerns franchisees were enticed to buy businesses with rubbery figures. “I spoke with franchisees daily who would tell me they believed they were lied to regarding the alleged profit the store they purchased was making prior to purchase. Many of them had not done their due diligence because they believed the company had credibility. Many of the franchisees had purchased company stores and there were allegations made that the profit/loss paperwork was altered prior to sale.” Jim’s Group, the country’s largest franchise chain, made a submission to the inquiry and said the current franchising code of conduct did little to protect franchisees from unscrupulous operators. “The whole system is no more than a feeding trough for lawyers,” the submission says. “Even if a franchisor blatantly breaches the code, the legal system is so cumbersome and expensive that people with few financial resources cannot take them on. “Thus, even positive aspects of the code, such as the requirement for two weeks’ delay after contracts have been delivered, and providing a list of current franchisees to the prospect, can be ignored. I have seen a disclosure document from a major franchisor where the phone number of each current franchisee was the office number. In another case, the franchisor routinely fails to return deposits.” Jim’s Group suggested a star rating system for master franchises. Former Brumby’s bakery CEO Michael Sherlock said franchising was in a poor state, and more transparency was needed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/21/fragile-under-pressure-kim-jong-un-wont-give-up","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T19:54:35Z","webTitle":"Fragile and under pressure, but Kim Jong-un won’t give up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/21/fragile-under-pressure-kim-jong-un-wont-give-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/21/fragile-under-pressure-kim-jong-un-wont-give-up","fields":{"headline":"Kim Jong-un: fragile and under pressure but he won’t give up","bodyText":"Rockets, satellites, missiles and atoms pepper the landscape in Pyongyang. They are the anchors of funfair rides, feature in extravagant floral tributes to the country’s “dear” and “supreme” leaders from the Kim dynasty, and appear on stamps, apartment buildings and school walls. These celebrations of the country’s weapons programme serve as a constant reminder to residents and visitors of how critical North Korea’s nuclear project has been to its national identity and security. Pursued at immense political and financial cost for more than six decades, even through a famine that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, it has proved useful leverage for wringing aid out of world powers, and an increasingly vital security guarantee for a brutal, autocratic regime. So the unilateral promise by the leader Kim Jong-un to halt tests of nuclear warheads and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and shut down the country’s nuclear test site, was an unexpected commitment that has added to hopes for talks with US and South Korean counterparts. It capped months of dramatic diplomacy that have seen Kim and Donald Trump pivot from trading belligerent threats to planning their summit and claiming a shared goal of getting rid of nuclear weapons. But experts on North Korea warned that Kim’s statement should be seen more as diplomatic manoeuvring, with relatively limited real costs to Pyongyang, than as a prelude to any genuine moves to gut the prized nuclear programme. Kim is under huge pressure. For the first time in decades North Korea may actually fear an American military attack, and its fragile economy is at huge risk from the strictest sanctions it has ever faced. Even on a carefully choreographed tour of the capital, long-standing shortages and privations are clear. A handful of cars and buses drift down vast empty streets, solar panels hanging from windows and balconies are testimony to regular power cuts. Kim needs trade to start flowing again, to fill his government coffers and the purses of supporters now grown used to moderate luxuries such as designer handbags, foreign whiskey and taxis to whisk them across town. He may be willing to make some genuine concessions for this; an improvement on past talks where Pyongyang has blustered and ultimately offered little more than a return to the status quo. But they will not include America’s stated aim – the total and irreversible destruction of the nuclear programme. The fate of other dictators who confronted America, but gave up weapons programmes, including Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, has not gone unnoticed. “People like to talk about North Korea as ‘crazy’. The absolute ‘craziest’ thing they could do is give up their nuclear deterrent in a situation where they have an aggressive nuclear-armed enemy,” Alex Wellerstein, a historian of science and nuclear weapons and a professor at the Stevens Institute of Technology, said. “Does anyone think they are that crazy? I don’t,” he added. Pyongyang’s aims were still unclear he said, but could include stalling to defuse tensions, seeking recognition from America that it has long felt it deserves, or negotiating to reduce sanctions. For now, though, Kim appears focused on making it through the summits. For weeks there have been questions on both sides of the Pacific about whether the meeting with Trump in particular would actually go ahead. It is apparently so sensitive that it has not been reported in North Korean state media. But the CIA chief Mike Pompeo’s visit to Pyongyang, for personal meetings with Kim two weeks ago, appears to have brought a sometimes improbable meeting one step closer to reality. The two men appear to have outlined a deal of sorts that would give both sides grounds to claim success even if little real progress is made on removing Pyongyang’s nuclear arsenal, the Wall Street Journal reported. Effectively it would see Kim swap the three Americans in his jails for the prestige of meeting the US president, something North Korean leaders have craved for decades. The Americans are academics at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, which was founded by a Korean-American Christian, and a businessman charged with spying and stealing state secrets in 2016 – the 62-year-old was sentenced to 10 years of hard labour. That agreement, and Pyongyang’s apparent show of goodwill over weapons testing, appear to make the high-profile summit more likely. But details still have to be hammered out. North Korea has agreed to constraints on its nuclear programme before and then backed away from commitments. In 2011, Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, spent the last weeks of his life negotiating a secret agreement with the US to trade food aid for a suspension of missile testing and uranium enrichment. It was sealed on 29 February, after his death, by his son and successor, and dubbed the “Leap Day” deal because of the date. Greeted with enthusiasm, within weeks it was effectively torn up. Kim’s government planned a satellite launch, insisting it was for peaceful purposes, but America disputed the claim, said Van Jackson, a former US official who at the time was working for the secretary of defence. “The United States made clear that space-launched vehicles, satellite-launched vehicles, cannot be considered anything but a missile test,” he told US National Public Radio. The stillborn deal has hovered over attempts to deal with North Korea, seen by some as evidence of the regime’s unscrupulous approach to manipulating western concerns. And while the statement from Pyongyang was dramatic, it may contain fewer concessions than the headlines suggest. Kim has completed his nuclear programme, so although his arsenal may be small and slightly unreliable, he doesn’t need further testing to use it as a deterrent. Abandoning nuclear tests and the country’s test site may just be strategic packaging of a geographical inevitability, after the Punggye-ri nuclear test site was probably damaged by September’s very large explosion. Tunnels caved in, Reuters reported, making it hard to use for any future test without risk of radioactive pollution seeping out. It also had omissions likely to worry regional powers who have always made more likely targets than the United States. “North Korea notably made no promises about intermediate or short-range missiles,” said Melissa Hanham, a senior research associate in the East Asia Nonproliferation Program. That leaves Japan and South Korea firmly within range. “North Korea’s promise to end [intercontinental ballistic missile] tests is also very good, but comes with even more caveats,” Hanham said. “North Korea also thinks of ‘space launches’ as distinct from missile tests, which is in part why the Leap Day deal fell apart.” Even if North Korea did suggest it might give up weapons, it would be extremely hard to monitor in a country reluctant to loosen its tight grip on information and access. “North Korea has its own uranium mining operations. It has cavernous, secret underground storage and production, lots of scientists with experience of making nuclear weapons,” said Peter Ward, a North Korea researcher at Seoul National University. “Tell me how denuclearisation can be ‘complete, verifiable, and irreversible’.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/21/jack-johnson-trump-pardon-sylvester-stallone","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T07:06:11Z","webTitle":"Trump 'considering full pardon' of Jack Johnson – thanks to Sylvester Stallone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/21/jack-johnson-trump-pardon-sylvester-stallone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/21/jack-johnson-trump-pardon-sylvester-stallone","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump 'considering full pardon' of Jack Johnson – thanks to Sylvester Stallone","bodyText":"Donald Trump said on Saturday he is “considering a full pardon” for Jack Johnson, the great African American boxer who was a victim of racially motivated injustice. Johnson became the first black heavyweight world champion in 1908, winning a fight in Australia against a white boxer from Canada. In July 1910 he pummelled the white boxer Jim Jefferies in Reno, Nevada, a famous a victory that led to deadly race riots. In 1913 Johnson was charged under the Mann Act with transporting a prostitute across state lines. Contemplating the all-white jury, the boxer told his lawyer: “Eleven of those men are for life conviction, and the other is for hanging before hearing the evidence.” Duly convicted, Johnson said: “They crucified Christ, why not me?” He then skipped bail and went to Europe. In 1920, he returned to the US and served nearly a year in jail. Johnson died in a car crash in North Carolina in 1946, at the age of 68. He has been widely celebrated since, inspiring a seminal jazz rock album by Miles Davis and books and films including a 2004 documentary by Ken Burns, Unforgivable Blackness: the Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson. Since the turn of the century, a campaign for a posthumous pardon has gathered pace. George W Bush and Barack Obama, the first black president, did not act on the matter but the Arizona senator and 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain has supported legislation for a pardon. Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate leader from Nevada who was a boxer in his youth, is also a supporter. In 2010, the British world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis told the Guardian that though Muhammad Ali’s “contribution was profound, Jack Johnson’s was the first”. “It was quite a story,” Lewis said. “I am a lover of history and it was good to look again at the sort of attitudes that were about back in those days, to see how far we have come. “Even though black people were, in some ways, more accepted in American culture, the promoters’ dream became to look for controversy. And Jack Johnson was the first great showman. He gave them what they wanted. Look at the time he lived. “It was remarkable that he was travelling the world, as a black man, getting arrested, leaving America, going to Europe. In the end he got old, like we all do, and he got knocked out by Jess Willard.” On Saturday, Trump tweeted that he had just learned about Johnson from an actor famous for playing a fictional – white – boxer. “Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson,” Trump tweeted from Florida, where he watched the Houston funeral of former first lady Barbara Bush on television, his wife Melania attending in his stead. Stallone, the star of the Rocky movies, has been a guest at the president’s Mar-a-Lago resort. “[Johnson’s] trials and tribulations were great,” Trump added, “his life complex and controversial. Others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon!” Trump has used his pardoning power three times: for the controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of racially profiling Latinos; for Kristian Saucier, a sailor convicted of taking photos in a restricted area of a submarine; and earlier this month for I Lewis “Scooter” Libby, a Bush aide convicted of leaking the name of a CIA agent. Last month, reports that the president’s lawyers discussed the pardoning power in the context of the Mueller investigation into Russian election interference and alleged links between Trump aides and Moscow caused general consternation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/apr/21/paul-pogba-manchester-united-tottenham-fa-cup-semi-final","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T20:25:19Z","webTitle":"Paul Pogba surges to centre stage at Wembley with display of art and graft | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/21/paul-pogba-manchester-united-tottenham-fa-cup-semi-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/apr/21/paul-pogba-manchester-united-tottenham-fa-cup-semi-final","fields":{"headline":"Paul Pogba surges to centre stage at Wembley with display of art and graft","bodyText":"It seems safe to say Paul Pogba will never please everyone. Not least when so many of those watching seem so eager to be displeased: to rail at every moment of struggle, those times where Manchester United’s most intermittently captivating midfielder refuses to do all of the many things that have been expected of him since his return to English football. United and Pogba have both sputtered and sparked this season. At times they have seemed a perfect fit in the most unwanted way, a team and a star player who are both prone to fades, moments of drift, a sense of trapped energy. Not so here, though. This was a wonderful, boisterous FA Cup semi‑final played out in a fug of heavy London heat, the kind of giddy spring day that stinks of Cup finals past, shivers of the old bog‑roll-and-bed-sheets Wembley. In the middle of which there was a moment of shared illumination as United produced their most compelling big-game performance of the season, coming from behind to beat Tottenham 2-1; and Pogba laid on one of his most consistently effective team efforts of an oddly skittish year. His best moment was a perfect little miniature. United were 1-0 down, Pogba having played a hand in the terrible defending that led to Tottenham’s breakaway opening goal. In those moments there was something a little sad and tender about Pogba’s futile attempts to gallop back, head bobbing frantically. A little later he was outnumbered on the left, robbed and then nutmegged by Kieran Trippier, to huge raucous jeers. But he turned his afternoon around with a fine hand in the equaliser, pulling himself up to his full height and bringing to bear the full weight of that wonderfully easy talent. First Pogba overpowered the un-overpowerable Mousa Dembélé on the left, fishing the ball out and romping away, spotting the run of Alexis Sánchez. A lovely dipping cross zoned in on the Sánchez forehead, an irresistibly fragrant, lilac-scented, rose-petal-strewn invitation to nod the ball into the net, which Sánchez accepted. It was an excellent piece of creative play, and in just the right bruisingly muscular fashion for those who crave this kind of thing from Pogba. Part of the Proper Football Man objection to his worst days is the shrill obsession with his powerful physique, the idea that there is something wasteful, even a little cowardly in his refusal to spend most of the game barging his way around the pitch in the classic island-football style. Much is expected of this abstract notion of Pogba. A lot of it seems to be based in a swirl of preconceptions, a folk memory of the midfield general who grabs an entire game in his great meaty hands: a kind of footballing Beowulf, two parts Roy Keane highlights reel, two parts false memory syndrome of those bulky‑thighed midfield bullocks of years past. Never mind football has changed. That it was perhaps never really like this much in the first place. That it is hard to think of any midfielder who really does this now in what is a hugely complex team game. Pogba is required to take charge – this despite the fact that he is clearly a footballer who plays in moments, who likes to tick along on the edges before producing those passages where the day can be bent to his will. With a little help, of course. At Wembley against Spurs in January Pogba had played as part of a two alongside Matic in a game in which Dembélé marched United’s midfield around Wembley in a friendly headlock, ambling through those wide lime-green spaces like a bear in pursuit of a picnic basket. Here Pogba started in the most Pogba-friendly midfield, with Ander Herrera and Nemanja Matic a fine, composed two-man escort. Herrera in particular was excellent, covering so much space and passing so neatly that Pogba was able to use his guile and power with an increasing sense of purpose. The preoccupation with his muscles is it own kind of prejudice. He is an artful midfielder, a passer and a dribbler. In the second half there were a couple of wonderful flighted crossfield balls, and a nice moment as Herrera scored the winning goal. Pogba was infield at the time, covering the space as the ball bounced across the Spurs defence. As it hit the net Pogba stopped and raised his arms, a moment of quietly touching lone celebration for a player who was used here in the best way, a high-grade cutting edge to a driving team performance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/26/the-missing-maths-the-human-cost-of-fossil-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T10:00:14Z","webTitle":"The missing maths: the human cost of fossil fuels | Ploy Achakulwisut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/26/the-missing-maths-the-human-cost-of-fossil-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/26/the-missing-maths-the-human-cost-of-fossil-fuels","fields":{"headline":"The missing maths: the human cost of fossil fuels","bodyText":"While the climate policy world is littered with numbers, three of them have dominated recent discourse: 2, 1000, and 66. At the 2015 U.N. climate summit in Paris, world leaders agreed to limit global warming below 2°C to avoid catastrophic impacts of human-caused climate change. The science consequently dictates that, for a 50% chance of staying below 2°C, around 1,000 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (or 300 billion tonnes of carbon) can be emitted between now and 2050, and close to zero thereafter. We’re currently emitting 36 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. However, the potential greenhouse gas emissions contained in known, extractable fossil fuel reserves are around three times higher than this carbon budget, meaning that 66% must be kept in the ground. The debate du jour thus centers on which emissions reduction pathway is most optimal for staying below 2°C. The calculus of many policymakers, economists, fossil fuel companies, and indeed scientists, is that the most economical way to stay below 2°C is to delay most emissions reductions for decades to come, and then to play catch up by relying heavily on as-yet technically and economically unviable negative-emissions technologies. However, a crucial number has been neglected in this mainstream calculation: 6.1 million. Each year, 6.1 million lives are lost prematurely due to air pollution. Though most acutely and visibly hampering megacities of the developing world, air pollution is a growing public health emergency that affects almost all of us in our daily lives, whether or not we are aware of it. The Health Effects Institute estimates that only 5% of the global population are lucky enough to live in areas with air pollution levels below safe guidelines. Though recent studies suggest there may in fact be no risk-free level of air pollution. Why is this number relevant to climate policy? Because one common culprit is responsible for the majority of both climate change and air pollution: fuel combustion. Burning coal, oil, natural gas, and biomass – for everyday uses ranging from electricity, heating, cooking, to transportation – releases hundreds of gases and particles, some of which disrupt the climate system or are harmful to human health, or both. Climate change could also worsen air quality in the future. Decades of research have revealed that air pollution is associated with a wide range of diseases and disorders, including asthma, cancer, heart disease, stroke, and premature birth. There is also emerging evidence that pollution from coal combustion and motor vehicles can cause development delays, reduced IQ, and autism in children. The societal and economic costs of air pollution are multifold. There are costs to the affected individuals, to their families and to society in terms of direct medical costs, costs to healthcare systems, productivity losses, and lower economic growth (not to mention costs resulting from damages to ecosystems). Yet almost none of these costs stemming from our fossil fuel reliance are included in the majority of cost-benefit analyses of climate mitigation strategies. A recent study estimates that the health co-benefits from air pollution reductions would outweigh the mitigation costs of staying below 2°C by 140–250% globally. Historical evidence paints a similar picture. The EPA estimates that the U.S. Clean Air Amendments cost $65bn to implement, but will have yielded a benefit of almost $2tn by 2020 in avoided health costs. Many public health expert groups have underscored the enormous opportunity for leaders worldwide to design policies and initiatives that will simultaneously tackle climate change and air pollution. Examples include replacing the most carbon-intensive and polluting sources such as coal and heavy-duty diesel with lower-emission or renewable alternatives, ending fossil fuel subsidies, redesigning urban spaces to make it easier and safer to commute by foot, bicycle, and public transportation, and transitioning to a more circular and sustainable economy. While the climatic mitigation effects of such measures are long-term and dispersed globally, the health benefits are immediate and local. For too long, the enormous toll of disease and deaths from fossil fuel pollution has been neglected in climate change policies and underappreciated by the public. But public health data makes it clear that not all 2°C scenarios are created equal. The lives and well-being of hundreds of millions of us – especially our children – could be at stake. We would be remiss to ignore it. Dr. Ploy Achakulwisut is a Postdoctoral Scientist at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health.

Ireland won the grand slam on the back of scorelines that did not quite reflect their dominance, but the opposition are now starting to unravel as that dominance deepens. The Scarlets had the last word, Tadhg Beirne, schooled by Leinster, galloping home before he returns home next season, albeit to Munster, but if that represented appropriate reward for the visitors it was reward for a campaign that has lit up this competition, not for their contribution to this match. They felt as comprehensively beaten as any semi-finalist of this competition, even if Leinster could not quite equal the hiding on the scoreboard that Saracens meted out to Clermont Auvergne in 2014. The Scarlets felt every inch the visitors. The Irish are back in charge, but they seem to have spent a disproportionate amount of time developing that dominance at this stadium, looking magnificent in the spring sunshine. In the Six Nations that impression was created by a rare run of three home games in a row across the middle of their campaign. Now, though, Leinster have dispatched the Premiership champions and the Pro14 champions in consecutive rounds to march through to the final unbeaten and looking a million dollars. This was no one’s idea of a neutral venue. That said, they could have played at Parc Y Scarlets and it would not have made a jot of difference with Leinster in this form. A year ago, the Scarlets held out down the road at the RDS with 14 men for the second half to beat Leinster to the final of the Pro12, as it was then, before running rings round Munster in this very stadium to become champions. They have further developed their dazzling style of play, even influencing Wales to embrace the same, but this was a sobering reality check for romantics everywhere. The butterfly was broken upon the wheel. The Scarlets could find no way into this game. They were not helped by a couple of close calls, Leinster earning most of the breaks from the referee, as home teams often do, but if the Irish had been denied any of them they would simply have found another way, as they have all season, whether they have been in green shirts, or blue, or red. There was more than a hint of the Six Nations match between Ireland and Wales in February, the relentlessness of the Irish assault on the Welsh eye-watering in its intensity. The only difference this time was a scoreline more or less representative of that. Where Wales had managed to duck and dive for a mere two-point half-time deficit in the face of Ireland’s 75% first-half possession, the Scarlets were 15 points adrift at the break, three tries to nil down, in the face of 70. One might have considered Leigh Halfpenny’s three penalties in reply no small achievement for a side so under the cosh. Leinster ran through the full gamut of rugby’s virtues, slick at the lineout, precise in midfield and powerful – so powerful – into contact. Are they adept at sniffing out weaknesses? Do they have to be, when they are so peremptory at brandishing their own strengths? Try number one was all Leinster, but tries two and three owed something to exploiting one obvious weakness in the Scarlets armoury. The loss of Johnny McNicholl has meant Rhys Patchell at full-back and Halfpenny, Wales’s anchor at the back, moving to the wing. Sure enough, high balls were sent down on the Scarlets’ other wing to set up position for their second try and on Patchell himself in the build-up to the third, right on the stroke of half-time, that vitally sensitive period of the game, either side of the break, that all the best teams choose for their telling scores. By then, Leinster had set their stall out with so sweet a move from a lineout that one had to double-check Joe Schmidt was not behind it. Ireland’s midfield was integral, so perhaps he was, but Isa Nacewa provided some spice, coming in from the blindside wing. Fergus McFadden could not finish in the corner, as he would for Leinster’s third, so it was over to James Ryan, who survived TMO scrutiny to drive over for the try. Sure enough, the siege was relentless after the resumption too, Scott Fardy becoming the latest to barge unanswerably through a Scarlets tackler to the line for try number four, 10 minutes into the second half. The 22-point deficit it set up was the one we would finish with, which did indeed feel on the light side. Leinster are back in charge, like Ireland. Now all Munster have to do is join them by negotiating their date with Racing in Bordeaux, the sort they relish. An all-Ireland final feels inevitable, not to mention appropriate in this season of seasons."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/21/price-comparison-data-may-have-been-used-leave-eu-brexit-cambridge-analytica","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T21:20:00Z","webTitle":"Price comparison site data may have been used by Leave.EU","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/21/price-comparison-data-may-have-been-used-leave-eu-brexit-cambridge-analytica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/21/price-comparison-data-may-have-been-used-leave-eu-brexit-cambridge-analytica","fields":{"headline":"Price comparison site data may have been used by Leave.EU","bodyText":"Personal information gathered from price comparison websites may have been used without people’s knowledge or consent by pro-Brexit campaigners in the European referendum. An ex-director of Cambridge Analytica told parliament last week that she believed the Leave.EU campaign, headed by Nigel Farage and bankrolled by Arron Banks, may have breached data protection laws by using people’s private information without consent. She said she had seen with her “own eyes” how Leave.EU had apparently targeted customers of Eldon Insurance – owned by Banks – using their private data to promote anti-Europe messaging. Banks, Leave.EU and Eldon have vehemently denied having shared any such data, either with each other or with Cambridge Analytica. But a “subject access request” submitted to Eldon has revealed that it holds data not just on its own customers, but also on people who have submitted a query to a price comparison website (PCW), which involves them agreeing to the site’s privacy terms. A subject access request is a legal mechanism for individuals to obtain information from companies about what personal information the company holds about them, why it is held and how it is used. Such a request has revealed that personal details from a car insurance query to the PCW Moneysupermarket were passed to Eldon and held in its database. The data included name, date of birth, address, email address, details of friends and family and telephone number. In its last annual report, Moneysupermarket said that it held data on 24.9 million people – or about half the British electorate. A spokesman for Moneysupermarket said: “Our providers use the personal information from our customers to generate personalised quotes for the service they have asked for (such as quoting for car insurance) and are not allowed to use this information for anything else unless they have permission from the customer.” Potential customers who use most price comparison websites enter multiple pieces of sensitive personal information into an inquiry form that is then passed to partner companies. The privacy terms of the PCWs make clear that such data sharing may occur. The fact that this happens, however, raises the prospect that people who simply searched for insurance online via a PCW could have had their private information shared in a way they might not have realised. Ravi Naik, a lawyer who specialises in data rights, said it would be “an astonishing misuse” of data. “It’s absolutely huge,” he said. “In theory, commercial operators could have access to almost every voter in the UK. People should be very concerned. This would absolutely be in breach of the second principle of data protection – that data gathered for one purpose isn’t used for another purpose.” Brittany Kaiser, an ex-director of Cambridge Analytica, gave evidence to the select committee of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport last week that Banks asked Cambridge Analytica to combine data from different sources in order to profile and then target voters in the European referendum: “He asked us to design a strategy where we could work with Leave.EU, Ukip and Eldon Insurance data together.” She also submitted documents that showed “complementary work streams” for Ukip, Leave.EU and Eldon insurance. Banks owns Eldon, the umbrella group for various insurance brands that includes the GoSkippy brand and underwrites Debenhams insurance. The Leave.EU campaign was based inside its headquarters in Bristol. Kaiser described a visit to the offices and told MPs that she had seen with her “own eyes” that Leave.EU staff were using insurance customers’ data to target them with political messaging. “I was under the impression, by what they told me, that every single individual that they were pulling up to call was actually a lead or a current customer of Eldon Insurance or GoSkippy,” she said. Leave.EU said that Kaiser’s testimony was “a confused litany of lies and allegations”. Lawyers for Banks and Eldon said such allegations were “highly defamatory”, that none of these allegations was true, and that there was no evidence to support them. They said Leave.EU and Eldon have never shared any data and that Leave.EU has never shared any data with Cambridge Analytica, whether in relation to the referendum or otherwise. Last week, the Observer revealed that Leave.EU and Banks had received “information notices” from the Information Commissioner’s Office in the same week that the regulator had conducted a raid on Cambridge Analytica’s office and seized computer equipment. Both actions are part of its year-long investigation into the use of data in the referendum. The DCMS committee, which is conducting an inquiry into fake news, also published interviews that Emma Briant, a lecturer in propaganda at Essex University, conducted with directors of Cambridge Analytica and the Leave.EU campaign. It included a recording of Andy Wigmore – a director of Eldon Insurance and spokesman for Leave.EU – making claims about how Eldon’s actuaries had been used to analyse data during the referendum. Wigmore told the Guardian last week that no actuaries had been employed by the campaign. Last year, he told the Observer that the campaign had used artificial intelligence that it had developed inside Eldon’s headquarters. He said: “In insurance you have actuaries. Actuaries look at data, it’s all they do.” The subheading was amended on 24 April 2018 to better reflect the contents of the article. The original version of the subheading, made during the editing process, incorrectly stated that Ms Kaiser told the select committee that Leave.EU “may have used data from Moneysupermarket”. Mr Banks has since said through his lawyers that Eldon Insurance has never shared any data, including data received from any Moneysupermarket or any other insurance partner, with Leave.EU or any other third party. He has also said that Eldon Insurance and its associated companies act in full compliance with its legal and regulatory obligations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/21/stephen-lawrence-25-years-eltham-changed","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T21:50:03Z","webTitle":"In the 25 years since Stephen Lawrence’s death, has Eltham changed?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/21/stephen-lawrence-25-years-eltham-changed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/21/stephen-lawrence-25-years-eltham-changed","fields":{"headline":"In the 25 years since Stephen Lawrence’s death, has Eltham changed?","bodyText":"Cheryl Clarke is still seething that Stephen Lawrence was granted special treatment, as she sees it. Gesticulating towards the bustling street where the black teenager was murdered 25 years ago today, Clarke says: “A Paki – an Indian boy – was stabbed down there just days after Stephen and he never got a plaque. Why is he the only one? What about all the others who’ve died around here and who never got a plaque?” The Stephen Lawrence memorial stone, flanked on Friday by fresh bouquets and single flowers, is set into the pavement on Well Hall Road in Eltham, south-east London. After nightfall on 22 April 1993 a gang of five or six white men strutted across the road towards Lawrence shouting: “What – what, nigger?” and plunged a knife into the chest of the 18-year-old aspiring architect. For some who live in the neighbouring estate, the death rankles primarily because it compelled British society to change its attitudes to race. “They call us white honkys, but if anything happens or you say anything you get called a racist,” says Clarke, clutching a can of energy drink. “Someone threw white paint on the plaque and a white person got blamed – but it was a black who did it.” The 48-year-old is standing outside her sister’s home on Scarsbrook Road within Eltham’s Brooks estate, the orderly grid of postwar terracing and semi-detached housing where four of the five men accused of killing Lawrence lived close to each other. In 2011 the Old Bailey heard how Lawrence unwittingly provoked the suspects by simply being a black man on their “manor”. Back then their “manor” was homogeneous, dominated by members of the white working class, bordered by the unrelenting traffic of Well Hall Road where it becomes part of the South Circular road on the stretch where Lawrence was murdered. The estate’s demographic, much like the city stretched out to its north, has changed profoundly since Lawrence’s killers were spotted running into its streets after 10.30pm on a night that has framed the debate on UK race relations since. Now black and Asian households outnumber the area’s white population, according to residents. One black teenager, asked if he was afraid of walking through the estate at night, says: “Nope, it’s more like the other way round – you’d be scared if you are white.” John Lowman, a retired newsagent, says the estate’s racial profile has changed steadily over the past two and a half decades. “It wasn’t like when they were moving blacks from Walthamstow to Dagenham in the 70s – then it was: ‘Blimey, you’ve got a lot of blacks around here’,” the 70-year-old says. “Here it was gradual. People steadily moved in from different cultures. The area is completely changed compared with how it was 25 years ago.” Several doors along from Clarke is Victor, a 52-year-old British Nigerian who pauses from laying a patio in the sunshine to explain that he has never experienced racism in his 10 years on the estate. “It’s nice around here,” he says. “I feel totally safe.” Others feel the same. Trainee filmmaker Nathaniel Callender has been living on the eastern periphery of the estate for 12 months and also never experienced or witnessed any bigotry. “It’s lovely. People are very friendly,” he says. “If we treat others like equals, if we are open to different cultures, that will inspire people. We are all human,” adds the 23-year-old, standing close to the entrance of Dickson Road, the street down which the Lawrence suspects were seen heading in the moments after the attack. Nearby stands the St Thomas More Catholic primary school. One of its teachers is sitting outside eating lunch. “I wear a headscarf and haven’t encountered much racism around here, although there are pockets,” says Monica (not her real name). However the 40-year-old identifies one variable that she feels has recently toxified sentiment on the estate. “Brexit has had a very negative impact,” she says. “It’s given people the right to say things like: ‘Go back to your own country.’” Speaking above the din of the playground, full of faces that reflect the increasing multiculturalism of the estate, Monica is concerned that attitudes are slipping back to the era when Lawrence was attacked on the pavement 300 metres away. “From my experience it’s like we’re going back to the 1980s when, growing up in Bracknell [Berkshire], we had our door kicked in, eggs thrown at us. These days it’s of a different type, more inadvertent. But social media means more people are involved,” she says. Charlie Davis, the councillor for Eltham North, who was born the year after the murder, believes the area has an outlook and makeup in keeping with much of the capital. “It’s like any area in London, very diverse, although probably more green than inner London,” he says. Statistically the diversity of the Brook estate is reflected in census figures for its ward, Eltham West, which incorporates 3,859 homes holding 10,399 people. Of these 6,839 are classified as white British and 3,560 as black and minority ethnic – 34.2% compared with around 40% for London as a whole. The unemployment rate – poverty is frequently classified as a driver of discrimination – is slightly higher than the national average, with a third of its working-age population – 2,514 – economically inactive, higher than the current UK rate of 21.2%. Measuring the actual level of hate crime at local level is harder, as the Metropolitan Police only provides data at borough level. For Greenwich, which incorporates the Brook estate, 1,089 religious and race hate crime offences were reported in the two years to February 2018, significantly higher than the 741 offences recorded in Barking and Dagenham to its north, but significantly less than the 1,626 in neighbouring Tower Hamlets. Other types of crime are a concern on Brook estate. Eltham police station has closed and Clarke, still holding her energy drink, says too few officers patrol the estate. “In terms of crime it’s more blacks than whites – drugs, mainly,” she says. As she speaks, an elderly black resident walks past down Scarsbrook Road. “You see how it’s changing?” adds Clarke. “That’s two of them who’ve passed since we been chatting.” The man offers a greeting. Clarke turns and shouts: “Good day to you.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/apr/22/county-cricket-yorkshire-v-notts-somerset-v-worcs-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T15:55:39Z","webTitle":"County cricket: Yorkshire v Notts, Somerset beat Worcs and more – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/apr/22/county-cricket-yorkshire-v-notts-somerset-v-worcs-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/apr/22/county-cricket-yorkshire-v-notts-somerset-v-worcs-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"County cricket: Yorkshire v Notts, Somerset beat Worcs and more – as it happened","bodyText":"Yorkshire have the breakthrough. Steven Mullaney hit three fours off Jack Brooks in the first over before being trapped lbw by Ben Coad at the start of the fourth, leaving the score at 21-1. Lancashire are nine down at Chelmsford and still 74 runs away from their target. Jamie Porter and Simon Harmer have taken a couple of quick wickets to dampen fears of a Red Rose heist. In Division Two, Middlesex are 4-0 chasing 442 at Derby. Luis Reece finished 157 not out for the Peakites in their second innings. Notts have been set a target of 403, with Yorkshire bowled out for 334. Tim Bresnan and Ben Coad (career best 33) shared 77 for the tenth wicket, although I would suggest the hosts batted on for about an hour too long. The light isn’t fantastic here, so I’d surprised if we see all of the 37 overs remaining in the day. We have reached tea, with Stuart Broad bowling to the baseball mitt in the middle ahead of his brief county stint over the next few weeks. Meanwhile, at Chelmsford, Lancashire are making a game of it. Chasing that 320, they are 233-7 having been 195-7. Jordan Clark and Joe Mennie are frustrating the champions, with the former 49 not out. That run out at Taunton is the source of some controversy since it transpired that Renshaws foot was beyond the boundary when he picked the ball up before sending in his howitzer throw. Yorkshire are still building their lead here. At 280-9, they are 348 ahead with Tim Bresnan and Ben Coad having shared 23 for the last wicket. Bresnan, on his way to 35 not out, even struck a pigeon at deep cover. The good news is that the feathered little fella is ok and still in situ. Somerset have won by 83 runs at Taunton. The seamers did the damage though the final wicket was a comic /tragicomic run-out just. Steve Magoffin, hampered by a dodgy hamstring failed to get back for a second run, which would normally have been a canter. Matt Renshaw’s throw was perfect and Leach removed the bails. The tail had started to torment Somerset. But they have now posted a victory in their first match of the season for the first time since 2012. Yorkshire’s lead is approaching 320 with two wickets left. Tim Bresnan is playing a useful hand for the hosts. The morning rain has given way to bright afternoon sunshine, much like it was first thing this morning at around 9am. At Chelmsford, Lancashire look to be a long way from home at 164/5 in pursuit of 320. Dane Vilas and Jordan Clark are in the early teens and need something special. In Division Two, Luis Reece has an unbeaten century for Derbyshire against Middlesex, but Ben Slater has just been dismissed for 99. Three quick wickets for Harry Gurney has given Notts some hope. He has trapped Jack Leaning and Andrew Hodd lbw, both playing around deliveries from the left-arm around angle, while Gary Ballance played on for 81. Yorkshire are now 204-7, leading by 272 with Tim Bresnan and Josh Shaw at the crease. I’d still like to wager that Yorkshire have got enough even now, though. Lunch around the circuit and Lancashire seem to have steadied somewhat in their chase of 320 at Essex and are still in it at 84/2 having been two down for 30-odd. Lions duo Liam Livingstone and Alex Davies are leading the recovery. Worcestershire are 85/6 in their pursuit of 279 to beat Somerset at Taunton, with Lewis Gregory taking three of the wickets to fall. That looks a thankless task for the Pears. Surrey’s lead is up to 409 over Hampshire with four wickets still in hand at the Oval. Here at Headingley, we are set for a 1.25pm resumption, with 18 overs lost – 76.4 remaining in the day. In Division Two, Derbyshire are still firmly on top against Middlesex at the County Ground. Openers Slater and Reece have unbeaten fifties, with the lead up to 279. Glamorgan lead Gloucestershire by 172 with three second-innings wickets in hand. That looks a belter of a game at Bristol. Leicestershire are replying strongly to Sussex’s 438/8 declared with 222/3. South African Colin Ackermann is unbeaten on 115, while Northants are heading for defeat against Warwickshire - 99/4 and still 166 behind in their second innings. Despite losing Tim Groenewald to the second ball of the day to set a victory target of 279, Somerset have enjoyed a productive morning at Taunton taking six Worcestershire wickets. Even though the pitch is not so green now there is still movement for the seamers. But perhaps the most surprising element has been the bounce and pace available from this surface – live green grass tends to assist that at Taunton. Lewis Gregory, who is subject to a 28 day approach, which has prompted some murmuring in these parts, bowled a fine first spell. He sent two of Daryl Mitchell’s stumps flying (middle and off) to the delight of alert photographers. Then he surprised Joe Clarke with an in-ducker. Clarke was lbw, disgruntled and remains devoid of runs at the start of a summer when opportunity is knocking. Meanwhile D’Oliveira was lbw to Davey and Travis Head wafted and edged against Groenewald. The sole blemish from a Somerset perspective came when Trescothick, at second slip, dropped Tom Fell on 30. He was surprised by the pace of the ball but this was not a costly miss. Soon after George Rhodes was well snaffled by Renshaw at third slip off Groenewald. Then Gregory returned to dismiss Fell lbw with the last ball before lunch. So far Jack Leach has not even contemplated warming up. 85-6. More weather frustration for Yorkshire, who can’t seem to shake it this summer. It is raining pretty heavily at present, with press box colleagues suggesting it could do for the next couple of hours at least. Lancashire have just lost a second wicket at Chelmsford, with Keaton Jennings falling to Peter Siddle - 32/2 now. Ben Foakes has just gone down at the Oval for 81. Olly Pope is still there unbeaten on 80, with Surrey 304/5 and leading Hampshire by 368. More rain at Headingley I’m afraid, and I think this could be a longer delay. There was just enough time for Gary Ballance and Jack Leaning to secure their century partnership for the fifth wicket. Ballance has 81 and it has a feeling of groundhog day as far as he’s concerned...you know the drill, scores runs for Yorkshire, hype surrounds an England Test call, goes wrong when he gets one and back to the first point we go. We are set for a start at Headingley, 20 minutes late, although play will commence under floodlights. I’d be very surprised if we get the full 96 overs in. Lancashire have lost an early wicket in their pursuit of 320, Haseeb Hameed bowled by Jamie Porter for one. Lancs 11-1 in the forth over. Porter mustn’t be far away from an England call, surely. We are poised at Taunton under hazy sunshine and the wary Somerset locals are noting 1) The pitch is suddenly not so green 2) In a similar game at the start of last year Essex knocked off 255 with no trouble and an Alastair Cook 100 3) Somerset have not won their first game of the season since 2012 … but the bookies probably have Somerset as favourites. Here they come. Anyway it should be a fascinating day here … The morning sunshine at Headingley has given way to dark clouds and a bit of rain, meaning a delayed start to day three. … where Yorkshire are in control against Nottinghamshire, writes Graham Hardcastle. This third morning could bring a century for Gary Ballance, who resumes on 76 with his side leading by 257 in their second innings at 189/4. At Chelmsford, Essex are also in a strong position having set Lancashire a target of 320. Interesting overnight quotes from James Foster, however: “I’m not sure if it’s going to be a winning total. I think it’s a good score, but I still feel we have to bowl exceptionally well. They’re a very good side, a very good batting line-up.” In Division One, all the home sides are ahead and looking good for victories. At Taunton, Vic will see Somerset resume their second innings on 255/9, leading Worcestershire by 278. James Hildreth is unbeaten on 111. At the Oval, Surrey are 217/4 second time around, leading Hampshire 281. Ben Foakes, a one to watch candidate this summer, has 50 not out. Down a division and five games in progress became four yesterday with Kent’s dismantling of Durham at Chester-le-Street. Derbyshire are on course to spring a surprise over Middlesex. They are 118/0 in their second innings, a lead of 226, as they search for a first home Championship win since September 2014. Glamorgan’s Shaun Marsh scored his second successive Championship century as they press ahead in their first innings against Gloucestershire (296/5 in reply to 236). He posted one on his last appearance for Yorkshire against Surrey last September. He was an option to return to Headingley before Glamorgan offered him a two-year contract, with the length of deal significant. Sussex and Leicestershire are in the midst of a high-scoring contest at Grace Road, including a century for Sussex’s Michael Burgess on his return to his former stomping ground and a maiden career half-century for Ishant Sharma. Leicester will begin on 112/2 in reply to 438/8 declared. Finally, at Wantage Road, Northants have work to do to avoid defeat against Warwickshire. They will resume their second innings on 41/0, trailing by 225. After a disappointing summer last year, their are positive signs for the Bears, with a first-innings century for Tim Ambrose. Ben Duckett is at the crease unbeaten on 10.

The 33-1 winner provided an important boost to his trainer, Rebecca Curtis, who is on the way towards rebuilding her stable after a difficult couple of years. Lavishing praise on his mount in the moments immediately after the photo finish result was announced, Wedge said: “He stuck his head out like an absolute lion for me. I could feel Bellsy getting to me all the way and he’s absolutely tried his heart out.” It is a career peak for Wedge, who must have been cursing his luck seven days earlier, when he was knocked out of Buywise’s saddle at an early stage of the Grand National. Wedge attracted unwanted attention on New Year’s Day when he missed a fence he should have jumped at Exeter and was disqualified on what would otherwise have been an easy winner. Coincidentally Bellamy got himself into hot water on the same day, failing a breath test for alcohol at Cheltenham, despite having cut short his New Year celebrations before midnight. Curtis, who had Grade One winners at the Cheltenham Festival in 2013 and 2014, has evidently lost some support in recent years and her reduced team of horses has yielded only nine winners this season. This result is a timely advert for the skills of the Welsh trainer, as well as a happy introduction to Scotland, which she had never previously visited. “I own a quarter of him,” Curtis said. “I bought him quite cheaply out of John Ferguson’s sale. He had broken down on both his front legs. I took a chance with him and thankfully he’s won a big race. It’s paid off.” The 29-year-old George Scott can dream of 2,000 Guineas glory in his fourth season with a trainer’s licence, having saddled James Garfield to land Newbury’s Greenham Stakes. He can also hope for the support of a considerably more experienced jockey, as Frankie Dettori pronounced himself “free at the moment” to take the ride in the Newmarket Classic next month, having pushed the colt to success over Expert Eye here. “Frankie is keen to go to the Guineas and he’s the man who knows most about this,” Scott said. “So I don’t see why not.” He added that James Garfield would “come on” for this run. “He’s quite a stuffy horse. I think anyone who saw him in the paddock, he was fit today. We’ve got a couple of weeks to freshen him up and that should be enough time. But he’s just so tenacious. He’s got a wonderful attitude.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/22/observer-view-on-theresa-mays-hateful-hostile-environment-immigration-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T05:06:13Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on Theresa May’s hateful ‘hostile environment’ immigration policy | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/22/observer-view-on-theresa-mays-hateful-hostile-environment-immigration-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/22/observer-view-on-theresa-mays-hateful-hostile-environment-immigration-policy","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on Theresa May’s hateful ‘hostile environment’ immigration policy","bodyText":"History will judge Theresa May harshly. In recent weeks, the appalling stories about the impact of the government’s “hostile environment” policy reported by our sister paper, the Guardian, have continued to grow in number. They paint a shocking picture of a Kafkaesque state that has denied people who came to the UK from the Commonwealth as children their rightful entitlement to work, to housing and to healthcare. May has maintained these are people who have been wrongly caught up in her 2013 decision as home secretary to create a “really hostile environment” for people living in Britain illegally. But their tragic stories are the direct consequence of a policy so punitive that it would inevitably make life intolerable for legal British residents. People without a passport are now being required to provide an absurd level of proof – four pieces of documentary evidence for each year of residence – of their legal status. Without this, they can no longer work, rent a home, open a bank account or access NHS care and may be detained and threatened with deportation. Doctors, bank clerks and landlords have become obliged to snoop on their fellow citizens by checking up on their immigration status. The government has doggedly pursued a hostile environment as a cheap alternative to investing in the border force and a functioning programme of exit checks. But leave the rhetoric aside and there is no evidence it is effective in encouraging people in Britain illegally to leave; the number of voluntary departures has actually fallen from its peak in 2013. What it has achieved, however, is seeding discrimination: research has found that requiring landlords to check people’s papers makes them less likely to rent to people with foreign accents or names. May’s initial response when the Windrush generation cases were first raised can only be described as callous. When Jeremy Corbyn wrote to her to raise the case of Albert Thompson, a man who moved to Britain from Jamaica as a child and whose mother worked as a nurse, but who has now been refused radiotherapy on the NHS, she first refused to intervene. Downing Street initially turned down a formal request to meet from 12 representatives of Caribbean countries. It has taken May months since the Guardian first reported on these cases to offer reassurances that the situation will be resolved for the Windrush generation and that they will be offered compensation. This does not go far enough. A wider group of lives is being blighted by the hostile environment. One case is that of Jay, a young black person born in the UK and taken into care as a baby and who was refused a passport. A state that was in loco parentis to him for almost 18 years threatened to deport him to a country he’d never even visited as an adult. Other children have lost their right to apply for British citizenship when they turned 18 because local authorities did not secure their citizenship while they were in their care. There are countless other casualties of the hostile environment, such as families separated from their children because of the Home Office’s harsh rules. Those who become caught up in this are confronted with a cruel Home Office bureaucracy that operates outside the principles of natural justice. Officials are incentivised to reject applications for the tiniest of technical errors; immigration application fees are so high they are generating profits of up to 800% for the state, and there is no longer any right of appeal or legal aid available in most types of immigration cases. Children as young as 10 who were born in the UK are subjected to a “good character” test when they apply for citizenship; if they have been cautioned, their application can be refused. The hostile environment will also have huge ramifications in the context of Brexit. EU citizens who have a right to remain in Britain but who cannot afford to secure the necessary papers will become similarly ensnared. We can expect EU leaders watching this crisis unfold to insist rightly on more robust guarantees for their citizens as a result. Both the prime minister and the home secretary, Amber Rudd, must accept full responsibility. Rudd’s attempt to pass the buck to officials for implementing government policy last week was utterly disingenuous. But it was Theresa May who was responsible for developing this approach while she was home secretary. Were she still in that post, her position would have been untenable. It is not enough to address the plight of the affected members of the Windrush generation. The government must dismantle the hostile environment altogether and restore a sense of natural justice to the immigration system; this should include relaxing its evidence requirements and slashing its application fees. Nobody who has grown up in Britain should be denied citizenship."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"info/live/2018/apr/23/guardian-digital-hackday-april-2018","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"info","sectionName":"Info","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T15:33:15Z","webTitle":"Guardian Digital Hackday - April 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/info/live/2018/apr/23/guardian-digital-hackday-april-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/info/live/2018/apr/23/guardian-digital-hackday-april-2018","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Digital Hackday - April 2018","bodyText":"Dear Reader, Oh what a journey something something I’ve learned so much something something incredible experience something yadda yadda let’s face it this was never about me and my personal validation as an unparalleled wordsmith. This was all about YOU. Yes you! Our digital stars. Congratulations to all the winners and to all those who worked to make sure these two days went off without a hitch. It was an amazing 48 hours filled with laughter, trials and tribulations, blood, sweat and tears and all manner of other idioms. To quote one Amy Poehler, It’s very hard to have ideas. It’s very hard to put yourself out there, it’s very hard to be vulnerable, but those people who do that are the dreamers, the thinkers and the creators. They are the magic people of the world. To everyone who participated in the Hackday, you are all magic! -Rasha Special thanks to Michael and Jon who gave my fingers a break at the end there. You rock! Mark Ottaway, Antonio Favata, Sophie Lambrakis, Anna Leach, Shermaine Waugh and Shehani Fernando with ‘See your AiR’! The amazing augmented reality hack to show the state of the air around us Paul and John for their Patron’s hack. The hats sealed it Scott Painter. Who did something, I can’t remember what. But well done! Dana! For her attempts to make the news sing. We heard the results, it was horrifying. So well deserved! Being the classy guy he is, Adam is foregoing the puns, and is instead thanking all those who have put huge amounts of effort into organising the hackday. And of course, the amazing Rasha for writing this blog (she’s not writing this block, so this isn’t shameless self promotion) Audience participation please: What will be more shocking, MC Adam’s jokes, or the winners? Answers on a postcard And that’s it for presentations. Everyone is furiously voting (speedily, not angrily). We should have results in a few short minutes... The suspense is outrageous. There’s even a Penguin trophy 50,000 page views a week to some cover letter examples! Incredible but true. How could we help to track such long-tail content? Sia, Mariot, Regis, Peter have been diving into the data lake to find them. Over 1,000 page views a week, over 3 weeks old: it goes into the dashboard. It doesn’t work yet but looks promising. A few years ago The Guardian built Ophan to do up-to-the-minute analytics for content. If this one doesn’t get called Slowphan I’ll eat my hat. Jon is presenting without slides or even a laptop! Despite appearing to be from the past he’s talking about how people could be able to file copy via email in the future. “It doesn’t work, I haven’t finished it”. Spirit of hackday right there. The website must load faster. So says Santiago and everyone agrees. Useful tips on how to optimise for first meaningful paint. Good size reductions and fighting webpack bugs. Good hackday stuff. A hack with a snappy name?! I’m game. Paul and Leigh-Anne are looking to empower people to get involved and make a difference: Signing petitions on change.org Emailing your MP Volunteering near you It’s all context sensitive to the page you’re looking at. Attributing sources is hard but luckily Jonny and Tom are here. They’ve hacked an attribution menu into our CMS, automatically extracting the names from the quotes. With just a little bit of data we can get more visibility on gender bias in sources as well as making it easier to get in touch with a variety of different sources. Nice. Jordan is up - recreating app crosswords for the year 2018. Brand new programming language, multiplayer support. It’s impressive stuff. Simon has been working on adding a dyslexia friendly font, low contrast mode and night mode. The lights go out during the night mode demo. Coincidence or carefully planned? The whole lot has been synced up to our preferences. Slick. Alex takes us on a deep-dive of the current state of screen-reader tools. Time to go in-depth on some of our site accessibility efforts. This is a 6 minute presentation, hold on to your boots. Yesterday they set up a road-show with a few exercises to understand more about screen-readers, keyboard navigation and more. Plenty more work to be done and lots of excitement in the room to get started. Gwyn has been working on adding Man of the Match voting into live reports. You also get notifications about who wins. Traditional football action with a Guardian spin. Nice! Phil and Mat have a problem. They also have a long-standing bug bear with the website. You see a smashing cartoon and can’t wait to see more. Standing in your way is your old nemesis, the browser back button. Simply adding a forward and back button to the full-screen view and Phil is away browsing cartoons. We suspect he is still browsing. Shaun is up next! He’s been working with the News Wise crew at the Guardian Foundation to build a mini version of our very own front page editor. It’s impressive stuff, even at 800x600 resolution and the presentation ends with a powerful photoshop image. The news is in, Shaun’s been hacking Simon is a man on a mission. That mission is to win “most cables used in a single hack 2018”. You never know which Today programme presenter will wake you up in the morning. For Simon, this lottery is unacceptable. Using a frankly irresponsible contraption formed of a Raspberry Pi, an Alexa and a literal software-controlled DAB radio - humanity now has the tools to parse the presenter name and avoid turning on the radio entirely if it’s fronted by “you know who”. All in the room agreed, the world has changed today. Colin is up next! It is a truth universally acknowledged that when you know you’re on one website, it can be incredibly perplexing when you click on a video link and it takes you directly to a completely different website. How can you ever find your way back? Well fear no more! Colin has the answer. He has made it possible to click on a link and, voilà!, it opens into a completely new tab. You never have to feel lost again. Time to take a look at the Patron page. Paul and John think it needs some TLC. Or at least patron does. As a patron I may want a personal thank you for my donation. Why not? I deserve one! So what happens? Well as soon as my payment goes through I can choose to get a phone call from a journalist at the Guardian to personally thank me for my support. Wow how lovely! I’m feeling the warm fuzzy the love. Q&amp;A Everywhere! Thomas has created a web brower extension to answer the burning questions you get after reading an article. We serve lots of Q&amp;A snippets on the Guardian website, but what if you could get the use of them on any other website? Thomas’ extension checks when there is a relevant Guardian Q&amp;A when you view content elsewhere, and shows you all the answers. For example if you read an article that lists 128 new tariffs that the US has imposed on China. You’re only likely to get 3 or 4. But gosh darn-it you want to know all the other 124! By using this extension you can click on a wee Q&amp;A button that will appear in the article and BAM! You now know all. Could the way you donate to the Guardian be simpler? At the moment it takes far too many clicks and key presses to make a quick speedy, small contribution. Joe has found a way to reduce the time it takes to donate from minutes to mere seconds! He runs us through the procedure. Joe bravely goes for the live demo approach; time for some tense music (Bourne Identity soundtrack, classy). Music intensifies. Yes! Success! Quick contributions are no longer the stuff of dreams Elvis who was working on the World Cup is sure the Guardian can do a better, more engaging job of reporting on the football to involve and include all fans from the frenzied to the ‘meh’. How do you this? Well how about start dropping some hardcore super cool facts that have nothing to do with football? Have you ever wondered if the speed of a football shot can match the speed of a train? Is it a burning question in the back of your mind as you watch the players go back and forth? Elvis has your answer. Our first presentation is Susie. She was the happy programmer working on the News Comparison for kids! How did Susie get on? Ah yes it works! Well done Susie. Here we go! It begins. Time for presentations. Adam MCing and looking swish in his navy blue blazer. Award for Most Stylish MC to you Adam. T-minus 15 minutes till the presentations and the awards! I am terribly saddened that I couldn’t get round to everyone in the last 2 days. I know there were quite a few more ideas floating around and being hacked to high heaven and they all deserve to shine in the spotlight. All I can say now is good luck to all and happy presenting! The awards ceremony approaches. Who else can I quickly accost? Perhaps a final update from Jon? His journey sure felt like a rollercoaster ride and I have to know how it ended. Yeah it doesn’t work. Gah. As crushing an end as that of Titanic. Jon abandons his idea just as Jack abandons the idea that both he and Rose could fit on that door. Right, I now nervously approach Phil praying that his idea will be a little easier to digest. Lucky me, it is! Apparently there is a serious ‘Next’ button shortage on the Guardian website, something that sounds pretty concerning and like it should be urgently addressed. Phil is currently focusing on the cartoon page. It appears once you click to view a certain cartoon, it is not possible to view the next one automatically without going back to the main page first. A positively shocking revelation that has left this humble blogger shaken to her very core. But Phil is very reassuring. He plans to change all that. Soon one will be able to skim through all the cartoons that their hearts desire by the click of the one button. Thank you Phil. Absolutely revolutionary stuff. We need more people like you in the world. The downside of being back on home turf today is everyone is a lot more scattered and I’m not just figuratively prowling anymore. Hmm… Aha! I see one! Tall, dark and debonair, it is Jorge and I’m sure he’s working on something incredibly interesting. 3 minutes later Jorge is trying very hard to explain his idea to me in a way that won’t hurt my brain. He needs a moment to formulate his explanation. More minutes tick by Crickets. …. Wait no, he’s found the words! …. Yeah ok so it’s very technical. VERY. Technical. But whatever it is it’ll hopefully mean less work for Jorge. Yay! Shehani, Shermaine, Anna, Mark, Sophie and Antonio are a mouthful. And for good reason. They are tackling a biggie, Air Pollution! Gasp. So what’s the idea? Well they are creating an iOS app that will help the user visualise, in real time, the air pollution around them in an Augmented Reality setting. ‘Ew who really wants to see that?’ you may ask but newsflash folks, right now pollution is the 4th highest cause of death worldwide. Holy Moly! Did you know this?! Personally I think this should drive a full blown bloody uprising but right now their goal is a little bit more modest. They want to raise awareness and engage with the users to help them find ways to decrease their exposure where possible for a healthier lifestyle. This idea sounds like a breath of fresh of air. Vive la révolution! Hey Kids! Are you interested in the news? Are you after a more critical view of the world? Would you like more comprehensive access to articles from the serious to the absurd? Then Susie has just the thing for you! It’s all about making sure you get the most inclusive view on a subject you possibly can when looking up stories online. The goal of this website is to help kids easily perceive the contrast between different news agencies around the world today, help them form a more critical analysis of any specific story and ultimately shape a more healthy world view. Susie’s flatmate Anna (a full-fledged adult) comments, I think I’d actually use that. High praise indeed. Here’s what it could look like: Good morning! Intermission over and today we are back at Guardian central for our 2nd and final day of our first Hackday of 2018. What other exciting ideas is our digitastic crew working on and who will be showered with accolades later this afternoon? Time to go back on the prowl and find out. And on that note it appears we have reached intermission. Stay tuned for our next and final installments tomorrow where we will find out about some more hacks and, among other things, if Dana has something to sing about, can dyslexics now truly rejoice, did Jon actually get anywhere, and who will win all the awards??! Dum dum duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuum! And back to Jon, progress? Better than earlier I will go that far That’s more like it Jon. On my way back from the loo I have passed by Simon and Jamie. They were the ones tackling accessibility earlier today. I thought it best to check if they had achieved any of their goals so far and so they have. They have now created the Accessibility button on the website with a dropdown of the options on the front page and have implemented ‘Low Contrast Mode’ which turns the background a soft yellow. During their research for this idea, they came across this scientific study which suggests that if you have dyslexia then using a creamy yellow background with black text helps. Simon says, It looked scientific when I read it. As before, positively inspiring words from Simon. Team Evergreen – Punchy name but no it’s nothing to do with the environment. It’s more about keeping old articles ‘forever alive’. They very graciously and patiently explained their goal to me. Honestly, there was some technical talk involving meta-data, whereupon my brain dissolved slightly through my nose but I did gather the big picture. It is all about monitoring user traffic and bringing readership to old stories that look to have long term value, keeping them relevant, and up to date where possible. In group member Siamak’s words its, About recognising the content that lives beyond the news cycle Moving stuff. Just ran into Dana in the pink jumper. Has she figured out how to get a Guardian article into the Top 40 Billboard charts? Ummmm… Not quite yet. She’s hitting a lot of roadblocks. What the iOS system allows you to do with speech is apparently very limited. You certainly can’t sustain a note or change its characteristics. She’s now trying to make a Mac app which has more audio options and flexibility. She’s definitely not singin’ the blues yet. Stop the presses! I just spotted Elvis! He’s alive!... and working at the… Guardian?! Who would have known? Well turns out he’s also working on the World Cup and he wants to make sure all you not-really-a-football-fan fans can feel included too. His idea is to lure you in with some super interesting statistics (no no stay with me this is good) like how far have players run through the match. That number will then be compared to, for example, the length of Central Park in New York. This could then lead you to an article on the top 10 books about the miscarriages of justice where the number 1 book is The Central Park Five. Get it now? Pretty Neat! Football fan? Want to feel a bit more involved? Desperately want to scream at someone (besides the television) who you think played better than the rest? Well despair no more! Gwyn, the man with the digital department’s most stylish shirts, is working on something for the upcoming World Cup! The idea is called ‘Man of the Match.’ As the game is being played, 10 minutes before the end, the Guardian editor writing the blog will select 4 players who he thinks have performed the best. The user will sign up to get a notification when voting is open. Then, you guessed it, they vote for who they think is the best. At the end of the game the winner is Man of the Match. It’ll look a little something like this: I told Gwyn I feel this is going create much ‘debate’ amongst fans and that’s apparently the point! Next, we check in with Jon. How is his automation dream proceeding? Jon says, Er, it’s not working at the moment... Don’t give up Jon. So remember Paul and Leigh-Anne? They were working on getting people more actively involved in the big issues. Concerned about the use of plastics? Air pollution? Where you get your eggs? At the end of an article they want to offer readers a concrete action or set of actions they can take to help make a difference and, at the same time, link them up with the relevant representatives, organisations and support groups. Right now they’re tackling some fundamental hurdles, one of which is, how the Guardian should best act as a middle man. Can we ultimately be 100% objective in our drive to make information available to the readers or will the ‘views of the Guardian’ make us lean towards certain issues or organisations above others? Hmmmmmmmm. Special shout out to the Tiny Laptop. No banana on hand for scale, sadly, but hopefully the coffee mug and Adam’s normal sized hands (seen here modelling some luscious lime nail polish) will suffice. I just spotted post-its! And diagrams! So I had to ask Nathan, Sarah, Calvin and Priscilla to ‘help’ me understand them. And turns out they are the perfect group to ask. They’re actually working on the Guardian help page to reformat and revamp its looks and functions. Right now its confusing, difficult to navigate and not very user friendly. We all agree that’s not the best 3 ways to describe a help page. I’ve come across Jon, another loner. His idea is to have a more automated procedure for journalists submitting their work via email to reduce some of the workload for our subeditors. Jon thinks it’s too boring to blog about but I disagree. Whilst not as exciting as singing articles, his is an example of one of the more practical ideas that can really make a difference and improve productivity. Jon’s idea has just ignited a hot debate between his fellow coworkers seated near him about email and security. Let’s keep an eye on how Jon may or may not solve this conundrum. Dana is a lone wolf. Her idea revolves around Text to Speech on the iOS app of the Guardian and she wants to do something a little bit fun with it. Dana is a little bit shy about her end goal as she’s not quite convinced it’s going to work. With some more coaxing though she reveals she wants to have the articles sing in the end. Now that is definitely fun! You can do it Dana, I believe in you! My first duo are Paul and Leigh-Anne who are working on an idea that would make it easier and more accessible for people to actively participate in the issues they care about. Still at the conceptual stage, I will check back on them a little later to see how they plan to achieve this goal. Near them are Jamie and Co who are interested in promoting all round better accessibility. How about a drop down menu on the website where users can select options such as high contrast mode, night mode, reduced animation and the like? Simon says, We might end up with a design that is better than the actual website. Bold words Simon! Good morning all! And what a beautiful morning it is to be at Amazon headquarters where our digital department is currently congregating. We will be spending the day putting our heads together to solve all the world’s problems! Or at least come up with some pretty cool hacks.

The actor, who played the Duke of Edinburgh opposite Foy’s Queen Elizabeth II, said efforts need to be made to create a level playing field. Speaking to the Hollywood Reporter, he said: “Claire is one of my best friends, and I believe that we should be paid equally and fairly and there should be equality for all. “I support her completely, and I’m pleased that it was resolved and they made amends for it because that’s what needed to happen. “Going forward, I think we should all bear in mind that we need to strive to make this better and a more even playing field for everyone involved – but not just in our industry, in all industries.” Last month at a television conference in Israel, The Crown’s producers, Left Bank Pictures, revealed that Smith earned more than Foy for his work on the show. After a petition, which called for Netflix and Smith to “make up for this sexist pay gap by donating the difference in their paycheques to the Time’s Up legal defence fund for sexual harassment and abuse victims”, Left Bank issued an apology to both actors. The statement said: “We want to apologise to both Claire Foy and to Matt Smith, brilliant actors and friends, who have found themselves at the centre of a media storm this week through no fault of their own. “As the producers of The Crown, we at Left Bank Pictures are responsible for budgets and salaries; the actors are not aware of who gets what, and cannot be held personally responsible for the pay of their colleagues.” Foy told Entertainment Weekly that she was surprised by the news. “I’m surprised because I’m at the centre of it, and anything that I’m at the centre of like that is very very odd, and feels very very out of [the] ordinary,” Foy said. “But I’m not [surprised about the interest in the story] in the sense that it was a female-led drama. I’m not surprised that people saw [the story] and went: ‘Oh, that’s a bit odd.’ But I know that Matt feels the same [way] that I do, that it’s odd to find yourself at the centre [of a story] that you didn’t particularly ask for.” Foy and Smith played the royal couple for the first two series of the show, but will be replaced by Olivia Colman and Tobias Menzies for the third series which is currently in development."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/apr/23/how-was-your-weekend-running","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T08:03:51Z","webTitle":"How was your weekend running?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/apr/23/how-was-your-weekend-running","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/apr/23/how-was-your-weekend-running","fields":{"headline":"How was your weekend running?","bodyText":"Yesterday was my fifth London Marathon and I’ve never seen the course like that: walkers from as early as 10k, so many collapsed runners by the side of the road I lost count (and hope, fervently, they are all ok). From the cold, windy deluge at Boston, to the hottest London marathon in six days: I’m not sure who angered the gods of marathon running recently, but whoever it was, please apologise and make the appropriate carbohydrate-based offering to appease them. Otherwise the next World Major will take place in an ice storm... The support was, as always, incredible - and the weather perfect for spectating. For running, however, it was far too hot. To go from training runs in under 10 degrees to racing in that was asking too much for most. I know an awful lot of people who took on 26.2 yesterday and of them, I can think of one single person who achieved their goal and got a PB: hats off to my friend Maria, who did it on her birthday to boot. Every single other person (ok, possibly excluding Mo Farah) was a country mile - or more - off their targets. I know people aiming for sub 2:40hrs who scraped under 3hrs. People aiming for sub 3hrs who came home half an hour or more after that. And every single one of them should be proud. It’s all very well saying that some races have been hotter, that people from warm climates have an advantage, but there is a reason that the optimum temperature for running - wherever you come from, wherever you train - is a good 12 degrees lower than it was yesterday. To battle through that, and come home with a medal is an achievement to be proud of, never mind that the numbers aren’t what you wanted. Marathons are unkind: the pros know that if it’s not their day, they drop out before 30k and live to race another in the near future. Us foot soldiers slog on, destroying ourselves in pursuit of a small bit of a medal on a ribbon to hang round our necks. But hey, if it was easy, the beer wouldn’t taste so good ... So, congratulations to all of you. And particularly to our very own Tara. I had the privilege of running with her yesterday and I know how early on she started to feel the heat and the effort - the body is trying so hard to dissipate heat, it just can’t sustain what would normally be a comfortable pace. There are races you run for time and feel proud of yourself for achieving them. Then there are the battles. They last for hours, hours in which you could, at any minute, just stop. And yet she didn’t: not once. That is, in my book, every bit as much of an achievement. Getting a PB is a victory lap, but finishing a race like that is surviving a war of attrition, and those medals are the ones you really earn. It might not feel like it on the Mall, but give it time and you start to realise that what you did makes you tougher, stronger and more resilient than you were the day before.

I was 13 when Verne Troyer hit our screens as Mini-Me in Austin Powers sequel The Spy Who Shagged Me. The character was a compound of stereotypes of people with dwarfism. He was hypersexual, unintelligent and aggressive. He was not even a character in his own right but a replica of another, average height role. Like dwarf performers in circuses of days past, his character only existed in contrast to others. In one scene, Mini-Me appears in a sling strapped to Mike Myers’ chest, like an infant. In the follow-up film, Goldmember, another character threatens to eat him because he “looks like a baby”. Throughout the series he serves as Dr Evil’s biddable pet. I imagine few who watched it know that in the past aristocrats and monarchs often “kept” dwarf people like this – abusing, ridiculing, and, sometimes, even killing them. Worst of all was the way the films turned violence towards dwarf bodies into a spectacle for comedy. Re-watching clips while writing this article, I felt sick at the sight of Myers’ foot smashing into Troyer’s 2ft 8in body – seeing it crumple against the wall. From Roman times, when dwarf people were forced to fight each other, to dwarf wrestling today, violence towards dwarf bodies has served as entertainment for average height, able-bodied audiences (often including children). I imagine few who laughed at such scenes know that studies show around 12% of people with dwarfism – including this author – have experienced physical violence because of our bodies. Nearly 80% have received verbal abuse. The Spy Who Shagged Me would later go on to gross more than $300m worldwide. It was nominated for and won numerous awards. Yet it did huge damage to our struggles not just for positive representations, but for equality and respect more generally. The film is almost 20 years old yet I, and no doubt many like me, still hear strangers’ shouts of “Mini-Me!” as we go about our daily lives. Troyer died on Saturday. He was just 49 years old. A statement on his Facebook page, said he had struggled with “his own battles” but that “unfortunately, this time was too much”. While no cause of death was formally announced, “depression and suicide”, the statement noted, “are very serious issues”. Sadly, depression and suicide are too common in dwarfism communities. Among those who participated in academic research, more than a third reported experiencing mental health problems. Loneliness and isolation are not unusual. Over the years, several actors with dwarfism have killed themselves, including David Rappaport and Hervé Villechaize. In her powerful article Little People, Big Depression, Rebecca Cokley reflects on how news of Rappaport’s passing affected her as a young girl and remembers her own friends with dwarfism who died too young and too soon. “I don’t think that a majority of my community are depressed because they’re little people,” she writes, “however I have no doubt that society’s objectification of little people adds insult to injury (literally) and can push folks over the edge.” Soon after news of Troyer’s death appeared on Twitter, the pathetic and vile jokes began. Even in death, his body marks him as a target for ridicule. Ignorant still but much less malicious were comments that he was “bigger than [insert height here]”, “a small guy but had a big heart”, or “a big man in a tiny package”, and so on. Such remarks, commonly used by the media, propagate assumptions that dwarfism is something negative for which we have to compensate through our achievements or character. As Cokley points out, it is often in death that average height and able-bodied people easily erase an individual’s disability or difference – as demonstrated by the recent passing of Professor Stephen Hawking – to claim they were “larger than life” or are “finally free from their disability”. I hate the character Mini-Me – the replica, the biddable pet, the victim of violence made to appear funny. But I was moved and saddened to hear of Verne Troyer’s passing and to learn more about his struggles. I am thinking of those who knew and loved him, those he knew and loved, those who now have an empty space in their life. It should not take the death of a member of the dwarfism community to prompt a sincere and meaningful discussion about the prejudice and discrimination many dwarf and disabled people face in their everyday lives. But it is a discussion we really need to have. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

The latest fortnightly survey of 1,026 voters finds that 54% of the sample believe Australia’s rate of population growth is too fast – which is up from 45% recorded five years ago. A higher percentage, 64%, think the level of immigration in Australia over the past decade has been too high – up from 50% recorded in October 2016. But while the trend underscores increasing community concern about immigration and population growth, 55% of the sample agree with the proposition that “multiculturalism and cultural diversity has enriched the social and economic lives of all Australians”. The statement “multiculturalism has failed and caused social division and dangerous extremism in Australia” was endorsed by 32%, while 13% did not have a view. The latest survey indicates the current concern is broadly based. A majority of all voting groups, apart from the Greens, believe that population growth is happening too fast, and more than 60% of Coalition and Labor voters think there has been too much immigration over the past decade. Opposition to the current level of immigration was higher among people over 45 than people under 45, although majority opposition was recorded in both groups. Supporters of multiculturalism were more likely to be under 35, Greens supporters and university educated, while detractors were more likely to be over 65 and proposing to support a political group other than the major parties. Voters were asked this fortnight to express a view about temporary and permanent migration, as well as short-term entrants. Forty-seven per cent believed there should be fewer short-term working visas and 46% were in favour of fewer permanent refugees. There was less concern about short-term student visas (39%), short-term working holiday visas (38%) and short-term business visas (36%). These categories are significant contributors to the higher number of foreigners currently in the country. There has been an influx of foreign students, with 200,000 more in the country than there were three years ago. A majority (63%) believed that foreign workers on short-term visas undermined the capacity of Australians to get a job and also agreed with the proposition – advanced by politicians including the former prime minister Tony Abbott – that the big cities can’t cope with further population growth, and immigration should be wound back until the necessary infrastructure is put in place (62%). A majority (61%) said they believed that “overall” immigration had made a positive contribution to Australian society but a majority (55%) also agreed with the statement immigration should be slowed as it causes too much change to our society. While there is a wealth of expert evidence that immigration boosts economic growth, a majority (51%) rejected that proposition, and also rejected the proposition that “Australia has the space and resources to cope with a much larger population”. Respondents were asked to rate the top-three problems facing Australia’s major cities and the list was housing affordability pushing people to the fringes, lack of government investment in infrastructure like roads and public transport and a lack of employment opportunities in the regions, driving people to the cities. Voters were also asked to nominate the most pressing issues the Turnbull government needed to address over the next 12 months. The top rated concerns were cost of living (51%), improving the health system (36%), creating jobs and reducing unemployment (32%), and housing affordability (29%). Labor voters were more preoccupied with improving the wages outlook and Coalition voters with reducing the deficit and boosting economic growth. Greens voters were more likely to think tax avoidance by big companies (29%), promoting renewable energy (49%) and more funds for education (28%) were important, while “other” voters were more likely to nominate cost of living (57%), national security and terrorism (34%) and reducing the budget deficit (22%) as priorities. The latest survey continues to point to a Labor victory in any federal election held today. Labor was ahead of the Coalition on the two-party preferred measure 53% to 47%, which is the same as the result recorded two weeks ago. Immigration has loomed as something of a flashpoint and a fault line within Coalition ranks over recent weeks as possible successors to Malcolm Turnbull have publicly signalled their leadership ambitions over the longer term. Abbott has been campaigning for months to cut the immigration rate, presenting the idea an effective means of product differentiation with the Coalition’s political opponents. On Monday, the former prime minister told 2GB: “I think people are worried about current record levels of immigration. “We’re adding a city the size of Adelaide to our population every five years, and I think that we should significantly scale it back at least until infrastructure, housing stocks and integration have caught up, because just at the moment there is no doubt that high levels of immigration, record levels, are putting downward pressure on wages, upward pressure on housing prices, and they’re making our roads almost impassable.” As well as Abbott’s relentless front running, in the week where Turnbull recorded his 30th consecutive negative Newspoll result, a story appeared in the Australian indicating that the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, had favoured a cut in the immigration rate. Publication of the story triggered a public difference of opinion between Dutton and Turnbull, sparked by the prime minister denying emphatically that an internal discussion had taken place on the issue. Turnbull and the treasurer, Scott Morrison – another conservative who has signalled a desire to lead the Liberal party in time – have been holding the line on immigration, arguing the permanent and skilled intake is currently running below the cap, and Australia needs the influx of people to boost economic growth. Some government conservatives believe that telegraphing a cut to immigration would be politically popular and could help turn around the government’s political fortunes. But Turnbull and Morrison have thus far rebuffed populist incursions, emphasising new investments in infrastructure as a way of easing congestion in the major cities and ensuring services keep up with population growth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/apr/23/australian-clothing-brands-wont-commit-to-garment-workers-safety","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T07:08:37Z","webTitle":"Australian clothing brands won't commit to garment workers' safety","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/23/australian-clothing-brands-wont-commit-to-garment-workers-safety","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/apr/23/australian-clothing-brands-wont-commit-to-garment-workers-safety","fields":{"headline":"Australian clothing brands won't commit to garment workers' safety","bodyText":"A group of well-known Australian clothing brands has failed to sign a crucial accord protecting garment workers in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster, according to Oxfam. Tuesday marks the fifth anniversary of the Rana Plaza collapse, Bangladesh’s worst industrial disaster. The building housed five garment factories supplying global clothing brands, and 1,135 people were killed when it fell. The tragedy sharpened the world’s focus on the appalling conditions endured by garment workers in Bangladesh and elsewhere, and put public pressure on western brands to do more to ensure safety and labour rights in their supply chains. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon It led to the development of the accord on fire and building safety in Bangladesh, an independent, legally binding agreement between brands and trade unions to protect workers. So far, the accord covers 1,600 factories, 767 of which have mostly completed safety remediation. The accord has 222 signatory companies and is estimated to cover 2 million workers. The agreement also gives greater legal power to workers to ensure brands are protecting them. Earlier this year, the accord was used by garment worker unions to reach a landmark $2.3m settlement with a multinational apparel brand accused of delays in remedying life-threatening hazards at its factories. The previous accord, struck in 2013, is about to expire, and brands have another month to sign the 2018 agreement. But Oxfam and an alliance of 13 Australian organisations say a number of well-known Australian brands are dragging their feet. Among the businesses that did not sign the last accord and are yet to sign the 2018 accord are the Just Group, which includes Just Jeans and Peter Alexander, and Fast Future, incorporating Valley Girl and Temt. Others that have signed neither agreement included Best and Less, Myer, and Country Road. Noni-B, Workwear Group and Licensing Essentials signed last year’s accord but were yet to agree to this year’s, Oxfam said. The Oxfam Australia chief executive, Helen Szoke, urged the companies to live up to their responsibilities to workers. “Signing the accord is about ensuring the absolute basics in the rights of more than two million garment workers – more than 70% of whom are women – in Bangladesh,” she said. “While safety concerns persist in some Bangladesh garment factories, the accord has had a real impact. This is just one step in tackling the appalling treatment of workers, with a growing call for increased transparency and the payment of living wages to allow them to break the cycle of poverty.” Those who signed the last accord include APG and Co, Designworks Clothing Company Pty Limited, Cotton on Group, Forever New, K-Mart Australia, Licensing Essentials Pty Ltd, Noni B, Pacific Brands, Specialty Fashions Australia, Target Australia, Woolworths Australia and Workwear Group Pty Ltd.

Welcome to our world","bodyText":"It’s been excellent entertainment observing certain sections of the commentariat over the past week circle their settler wagons around yet another day that is becoming increasingly sacrosanct in the mythos of Australia’s nationhood. Particularly after the rise in public support already this year for a more honest and inclusive construction of the national narrative. Further agitating commentators such as Steve Price and Karl Stefanovic is the encroachment of consumer culture into the nether recesses and up the plinths, cenotaphs and poles of everything we hold sacred. I refer, of course, to Anzac Day, but there is another significant anniversary this week. For those unaware, Sunday 29 April is the commemoration of Lieutenant James Cook sailing into Botany Bay in 1770. Recent examinations of these dates in relation to Australia’s preferred representation of its national character have been inspired. Last week in a National Press Club address, Man Booker prize winning novelist Richard Flanagan seared several sacred cows of Australia’s national sensibility. And the historian Mark McKenna has also taken a hot pin to numerous bloated cultural conceits in his Quarterly Essay titled Moment Of Truth. No doubt Quadrant magazine has an armoury of apoplectic, scorn-enriched columns on standby. So it goes in the history wars, lest we forget. You will hear a lot about Aboriginal resistance on the frontier this week. And rightly so. It began with the arrival of Cook’s exploration party, and it is patently inexcusable that “the cult of Anzac”, as Flanagan described it, continues to wilfully exclude the sacrifices and massacres of our First Nations soldiers. In recent years, there has been incremental improvement on this front but even the battle for that modest recognition has had to be fought tooth and nail. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday Every year, as the dawn service gets underway, as the Anzac processions march the streets of cities, towns and villages across the continent, as the crowds stand stony-faced and reverent to the plaintive strains of the Last Post, I invariably find myself wondering how many of the people in attendance have, at any time during their lives, thought or said that Aboriginal political dissidents should just “get over it”. And in response I ask, what does it matter that the superhero film, The Avengers: Infinity War opens on Wednesday? Welcome to our world. I, for one, welcome our new Marvel overlords. Price and Stefanovic cry that it is an insult to “our” traditions. Well, I recall a similar “grubby cash grab”, as Stefanovic described the decision to release the film on 25 April, sweeping into the institution of Good Friday around two decades ago. As many people remonstrated at that decision to “open” the most sacred – and previously the most boring – of Christian holy days, I stood and applauded. Wonderful stuff, I thought then and stand by that position today. It wasn’t an intrusion on “our” society’s values. Enough of the hypocrisy. Open the markets! Open the stadium gates for the footy! Open the cinemas! Open the detention centres! Open the formation of Australia’s national identity to new influences and criticisms too. We’ve all witnessed the retaliations on Scott McIntyre and Yassmin Abdel-Magied in the past couple of years for their critiques of the peculiar fanaticism that has permeated the commemoration of the Anzacs since around the mid-1990s. Should I be threatened with similar reprisals, I reiterate that I do attend Anzac Day services and indeed respect the sacrifices of our diggers. There is a history of soldiering in my family. But I also realise that the Anzac “spirit” has been exploited by a litany of preening politicians to curry a notion of national legitimacy among otherwise politically indifferent and economically disaffected constituencies. I look around at the crowd during welcome to country ceremonies too. What do I see? Non-Indigenous people diving head-first into their smartphones. When I am at the front of the room delivering an acknowledgement of country, I see the courteous smiles tighten and the eyes glaze over. Some Aboriginal people have upped the ante whenever presented with the opportunity to address a gathering. They forcefully drive home truths about our dispossession and our ongoing resistance to colonialism. These expressions are generally followed by pointed declarations of sovereignty. I’ve given that kind of delivery a run but have come to realise that it too is readily disregarded. A sinister glow instantly illuminates a wall of detached faces. After some consideration, I decided the elders who concocted these ideas were much savvier than I am. These ceremonies are not polite gestures, nor defiant statements, but shrewd provocations. They are mechanisms that oblige you to position yourself in relation to acts of barbarity. And that situation confers new responsibilities upon you. You either become woke, as the kids say; or remain complicit in the perpetuation of an increasingly wretched cover-up. And that is something that the spirit of our ancestors, our diggers and our marvellous cinematic superheroes spurn in the name of justice. • Jack Latimore is a Goori writer and researcher based in Melbourne • Comments are pre-moderated to ensure the discussion is about topics that have been addressed in this article"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/22/mohamed-salah-pfa-player-of-year","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T22:17:27Z","webTitle":"Mohamed Salah and Fran Kirby named PFA players of the year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/22/mohamed-salah-pfa-player-of-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/22/mohamed-salah-pfa-player-of-year","fields":{"headline":"Mohamed Salah and Fran Kirby named PFA players of the year","bodyText":"Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah has been named as the Professional Footballers’ Association player of the year for the 2017-18 season. The Egypt international saw off competition from the Manchester City trio of Kevin De Bruyne, Leroy Sané and David Silva to become the second African player to win the award after Riyad Mahrez of Leicester in 2016. Tottenham’s Harry Kane came third, with De Bruyne second. Salah, who moved to Anfield from Roma last June for a club record fee of £36.9m, has scored 41 goals in his debut season as Jürgen Klopp’s side have reached the semi-finals of the Champions League. Salah was presented with the award at the Grosvenor Hotel in London on Sunday evening, with City’s winger Sané voted as young player of the year. “It’s an honour to win this award especially because it was voted for by the other players,” said Salah. “I would like to thank my team-mates and everyone at the club for helping me to make this happen.” Asked what it meant to become the first Egyptian to win the award, he said: “Hopefully I’m not the last one. I’m very proud to win and I’ve worked very hard.” Fran Kirby, who played in Chelsea’s 3-1 defeat in the first leg of the Women’s Champions League semi-final on Sunday, won the women’s player of the year award. Bristol City’s Lauren Hemp was named young player of the year. The PFA’s Merit award went posthumously to Cyrille Regis, the former West Brom forward who died aged 59 in January. The award was recognition of Regis’ pioneering role in changing attitudes towards black footballers in England. While not unexpected given his stunning debut season at Anfield, Salah faced strong competition from the Belgium international De Bruyne, who has been the standout player for the champions. Speaking after their 5-0 victory over Swansea on Sunday, Manchester City’s manager, Pep Guardiola, had backed his midfielder for the award. “If he doesn’t win, then congrats to the guy that wins,” he said. “But in my opinion there is no player better than him in terms of continuity, every three days, competitions, three days. Maybe the numbers say someone is better than him but this season there has been no one better than him. That’s my opinion but players can have another one. But in the end, in the summertime, we will be at home being champions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/23/coalition-narrows-gap-newspoll-government-31st-loss","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T22:07:50Z","webTitle":"Coalition narrows gap in latest Newspoll as PM defends resisting banking inquiry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/23/coalition-narrows-gap-newspoll-government-31st-loss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/23/coalition-narrows-gap-newspoll-government-31st-loss","fields":{"headline":"Coalition narrows gap in latest Newspoll as PM defends resisting banking inquiry","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull has admitted the Coalition made a “political mistake” by refusing to set up a royal commission into banks for so long but has defended the decision, arguing it helped put “customers first”. Turnbull’s attempt to staunch criticism of the government’s delay comes as the Coalition has recovered in the Newspoll, trailing Labor by 49% to 51% in two-party-preferred terms, its best position since September 2016. Labor has demanded the government establish a compensation scheme for victims of banking misconduct, attempting to seize the initiative as Turnbull government ministers including the financial services minister, Kelly O’Dwyer, struggle to deal with the fallout of the royal commission’s revelations after just three weeks of hearings. At a press conference in Berlin overnight Turnbull conceded in hindsight that “politically, we would’ve been better off setting one up earlier”. “But as it is turned out, I think we put customers first,” he said. Turnbull argued the Coalition had introduced measures to protect customers and the banks would have argued against them on the basis no reforms should be undertaken until the commission had reported back. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “You know, whichever way you want to analysis it, you can’t live your life backwards. I made the call and I take responsibility.” The Coalition’s performance has come under intense scrutiny because a fortnight ago Turnbull recorded his 30th consecutive Newspoll defeat, passing the marker he set for Tony Abbott as one reason to challenge his leadership. The one-point recovery to 49-51 in Monday’s poll is within its 2.5% margin of error and preferences were the difference, with the primary votes of the Coalition and Labor remaining unchanged on 38% and 37%. Turnbull’s satisfaction rating jumped from 32% to 36%, while 53% of respondents said they were dissatisfied with his performance, down from 57%. Bill Shorten’s satisfaction rating also rose slightly, from 32% to 34%, and dissatisfaction with the Labor leader fell from 57% to 54%. Turnbull remained preferred prime minister at 38% to Shorten’s 35%. Turnbull was in Europe for much of the period when the poll was taken, attending the Commonwealth heads of government meeting and preparing for Anzac Day events. The political fortnight since the last poll has been dominated by the shocking revelations at the banking royal commission and a messy debate within the Coalition about whether it had discussed potential cuts to the immigration rate. Among respondents to the Newspoll, 56% said the immigration rate was too high, compared with 28% who said it was about right and 10% who said it was too low. Turnbull’s limited admission on banks comes as Bill Shorten raises the stakes by calling for the government to offer a full apology. In a letter to Turnbull the opposition leader said an extension for the inquiry, an apology and compensation scheme were the “least the government can do”. The former prime minister Tony Abbott and former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce have both admitted they were wrong to oppose the royal commission into Australia’s financial sector, after revelations AMP repeatedly lied to the regulator and the Commonwealth Bank continued to charge fees to clients who had died were uncovered by the commission. The heads of Australia’s biggest banks have also apologised for both the conduct and fighting the inquiry. Senior government ministers have refused to concede it was wrong in principle to oppose the royal commission. On Sunday O’Dwyer repeatedly deflected questions on the point and defended the delay by telling ABC’s Insiders the government had acted in a “sober and deliberate” manner. Later, Joyce told ABC that O’Dwyer should have ditched “speaking notes” and taken responsibility for government decisions. “I know where Kelly is. She’s got the talking points. ‘These are your speaking notes, say this’,” Joyce said. “Screw them up, throw them away, and speak down the barrel [of the camera] about what’s the truth. This is wrong, we’re going to deal with it, I take responsibility for it, I’m going to act on it and next question.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/22/gary-ballance-yorkshire-nottinghamshire","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T19:17:51Z","webTitle":"Gary Ballance sends Yorkshire to verge of win against Nottinghamshire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/22/gary-ballance-yorkshire-nottinghamshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/22/gary-ballance-yorkshire-nottinghamshire","fields":{"headline":"Gary Ballance sends Yorkshire to verge of win against Nottinghamshire","bodyText":"This third day, albeit one interrupted by morning rain, had the sense of revisiting recent glories for Yorkshire, who charged towards a first win of 2018 over newly promoted Nottinghamshire with eight evening wickets, having set them a highly unlikely target of 403. When the White Rose won back-to-back Championship titles in 2014 and 2015, and even challenged Middlesex in 2016, they ground sides down with ruthless cricket – often a buzzphrase of their coach at the time, Jason Gillespie. Last year that approach was missing, particularly with the bat, as they narrowly escaped relegation. Throughout the winter their current coach, Andrew Gale, and director of cricket, Martyn Moxon, have repeatedly spoken about the need for that to return. So they will have been thrilled to see it reap reward during this dominant day, highlighted by a measured 82 for the captain, Gary Ballance, and Tim Bresnan’s unbeaten 68. It was Brenan’s highest score since a brilliant 142 during the final game of 2016, the Championship title decider against Middlesex at Lord’s. Yorkshire began the day on 189 for four in their second innings, leading by 257, with Ballance and Jack Leaning (37) completing a fifth-wicket partnership of 103 shortly after lunch. That stand was the glaring example of returning determination. During the second half of the afternoon, Bresnan shared a 10th-wicket stand of 77 with Ben Coad, who posted a career-best 33, to take the lead beyond reach. Bresnan even struck a pigeon at deep cover during his innings. Yet Notts had their moments. Shortly after lunch, the in-form left-arm seamer Harry Gurney struck three times in 10 balls to reduce the score from 198 for four to 204 for seven, including Ballance playing on to middle stump. Later Chris Read’s replacement behind the stumps, Tom Moores, took two outstanding one-handed catches leaping high to his right to help Luke Fletcher and Jake Ball remove the tail-enders Josh Shaw and Jack Brooks. All those days catching balls with the help of the back garden trampoline and his father have certainly come in useful. Notts then started their chase on the front foot despite losing their captain, Steven Mullaney, lbw to Coad in the fourth over. Mullaney had hit three boundaries in the first over off Brooks before Jake Libby hit two off Coad in the second. The scoring rate remained good but they lost a flurry of wickets before the close, Coad finishing the day with four. They slipped from 101 for three to 151 for seven inside nine overs, with the extra half-hour taken. They begin day four on 181 for eight. Gregory does the damage in Somerset’s flying start For the first time since 2012 Somerset have started their season with a Championship victory. It was achieved without a wicket being taken by a spinner, which has rarely been the case in recent times. Jack Leach, now of England, bowled 10 balls in the match. Somerset’s seamers, spearheaded by Lewis Gregory, did the damage as Worcestershire were bowled out for 195, 84 runs short of their target. Gregory took vital wickets at the start of the innings. He sent two stumps flying out of the ground when dispatching Daryl Mitchell. He surprised Joe Clarke with an in-ducker, which followed several away-swingers, to gain a leg-before decision. Clarke, highly rated and a regular Lion, has, like many young batsmen, struggled for runs after two matches this spring. Gregory also disposed of Tom Fell just before lunch. The pacemen accounted for 39 of the wickets to fall in the match; there was one controversial run-out. The game began on an emerald green surface, which day by day faded. Most laudably the pitch retained its pace throughout so that the edges comfortably reached the slip cordon. On two occasions the ball arrived so quickly that Marcus Trescothick at second slip was unable to hold on to the type of catch he habitually gobbles up. Gregory’s main ally was the veteran Tim Groenewald, who found the outside edge of at least three different bats – he was also the victim of two dropped catches since the keeper, Steve Davies was also fallible. Josh Davey, who does not excite the needle of the speed radar a great deal, picked up two wickets. Meanwhile Craig Overton, the fastest and most celebrated of Somerset’s pacemen, had to wait the longest for his solitary victim, Josh Tongue. Pace, like spin, was not an essential asset on this surface to the frustration of those trying to improve the England team. This was Worcestershire’s second defeat of the season, an outcome that was a travesty for their young all-rounder, Ed Barnard, who had a brilliant game. He took 11 for 89. In Worcestershire’s first innings he hit a half-century and was out selflessly heaving when batting with his No 11. In the second he top-scored with an unbeaten 45. “Ed has slipped under the radar a bit,” said his captain, Joe Leach. “He is the real deal. He looked every inch a batter in this game along with his 11 wickets.” The match ended with some controversy and confusion. The last man Steve Magoffin, struggling with a tight hamstring, was run out by a brilliant throw from the cover boundary by Matt Renshaw, Somerset’s replacement for Cameron Bancroft as an overseas player. But it became apparent after Magoffin had been given out that Renshaw’s foot had been beyond the boundary when he threw the ball. Joe Leach dealt with this adroitly after a handy half-hour cooling-off period. “We were not overly happy. But that’s the game; we have to move on. Realistically it probably did not make a difference but there have been some improbable last-wicket partnerships.” He also acknowledged the impact of so many dropped catches when his side was in the field. James Hildreth, the outstanding English batsman on view, was dropped four times while scoring 159 runs in the match. The confusion came from Somerset. It was announced at a members’ meeting on Thursday evening that Lewis Gregory had been the subject of a 28-day approach from another county – his contract is up at the end of the season. “That’s news to me,” Gregory said, adding he was “passionate about the club”. Jason Kerr, the new first-team coach, said: “I’d be tapping him up if I was with another county.” Bowling as he did in this game will surely assist him in any contract negotiations.

The most significant came when peers voted by a majority of 71 to keep most of the EU charter of fundamental rights in domestic law after Brexit. They backed an amendment tabled by the crossbencher Lord Pannick which was supported by Labour and the Lib Dems. Proposing his amendment, Pannick said that to exclude a number of important EU rights from domestic law would lead to a lack of certainty and continuity, providing a “recipe for confusion” after Brexit. He went on: I fear the government is seeking to make an exception for rights under the charter because the government is suspicious of the very concept of fundamental rights ... This bill should not be used as an excuse to reduce the legal rights which we all enjoy against the state. The government then suffered two further defeats, by majorities of 50 and 57, as peers voted to retain the right of action in domestic law after Brexit in the event of failure to comply with the general principles of EU law. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, has pledged that the Windrush generation will be granted British citizenship, as the government attempted to draw a line under the scandal. A claim from the UK’s City minister that the EU is softening its opposition to giving the country’s financial services sector a special Brexit deal has been dismissed in Brussels. That’s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Here is how Labour is explaining the impact of the two Beith/Pannick amendments. The government has suffered its third defeat of the night in the Lords on the EU withdrawal bill. Amendment 19 (see 7.02pm) was approved by 280 votes to 223 - a majority of 57. Peers are now voting on a third amendment. This is amendment 19, another tabled by the crossbencher Lord Pannick and the Lib Dem Lord Beith. It backs up amendment 18 (see 6.48pm) by removing a paragraph from the bill clarifying the terms under which the bill would let ministers make regulations specifying in what circumstances retained EU law could be challenged in court after Brexit. You can read all the bill documents, including the text of the bill and the wording of all amendments, here. The government has been defeated again. The Beith amendment (see 6.48pm) was passed by 285 votes to 235 - a majority of 50. Peers are now voting on another amendment to the EU withdrawal bill. It is amendment 18, tabled by the Lib Dem peer Lord Beith and by Lord Pannick, the cross-bencher. It would remove a section from the bill giving ministers the power to make regulations specifying in what circumstances retained EU law can be challenged in court after Brexit. This is from HuffPost’s Paul Waugh. Here are the voting figures in the Lords division. There were 10 Conservative rebels. Here are the key extracts from Amber Rudd’s statement in the Commons about the Windrush migrants. Rudd, the home secretary, explained the measures she was taking to guarantee Windrush migrants cost-free British citizenship. I want to enable the Windrush generation to acquire the status that they deserve – British citizenship – quickly, at no cost and with proactive assistance through the process. First, I will waive the citizenship fee for anyone in the Windrush generation who wishes to apply for citizenship. This applies to those who have no current documentation, and also to those who have it. Second, I will waive the requirement to carry out a Knowledge of Language and Life in the UK test. Third, the children of the Windrush generation who are in the UK will in most cases are British citizens. However, where that is not the case and they need to apply for naturalisation, I shall waive the fee. Fourth, I will ensure that those who made their lives here but have now retired to their country of origin, are able to come back to the UK. Again, I will waive the cost of any fees associated with this process and will work with our embassies and High Commissions to make sure people can easily access this offer. In effect this means anyone from the Windrush generation who now wants to become a British citizen will be able to do so. She said the Home Office would pay compensation to those people who have suffered loss. The state has let these people down. Travel documents denied, exclusions from returning to the UK, benefits cut, even threats of removal. This, to a group of people who came to help build this country. People who should be thanked. This has happened for some time. I will put this right and where people have suffered loss, they will be compensated. The Home Office will be setting up a new scheme to deliver this which will be run by an independent person. I will set out further details around its scope and how people will be able to access it in the coming weeks. She said officials would take a “generous” approach to help people get the documentation they needed. My officials are helping those concerned to prove their residence and they are taking a proactive and generous approach so they can easily establish their rights. We do not need to see definitive documentary proof of date of entry or of continuous residence. This is why the debate about registration slips and landing cards is misleading. Instead the caseworker will make a judgement based on all the circumstances of the case and on the balance of probabilities. Previously the burden of proof on some of the Windrush generation to evidence their legal rights was too much on the individual. And now we are working with this group in a much more proactive and personable way in order to help them. She said that a review of more than 4,000 cases had not found any evidence of anyone being wrongly deported and that another 4,000-odd cases are still being checked. The 1971 Immigration Act provides protection for this group if they have lived here for more than five years if they arrived in the country before 1973. And I am now checking all Home Office records going back to 2002 to verify that no one has been deported, in breach of this policy. This is a complex piece of work that involves manually checking thousands of records. So far, 4,200 records have been reviewed out of nearly 8000, which date back to 2002, and no cases have been identified which breach the protection granted under the 1971 Act. This is an ongoing piece of work and I want to be absolutely certain of the facts before I draw any conclusions. I will ensure the House is informed of any updates and I intend to have this data independently audited once my department has completed its work to ensure transparency. She claimed that the current problems facing Windrush migrants were caused by decisions taken by successive governments going back nearly 40 years. The Immigration Act 1971 provided that those here before it came into force should be treated as having been given indefinite leave to enter or remain in the UK, as well as retaining a right of abode for certain Commonwealth citizens. Although HMS Windrush docked in the Port of Tilbury in 1948, it is therefore everyone that arrived in the UK before 1973 who were given settlement rights and not required to get any specific documentation to prove these rights. Since 1973 many of this Windrush generation would have obtained documentation confirming their status or would have applied for citizenship and then a British passport. From the 1980s successive governments have introduced measures to combat illegal immigration. The first NHS treatment charges for overseas visitors and illegal migrants were introduced in 1982. Checks by employers on someone’s right to work were first introduced in 1997, measures on access to benefits in 1999, civil penalties for employing illegal migrants in 2008, and the most recent measures in the Immigration Acts of 2014 and 2016 introduced checks by landlords before property is rented and checks by banks on account holders. She paid tribute to the contribution of the Windrush generation. From the late 1940s to the early 1970s, many people came to this country from around the Commonwealth to make their lives here and help rebuild Britain after the war. All members of this House will have seen the recent heartbreaking stories of individuals who have been in this country for decades struggling to navigate an immigration system in a way they never, ever should have been. These people worked here for decades. In many cases they helped establish the National Health Service. They paid their taxes, enriched our culture. They are British in all but legal status and this should never have been allowed to happen. Both the Prime Minister and I have apologised to those affected and I am personally committed to resolving this situation with urgency and purpose. The government has just lost the EU withdrawal vote in the House of Lords. Peers voted by 316 votes to 245 - a majority of 71 - to keep most of EU charter of fundamental rights in domestic law. This is from Dawn Butler, the shadow equalities minister. She is highlighting the demands she was making last week, including for Windrush generation migrants affected by the scandal to have their full British citizenship assured. In the Lords peers are now voting keeping the EU charter of fundamental rights as part of domestic law. (See 4.13pm.) This is from the BBC’s Esther Webber. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, asks at what point this level of complacency becomes institutional racism. Rudd says she is sorry Roberts is interpreting this in that way. Labour’s Maria Eagle asks if people will still be required to produce four pieces of documentary evidence for every year they have been in the UK. Rudd says they won’t be. And she says that was not even the requirement before her announcement. She says, on a visit to the Croydon immigration centre, she asked staff if they previously required that level of documentation. And they said they didn’t, she says. These are from my colleague Amelia Gentleman, who broke the story about the scandal affecting the Windrush generation and who has led the reporting on this issue. This is from Satbir Singh, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. Labour’s Fiona Onasanya asks Rudd to confirm that the compensation scheme will cover loss of earnings, loss of benefits, legal fees, Home Office application fees, air fares and other costs. Rudd says there will be a consultation on what the compensation scheme should cover. Anna Soubry, a Conservative, says the Labour party as a whole did not vote against the Immigration Act. She acknowledges that Diane Abbott did, but the party as a whole did not, she says. She suggests that Labour is not being honest; these problems would have arisen whichever party was in charge, she suggests. In response, Rudd says she wants to be clear that she is not blaming anyone else. Philip Hollobone, a Conservative, says his constituents in Kettering respect the contribution of the Windrush generation but do want the government to keep cracking down on illegal immigration. Will Rudd assure him that she will continue to press on with that. Rudd says she will. She says the Labour party once produced mugs to show its commitment to curbing immigration. (That was before the 2015 general election. Under Jeremy Corbyn, the party’s approach has been different.) Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee, says she spoke to someone today turned away by the Home Office because they were from Kenya, not a Windrush migrant. There is widespread concern that there is cultural disbelief in the Home Office. People there do not accept that there is a link with the net migration target. Will Rudd get rid of that target? Rudd says she wants to help all Commonwealth migrants. As for the target, Rudd says she is going to resist the temptation to talk about that at the moment. The key point is the distinction between legal and illegal, she says. She says the problem here is that people here legally have been affected. The Labour MP David Lammy says everyone in the Caribbean because the British empire and others took them there under slavery. And he says that he and his parents have been in this country as British citizens. He says, when Amber Rudd says people can get British citizenship, she ignores the fact that they are citizens already. There are many other people in the same category, born under empire, he says. If the Commonwealth is to mean anything, it must mean that - common wealth. Rudd thanks Lammy for the work he has done on this issue. She appreciates it, she says. She says, as home secretary, she has to address the point about people’s legal status. She says the steps she is taking will affect all citizens from the Commonwealth. The SNP’s justice and home affairs spokeswoman Joanna Cherry says the problem was caused by the government’s “ludicrous immigration target” and its decision to create a hostile environment for immigrants. She says Rudd should not let Theresa May use her as a human shield. She urges Rudd to reject May’s approach, or to resign. Rudd says the problem has built over over successive governments. She defends the government’s decision to take action against illegal immigrants. The Labour MP David Lammy, one of the leading figures in the campaign for the rights of the Windrush generation, has posted this response on Twitter. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, is responding now. She says this has been one of the biggest scandals in home affairs for years. She says Rudd said this should not have been allowed to happen. But Rudd allowed it to happen. The home secretary has to understand that ultimately the buck stops with her. Abbott says this was forceable and it was foreseen. MPs tried to draw the government’s attention to it. The real problem was the 2014 Immigration Act. She and MPs like Jeremy Corbyn and David Lammy spoke and voted against this. The Act removed the exemption of Commonwealth migrants from deportation, she says. She says people who deprived of their family and friends. People were expected to produce four pieces of documentation for every year they were in the country. Who could have thought that was fair, she asks. She says some elements in the statement are welcome, like the waiving of fees and the waiving of the requirement to pass the citizenship test, even though some of these people would pass that test with flying colours. She says it would be easy to extend the protection that applied to Commonwealth citizens that existed before 2014. She says the compensation must not just be a token sum of money. It must properly compensate for the loss suffered. She asks where the extra staff for the Home Office unit will come from. Will they be new staff? She says, coming up behind the Windrush cohort, is a cohort from South Asia. They will be asked for four pieces of data too, and subject to the same amount of humiliation. Abbott says 500 people attended a meeting on this issue organised in the Commons last week. Rudd must understand how upset people from this generation feel. They feel it says something about how the government views this entire community. As a few MPs heckle, Abbott says some of them are saying “rubbish”. She says her parents’ generation had unparalleled commitment to his country. Some never took a day off work, she says. Rudd says none of these measures can undo the pain endured. But she says she hopes she can put things right. Rudd is now addressing compensation. Those affected must get the documents they need. But compensation must be addressed to. Some of these cases are “harrowing”, she says. The state has let these people down. Labour MPs shout: “You.” She says, where people have suffered loss, they will be compensated. The Home Office will set up a new scheme to pay compensation to those who have lost out, she says. It will be independently run. Rudd says she will consider if further measures need to be taken. Rudd says 4,200 cases have been reviewed. So far, no cases have come to light of people being unfairly deported, she says. But further cases are being reviewed. There are around 8,000 in total to be considered, she says. They are being manually checked. And she says she wants the process to be audited. Rudd says the Home Office is a great office of state. She says caseworkers will adopt a balance of probability test when deciding these cases. Rudd says these steps intended to combat illegal immigration have an an “unintended and sometimes devastating” effect on some Windrush migrants. Successive governments are to blame, she says. This provokes some jeering. She says some people just have indefinite leave to remain. That means, if they leave, they can be refused entry. Rudd says citizenship fee will be waived for anyone from Windrush generation who wants to apply for citizenship. The requirement to pass the citizenship test will be waived, she says. She says she will waive the fee for the naturalisation process. Rudd says she wants to explain how this happened. Everyone who arrived before 1973 given settlement rights did not require specific documentation. Since then many of these people would have applied for documentation. She says since the 1980s successive governments have introduced measures to combat illegal immigration. She lists several of them, starting with rules introduced in 1982. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, is giving her statement on the Windrush generation now. She says these people are British in all but legal status. The current situation should never have been allowed to happen, she says. She says she and Theresa May have apologised. Theresa May has announced that there will be an annual commemoration of the life of Stephen Lawrence on 22 April, known as Stephen Lawrence day. This is what she said at the service this afternoon to mark the 25th anniversary of his murder on 22 April 1993. For the past 25 years, Doreen and Neville have fought heroically to ensure that their son’s life and death will never be forgotten. Their dignity, their courage and their sheer determination are an inspiration to us all. We are privileged to be here today at this special final anniversary service to commemorate Stephen. But it is right that Stephen’s name and legacy lives on. In the run up to this service, I have spoken with Baroness Lawrence about how best to achieve this. And so, today, with Baroness Lawrence’s blessing, I can announce that the government will work with the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust to establish a national, annual commemoration of Stephen’s life and legacy, to take place on the 22nd of April each year: Stephen Lawrence Day. We will use this day to encourage and support young people in achieving their dreams, and to reflect on Stephen’s life, death and the positive change he has inspired. In the House of Lords peers have started debating amendment 15 to the EU withdrawal bill. A vote is due later this afternoon, and the government is expected to lose. This amendment, and some associated amendments, would ensure that most of the EU charter of fundamental rights remains part of domestic law after Brexit. They have been tabled by Lord Pannick, a crossbencher and barrister, Lord Goldsmith, the Labour former attorney general, Lady Ludford, a Lib Dem Brexit spokeswoman and Lord Deben (John Gummer), the Conservative former cabinet minister This is from the BBC’s Esther Webber. Cat Smith, the shadow minister for voter engagement, is responding to Chloe Smith’s statement. She says the voter ID pilots in England are unlike the system operating in Northern Ireland. Referring to the concerns about the policy raised by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (see yesterday’s Observer), she asks if the pilots are compliant with human rights law. She asks for an assurance that none of the Windrush-generation migrants will be disenfranchised by the new system. And she urges the government to drop the pilots. Smith responds. She says she has replied to the EHRC, and she says the pilot scheme does comply with the European convention on human rights. She says the Windrush generation are not being disenfranchised. But she says there will be a statement on Windrush later, and so she will not say more now. She says she thinks Labour are implying that electoral fraud is not worth tackling. Quoting a letter written to her local paper, she says Labour are concerned about losing votes. Chloe Smith, the Cabinet Office minister, is now responding to the urgent question about the voter ID pilots at the local elections. (See 12.44pm.) She says electoral fraud is not a victimless crime. People’s votes get stolen, she says. She says people get asked for ID in other circumstances, such as when they collect a parcel, and that it is reasonable to ask for ID when people vote. Voter ID rules have been introduced in Northern Ireland. There was no evidence turnout fell, she says. But there is evidence that electoral fraud fell sharply. She says it was Labour that introduced voter ID requirements in Northern Ireland. She says the government does not want to see democracy dumbed down. The Times’ Patrick Kidd has suggested a possible explanation for John Bercow’s decision to let defence questions over-run. (See 3.25pm.) This is from the Press Association’s Ian Jones. This is the cryptic comment that John Bercow, the Commons speaker, came out with a moment ago. (See 3.25pm.) Colleagues needn’t worry. Their questions will be reached. But the chair has to react to the development of events, to which I and some colleagues are privy, and others are not. And if you weren’t already confused, you will now be. John Bercow, the Speaker, has just assured MPs trying to ask a question at defence questions that they will get their chance. He will let the session run beyond 3.30pm, he implied. Then he said something cryptic about he and other MPs being privy to some knowledge that other people did not know about. Perhaps he was just referring to the fact that the minister responding to the urgent question is running late? Or perhaps something else is afoot? We’ll find out soon. NFU Scotland has put out a statement saying it is disappointed to see that the government is continuing to rule out staying in the customs union. (See 12.39pm.) Scott Walker, its chief executive, said: Trade with Europe is important to us, as are the trade agreements that Europe already has in place with countries around the world. Continued membership of the customs union would allow us to keep frictionless free trade with Europe while allowing us access to important world markets on terms that recognise the importance of maintaining domestic food production. Australia, New Zealand and the USA are all countries that the UK government has indicated as post-Brexit target markets for free trade agreements and all will wish increased market access for their food producers on their terms. Farming in this country must not be sold out for an ideological view. We remain adamant that any Brexit outcome that results in the UK importing cheaper food would be hugely damaging to the farming, food and drinks sectors of Scotland and the UK. Sucking in food imports also means exporting jobs and incomes in the domestic farming and food supply chain, as well as animal welfare and environmental responsibilities beyond our shores. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, will be responding to the Amber Rudd statement, which is now due at about 4.15pm (because of the urgent question coming first). With the government committed to offering victims of the Windrush generation some compensation, Abbott expresses scepticism about how effective this will be. On her Twitter feed Abbott also points out that she was warning about the impact of tighter immigration controls on Windrush-generation migrants who are in the UK legally four years ago. She was one of only a handful of Labour MPs who voted against May’s immigration bill in 2014. (Jeremy Corbyn was another.) And the Financial Times columnist Gideon Rachman has written a good column about the customs union issue too (paywall). The best bit comes at the end. It is this situation [the refusal of leading Tory Brexiters to accept compromise on the customs union] that led one leading British political analyst to predict to me recently that Brexit will not happen because “there is no version of Brexit that can get a parliamentary majority”. Yet similarly informed people looking at the same facts come to very different conclusions. Charles Grant, head of the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank, reckons the chances of stopping Brexit are now less than 5 per cent. A couple of prominent remainer MPs with whom I’ve discussed the issue put the odds of stopping Brexit at between 20 per cent and 40 per cent. With so many informed people arriving at such wildly divergent conclusions, my own conclusion is that nobody really knows. There are just too many uncertainties. So hardline remainers should not give up yet. The whole situation reminds me of an old joke about a horse-trainer serving a mad Russian tsar. One day the tsar insists that the trainer must make his favourite horse talk within the year — or face execution. The trainer instantly agrees to make the horse talk. When his friends warn him that he has taken on an impossible task, he replies: “A lot can happen in a year — the tsar might die, I might die, the horse might die. Or the horse might talk.” It is just under a year until Brexit. Remainers should not give up hope. The horse might talk. This is from Sky’s Darren McCaffrey. Dominic Grieve, of course, is the Conservative former attorney general and one of the Tories who has signed an amendment to the trade bill saying staying in the customs union should be an objective of government policy. The BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, has written a useful blog unpicking the ‘customs union/confidence vote’ kerfuffle. “Lots of things can be true at the same time, even though they seem to contradict each other,” she writes - a helpful maxim for journalists everywhere. Here is an excerpt. Yes, it is true that a powerful group of Brexiteers believe that they have been told by No 10, that any effort to water down the government’s position on the Customs Union would be treated as a vote of confidence, to bring rebel Remainers to heel. This is in the context not of this week’s vote, which would not have any power to force a change of heart, but a vote that will have that authority next month. It is also true that those potential rebel Remainers believe they have been assured by the government that they would NOT turn a vote on the customs union into a vote of confidence. They think they can try to shift Theresa May’s position without collapsing the government, indeed they say the chatter about a confidence vote is a ‘ruse’ by the Brexiteers. Downing Street says publicly that no such decision has been made. It’s not surprising that in uncharted territory they don’t want to be bound to one position now over a vote that’s not for another month. Number 10 has confirmed that Amber Rudd, the home secretary, will make a statement to MPs this afternoon announcing new measures to help victims of the Windrush generation scandal. (See 12.39pm.) The Home Office is to be given sweeping data protection exemptions that will prevent anyone seeking information about their immigration status in future, campaigners for the Windrush generation are warning. Downing Street has rejected claims that the government has decided to make the vote due next month on an amendment intended to keep the UK in the customs union a matter of confidence. (See 9.05am.) Jürgen Klopp, the manager of Liverpool, has told the Guardian that Brexit “makes no sense at all” and that he believes British people should have the chance to vote again on their future either in or outside the European Union. A roundtable meeting between Jeremy Corbyn and a range of Jewish groups to discuss antisemitism in Labour and other issues has been postponed, reportedly because of concerns about the planned participation of one group. Labour will introduce new bank holidays to mark the patron saints of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland if it wins the next general election, Corbyn has said. A former high court judge has been appointed to lead an independent inquiry into the alleged bullying and harassment of House of Commons staff, the parliamentary body organising the process has announced. On her campaign visit to the West Midlands this morning, Theresa May restated her determination to leave the customs union. She said: Coming out of the customs union means that we will be free to have those deals - deals that suit the UK. But I also recognise the importance to businesses like this [a furniture firm - see 12.53pm] of being able to have as frictionless a border as possible into the European Union. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives has warned that Wales faces a period of “rudderless leadership” if the process to select Carwyn Jones’ replacement drags on until the end of the year. Jones announced at the weekend that he was stepping down as first minister in the autumn during the Welsh Labour conference at the weekend and said his successor would be in place by December. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Tories in Wales, has called for swift action to replace the first minister, and for the election of a new leader “within weeks – not months”. He said: The first minister’s decision to stand down has created an immediate vacuum at the heart of Welsh politics, and we now face a period of rudderless leadership whilst the Labour party works out how to elect his replacement. They need to get a move on, for the sake of our public services and public confidence in devolution. Welsh NHS waiting lists are spiralling, we have a teacher recruitment crisis, and take-home pay is the lowest in any part of the UK. It is simply unacceptable for the country to be left in limbo until the end of the year. A row is brewing over the method of electing a new Labour leader – and thus first minister in Wales. Shortly before Jones announced he was stepping down, the Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris won the Welsh Labour deputy leadership election through an electoral college system – rather than one member, one vote. Many within the party in Wales believe that the new leader should be elected on a one member one vote system. Davies said: Frankly, the majority of the public are unconcerned by the mechanism used to determine Carwyn’s replacement, but we need to see a new first minister with a mandate to take Wales forward in the coming weeks – not months. As Anne Perkins and Amelia Gentleman report in today’s Guardian splash, Mike Freer, a government whip, sent out an email saying the Windrush scandal has “absolutely nothing” to do with policies implemented while Theresa May was home secretary. Freer subsequently issued a statement clarifying his position. In it he said: As the prime minister and home secretary have said, the situation that some members of the Windrush generation have found themselves in is unacceptable, and that’s why it’s right that the government has apologised and is offering help to those affected. The point I was making in constituency correspondence was that some have deliberately sought to conflate this with measures to counter illegal immigration, which we know is a matter of public concern - and that the decision to destroy landing card documents was taken for the first time in 2009. Theresa May visited a furniture company in the West Midlands as part of the Tories’ local election campaign. As the Press Association reports, May met machinists and other workers at Boss Design, posing for a selfie with technician upholsterer Derek Whitehouse at the company’s factory in Dudley, West Midlands. Boss Design manufactures and supplies furniture for commercial use in the overseas and home markets, including the presenters’ seats currently used on the set of Match Of The Day. Around 4,400 council seats will be up for grabs on May 3, with elections being held in 150 local authority areas across England. Polls are also taking place to elect mayors in the London boroughs of Hackney, Lewisham, Newham and Tower Hamlets, the borough of Watford, and in the Sheffield city region. Before the Amber Rudd Windrush statement, there will be an urgent question on voter ID pilots taking place at the local elections. That may have been prompted by this story in Sunday’s Observer. This is how it starts. Government plans that will force people to prove their identities at polling stations in May’s local elections risk disenfranchising members of ethnic minority communities, according to a leaked letter to ministers from the equality and human rights watchdog. In a move that will fuel controversy over the treatment of migrants in the UK following the Windrush scandal, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has written to the Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, raising its serious concern that the checks will deter immigrants and others from participating in the democratic process. Here are the main points from the Number 10 lobby briefing. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, will make a statement to MPs this afternoon setting out further measures to address the Windrush generation scandal, the prime minister’s spokesman revealed. He would not give details of what Rudd would say, but he reminded reporters that Theresa May said on Friday that compensation for victims was one issue being considered. The spokesman played down reports that senior cabinet ministers want to drop one of the two options put forward by the government for post-Brexit customs arrangements. Referring to the Times splash (see 10.58am), the spokesman said the government was still looking at both options. He refused to say whether one option was favoured by Theresa May. The spokesman dismissed the claim from David Jones, the former Brexit minister (see 10.58am), that the government’s customs partnership proposal would lead to the UK eventually staying in the customs union. That was not the case, the spokesman said. “We are absolutely clear that we are leaving the customs union.” The spokesman said that the government thought it could get new customs arrangements in place by the end of the transition period, which concludes at the end of 2020. Experts are very sceptical about this. When it was put to the spokesman said that May herself suggested in her evidence to the Commons liaison committee that more time might be needed, the spokesman suggested her words had been misinterpreted. The spokesman was unable to identify any outside experts who have described the customs partnership proposal as viable. Some policy makers have described it as a fantasy option. Asked about this, the spokesman said the government thought it was a viable option, but could not cite third-party authorities backing this up. The spokesman said that BBC reports this morning saying the government was going to make the vote on staying in the customs union due later this spring a matter of confidence were “an absolute mystery”. Those reports were subsequently dropped, he noted. (9.05am.) The spokesman signalled that government MPs will abstain in the debate this week on a motion saying the government should set staying in the customs union as a negotiating objective, saying that the debate is being treated as “routine backbench business”. The spokesman refused to confirm reports that a visit to the UK by President Trump has been pencilled in for July. The spokesman just said that a working visit was planned for later this year. The spokesman said that the claim from Dawn Butler, the shadow equalities minister, that the government was “institutionally racist” was “not true”. May will attend a service this afternoon to mark the 25th anniversary of the murder of Stephen Lawrence, the spokesman said. Jeremy Corbyn has launched a fresh attack on the privatisation of Royal Mail, saying hundreds of millions of pounds have been “siphoned off” to shareholders, while workers and consumers have lost out. As the Press Association reports, Corbyn told the Communication Workers Union in Bournemouth that Labour would renationalise the Royal Mail if it won the next election. He said that, despite claims by the coalition government that privatisation would lead to investment in services, prices had increased and staff were losing out on pay and conditions. He said: It was totally wrong to sell off such a precious national asset ... Between 2013 and 2017 £800m has been paid to shareholders, £626m of which went to non-employees. Over the last eight years dividends paid by private companies in Britain previously in public ownership totalled £37bn. Just think what could be done with £37bn for infrastructure, housing, health and education. It is a vast sum of money. I’m just back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. It did not really take us on at all, although it sounds as if the Amber Rudd statement on Windrush this afternoon (see 9.31am) will be quite meaty. I will post a summary soon. The government has put forward two options for customs arrangements with the EU after Brexit. They were set out in a position paper (pdf) last year. Here is an excerpt. The Government believes that there are two broad approaches the UK could adopt to meet these objectives. These approaches represent different choices about the nature of our relationship with the EU and countries around the world, but in either option the UK would seek to pursue its independent trade policy objectives. ● A highly streamlined customs arrangement between the UK and the EU, streamlining and simplifying requirements, leaving as few additional requirements on EU trade as possible. This would aim to: continue some of the existing arrangements between the UK and the EU; put in place new negotiated and potentially unilateral facilitations to reduce and remove barriers to trade; and implement technology-based solutions to make it easier to comply with customs procedures. This approach involves utilising the UK’s existing tried and trusted third country processes for UK-EU trade, building on EU and international precedents, and developing new innovative facilitations to deliver as frictionless a customs border as possible. ● A new customs partnership with the EU, aligning our approach to the customs border in a way that removes the need for a UK-EU customs border. One potential approach would involve the UK mirroring the EU’s requirements for imports from the rest of the world where their final destination is the EU. This is of course unprecedented as an approach and could be challenging to implement and we will look to explore the principles of this with business and the EU. Officially the government has not said which of these two options - the “highly-streamlined customs arrangement”, or the “customs partnership” - it prefers. Yesterday, in an article for the Mail on Sunday, David Jones, a Conservative former Brexit minister and a Brexit enthusiast, said the “customs partnership” idea was unacceptable. He explained: The ingenious plan goes like this: the UK would indeed quit the customs union and be able to sign post-Brexit free-trade deals with countries around the globe. As the Leave side promised in the referendum campaign, we would be free to set our own, lower tariffs on imports. But to avoid a hard Irish border, the UK would take on the role of the EU’s tax collector. We would impose the full tariffs on products destined for the Continent and pass the money on to Brussels. Importers of goods staying in the UK would receive a rebate. Et voilà! No need for customs posts in Ireland and full steam ahead for post-Brexit free-trade deals. But sadly, this is nothing more than a Byzantine scheme designed first to slow down Brexit and then to strangle it. And today, in the Times’ splash (paywall), Francis Elliott says other Brexiters are also urging Theresa May to drop this proposal. He says: Theresa May will face calls from senior Brexit-supporting ministers to ditch her favoured option for a customs deal with the EU at a meeting this week. David Davis, Liam Fox and Boris Johnson are to press the prime minister to abandon the plan as fears grow that she is paving the way for a compromise on the issue. They will confront her at a meeting of the cabinet’s Brexit sub-committee, scheduled for Wednesday. The ministers believe that the so-called customs partnership is unworkable and is encouraging Brussels to press for Britain to stay in a customs union after Brexit ... The Brexiteers, however, will press Mrs May to focus on the second option, known in Whitehall as “max-fac” or “maximum facilitation”, which aims to minimise but not eliminate checks. Critics say that this option would cost businesses more and make it impossible for Britain to honour its commitment to avoid a hard border with Ireland. And what are Number 10 saying? I’m just off to the lobby briefing to find out. I will post again after 11.30am. Here is Stephen Clarke, a senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, on today’s zero-hours contract figures. (See 10.23am.) The use of zero hours contracts increased rapidly in the wake of the financial crisis but our tightening labour market has curbed their growth. Nonetheless, around 900,000 workers are on a zero hours contract, including one in twelve young people. And while some workers appreciate the flexibility they bring, for others they bring insecurity and lower pay. The government can help both of these groups by providing a right to guaranteed hours for anyone who has in practice been doing regular hours on a zero hours contract for at least three months. The number of zero-hours contracts in the UK has increased to 1.8m over the past year, new figures show. As the Press Association reports, the total, in the year to last November, increased from 1.7m in the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The number of contracts not guaranteeing regular hours represents 6% of all contracts, unchanged from the previous figure. The ONS has previously reported that 901,000 workers are on zero hours contracts. Here is some comment from Labour parliamentarians on the ‘making customs union vote a confidence issue’ kerfuffle. From Chris Bryant MP From Chuka Umunna MP From Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords. For an alternative view, here is the start of a thread from Christopher Montgomery, a Tory aide working with the European Research Group, who are pushing for a harder Brexit. I think Montgomery misses the point. A government can, I suppose, treat any vote it likes as a matter of confidence. But before the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, that had consequence. A prime minister could say, if he or she lost, that would trigger a general election. John Major used this tactic to reverse a defeat on the Maastricht bill. But this option is not open to Theresa May. If she is lost a customs union vote and wanted to hold a general election, under the FTPA she would have to table another vote calling for an election, or table a no confidence motion in her own government. What is true, though, is that May could treat a vote on the customs union as a personal resigning matter. She could threaten to resign as prime minister if she lost, triggering a Conservative leadership context. This could lead to a range of potential outcomes, some of which would be very unpalatable to either Tory Brexiters or remainers. It is also conceivable that, using some form of confidence argument, the Tories could threaten to withdraw the party whip from MPs who voted against the government on the customs union. This would up the stakes considerably - MPs who are suspended cannot stand again for election as Conservative candidates - but if the rebels ignored the ultimatum, and May was then forced to follow through on her threat and remove the whip from several Tory MPs, she could wipe out her own Tory/DUP majority overnight. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, is making a Commons statement on the Windrush scandal at 3.30pm, the Labour whips are saying. Ian Aitken, the great political reporter who recently died, had a law of journalism that went something like this: there are some stories that, by the act of getting published, automatically become true; and then there are other stories that, by the act of getting published, automatically make themselves untrue. This weekend Brexit and the customs union have given us a terrific example. Yesterday the Sunday Times published a story (paywall) by Tim Shipman and Caroline Wheeler saying that, although Theresa May is officially committed to taking the UK out of the customs union when it leaves the EU, in private she is preparing to back down on this point. Theresa May’s team has privately admitted she may have to accept permanent membership of a European customs union, after a secret wargaming exercise concluded that even Brexiteers such as Michael Gove and David Davis would not resign in protest. The prime minister has insisted that the UK will leave the common tariff area so it can pursue free trade deals outside the EU. But one of May’s political team told a meeting on March 20 that she and senior aides “will not be crying into our beer” if parliament forces the government’s hand — a position that will enrage some Brexiteers. Twenty four hours later the prospect of a voluntary climbdown over the customs union seems to have vanished, or at least got a lot, lot smaller. (That may have been intention of the person briefing the Sunday Times, but that’s another issue.) Even if May was anticipating such a U-turn, in response to the Sunday Times story she has had to assure people that it will not happen. A Downing Street briefing to that effect was leading the BBC news last night. This morning someone seems to have gone even further. At 8am the BBC was reporting that May planned to make next month’s vote on the customs union a matter of confidence. This was obviously a nonsense - a vote on an amendment to legislation is not a vote of confidence in the government, and the days when a prime minister could treat it as such, by threatening to resign and trigger a general election in the event of a defeat, have gone thanks to the Fixed-term Parliaments Act - and Downing Street sources are now saying that, on the confidence issue point, the BBC bulletin was wrong. Still, it all shows how feverish this is all getting. We’ll hear more from Number 10 later. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Jeremy Corbyn gives a speech at the Communication Workers’ Union conference. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 2pm: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, gives a speech at the City Week conference. After 3.30pm: Peers renew their debate on the EU withdrawal bill. Later there will be a vote on keeping the EU’s charter of fundamental rights in UK law which the government is expected to lose. 4pm: Sir Tom Scholar, permanent secretary at the Treasury, gives evidence to the Commons public accounts committee about the Brexit financial settlement. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another at the end of the day. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning’s political news from Jack Blanchard. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today’ top 10 must reads.

It exposed the weakness of the Australian conference and also raises the unpalatable question: can Australia support four Super Rugby franchises and be competitive against New Zealand and even South African sides? Rugby Australia would have no appetite to cut an Australian team after the agony of culling the Western Force last year and that is entirely understandable. It was a messy and painful execution, which has left scars on the Australian rugby landscape, particularly in Western Australia. The reduction to four Australian teams was meant to make them stronger by re-distributing the ex-Force players among the surviving teams, but the evidence so far this season suggests RA did not go far enough. Australian rugby is operating in a false economy. When Australia expanded to five Super Rugby teams the prevailing wisdom was bigger is better, but history tells us less is more. The biggest problem facing Australian Super Rugby is the player drain to Europe. There are now more professional Australian players playing overseas than in Australia. While RA is still able to retain sufficient leading Wallabies to keep the Australian team reasonably competitive in Test rugby, it is the loss of talismanic Super Rugby players which is really damaging the game. Many of the Brumbies’ current problems would be solved by playmaker Matt Toomua, who is playing for English club Leicester, while flanker Scott Fardy’s outstanding form for Irish province Leinster is drawing comparisons with Heineken Cup hero Rocky Elsom. Boom backrower Sean McMahon has already been lost to Japanese rugby, while Reds five-eighth Jono Lance, Waratahs winger Taqele Naiyaravoro and Brumbies centre Kyle Godwin are leaving at the end of the year. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Australian rugby cannot compete financially with rich clubs in Britain, France and Japan for players, which means the game in this country has a stark choice – either it starts to find ways to generate more income to retain players or makes more cost-saving measures. The culling of the Force was a financial disaster for RA, but from next year it will have an extra $6m to spend annually and much of this money should be directed towards retaining key Super Rugby talent. If that is not enough to make a difference, Australia will need to seriously contemplate reducing the number of teams again to save more money which it can re-invest in the remaining sides to make them more competitive and marketable. Of course, Australia’s Super Rugby teams could make more money if more people attended games and watched on TV, but that will not happen while teams are not performing satisfactorily and they will not perform while quality players continue to leave. It’s a vicious circle. Three strong and competitive Australian teams would help to generate revenue by attracting crowds to games and viewers to television sets. It is not the number of teams that generate income, but the number of eyeballs watching. Also, concentrating Australia’s talent into three teams would help to enhance the cohesion of the Wallabies and make them more competitive, which would also be good for the financial health of the game. It is worth remembering the last time the Wallabies held the Bledisloe Cup in 2002 there were only three Australian Super Rugby teams. So if you had to make the cut, who would it be? Clearly, the heartland states of NSW and Queensland are too big to fail because between them and the Wallabies they generate the vast majority of the broadcast revenue which underpins the professional game in Australia. After what happened with the Force, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for RA to come wielding an axe at the Brumbies or the Rebels, but a merger between the two teams, an idea which was floated during the Force culling saga, could help to solve the twin problems of Australian competitiveness and commercial viability. The iconic Brumbies brand is a valuable asset which should not be lost if that can be helped, but growing the game in Melbourne, a city of four million people, is potentially important to the future of the code. A scenario in which the Brumbies play half of their games in Canberra and half in Melbourne could be the answer, but that outcome would need to be negotiated with all parties agreeable. Australian teams have now lost 35 Super Rugby games in a row to New Zealand opposition, which is more than Malcolm Turnbull has lost consecutive news polls. If Australian rugby has not got the wherewithal to break this cycle, the game will just go around in ever diminishing circles.

I’m afraid, yes, the yellow race will rule the world.” That’s Pauline Hanson’s mother Norah, recorded during an interview in the 1990s. Her ravings link Hanson’s own fear of “being swamped by Asians” and the traditional “White Australia” anti-Chinese sentiment from which, in many ways, Australian nationalism emerged. During the deliberations that led to the constitution, Henry Parkes, the so-called “father of federation”, infamously warned of “the countless millions of inferior members of the human family who are within easy sail of these shores”. The first plank of the ALP’s first platform demanded a White Australia; the first parliament of the commonwealth passed the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901. As the historian Charles Ferrall says, “no other social or ethnic group has been the object of such prolonged and intense vilification [in Australia] as the Chinese” (though perhaps Indigenous people would disagree). Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday Like it or not, it’s against that historical backdrop that the current discussion about Australia’s relationship with an ascendant China has been unfolding. That’s why it’s so baffling to find a principled, progressive writer like Clive Hamilton weighing in with a book called Silent Invasion, a title that can’t help but echo what Catriona Ross calls “an enduring preoccupation of Australian popular fiction … a detailed set of discourses centring on Australian vulnerability and Asian menace.” It’s even more baffling when that book contains passages that move back and forth from descriptions of ethnicity to descriptions of political loyalty. Hamilton, for instance, writes: As a campus of the University of New South Wales, ADFA is not more secure than any other Australian campus. I was told that the company that has the security contract, including emptying the wastepaper baskets, is staffed by ethnic Chinese. While engaged in an conversation with an expert about PRC espionage in Australia, an ethnic Chinese cleaner entered the office to empty the bin. Hamilton’s no racist but paragraphs like that can best be described as unfortunate. Already, as China scholar David Brophy points out, the far-right Australia First Party has begun lauding Silent Invasion on the basis that “Professor Hamilton is not revealing much more than what the Australia First Party has been saying for years!” It’s common for pundits to proclaim the need to “understand China”. But, in the current circumstances, we might do well to try to understand Australia, and its propensity to a certain kind of xenophobia. The colony that became Australia grew from an invasion. Having dispossessed others, the settlers found their own dispossession all too easy to imagine. Accordingly, they identified their security with the security of their imperial protectors, with sometimes surprising results. In 1861, for example, the Melbourne Argus explained to its readers that “as a matter of sound precaution, citizens of the United States now resident in Victoria should be placed under surveillance”. We’re so accustomed to thinking of Australia as a US ally that a newspaper security scare directed at white Americans seems almost a category error. But, during the so-called “Trent affair”, Britain briefly seemed likely to join the American civil war, fighting against the Union. Australia thus concluded that it, too, would be warring with Washington – and so the Argus demanded the registration of those perfidious Yankees under the Aliens Act. The same equation between the interests of Australia and the interests of the empire explains the old gun emplacements and other fortifications you can still see around the entrance to Sydney Harbour or Port Phillip Bay. They’re remnants of the multiple and ongoing panics about Russia, waves of which commenced after the Crimean war. Again, when Britain began fighting the tsar, the Australian colonists began obsessing over the Russian menace. The didactic 1877 novel The Invasion depicts a Russian fleet landing 6,000 troops at Botany Bay in the early hours of the morning; in the 1883 novella The Battle of the Yarra, a tsarist incursion to Melbourne results in “the filthy gutters of Flinders Street beco[ming] thickly stained with blood”. For the British, the Russians were merely another rival in “the great game”. The Australians, however, imagined Russia as a potential occupier – and worried that Britain was too sanguine about its ambitions in the Pacific. During the second world war, John Curtin recognised the weakness of the British empire and realigned Australia with the American one. In the second half of the 20th century, the Australian political class still saw Russia as a local threat but this time through the prism of the cold war. Similarly, the new alliance with America rebooted the old hostility to China, with the horror of the yellow peril becoming the fear of the red menace. By the mid-1960s, China was the overwhelming focus of Australian foreign policy, just as it had been through most of the 19th century. After the fall of Soviet Union, the tensions in the Pacific temporarily eased – and, for several decades, Australia could service China’s booming economy without jeopardising its position under America’s protective wing. That, however, no longer seems viable, as Beijing’s new assertiveness threatens a regional confrontation with an American empire in palpable decline. So where, then, does that leave Australia’s customary reliance on an imperial protector? For Clive Hamilton – and many in the national security establishment – the answer is simple: for all its flaws, the US remains a free society. China, on the other hand, is not. On that basis, Australia should double down on its alliance with the US, taking its place in a “global war between democracy and the new totalitarianism”. But great power politics doesn’t allow that kind of simple distinction. In earlier periods, Australian paid for the protection of the British fleet by volunteering young men for bloody slaughters in the name of the empire. The alignment with Washington entails a similar price, already implicating Australians in some of the greatest crimes against democracy in the modern age. In 2003, for instance, John Howard made perfectly clear that he saw participation in the invasion of Iraq as, at least in part, a means of strengthening Anzus. There was nothing anti-totalitarian about the carnage that followed, with as many as a million people dead. The ghastly reverberations continue to this day. In 1966, the Australian government agreed, as part of the US alliance, to host the Pine Gap spy base near Alice Springs. Almost certainly, that facility connects Australia to America’s automated drone assassinations, as well as in the NSA’s attempts to gain access to all electronic communications everywhere in the world – two of the more Orwellian schemes underway anywhere in the world. In other words, the distinction between the methods of democratic and undemocratic imperialist powers simply doesn’t hold. Hamilton decries what he calls “a systematic campaign” by China “to infiltrate, influence and control the most important institutions in Australia”. Yet democratic Australia has been running very similar campaigns against those nations it can control. For instance, Canberra barely disguised the use of its political and economic heft to construct a detention centre on Manus Island – a camp that breached not only international treaties but also Papua New Guinea’s own constitution, with obvious consequences for the rule of law in a developing country. Even more egregiously, Australia has deliberately transformed the ostensibly sovereign island of Nauru into an authoritarian client state, whose “independence” now serves only to displace responsibility for its attacks on civil liberties, the media and the judiciary. Quite simply, China’s done nothing to Australia comparable to what Australia’s done to Nauru. When Fairfax recently reported on suggestions of China’s military interests in Vanuatu, few commentators mentioned that, while Beijing possesses precisely one external military base (in Africa), the US maintains 800 of them – including a massive deployment in the Asia-Pacific. It’s Australia’s alliance with that extraordinary arsenal that allows local pundits to casually refer to Vanuatu as “our backyard” – a phrase symptomatic of unabashed colonialism. None of that is intended to prettify the Chinese regime, a clique of dictators becoming ever more dictatorial, nor to whitewash its own ambitions in the Pacific. The narrative of Australian settlement is part of a broader story, one in which, over and over again, one great power after another imposes its will on the region. We don’t need to counter American imperialism with a Chinese brand – nor the other way around. Despite the ravings of the Hanson family, the people of the Asia-Pacific – whatever their ethnicity – share a common interest in de-escalation and de-militarisation, rather than in a new arms race. It’s that for which we should be fighting. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/08/are-elite-sportswomen-changing-what-coming-out-looks-like","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T18:00:25Z","webTitle":"Are elite sportswomen changing what coming out looks like? | Danielle Warby","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/08/are-elite-sportswomen-changing-what-coming-out-looks-like","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/08/are-elite-sportswomen-changing-what-coming-out-looks-like","fields":{"headline":"Are elite sportswomen changing what coming out looks like?","bodyText":"“The word you’re looking for is ‘girlfriend’.” These few words by a Twitter user who was following the coverage of the 2017 AFLW Brownlow medal kicked off a social media storm. They accompanied a screenshot: a Fox Sports website journalist had captioned a photo of Collingwood full-forward Moana Hope on the red carpet with “her friend” Isabella Carlstrom. The incredulity flew thick and fast, and questions were asked: was it a deliberate erasure of Hope and Carlstrom’s relationship? Or did Fox Sports just not know? If they didn’t know, why not just not have a descriptor? Why didn’t they ask? Were they fearful of outing an athlete? Hope and Carlstrom had never hid their relationship, but they weren’t exactly out either. And they’re not the only sportswomen to walk this line. For some of these couples you need to read between the lines, or pick up on the subtle and not-so-subtle cues. For others, like Matildas star Chloe Logarzo and softball player Jasmine Peters, there’s no ambiguity. Their Instagram accounts leave nothing in doubt. They are all part of a relatively recent phenomenon: elite sportswomen becoming more visible about being in same-sex relationships. “There are still a few people scared that it is going to tarnish their image, but for me, if it was going to tarnish my image then it’s not the image I want because I’m not telling the truth,” says Logarzo. For a time, these athletes’ relationships didn’t receive all that much mainstream media attention. To be in the know you really had to be a women’s sport fan and you had to be following these athletes on Instagram. Then came the federal government’s marriage equality postal survey, which threw the spotlight onto anyone in the public arena and in a same-sex relationship. Soon after that came the “the kiss”: Adelaide Crows AFLW player Erin Phillips wins the league’s inaugural best and fairest award and at the ceremony is immediately congratulated by her wife, American retired professional basketball player Tracy Gahan, with a kiss. Media around the world erupts, with photographs and video of the moment being shared widely. The issue of homophobia in sport is gaining more traction all the time. And rightly so, although most of the conversation up until now has been focused on male athletes and the desire – particularly within queer communities – to see them come out. While such conversations are important to have, they ignore the experiences of female athletes—experiences that are often completely different, more complicated, and come with their own set of challenges. The lack of media coverage is the first and most obvious difficulty. Even if you are out, no one knows because the media isn’t talking to you or even about you. How do you present yourself? It’s a question the majority of women ask themselves regularly, and it’s one game we can never win. You’re either deemed too sexy or not sexy enough. And you immediately wear that stereotype, no matter your sexuality: aren’t all women who play sport lesbians anyway? Logarzo considers herself to be out, but by society’s working definition at the time of this interview she was not. Now, after an earlier version of this piece was published, she is. Confused? And what about Hope and Carlstrom? Tony Harper, the Fox Sports journalist who wrote the caption, explained: “I googled them. I found three articles where Moana refers to Isabella as her ‘friend’ so that’s what I went with.” Erin Riley, the author of the tweet that looked to ‘correct’ the caption, says: “I just assumed they were out.” But were they? Who even gets to decide? “I always refer to Jasmine as my girlfriend, I never say I don’t have a girlfriend,” says Logarzo. “But it’s never really been something I’ve sat down and talked about [to the media].” There’s a gap. So should we, the media, make assumptions about an athlete’s sexuality without their express permission? Hell no. Not every athlete wants to talk about their sexuality or relationship. As one sportswoman told me, on condition of anonymity: “I don’t like sharing too much of my personal life. Obviously I do share some personal things, but I don’t want my sexuality being a focus.” But perhaps, if you take your girlfriend to an official awards night, hold her hand as you walk down the red carpet when you know there will be a shitload of media, then you are de facto out? If a straight couple did that, everyone would assume and call them a couple and it would be reported as “X &amp; Y debut their new relationship at the Brownlow”. How difficult would it have been for the photographer or an assistant to ask for names and relationships on the red carpet after every photograph was taken? Or maybe we shouldn’t be highlighting relationships at all? That was the eventual position Harper came to, removing all references to partners, wives and friends from photo captions of the awards coverage for both male and female players. “For me it’s about the athlete,” says Harper. “If they don’t raise it [their relationship or sexuality] then I don’t raise it. I want to go where people want to take me. Personal is personal until an athlete wants to take it there.” Then there was “the kiss”. What had always been a non-story became a huge story—when it happens all the time on a player’s Instagram it’s not a story, but it’s a huge story when it happens at a glittering event packed full with mainstream media. The fact is that while the media tries to figure out the ins and outs of who is in or out, athletes are on Instagram being visible and in total control. As Dr Kim Toffoletti, Senior Lecturer in Sociology at Deakin University, says: “[What] we’re seeing is lesbian athletes in all facets of their life and we’re not waiting for the mainstream media to present them in a particular way.” Couple this with an increasing desire from younger generations to not be labelled at all rather than be out, and what you have is people living their lives and being visible without expressly talking about it. It’s a non-story to them; coming out isn’t a consideration. “I don’t think it’s necessary [to make an ‘announcement’] because it shouldn’t be a big thing,” Logarzo says. People think of their identities as more than just their sexuality. For sportswomen, being an athlete is what is front and centre—more than being lesbian, and often more than being a woman. How many times have women in sport had to ask for the focus to be only on their athletic achievements? On top of this, publicly claiming a sexual identity of the LGBQ (*) variety is still a very political thing to do, and it’s tough enough for women in sport as it is, without adding extra complications to navigating what is still, at times, a hostile environment. This discussion is all complicated by the fast pace at which things are changing. The issue of marriage equality was at the forefront of political debate in Australia leading up to and during the postal survey. During this debate many athletes became vocal in their support of marriage equality and about being in same-sex relationships. Casey Delacqua, Erin Phillips, Michelle Heyman, Alex Blackwell and Megan Schutt all had articles published in which they stated their support and their sexuality, and many more athletes took to social media with theirs. Others, like Moana Hope and Sam Kerr, participated in equality campaigns with their sponsors. The introduction of the AFLW has gone some way to normalise same-sex relationships. As Caroline Wilson wrote: “The great achievement of the AFLW in this area has been to expose the complete acceptance, to the point of indifference, to what was once considered controversial.” When you pull up women from amateur leagues where there is little-to-no pressure to hide your sexuality, these women are hardly going to go back in when later dealing with mainstream media. Social media gives female athletes a choice. They don’t have to make a big coming out statement—they can just be themselves on social media, be public about who they’re in a relationship with and deal with questions from the media if and when the time comes. “If the media asked me, I’d be open to talking about it,” says Logarzo. “If someone asked me, I would say I’m gay.” Still, we need to recognise that social media has created just another set of challenges that women in sport have to manage and steer, and they often have to do this on their own. Logarzo and Peters have acknowledged their identities and their relationship without making it political, and in doing so they have maintained a level of control and comfort over what they chose to share. However, the personal is still political whether they intend it or not. They’re doing their part to normalise queer visibility on their terms. Academic scholarship on social media says that as a user what you’re selling is community, connection and intimacy—so if an athlete can’t share themselves what’s the purpose of social media to them really? The majority of female athletes don’t have a public relations or media team behind them. Social media has become the most important tool in their arsenal and they’re too busy getting on with playing their sport to be anything but authentic.

The devastating health crisis afflicting central Australia","bodyText":"What is HTLV-1? Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 is spread through contaminated blood, unprotected sex and breastmilk. Like HIV, there is no cure. Like HIV, the virus causes potentially fatal complications but unlike HIV it takes much longer for symptoms to appear. Some people may carry the virus for 30 years before chronic complications appear. What does it do? Five to 10% of all those with the virus will develop a rapidly fatal form of leukaemia and nearly all those who contract leukaemia will die within 12 months of diagnosis. Other life-threatening complications include kidney failure, lung disease, inflammation of the spinal cord leading to paralysis and other opportunistic infections. The severity of symptoms seems to depend on the viral load in the bloodstream. The higher the viral load, the more likely serious symptoms will appear. In central Australia communities have a high viral load and the most common complication is a severe lung disease, bronchiectasis. Who’s at risk? HTLV-1 infects up to 20 million people worldwide. It’s endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, South America, Papua New Guinea, Japan and central Australia, which has the highest transmission rate in the world. There is speculation about why it has taken hold in these specific areas and not others. Researchers at the Pasteur Institute in Paris say it is probably linked to a “founder effect” in some areas. Essentially, once it has taken hold in an area, it is impossible to eradicate. Why isn’t there a vaccine? HTLV-1 was discovered in 1980. It was eclipsed in scientific interest by the discovery of HIV in 1984 which caused a global epidemic. The two viruses have been treated very differently ever since. HTLV-1 has been neglected by the global research community. Testing, research and clinical treatment need to be conducted before any cure can be sought. Japan is most advanced in treatment. It has reduced the transmission rate over time by 80%, through mass testing, and is trialling drug treatments. In 2014, the Global Virus Network set up an HTLV-1 taskforce, led by experts from 11 countries, to “speed the pathway to discovery of drugs that will stop virus transmission or progression from infection to disease, in addition to educating the public about the nature of these viruses, the diseases they cause and how to prevent their spread”. To date, none of the taskforce members are from Australia. • Support our independent journalism with a monthly or one-off contribution This article was amended on 26 April 2018 to clarify the order of Dr Robert Gallo’s retrovirus discoveries: he first discovered HTLV1 in 1980, and co-discovered HIV in 1984."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/22/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-fa-cup-play-with-kids","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T21:30:32Z","webTitle":"Mauricio Pochettino: ‘Maybe next season we play the FA Cup with kids’ | Sachin Nakrani","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/22/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-fa-cup-play-with-kids","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/22/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-fa-cup-play-with-kids","fields":{"headline":"Mauricio Pochettino: ‘Maybe next season we play the FA Cup with kids’","bodyText":"What is success? It is a broad, somewhat vague question that is relevant to most aspects of life, and particularly so in the context of life at Tottenham Hotspur. Following defeat against Manchester United on Saturday, there were more accusations of “choking” and “bottling it” thrown Spurs’ way, and to some extent they were justified given this was the club’s eighth successive defeat in an FA Cup semi-final, and one in which they faded badly having started strongly and taken the lead. Yet to choke and lose your bottle you first have to get to a stage where those failures are relevant and that is what Tottenham are doing now on a regular basis – winning games, going far, remaining in the conversation beyond the winter and into the heat of spring. Is that in itself not success? Mauricio Pochettino certainly thinks so if his comments on Saturday evening are anything to go by. Having insisted he had no regrets about the manner of his team’s loss, the manager called for a wider appreciation of the “process” he has instigated since taking over at Tottenham four years ago, one that has seen expectations rise to the point where “arriving at the [FA Cup] semi-final and being competitive in the Champions League and the Premier League is not enough”. It was not the first time Pochettino had called for perspective in the face of perceived impatience and perhaps also explains his answer when it was put to him that in regards to the FA Cup specifically, it may be better for all associated with the club if next season he did not take the competition too seriously. Play the kids. Take a third-round exit on the chin. Keep expectations to a minimum. “Yes, I am thinking with Tottenham to play with kids the next time. I agree with you,” he said. “It is my job to be criticised when we don’t win. The problem is the perception sometimes is not realistic. But maybe next we will provide the possibility to play with kids and I’m sure it will be fantastic for experience and everything. Then we stop to arrive in this situation.” Not surprisingly, Pochettino’s remarks drew startled glances from those listening and while it is possible the Argentinian had not understood the question properly, he said what he said, and what he said gave the stark impression that this most considered of men has reached a level of frustration in regards to how Tottenham’s progress under his charge is being perceived. It may also be possible that Pochettino has recognised that for all the progress – the success – he has achieved since succeeding Tim Sherwood in May 2014, there is only so far he can take this team. That much could be taken from how, completely unprompted, he also alluded to a time when he is no longer in charge. “Tottenham need more time with me or with another, but the most important thing is to keep going and keep developing,” he said. This was new. Notable. Not to be dismissed lightly. The picture is a somewhat uncertain one, then, after Saturday’s game, in which Dele Alli gave Tottenham the lead during a spell when those in white and blue were leaving United dizzy with their movement and energy. But then Alexis Sánchez equalised and the balance shifted. Ander Herrera’s winner was coming and sucked all belief out of a team that have already beaten José Mourinho’s men at Wembley this season, as well as Real Madrid, Liverpool and Arsenal. Was this collapse, then, more mental than physical or tactical, borne out of a grim sense of deja vu? “It could be,” admitted Harry Kane. “There’s obviously a reason why we’re falling short in semi-finals. So we have to do better. I wouldn’t be able to tell you exactly what it is. But it’s frustrating. We just have to find our way round it.” So much is right at Tottenham but so much is not quite right, either, and increasingly it feels there is only so far this combination of manager and players – possibly the best in the club’s history – can go without tangible reward. They need a trophy, to satisfy professional cravings as well as push back the naysayers, and this proved to be yet another occasion when a golden chance to land one slipped away. There is always next season, but to judge by Pochettino’s words and demeanour, that is a sentiment he is not prepared to cling on to for too much longer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/22/the-guardian-view-on-the-gaza-protests-a-new-challenge-to-israels-blockade","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T17:37:46Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the Gaza protests: a new challenge to Israel’s blockade | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/22/the-guardian-view-on-the-gaza-protests-a-new-challenge-to-israels-blockade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/22/the-guardian-view-on-the-gaza-protests-a-new-challenge-to-israels-blockade","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the Gaza protests: a new challenge to Israel’s blockade","bodyText":"This weekend the United Nations Middle East peace envoy asked: “How does the killing of a child in #Gaza today help #peace? It doesn’t! It fuels anger and breeds more killing.” Nickolay Mladenov was right to be outraged. He tweeted after a Palestinian teenager was shot in the head apparently by Israeli army snipers while peacefully protesting near a border fence. The Israeli government at first dismissed calls for an investigation, only to concede to one after the international community called on the military to “stop killing children”. The soldiers’ use of live ammunition against unarmed demonstrators is an affront; but it is in line with the brutal attitudes towards Palestinians that have become normalised by Israeli politicians. The snatching of life from a few dozen people and the maiming of 1,700 more over the past four weeks are an indication of what Israel thinks is a fair price to pay to keep Gaza in check. A journalist has been shot dead and ambulances fired upon. This awful pummelling of a besieged population is not solely, as the Israeli military claim, to protect a border fence. It is to cow people into submission. The signs are that it will not. These protests were envisaged as a grassroots nonviolent campaign to remind the world that Palestinians whose families were driven into exile during the establishment of Israel consider their right to return inviolable. The idea spun out of a viral Facebook post by Ahmad Abu Artema, a 33-year-old journalist, who wondered what would happen if thousands of people in Gaza, the majority of whom are refugees and their descendants, attempted to cross the frontier peacefully to reach their ancestral homes. These may be idealistic thoughts, but they are not ignoble ones. Who would not prefer Mr Artema’s suggestion that Palestinians and Israelis could live side by side as equal citizens to the violent passions and hatred that pass between these two peoples today? In preferring to dream rather than accepting today’s nightmare, Mr Artema shares a belief with Israel’s president in a better future. Mr Artema’s ideas have been, unlikely as it sounds, adopted – Israel would say hijacked – by Hamas, the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza. The jury is still out as to how long Hamas’s patronage will allow the protests to remain peaceful. The weekly marches build up to a peak on 15 May, when Palestinians mark the Nakba, the catastrophe, which is how they view the foundation of Israel. After a decade of economic blockade by Israel as well as Egypt and three mini-wars, Gaza is on the brink of catastrophe. It is now a giant prison for its 1.8 million people. By 2020, the UN says Gaza will become uninhabitable. The strip is a pressure cooker waiting to explode. Unfortunately Israel’s hardline government sees gains where others see losses. Its scandal-plagued prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has already got Donald Trump to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital despite its being under international jurisdiction and to cut US funding to the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees. Mr Netanyahu is now targeting the Palestinian right of return. Such behaviour steels Palestinians with the morale needed for a long struggle. These issues were meant to be resolved through talks. Instead Mr Netanyahu has seized the opportunity presented by Mr Trump’s absurd vanity about securing the “ultimate deal” to press home his advantage. The gains will be ephemeral. The subjugation of Palestinians erodes Israel’s standing internationally and damages its democracy at home. Its politics are polluted by anti-Arab bigotry. As Israel grows richer, Palestinian destitution becomes more troubling. Its dilemma grows more acute as the number of Palestinians in the Holy Land approaches that of Jews. Israel cannot hold on to all of the land between the Jordan river and the Mediterranean, keep its Jewish identity and remain a democracy. It is in Israel’s interest to accept that Palestinians need a state as much as Israelis do. Otherwise, the choices are a single entity in which Jews could eventually be a minority; a form of apartheid; or perpetual occupation. Hollywood stars like Natalie Portman have understood the dangerous turn Israel is taking.

The decision would put the company at the frontline of the NDIS, interacting frequently with people with disability and service providers, many of whom are still grappling with a vast, complex and sometimes confusing scheme. “Sourcing our contact centre services from Serco will give ongoing flexibility, responsiveness and value for money,” the NDIA said in a statement. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon But the decision has outraged disability rights campaigners, who say Serco’s poor history abroad and its lack of experience in disability should have precluded it from any role delivering the landmark scheme. People with Disability Australia co-chief executive, Matthew Bowden, said he was “gravely concerned” that Serco would, like other third-party providers, fail to uphold the values, objectives and principles underpinning the NDIS. “We have no details on what expertise Serco have in providing communication services for people with disability, or why the NDIA has decided to outsource such a vital part of its services,” Bowden said. “The NDIA needs to hire more staff and make their communication avenues with people with disability more transparent. Instead, they are offloading their responsibilities, and requirements, to deliver services to people with disability.” Paralympian Kurt Fearnley was among those expressing concern at the decision, saying Serco would be “racking their brains on how they can bring lived experience of disabilities into their workplace”. “The NDIS will be worthless if people with disabilities aren’t at its core!” he tweeted. The chief executive of Autism Awareness, Nicole Rogerson, said she was concerned that Serco, a company with a lack of intimate involvement in disability services, had been handed such a critical, customer-facing role. “It just looks like an accident waiting to happen, and it worries me senseless,” she told Guardian Australia. “My first feeling this morning was that the government has just handed over its responsibility, outsourced its responsibility for the most vulnerable Australians, and that makes me disgusted.” Labor’s social services spokeswoman, Jenny Macklin, said the Serco contract was a “worrying development”. She said it showed the restriction on staffing levels at the NDIA should be lifted, in line with the recommendations of the Productivity Commission. “NDIS call centres are specialised, they require properly trained staff. People with disability and their families want a people-centred NDIS, not a commercial call centre,” Macklin said. “The NDIS exists to improve the lives of people with disability – not the profits of multinationals.” The Greens spokesman on disability rights, Jordon Steele-John, said he was appalled by the decision, and raised concerns about Serco’s poor record of caring for people. He also feared for the security of participants’ private information. “People in the disabled community have been warning about lobbying by Serco with regards to the NDIS for years and their worst fears have now come true,” he said. “The last thing disabled people need when trying to interact with the NDIA is to be treated as a commodity.” The NDIA said Serco would not be able to take any services or data offshore. “Under the partnership arrangement, Serco’s staff will be fully trained and will comply with all commonwealth government privacy and security requirements,” the NDIA said. “As an Australian-based supplier, Serco will ensure that no services or data will go offshore.” Serco already has a contract to help run Centrelink’s troubled call centre, and the federal government announced on Monday it would hire another 1,000 call centre operators from the private sector. The Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) said the hiring of the staff would not solve Centrelink’s problems. The union’s national secretary, Nadine Flood, said: “I’ve been calling loudly for years for more permanent Centrelink call centre staff to replace the more than 5,000 jobs the Turnbull government has slashed in this department. Instead the government is continuing to sell the agency off piece by piece, lining the pockets of their corporate mates like Serco rather than putting that money into wages and secure jobs for call centre workers.” Serco has been investigated by the UK’s serious fraud office for billing the government for electronic monitoring of criminals who were either dead or still behind bars. It paid back tens of millions of pounds but was later cleared of fraud. It had also presented false data to the UK’s National Health Service 252 times, was accused of fraudulent record keeping and had allegedly manipulated results when it failed to meet targets. The company has also been accused of covering up the sexual abuse of immigrations in the UK’s Yarl’s Wood removal centre. The Guardian revealed last year that Appleby, an offshore law firm operating in the world’s tax havens, deemed Serco to be a high-risk client before agreeing to help it set up a company in Mauritius. Appleby said Serco’s “history of problems, failures, fatal errors and overcharging” increased the law firm’s exposure to risk. Serco currently runs private prisons and 11 of Australia’s onshore immigration detention centres, including Christmas Island. The company will help build and run Australia’s largest prison, near Grafton in New South Wales, and already operates private prisons in Western Australia and Queensland, provides non-clinical services in hospitals and is building Australia’s next Antarctic discovery vessel. Serco and the NDIA have been contacted for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/apr/23/labour-bid-to-block-regulatory-powers-for-office-for-students","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T05:15:02Z","webTitle":"Labour bid to block regulatory powers for Office for Students","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/23/labour-bid-to-block-regulatory-powers-for-office-for-students","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/apr/23/labour-bid-to-block-regulatory-powers-for-office-for-students","fields":{"headline":"Labour bid to block regulatory powers for Office for Students","bodyText":"Labour is launching a last-ditch bid to stop MPs rubber-stamping the transfer of higher education regulatory powers to the controversial Office for Students. The new universities watchdog was at the centre of a row earlier this year when the rightwing commentator Toby Young stepped down from its board following anger over offensive tweets he had posted. Labour will use a procedural device in the Commons on Monday night to force one final debate and vote on the Office for Students (OfS), which is an important part of the government’s market-oriented higher education policy. If the government were to lose the vote, the watchdog would no longer have key powers enabling it regulate universities. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, accused the government of ignoring concerns from students about the cost of living and rising debt because ministers were preoccupied with creating an institution that they could dominate. “Ministers have sought to turn the so-called independent regulator into their puppet, pursuing their obsession with free markets and political pet projects instead of the sector’s best interests.” The OfS combines the responsibilities of the former Office for Fair Access (Offa) and the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce). In the redesigned higher education world it will be at the heart of the market-oriented higher education system. Set up by the Higher Education and Research Act, it combines the roles of regulator with access to government funding. It has a mission to encourage a competitive market and it is permitted to intervene where it believes there is market failure, or to protect the interests of its “consumers” – students, government and wider society. Rayner, who will lead the debate against a technical piece of secondary legislation that is necessary to incorporate the powers of Offa and Hefce, is challenging the way the board has been set up and appointments to it. The OfS has been mired in controversy from its inception. On New Year’s Eve, the universities minister, Jo Johnson, announced the appointment of Young, an enthusiastic backer of the government’s free schools policy, as one of its non-executive board members. Young resigned just over a week later, after several controversial past tweets of his emerged. The chair of the education select committee, the Tory MP Robert Halfon, called them “incredibly dark and dangerous” remarks about people with disabilities, working-class students and “progressive eugenics”. Rayner said: “There are still serious unanswered questions about the shambolic process of appointment to the board ... The choice of student representative was blatantly politicised while university staff and the entire further education sector have been left unrepresented entirely,” Many critics say the OfS is too powerful, and too close to government and to the universities themselves. The National Union of Students is not represented on the OfS, and nor is there any collective representation of further education colleges. The OfS will control universities’ funding through a series of hurdles that need to be passed in order to access the highest levels of government support. Last December, the National Audit Office published a highly critical report of the government’s whole approach to higher education and in particular student fees. It said English universities would risk charges of misselling if they were regulated like financial institutions and found that many courses were not good value for money."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/23/leinster-champions-cup-ready-take-seat-european-ruby-top-table","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T09:00:07Z","webTitle":"Leinster ready to take their seat at the head of European rugby’s top table","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/23/leinster-champions-cup-ready-take-seat-european-ruby-top-table","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/23/leinster-champions-cup-ready-take-seat-european-ruby-top-table","fields":{"headline":"Leinster ready to take their seat at the head of European rugby’s top table","bodyText":"It has not been a vintage Champions Cup by any stretch but after a weekend of deep intensity, if little in the way of edge‑of‑the‑seat excitement, it is hard to escape the sense it is a seminal one. Since Leinster last sat at the head of the European table, Toulon and Saracens have both taken their turns but they are marching back with a blend of power and precision that suggests they will take some shifting. It will require an almighty effort from Racing 92 to deny them in Bilbao next month and while the French side had too much in their armoury for a Munster team so uncharacteristically rattled, Leinster’s ability to sustain their excellence for 79 minutes against the Scarlets understandably installs them as favourites. The Scarlets’ scythe was simply no match for Leinster’s sledgehammer and had Racing not palpably taken the foot off the pedal in the second half on Sunday the scoreline would have been every bit as one-sided. It was not – and credit Munster’s second-half showing for that – but it can be said with some certainty that both matches were over by half-time. So no, not a vintage tournament, regardless of how much English involvement there was in the latter stages. Undoubtedly there have been pockets of excitement, but perhaps we were a little too easily seduced by the swashbuckling Scarlets or La Rochelle’s razzle dazzle. There are not many matches that will linger long in the memory and if the semi-finals told us anything it is that there is no substitute for the kind of physicality and accuracy served up by both Leinster and, for the first half at least, Racing. Leinster were imperious but, as with Racing, they could afford to be only because of the quick ball provided to them by their bulldozing forwards. The Scarlets selected a pair of breakdown experts in their back-row in James Davies and John Barclay but neither had a sniff with Cian Healy, James Ryan or Scott Fardy smashing every ruck or blasting over the gain-line with ball in hand. For Racing, read Yannick Nyanga, who at 34 was perhaps the most impressive performer across the weekend. Ably assisted by both props – Eddy Ben Arous and Cedate Gomes Sa – and the individual brilliance of Teddy Thomas, Racing bullied a Munster side that had been developing a reputation for doing similar themselves. Racing have not quite crept up on the rails to reach the final – a second in three seasons – but they have spent less time in the spotlight, benefiting from an emphasis on the narrative of Irish dominance this season. Clermont may be enduring a torrid time but not many teams emerge from a knockout match at the Stade Marcel-Michelin victorious so perhaps we ought to have paid more attention to Racing’s quarter-final victory. For they have recast themselves as European heavyweights less reliant on their overseas stars. Rather, it is less heralded players – teak-tough forwards such as Bernard Le Roux, so influential at the breakdown, Wenceslas Lauret and, of course, Nyanga – who laid the platform on Sunday, all the while marshalled by the wonderful Maxime Machenaud. They, at least, may be equipped to handle Leinster’s power. Saracens were able to for 45 minutes or so before Leinster pressed the accelerator to the floor but anyone who makes Munster look so ordinary will be difficult opponents. It is hard to recall Conor Murray having such a poor afternoon and it will come as no consolation that his international halfback partner, Johnny Sexton, did not miss a beat against the Scarlets. Sexton was the star turn for Leinster, who like Saracens and Toulon before them, give off a certain air of invincibility. Before this season, the last time Ireland won the Six Nations grand slam was 2009 and a couple of months later Leinster clinched their first European title. Racing are worthy finalists but only a brave gambler would bet against a repeat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/apr/23/arsene-wenger-tackles-elephant-in-room-reasons-leaving","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T08:06:36Z","webTitle":"Arsène Wenger tackles elephant in room over reasons for leaving","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/23/arsene-wenger-tackles-elephant-in-room-reasons-leaving","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/apr/23/arsene-wenger-tackles-elephant-in-room-reasons-leaving","fields":{"headline":"Arsène Wenger tackles elephant in room over reasons for leaving","bodyText":"It was never going to be a totally normal day. Even if so much of it slipped into the old routines – Arsenal played with every typical Arsenal characteristic and the crowd watched on without getting overly dramatic – there was a surreal sense that underneath it all nobody quite knew what to do about the bombshell. It felt like that quintessentially English thing of having a cup of tea or talking about the weather rather than delving into the deep emotional consequences of a turn of events everybody really cares about. During the game itself Arsène Wenger tried to do the same, focusing on the job still at hand and not much else. But afterwards, entering the press room to face his first inquisition, feeling the intense currents coursing round as the questions rattled from the floor in search for finer details surrounding Wenger’s big decision, the man himself began to open up. If clues were being sought as to why now, and what the trigger was, to push him to call time on his life’s work at Arsenal, it all came splurging out suddenly. The nub of it revolved around how the club’s global reputation has taken a hit with the negative vibes that have trailed around a team struggling to hit the top notes consistently. “Values” is one of his favourite words and Wenger has wrestled with the idea that the club’s values have been tarnished. Notably, as if it was something he wanted to say, it came in answer to an unrelated query. Question: “After 22 years of a stressful job have you felt some relief having made your statement?” Wenger: “No, because I was not tired. But I believe this club is respected all over the world, much more than in England. Our fans did not give the image of unity I want, and that was hurtful. Because I feel the club is respected and overall the image we gave from our club is not what it is and not what I like.” Q: “Can you elaborate on that?” W: “I have nothing more to say. I feel that this club has a fantastic image and for me that is absolutely vital. We can speak and speak and speak but sport is about winning and losing and you have to accept you will lose games – even when I will not be here any more. But it is as well about something bigger than just winning or losing and for me that was always a worry: how the club is perceived worldwide, for kids playing in Africa, China and America and the dreams it can create for young children who want to play football. And all our clubs have a responsibility for that.” Q: “The fans clearly hurt you in that sense?” W: “No, not me.” Q: “But they hurt the club?” W: “I am not resentful and I do not want to make stupid headlines. I am not resentful with the fans. I just feel that, if my personality is in the way of what I think our club is, for me that is more important than me staying. It is nothing to do with the fans. The fans were not happy and I can understand that and I have to live with that.” He did live with it for a while. But the wind-down has now begun. The long goodbye is not really Wenger’s ideal scene as he prefers not to be the story. But this farewell tour has a few more dates to go – six or possibly seven more matches if Arsenal can rouse their game enough to overcome the challenge of the upcoming Europa League semi-final against Atlético Madrid, with the first leg on Thursday in London. Wenger’s post-match comments came from the heart and he at times looked moved by the situation. Q: “Can you describe the emotions of the last few days?” W: “It’s a mixed feeling. First of all I must say I’m touched by all the praise I got from all of English football and I’m grateful for having had that experience in this country. In England football is special, passion is special and you find that nowhere else. I know I will not get that anywhere else in my life, so that’s absolutely special. “After that I had the feeling a little bit that I have assisted life at my funeral, because people speak about you, how you were. It was a little bit interesting on that front. I don’t need to die any more – I know what people will say about me! “Apart from a little sense of humour, I would like to thank everybody who has been absolutely nice to me. “It’s a bit like my job – I certainly got more praise than I deserved and sometimes more criticism than I deserved. It’s been difficult but as well fantastic.” After 22 years of conversations and explanations he still has plenty to say in his own way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/22/racing-92-munster-european-rugby-champions-cup-semi-final-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T18:18:43Z","webTitle":"Teddy Thomas runs in two tries as Racing power past Munster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/22/racing-92-munster-european-rugby-champions-cup-semi-final-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/22/racing-92-munster-european-rugby-champions-cup-semi-final-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Teddy Thomas runs in two tries as Racing power past Munster","bodyText":"The ultimate Irish rugby party may not have materialised but this season’s European Champions Cup final should still be one for the connoisseur. Forget the theory about Leinster being unbeatable this year: if Racing 92 perform for 80 minutes in Bilbao on 12 May with the same power and panache which shredded Munster early on a gorgeous afternoon in Bordeaux the trophy will be heading away from Dublin. The first half felt almost as one-sided as Leinster’s suffocation of the Scarlets the previous day as the Parisians abruptly ended any prospect of two Irish provinces contesting the final in the immediate wake of the national team’s convincing Six Nations grand slam. Instead neutrals can now expect a Basque showdown of genuine quality, particularly if Racing can again accelerate into an early lead. Even Munster, so often the Houdinis of European rugby, were never going to escape from 24-3 down inside 26 minutes. Roared on by the travelling Red Army, they mounted a brave second-half comeback but the damage was done. A brace of tries from the onrushing Teddy Thomas and a third from the captain, Maxime Machenaud, handed the ball by Thomas when the big wing needed only to dot the ball down to register a stunning hat-trick, had long since made the contest a Racing certainty. Poor old Munster. This was their 13th European semi-final and nine have now ended in defeat, with their last final appearance a decade ago. As with the Scarlets, they did wonderfully well to reach the last four, only to run into high-class opponents who would have monstered most teams on the day. The Munster of old used to specialise in confounding the odds but the professional game has moved on. In this sort of company pluck and defiance take a side only so far. It was also a thought-provoking afternoon for all those connected with England’s 2019 World Cup planning. Eddie Jones may keep insisting that club and international rugby are two different things but, if France, who will be sharing England’s pool, ever get around to selecting their best players in their optimum positions and improving their fitness levels, they are capable of causing anyone problems. Had Munster’s forwards not dug in and a yellow card for Marc Andrieu not helped Munster to rack up three unlikely tries in the second half, it would have been a proper towelling. Thomas featured in only two of France’s Six Nations fixtures but he and the explosive Virimi Vakatawa are as lethal on their day as any strike runners in Europe. With fellow internationals such as Machenaud and Yannick Nyanga equally influential and Donnacha Ryan supplying a bit of Irish insider knowledge, modern rugby’s first rule of engagement was duly reinforced. Run hard, fast and straight enough for long enough and opponents will crack sooner rather than later. For Munster fans of a certain vintage it was a reminder that miracles do not happen to order. Eighteen years ago in this same evocative, largely unchanged venue, Munster qualified for their first Heineken Cup final on an unforgettable, scorching hot afternoon, showing other-worldly desire to edge out a more fancied Toulouse side. It was another blissfully warm day but not, in this instance, such a memorable game for the travelling hordes in red. They needed everything to be spot on from the start but, apart from anything else, Ian Keatley at fly-half is no Ronan O’Gara. The fly-half crucially missed a penalty kick to touch which would have given his side a promising early platform close to the Racing 22 and then, for some unaccountable reason, opted for a limp drop-goal attempt with a number of team-mates promisingly positioned outside him. Racing, in contrast, were spot on. Only five minutes had elapsed when Thomas screamed round the outside of Munster’s narrow defensive line and over in the corner and, when Vakatawa stepped past Conor Murray to set his team-mate up for his second in the 18th minute, there was already a sense of foreboding. The sight of Thomas politely sidestepping the chance of a hat-trick to set up Machenaud instead merely underlined the chasm between the sides. There were only 17 minutes left in the game by the time Munster finally crossed their opponents’ try-line through the replacement Simon Zebo, by which point Racing had been reduced to 14 men. The lively Zebo and another second-half replacement, Robin Copeland, injected pace and purpose previously lacking and, with Racing settling for what they had, late converted tries from Rhys Marshall and Andrew Conway added a misleading gloss to the final scoreline. With the outcome never really in doubt, the sight of Zebo, who is heading to Racing next season, throwing his boots to the Munster fans after the final whistle merely intensified the sense of regret. Should their big rivals, Leinster, go on to lift Europe’s biggest trophy, it will take them even longer to get over it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/22/juventus-v-napoli-serie-a-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T20:42:44Z","webTitle":"Juventus 0-1 Napoli: Serie A – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/22/juventus-v-napoli-serie-a-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/22/juventus-v-napoli-serie-a-live","fields":{"headline":"Juventus 0-1 Napoli: Serie A – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s it for tonight’s coverage. We’ll have a match report on the website shortly, and Paolo Bandini’s usual piece tomorrow. Thanks for your company, goodnight. Here’s the updated Serie A table. It’s still in Juventus’s hands, but two of their last four games are away to Inter and Roma. Napoli’s players are celebrating like they’ve won the biggest game of their life. Which is exactly what most of them have done. Many of their fans are in tears of joy. It was a game that promised much and delivered very little - until that unforgettable late twist. Calcio? Bloody hell. Napoli move to within one point of Juventus with a famous victory at the Allianz Stadium. It looked like Juventus had broken their spirit with a defensive masterclass, only for the superb Kalidou Koulibaly to win the match with a mighty header in the final minute. 90+1 min There will be three minutes of added time. Koulibaly has been brilliant all night and that was a monstrous header. Callejon hit an outswinging corner from the right towards the penalty spot, where Koulibaly got the run on Benatia before leaping to thump an immense downward header past Buffon! What a header! Napoli have scored in the last minute!! 89 min Insigne’s inswinging cross beats everyone at the near post and is palmed away by Buffon, diving to his left. That would have sneaked in the corner. 86 min Napoli look shattered. For the first time in the match they are struggling to keep the ball, and Juventus are happy to play out the last few minutes. 83 min Zielinski’s wobbling long-range strike is pushed away by Buffon, who decides to take no chances. Napoli have increasingly been restricted to shooting from distance. 82 min A moronic foul by Callejon on Pjanic gives Juventus a free-kick 40 yards from goal. The title is getting away from Napoli, who look frustrated and tired. Pjanic’s free-kick clears everyone and goes a few yards wide of the far post. 81 min Milik eyes the top corner from 30 yards. Goalkick to Juventus. Napoli look like they have had their optimism slowly broken by the Juventus defence. 80 min Napoli make their final substitution: Allan off, Marco Rog on. 77 min Insigne leads a Napoli break and plays the ball into Milik. He tries to slide a return pass through to Insigne and it’s intercepted by Benatia. Fine defending yet again. It’s been a masterclass from Juventus. 75 min This match sometimes feels like the same bit of footage on loop, with Napoli probing patiently before eventually running into the brick wall that is Juventus’s defence. 73 min Callejon’s superb volley is excellently saved by Buffon, though it wouldn’t have counted as he’d been wrongly flagged offside. 71 min Juventus make their last change, with Mandzukic replacing Douglas Costa. The match is apparently drifting towards a 0-0 draw that would make Juventus strong favourites for the title. 68 min Insigne, picked out nicely by Mario Rui, pings a long-range shot that is comfortably patted down by Buffon. 68 min Napoli are running out of time. At the moment it’s stalemate. 66 min Another Napoli change - Zielinski replaces Hamsik. 63 min Juventus are defending so well. Napoli are struggling to create anything of note despite having all of the ball. 62 min “Evening Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “Thrilling and tense Sunday night Serie A title deciding MBMs are all well and good, but they’re not exactly World Championship snooker on the red button, are they?” Remember when the ‘red button’ was as exotic, mysterious and exciting as, er, Friends Reunited? 60 min Napoli’s first change: Milik replaces Mertens. 59 min The second half is following the same pattern as the first - lots of neat possession from Napoli matched by formidable defending from Juventus. 57 min Douglas Costa zips past Hysaj in the box, but Jorginho comes round to make a vital interception. 55 min Hamsik’s deep, curling cross clears Asamoah and is volleyed over on the run by Callejon. It was a tricky chance. 54 min Cuadrado’s shot is blocked by Koulibaly, who is having a fine game. 52 min Nice play from Napoli. Insigne plays a good short pass down the inside-left channel to Hamsik, who whistles a first-time shot into the side netting at the near post. Buffon had it covered. 49 min A slow start to the second half. Napoli have some good options on the bench, notably Arkadiusz Milik; we’ll surely see him if it stays like this. 46 min Peep peep! Juventus begin the second half. Juventus have made a half-time change, with Juan Cuadrado replacing Paulo Dybala. Here’s the Serie A table as things stand. Napoli wouldn’t be out of it - Juventus still have to go to Inter and Roma - but realistically they probably need to win tonight. That was a fascinating 45 minutes, even if there weren’t many clear chances. Pjanic’s deflected free-kick hit the post for Juventus; Insigne and Hamsik put decent opportunities wide for Napoli. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 43 min Napoli are playing some lovely, eye-catching football. But if I was a Napoli fan, I would fear this happening in the second half. 40 min Napoli have played like the home side for most of the half, though Juventus won’t really mind that. The problem for both sides - Napoli with lots of possession, Juve on the counter - has been a lack of penetration. 38 min Insigne has a goal disallowed for offside! It was the right decision, though it was also a lovely first-time finish. 33 min Napoli continue to play the slicker football, though they have yet to really test Buffon. It’s a fascinating match. 31 min It’s going off! It started when Insigne put the ball out so that Douglas Costa could receive treatment. When play resumed, Khedira didn’t give the ball back to Napoli but lobbed it into touch near the corner flag, sparking a full and frank exchange of views from the players on both sides. It soon petered out. 30 min Douglas Costa goes down holding his face after a hand-off from Insigne. Nothing to see here. 27 min Pjanic is booked for clattering Mario Rui. 26 min This is a terrific spell for Napoli, who are playing with such confidence in possession. 24 min Hamsik misses a great chance! Mario Rui slid a lovely pass down the side of the defence to find Hamsik, who made an in-to-out run to create the opportunity - but then dragged a left-footed shot wide of the far post from a tight angle. 23 min The first quarter has flown past. Napoli have been slightly the better side but there’s very little in it. 23 min “Speaking of 2001, Napoli’s crest is very Netscape Navigator,” says Matt Dony. “At the time, popular and cutting edge, but since rendered redundant and left to fade into obscurity. Apropos of nothing, how did AC Milan get on yesterday?” 21 min Napoli work the ball beautifully from right to left for the overlapping Mario Rui. He overhits his cross but it almost sneaks into the net, with Buffon leaping desperately to tip it over. 19 min Mertens’ long-range shot is comfortably saved by Buffon. 18 min There’s a furious pace to this game, with an intensity level to match. It’s tremendous stuff. 17 min From the corner, Higuain’s acrobatic volley goes straight down into the ground and bounces ominously towards the far post, where it’s headed behind for another corner. I think it was going wide but the Napoli defender played it safe. 17 min The free-kick is 20 yards from goal, a fair way to the left of centre. Pjanic’s sidefooted effort hits the wall, wrongfoots Reina and clatters the outside of the far post! 16 min Raul Albiol is booked for fouling Higuain just outside the area. This won’t end 11v11, will it. 15 min “Been a long long time since I’ve been as excited about a game where I support neither side!” says Nick Parmenter. Same here. Serie A title deciders are fantastic. 14 min After a torrid start, Juventus are starting to have an even share of the game. 13 min A rare Juventus attack brings their first corner. It’s a superb inswinger towards Howedes, whose towering header hits the head of the challenging Mario Rui and flies over the bar. The referee gives a goal-kick. 11 min Chiellini can’t continue and is replaced by Stephan Lichtsteiner. Howedes will from right-back move to centre-back. 10 min Benatia is booked for a foul on Mertens, who was running onto a through pass. It wasn’t quite a clear goalscoring opportunity because of the covering Chiellini; that probably saved Benatia from a red card. Asamoah was also booked for a foul earlier in the move. 7 min Chiellini injured himself trying to block that early shot from Insigne. That’s desperate news for Juventus. He’s going to try to continue but it might not be for long. 6 min Chiellini is struggling with injury. I’m not sure what happened but he’s clearly got a problem. 5 min Napoli are pressing Juventus high up the pitch, as you’d expect. This has been a really confident, authoritative start from them. 4 min “Why do the players have a red mark on their faces?” asks Rohit. Apparently it is in support of a campaign against domestic violence. 3 min Napoli have made a fast, aggressive start and are having a lot of the ball. 1 min Insigne misses a great chance after 56 seconds! Hamsik’s cutback from the left took a deflection and deviated into the bath of Insigne, who shinned it wide of the far post from 10 yards. It did bounce a little awkwardly but it was still a big opportunity. 1 min Peep peep! Napoli get the match under way. They are in blue; Juventus are wearing black and white. The players are ready for action. There’s a glorious atmosphere at the Allianz Stadium. Dries Mertens and Marek Hamsik start for Napoli, which is not to all tastes. Respect “Maurizio Sarri just set the tone,” says Rav Gopal of Napoli’s manager. “Here’s a video of him giving Juventini the finger.” Juventus (4-3-3) Buffon; Howedes, Benatia, Chiellini, Asamoah; Khedira, Pjanic, Matuidi; Douglas Costa, Higuain, Dybala. Substitutes: Subs: Szczesny, Pinsoglio, Lichtsteiner, Barzagli, Rugani, Alex Sandro, Bentancur, Bernardeschi, Cuadrado, Mandzukic. Napoli (4-3-3) Reina; Hysaj, Albiol, Koulibaly, Mario Rui; Allan, Jorginho, Hamsik; Callejon, Mertens, Insigne. Substitutes: Rafael, Sepe, Maggio, Chiriches, Tonelli, Milic, Zielinski, Rog, Machach, Diawara, Ounas, Milik. Anyone who lived through 2001 will never forget one thing: that there ain’t no party like an S Club Party. And by the same token, there ain’t no title decider like a Serie A title decider. Down the years, such fixtures have ached with importance, drama, brilliance and controversy. When it comes to summit six-pointers, Italians definitely do it better. If we get all four of those tonight, we’ll remember the match forever. Four is the operative number – that’s how many games are left after tonight, and the points advantage that Juventus have over Napoli. But if Napoli win tonight all bets are off, especially as Juve still have to play Inter and Roma away. Juve are aiming for their seventh successive scudetto and their 34th overall. Napoli are hoping to win only the third in their history. The first two were won in 1987 and 1990, when Diego Maradona vaccinated allcomers. With their swashbuckling style, they would be incredibly popular winners. If you’re not excited about this match, you really should see a doctor at your earliest convenience. But not in the next few hours, eh.

That’s what everyone – including members of the government – have been asking since the rumbling story erupted a week ago, after six months of cases appearing in the press. Trying to work it out herself, Amelia Gentleman, the Guardian reporter who uncovered the scandal over six months, wrote rather modestly: “Obviously the prime minister is busy and maybe doesn’t read the Guardian much.” But Theresa May employs people to keep her abreast of brewing rows, and no one thought to mention it. Stranger still, when you consider that this scandal has been years, not just months, in the making, as the “hostile environment” policy on immigration was formulated under the coalition. I understand that, at the time, it was the subject of a standup row in the cabinet room between May when she was home secretary and the then education secretary, Nicky Morgan. Morgan had, along with the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, raised concerns that May’s new policy for illegal immigrants would turn teachers and health workers into immigration officials. Morgan went further and also questioned the very principle behind the “hostile environment”. No wonder she lost her job as soon as May took over as prime minister. May had also been asking ministers from other departments to insert the phrase “hostile environment” into speeches and documents, which didn’t go down well. But while some Conservatives objected to the catchy name, few noticed that the design of the policy itself was flawed. It required people to produce documents that the Home Office itself knew no longer existed, or which it was highly unlikely that anyone, whether living here illegally or legally, would have kept for several decades. This wasn’t just May’s mess. David Cameron was the one who had made and then stuck to the Tory promise to drive net migration down into the tens of thousands. He then took over the cabinet committee charged with creating this hostile environment after his 2015 election win. Ministers from the time say they noticed Cameron growing rather awkward when dragged into standoffs between the Home Office and other departments over the target. “May would say to him, ‘Well, you’ve given me this target to meet so why are all these ministers getting in the way’,” says one cabinet minister. “That’s what she’s like, what she’s always been like, if you give her something to do, she’ll keep at it even when it seems impossible.” This dogged determination once won May plaudits as a “bloody difficult woman” who focused on getting things done, rather than playing political games. But it can also lead to the sort of stubbornness that prevents pragmatism: many Tories would dearly love for their party to ditch the net migration target, as it serves largely as a quarterly reminder that the government is still failing to meet it. Unfortunately, one of the very few who would die in a ditch for the target is May. Amber Rudd, her successor, is known to be more liberal on immigration in private. But she has stuck to May’s imprint for the Home Office, something her allies now feel is a mistake. “Successful home secretaries, like them or loathe them, set their own agenda,” says one. Some have suggested Rudd should have emulated Jeremy Hunt in pushing ahead with a personal programme of reform, though it’s difficult to see how this would have worked in practice, given May is still very interested in the Home Office and generally happy for Hunt to do as he pleases as health and social care secretary. “Amber has definitely been damaged by this row,” said one supporter. “She won’t lose her job but in terms of leadership, it’s all looking a lot more difficult.” In fact, some on Rudd’s side suspect her difficult week, in which she was really unable to blame anyone for what had happened, has come about entirely because she is a leadership prospect. “This is a proxy war,” says one senior MP. “You look at the way the European Research Group [the powerful group of Brexiteer Tories, chaired by Jacob Rees-Mogg] has been trying to go after remainers. They went after Philip Hammond, trying to get him sacked. Then they had a good go at Greg Clark. Now it’s Amber’s turn.” These leadership tensions are one of the reasons Conservatives on both sides of the party think the Windrush issue suddenly blew up in the way it did: everyone saw it as an opportunity to further their own causes. Privately, many senior Tories aren’t too worried about the implications of the row itself, beyond the usual gripes about No 10 being “flat-footed” in not realising there was a problem, and refusing to discuss the matter with those who tried to raise it. They think this is eminently solvable, and it will cause no long-term damage to the Conservatives – so long as the Home Office ensures the flaws in the hostile environment policy are ironed out quickly. This, though, suggests few Tories have yet grasped how big the flaws are with the hostile environment approach, despite the many years in which it has now been active. It has caused problems that go far beyond the Windrush generation. If the Tories really think they can move on after merely addressing Windrush, then they’re at risk of failing to see the next big row coming, too. • Isabel Hardman is a political journalist and assistant editor of the Spectator"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/17/modis-government-fails-to-act-on","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T17:35:51Z","webTitle":"Modi’s government fails to act on rape | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/17/modis-government-fails-to-act-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/17/modis-government-fails-to-act-on","fields":{"headline":"Modi’s government fails to act on rape","bodyText":"In the context of Indian PM Narendra Modi’s visit to the UK, we are deeply shocked at the gut-wrenching violence against women and children in India being defended by politicians of Modi’s ruling Hindu rightwing party, the BJP. Hindu extremists, or their associates, stand implicated in rape and murder while some BJP leaders actively mobilise to defend them and undermine the rule of law (Reports, 12 April and 17 April). In Kathua, in Jammu and Kashmir state, eight-year old Asifa was horrifically gang raped and murdered in a Hindu temple by a group of men, in order to terrorise the nomadic Muslim Bakarwal community she belonged to. There followed violent protests in defence of the accused by a pro-Modi Hindu rightwing outfit the Hindu Ekta Manch. At least two BJP ministers took part in these protests. In Unnao in Uttar Pradesh, ruled by the BJP’s notorious hate preacher Yogi Adityanath, a 16-year-old girl was raped. When her family protested after almost a year of inaction by the police, her father was brutally assaulted by Sengar’s [one of the suspect’s] supporters, arrested on a false case and died in police custody. Narendra Modi’s long silence was only broken on 13 April in the face of mass protests in Delhi. He promised justice to “daughters” but refused to utter the word “rape” let alone recognise the role of his own party supporters in perpetrating and celebrating such horrors. The media must question Modi about the involvement of his party members in these atrocities and his government’s effective sanctioning of rapes, attacks on minorities and lawlessness.

A coalition of human rights organisations from Germany, Italy and Yemen filed a complaint on Tuesday with the prosecutors’ office in Rome against officials from the Italian foreign ministry and the local subsidiary of the German conglomerate Rheinmetall, RWM Italia, over arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The move was announced at a joint press conference of the organisations in Rome on Wednesday. Saudi Arabia leads a coalition conducting a bombing campaign of Yemen, aided by UK military advisers, against Houthi rebels. Recent challenges to the Saudi bombing campaign by human rights and anti-arms organisations in the UK and elsewhere in Europe have failed because they have tended to be too broad. The groups mounting the legal challenge in Italy hope that by focussing on a specific incident – a well-documented bombing on 8 October 2016 that left a family of six dead, including four children – they will increase their chances of success. The legal challenge was lodged jointly by the Berlin-based European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), the Yemen-based Mwatana Organisation for Human Rights and the Italian Rete Italiana per il Disarmo. The groups have asked prosecutors to investigate whether there is liability on the part of Italian foreign ministry officials tasked with authorising arms exports and RWM Italia directors over alleged arms sales to the Saudi-led coalition. Attempts by the Guardian to contact Rheinmetall for a response proved unsuccessful. Among the remnants that Mwatana said it found at the site of the 2016 attack on the village of Deir al-Jari in Hudaydah, north-west Yemen, was a suspension lug for holding bombs in place. According to the complaint, the serial number on the lug identified it as part of a batch manufactured in June 2014 by RWM Italia, which has its headquarters in Ghedi in northern Italy, and production facilities in Sardinia. Mwatana, which said it had arrived at the site of the bombing the day after the incident to interview witnesses and gather evidence, sent pictures to the Italian news agency Ansa last year. Linde Bryk, a Dutch lawyer who worked in Kosovo and is now with the ECCHR, said: “What makes this case special are the remnants found at the site of the airstrike. This case is emblematic as it not only concerns Italy’s role but the general question on the responsibility of European governments and European arms manufacturers for the consequences of arms exports used by the Saudi-led coalition.” She added that the case aimed to address the fact that merely having government export authorisation for arms sales does not shield these companies from liability. Politicians and military personnel enjoy a high degree of protection against prosecution, but those who filed the case are hoping a precedent can be set in which officials who authorise exports as well as arms manufacturers are not exempted. Francesco Vignarca from Rete Disarmo said: “Despite the reported violations in Yemen, Italy continues to export arms to members of the Saudi-led military coalition. This is contrary to Italian law 185/1990, which prohibits arms exports ‘to countries engaged in armed conflict’. Further, it is in contrast with the binding provisions of the EU common position on arms export control and the international arms trade treaty.” Civil war broke out in Yemen after Iranian-backed Houthi rebels ejected the UN-recognised government of Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi from the capital, Sana’a, in 2015, prompting the Saudi-led intervention. The country has since endured what has been called the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with three-quarters of the population of about 22 million people in need of some form of aid, according to the UN. If the Italian prosecutors’ office declines to pursue the case, the groups can consider going to higher courts, including the international criminal court, which so far has not been investigating events in Yemen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/19/destruction-at-the-ancient-site-of-mari-in-syria","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T13:29:50Z","webTitle":"Destruction at the ancient site of Mari in Syria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/19/destruction-at-the-ancient-site-of-mari-in-syria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/19/destruction-at-the-ancient-site-of-mari-in-syria","fields":{"headline":"Destruction at the ancient site of Mari in Syria","bodyText":"Three weeks ago, the Syrian antiquities directorate released new photos showing another devastated archaeological site. Outside Syria the news has received fairly limited press attention, except in France, where Mari, the site in question, is much better known. French archaeologists have been excavating at Mari since 1933, the most recent expedition running until 2010 when the Arab Spring and growing unrest made the site inaccessible. In light of the level of damage which is now evident, perhaps it’s worth sparing a moment to look at why Mari matters to archaeologists, historians and the cultural heritage of Syria. When Islamic State emerged, the part of Deir ez-Zor province in which Mari lies was one of the first areas to fall under its control in early 2014. Under IS, the site suffered an immediate explosion of looting; satellite images revealed the change from archaeological site to lunar landscape in a matter of months. More than 1,500 new looting pits were recorded at Mari between 2013 and 2015, likely representing the removal of a huge quantity of ancient objects, sold into the illegal antiquities market to fund Isis and its war. Sadly, this is a story common to many archaeological sites across the region, but Mari isn’t just another site. For archaeologists it’s one of the most important sites so far excavated for those interested in understanding the great urban centres of Bronze Age Mesopotamia, or in diving into the turbulent politics of the second millennium BC. Mari was home to an extraordinary palace. The earliest major structure dates to around 2500-2300 BC, and part of this early palace was restored and preserved at the site, providing a unique opportunity to walk through a third millennium BC Mesopotamian palace, standing almost to its roof beams. This palace area is now very badly damaged. Its protective roof was compromised by a sand storm in 2011, and the security situation at that time left it impossible to make repairs, but the recently released photos show that large parts of the palace’s 2m thick walls have now collapsed. Prof Pascal Butterlin, who directed excavations at the site up until 2010, believes such a level of destruction suggests that explosives, either ground based or more likely from air strikes, were probably involved, adding to the damage caused by looting for financial gain. Butterlin gave a paper detailing the plight of Mari at the International Congress on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East conference in Munich two weeks ago, to general dismay. For archaeologists and historians, Mari’s royal palace is more famous in its later form. In around 1800 BC the palace was remodelled and expanded by the Lim dynasty and the excavation of this building has provided the most complete picture available of the life of a royal palace and the functioning of a Bronze Age city state. This is in part due to the good preservation of the architecture and the almost complete excavation of the palace’s 300 rooms, but also to the 25,000 cuneiform tablets recovered during the excavations, which mostly date to this time. The texts preserved on the tablets have left us the names of the rulers of Mari, provided a wealth of detail about the city and its people, and opened an exceptional window on the politics and diplomacy of the ancient Near East through the preservation of royal letters between the kings of Mari and the rulers of neighbouring kingdoms. Ruling Mari wasn’t an easy job; the city was surrounded by more powerful kingdoms and beset by frequent internal troubles. King Yaggid-Lim was killed by his servants, while Yahdun-Lim was assassinated by his own son, who in turn was also assassinated after a reign of just two years. The best-known king of Mari was Zimri-Lim; a contemporary of the mighty Hammurabi of Babylon, famous for the earliest surviving law code. Zimri-Lim, whose father also seems to have been assassinated by untrustworthy servants, managed to wrestle Mari back from a rival royal house. He married Shibtu, a princess from the kingdom of Yamad, centred at modern Aleppo. They had at least eight daughters and many letters between the king and his grown-up daughters survive to illustrate a close and fond fatherly relationship. Zimri-Lim was less successful in his relationship with Hammurabi. After being an ally of Babylon in its wars with Elam and the city state of Larsa, the diplomatic relationship between Zimri-Lim and Hammurabi gradually soured, culminating in a Babylonian army being dispatched to conquer Mari in 1761 BC. It’s impossible to tell how much more of this history may have been hacked out of the ground by the IS-sponsored looters, written on tablets which were sold to fund the fighting. Zimri-Lim disappeared from the historical record when his city fell, presumably because he didn’t survive the encounter, but his palace did survive along with the records of his fourteen-year reign. The palace constructed by the kings of Mari was of unusual magnificence, and the diplomatic texts suggest it was famous in its day as one of the largest and most luxurious royal palaces in existence, the envy of other rulers. The huge courtyards were planted with palm trees and the walls of the palace were painted with elaborate scenes and decorative designs, including a large fresco showing the investiture of Zimri-Lim as King, now displayed in the Louvre. The palace’s chapel contained a life-sized statue of a goddess, which was drilled through so that real water could run from the mouth of the vase held in the goddess’ hands. Sadly, the palace chapel and all the royal reception rooms are now a mass of huge looters pits. Given the wonders of the palace of Mari and the importance of this site, it’s disappointing that the destruction of the palace and the plundering of the site in search of tablets and other saleable objects hasn’t received more attention. The first explanation is that cultural destruction in the Middle East has been so widespread in recent years that it’s ceased to be news-worthy in all but the most extreme cases, which is a depressing thought. A second disadvantage Mari has over more high-profile sites, such as Palmyra, is that its buildings were made of mud, and not the classical stonework which produces photogenic ruins and screams its artistic worth to a general audience. Nevertheless, Mari deserves to be considered as a loss on the same scale as any of the more celebrated sites to have suffered during the Isis conflict.

But, if you’d rather a more tranquil location, without the selfie seekers, Caerketton Hill at Swanston is well worth the trek. Lying to the south side of the city, Swanston village sits on the fringes of the Pentland Hills (a 15-minute drive or short bus trip from the city centre).

Not only does the view include the coastlines of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales but that of the Isle of Man itself. The other two kingdoms? Why, heaven and the sea, according to the Manx. On a clear day, you can see the fells of the Lake District, the mountains of Mourne and Wicklow, and the Scottish Southern Uplands.

The former industrial majesty is juxtaposed against the patchwork farms of North Yorkshire and, on a clear day, the North Sea. There’s an outstanding restaurant at the top called Lord Stones, serving afternoon tea, Sunday roast and everything in between. Josh Alexander Ancient ruins, Morecambe Bay There’s something magical about standing in the eighth-century ruins of St Patrick’s Chapel at Heysham Head, looking across the ever-changing Morecambe Bay. It’s a wonderful view whatever the weather: mist adds to the mystery conjured up by the ruins and nearby stone graves; it can be breathtaking watching showers sweep across the bay but it’s especially splendid in winter, when the Lakeland fells across the bay are topped with snow. gdeanouk To the lighthouse, Northampton Northampton couldn’t be much further from the sea, yet we have a building we refer to as the lighthouse. The National Lift Tower, 127 metres tall, looms over the town as a reference point, an enduring Brutalist symbol standing alone. It reminds me of going home because it means you always see something of Northampton before you can see the town itself. My favourite view of the lighthouse is from a large pond nearby, extending deep into the water and drifting into hazy ripples, as well as its perfect reach skyward. David Bevan Lovely listed pier, Bangor Grade II-listed Bangor Pier is perfectly positioned on the Menai Straits and offers magnificent views of Anglesey and the Welsh mainland. There is a 50p entrance fee and dog owners will be pleased to hear there is currently a trial in place allowing pets to join their owners for the relaxing stroll. There are very few stalls, as the pier’s main purpose is to provide breathtaking views in a peaceful atmosphere. Head there on a clear day, during the warmer months, for the best views. It can be deceptively windy on the pier, though, so be armed with layers of clothing just in case.

Most Niçois would argue that the classic version doesn’t contain tuna, but I choose to serve my salad with seared tuna steak as I think they make beautiful partners. More often than not, a restaurant’s niçoise is a failure because it has not been dressed properly or the dressing has no flavour. You might look at the ingredient list and think it’s hard to go wrong, but believe me, a bad niçoise can be very, very bad. Serves 4 Prep time: 10mins Cooking time: 15mins For the french dressing 50g dijon mustard 50ml white wine vinegar 25ml sherry vinegar 1 small garlic clove, crushed 300ml extra virgin olive oil Salt and pepper For the salad 200g small salad potatoes, peeled if desired 100g long French beans, trimmed 2 little gem (baby) lettuces, leaves separated 4 hard-boiled eggs, cut into quarters 8 anchovies, in oil, drained 16 cherry tomatoes ½ red onion, sliced 12 pitted black olives 1 fennel bulb, sliced very thinly 10g (2 tsp) chives, finely chopped 4 x 100g slices of tuna, very fresh Salt and pepper 50ml olive oil In a small bowl, whisk the mustard with the vinegars, garlic and a little seasoning. Pour over the oil in a thin, slow drizzle, whisking constantly until the vinaigrette becomes thick. Transfer to a jar or airtight container and keep in the refrigerator. Place the potatoes in a small pan, cover with cold water and bring to the boil. Simmer until just tender, then drain well. Allow to cool and thinly slice. Meanwhile, cook the french beans in boiling salted water, leaving them firm with a slight crunch. To assemble the salad, arrange the lettuce leaves in a serving dish. Pile on the remaining ingredients, scattering over the chives, and drizzle with the dressing. When ready to serve, cook the tuna. Season the fish on each side. Heat a frying pan until very hot, add a drizzle of oil and fry the tuna very, very quickly on each side. The outside should be just warm and the middle still rare. Place on top of the salad and serve immediately. This recipe is taken from Classic Koffmann by Pierre Koffmann, published by Jacqui Small, an imprint of The Quarto Group (£30)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/17/higher-loyalty-james-comey-jonathan-freedland-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T12:50:35Z","webTitle":"A Higher Loyalty by James Comey review – Hillary’s emails, the election and a loathing for Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/17/higher-loyalty-james-comey-jonathan-freedland-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/17/higher-loyalty-james-comey-jonathan-freedland-review","fields":{"headline":"A Higher Loyalty by James Comey review – Hillary’s emails, the election and a loathing for Trump","bodyText":"In the copious literature of the US capital, there is a sub-genre we might call “the saint in the swamp”. It focuses on the travails of an honest man sent to wade through the muck and slime of America’s political Babylon. The exemplar is, of course, the 1939 classic film Mr Smith Goes to Washington, with Jimmy Stewart as the lone man of integrity on the Potomac. But the archetype recurs at intervals in the culture, with the West Wing’s Jed Bartlet a more recent incarnation. And now we can add a new, non-fiction addition: the memoir of James Comey, the FBI director fired a year ago by Donald Trump. Perennially cast as a boy scout – and in Washington that’s usually an insult – Comey establishes his goody-goody credentials early and often. We learn that, when he was in his 20s, people would clap eyes on the 6ft8in lawyer and instantly offer smalltalk about his presumed past as a player of college basketball. As it happens Comey hadn’t played, but in his youth he would let people think he had. “This was a seemingly small and inconsequential lie told by a stupid kid, but it was a lie nonetheless. And it ate at me. So after law school I wrote to the friends I’d lied to and told them the truth,” he writes. Later he gives the director of national intelligence a necktie. Or rather, “I regifted to him a tie my brother-in-law had given me … Because we considered ourselves people of integrity, I disclosed it was a regift.” There’s plenty in that vein, including a declaration that Comey made a habit of using the staff canteen at FBI headquarters and that “I never cut the line … even when I was in a hurry.” Acting pre-emptively to ensure the reader is not left “mildly nauseous” – to quote Comey’s description of how he would feel if he had tipped the election to Trump – by all this virtue, the introduction warns us that the author has long struggled with flaws in his character that include being “stubborn, prideful, overconfident, and driven by ego”. The word “sanctimonious” appears in the book’s first paragraph. All this moral goodness can make Comey an occasionally cloying companion. Nor is the book helped by its apparent dual function as a leadership manual aimed at those who tend to turn left when they board aircraft. There’s lots of management tips for the inspiration-hungry CEO, advice about getting the best from your team and an unfortunate tendency to describe anyone in even a vaguely senior organisational role as a “leader”. Fortunately, though, Comey has quite a story to tell – and that’s even before we get to the Clinton and Trump chapters that have made this book an instant bestseller. His life has been full of drama. As a teenager, he and his kid brother were held at gunpoint in their home by an intruder who turned out to be a wanted serial rapist. He and his wife lost a baby to a preventable infection nine days after the child was born. In his early career as a prosecutor, Comey took on and defeated the Gambino crime family. Yet the temptation is strong to read all this through the lens of what we know will follow. Indeed, the author pushes us in that direction. When he recalls some unhappy childhood memories and offers his thoughts on the psychology of the bully, we know who he has in mind. And he is not afraid to make the connection explicit. Cornered into a dinner a deux with Trump at the White House, and asked to profess his personal loyalty, he is reminded of “Sammy the Bull’s Cosa Nostra induction ceremony – with Trump, in the role of the family boss, asking me if I have what it takes to be a ‘made man’”. For liberal Trump-haters, reading A Higher Loyalty will be a conflicted experience. Comey was both hero and villain in 2016, on the one hand closing the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of unsecured email and, on the other, revealing he’d reopened it again less than a fortnight before election day. He both saved her candidacy and buried it. Accordingly, the Hillary chapters will be hard going for those who hoped she would become America’s first woman president. Yet Comey makes a good defence of his actions, showing how he was repeatedly confronted with a series of lose-lose choices. On the late October disclosure that the email probe was active again, he writes that he faced two doors: one marked Speak, the other Conceal. Had he failed to reveal that investigators were looking anew at Clinton’s emails, and had she been elected, Americans could justifiably argue that they had not voted in full possession of the facts. The FBI’s silence would have rendered Clinton an illegitimate president. (You can imagine what the Fox-Republican complex would have done with such a revelation.) Even those who follow Comey’s logic – and most readers will, I suspect, conclude that his motives were pure – are likely to struggle nonetheless with the other crucial decision he took in 2016. If disclosure was right for Hillary, why was it not right for Trump? Why did the FBI not announce that it was also looking at Trump’s possible collusion with Russia? Here Comey’s reasoning is much less persuasive. He explains that the Trump/Russia investigation was at a much earlier stage, that they did not want to tip off possible suspects and so on. But given the stakes, and the consequences, it’s not really good enough. The truth is, and Comey admits as much, he and others, including Barack Obama, were swayed by their assumption that Clinton was cruising to victory. That led Obama to keep back what he knew about Russian meddling in the election: why undermine Americans’ faith in their democracy when those Russian efforts were apparently making so little difference? And that same assumption shaped Comey’s decisions: he allowed himself to be more worried by questions of future public faith in a Clinton victory than by the risk that his actions might derail that outcome. The Trump win and what followed provides the material for the book’s most riveting chapters. Comey has a keen eye and his observations of Trump and his enablers are sharp. He shows us attorney general Jeff Sessions, for example, under pressure, eyes down, darting from left to right. But it’s Trump we’ve paid to see. Comey cannot disguise his loathing for the man, and the portrait he paints could not be uglier. He has Trump speaking in monologue, leaving no space for anyone else to say a word, a silence the new president takes as assent and complicity. Trump is ignorant – he blanks at Comey’s use of the word “calligrapher” – incurious and casually dishonest. And his ego is unbound. When Comey attended Oval Office meetings with Obama or George W Bush, the president would take a seat with the rest of the group: primus inter pares. But Trump remains seated behind his big desk, as if on a throne attended by courtiers. Comey puts that down to insecurity. A more confident man would not need to demonstrate his status so crudely. Comey records such details throughout, noting who has emotional intelligence and who lacks it. He describes “the Washington listen”: not so much listening as waiting for your turn to speak. And he offers some fascinating observations on presidential humour. Bush could crack a joke, but it was usually at someone else’s expense. Obama laughed easily and never once used humour as a putdown. Trump, meanwhile, never laughs, not even once: to do so would require acknowledging the existence, and successful conversational play, of another person. If the book has a hero besides Comey, it is Obama. A one-time registered Republican, Comey is bowled over by the Democrat who made him head of the FBI. In Obama he sees the wisdom and human sensitivity he aspires to himself. He recalls how, at a reception to mark Comey’s appointment, Obama posed for a photograph with Comey, his wife, the couple’s two daughters and their then boyfriends. At one point, Obama gestured to the boyfriends and said, “Hey, why don’t we take another without the guys. You know, just in case.” It was done playfully, but it was also wise. With all that must weigh on a president’s mind, he nevertheless had room to imagine the awkwardness such a photo could cause several decades later. In Comey’s telling, Obama was something of a saint in the swamp. Obama valued what Comey himself cherished and regarded as near-sacred: the independence of US institutions and, more important still, the obligation to tell the truth. There was a time when we might have teased such a man, mocking him as an earnest altar boy. But we don’t have that luxury now. In today’s world, truth has become a precious commodity and those ready to risk their careers to defend it are few and far between. Comey may be self-righteous, but in 2018 and given the alternatives, that has come to look like a rather tolerable vice. • A Higher Loyalty by James Comey is published by Macmillan (£20).

Hence she leaves the leotards to the cast of Glow. Instead, she dresses in the kind of clothes that semaphore this is a woman who has too much going on to worry about where to dry-clean her cape. Sure, grey marl T-shirts, hoodies and the kind of ripped jeans preferred by Premier League footballers are never going to see her on best-dressed lists. But file her next to Mr Robot’s Elliot Alderson wearing the ‘damaged genius’ uniform. Kalinda Sharma, The Good Wife So much about Kalinda Sharma is all kinds of formidable. The PI skills. The shady past. The slightly suspect methods for getting at the truth. The constant notebook-as-accessory. But the fashion? This is a rare disconnect between character and look. The knee-high leather boots, 10 denier tights, fitted biker jackets and short skirts feel too close to something Presidents Club-approved to fit a woman who is anything but compliant. According to The Good Wife’s costume designer, the character has 60 biker jackets in her wardrobe. We would argue that is 60 too many. If a spin off was in the works (hey, we can dream), we’d advise a trench. Stan Rizzo, Mad Men Stan Rizzo’s bro-hemian role in Mad Men can be seen just by looking at him. He likes to spell out his allegiances in caps with his clothes. The Easy Rider jacket. The love beads. The beard. He’s all Cedar Tavern, waiting for a sighting of Dylan or De Kooning, getting wasted and picking up chicks. He’s the kind of man who puts a paperback of Last Exit to Brooklyn in his back pocket to impress. That is, of course – spoiler alert! – until Peggy steals his heart. He’s probably wearing something far more discreet now. Chandler Bing, Friends There really is only one question when it comes to Chandler Bing, isn’t there? “Could he have any more sweater vests?” This is the man who immortalised the knitted garment, remaining resolute in his affection for the item for 10 seasons - we’ve never known such on-screen wardrobe loyalty. But it really is something that should have been marked up as: “What were you thinking?” He more or less single-handedly elevated its dad-factor to higher than that of even the anorak. It’s telling that even purveyors of the current dad-core trend chose to let it stay where it belongs in 1994 as it resurrected its sartorial bedfellows from the archive. Tahani Al-Jamil, The Good Place There’s no doubt that Tahani, aka Mean Giraffe, is insufferable. Even before she opens her mouth, those floral frocks and blow-dries should send alarm signals – and they do to jeans-and-a-T-shirt-clad Eleanor Shellstrop. What self-respecting millennial dresses as if she’s ready for a garden party at a moment’s notice? It’s suspect in the extreme. And that’s even before we get to the picture hats. We’d like to see her switch it up and be more Jason Mendoza. We’d feel a lot more comfortable with tracksuit and sliders – and, let’s face it, she would be too. Gus Cruikshank, Love Don’t let the sheepish expression fool you – Gus isn’t Mr Nice Guy. In fact, as one culture site had it, he’s actually the “biggest asshole on TV”. Just ask the team he works with on Wichita. The real Gus is subtly there in his uniform of thrift finds: preppy shirt-sleeved plaid shirts and chinos. Sounds harmless, right? A bit ironically All-American? Wrong. Actually, that unassuming garb is the sign of sneaky overfamiliarity and economy with the truth. Even with Mickey’s influence in series three, and that cool military jacket, Gus isn’t quite what he seems. His wardrobe spells that out just so."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/apr/18/can-be-left-alone-victoria-beckham-treadmill-reebok-sportswear-range","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T05:00:18Z","webTitle":"‘I can literally just be left alone’: Victoria Beckham on why the treadmill is her happy place","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/18/can-be-left-alone-victoria-beckham-treadmill-reebok-sportswear-range","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/apr/18/can-be-left-alone-victoria-beckham-treadmill-reebok-sportswear-range","fields":{"headline":"‘I can literally just be left alone’: Victoria Beckham on why the treadmill is her happy place","bodyText":"Like the Von Trapps reimagined for the athleisure era, a quartet of Beckhams is posing in the lobby of a white-walled art deco house in West Hollywood, all wearing Reebok merchandise. Imagine a set of Russian dolls in sportswear and you get a sense of the effect as Beckhams of various sizes – Cruz, 13, Romeo, 15, and Brooklyn, 19, in hoodies, along with Victoria, in a white Reebok T-shirt tucked into leather trousers – smize for the cameras. This tableau has been arranged at a dinner to promote Beckham’s much-hyped collaboration with Reebok. More specifically, tonight’s event launches a “teaser” range designed by Beckham with 90s basketball legend, and long-term Reebok ambassador, Shaquille O’Neal. The first drop, of hoodies and T-shirts, will go on sale in May on Beckham’s website and will serve as a buzz-builder for the collection proper, due towards the end of the year, which will centre on performance workout wear, including bras, leggings and trainers. According to an impassioned speech given to assembled journalists by Reebok’s CEO, Matthew H O’Toole, tonight’s launch is about much more than hoodies. It is, he says, “one of most incredible nights in the history of Reebok”. The company – which recently announced a plan to transform its bottom line by homing in on the fitness market – has “always been about empowering women … this is an incredible step forward in what’s possible for that”. In the 90s, a plotline in which Victoria Beckham became an icon for female empowerment through fitness would have been deemed so implausible that even the creators of Spice World: The Movie might have rejected it. Back then, her personal brand was set up in opposition to sport. She was Posh: she pouted and swayed in mini dresses and heels; Mel C was the one karate kicking in tracksuits. Later, in the 00s, far from being papped wearing trainers, her impractical footwear was one of the aspects of her image that the popular press most criticised. She wore towering heels to take the kids to an amusement park; she wore tiny white shorts with wedge trainers to throw the first pitch for the LA Dodgers. In 2008, she coined a phrase that has become a meme: “I can’t concentrate in flats”, and said: “I’d love to go to the gym, but I just can’t get my head around the footwear.” “Goodness,” Beckham says at dinner (she says “goodness” a lot), “I have said quite a few things as a joke that people have taken maybe a little too literally.” Actually, she says, she has always exercised, “though I didn’t exercise as much as I do now when I was in the Spice Girls because there wasn’t the time to do it”. Now, she says, she has more of a routine, which includes an hour on the treadmill before taking the kids to school, still wearing her workout gear, after which a trainer takes her through a Tracy Anderson-method dance-based hour-long workout. At the school gates, she says, “most of the mums and dads are wearing workout clothes. People are busy. They are either just coming back from the gym or just going to the gym.” Does she think exercise is empowering? “For me,” she says, “that’s where I go in the morning, that’s ‘me’ time. It’s not just about how it makes you look. It’s how it makes you feel. It really gets me ready for the day. It clears my mind. It’s also where I have lots of ideas. It’s a time when I’m not on the phone, I’m not with the children, I’m not with David; I can literally just be left alone.” The former queen of bodycon is now most likely to use words such as “comfort” and “ease” while talking about clothes. Sportswear and trainers are huge business at the moment, she says, because “I think people want to be comfortable”. She likes it when people mix sportswear with tailoring, when they “do it and it looks effortless as opposed to too contrived”. She bats this point over to the three team VB employees who sit on a plush sofa parallel to ours, observing our interview and occasionally chiming in. “That is one way that I don’t love sportswear, actually,” she tells them. “I don’t love sportswear with a heel because it doesn’t look effortless and I think the whole point of bringing sportswear into the wardrobe is that it should look easy.” If her entourage are not physically making notes as she says this, they must be doing so mentally. Beckham’s approach to design – which is accomplished enough that it has long won over the traditionally snobby fashion industry, even if the perception in the wider world sometimes lags behind – seems genuinely intuitive. She has a sense of the zeitgeist based on the clothes she wants to wear. “I’ve wanted to create workout clothes for a long, long time, you know,” she says. “I work out every day and I want to make clothes that I want in my life.” That said, she is also very earnest. Of the process of working with a sportswear brand, she says: “I want to push them and I want to be pushed as well. I want to learn and create something different.” She speaks with enthusiasm about function, technical fabrics and “bonding details”. Later, by the time food is served (at a long table canopied with fairy lights and groaning with floral displays), things are more relaxed. The army of men and women who have been stalking the corridors, hissing “VB is coming” into their iPhones between interviews and photo calls, have dispersed. Salt-N-Pepa’s Spinderella is on the decks. Around the dinner table, superstylist Rachel Zoe chats with actor Eva Longoria; hairdresser to the stars Ken Paves mingles with tattoo artist to the stars Dr Woo and spin instructor to the stars Angela Manuel-Davis. All have glowing complexions that speak of money, yoga, green juice and veganism. Beckham sits next to her business partner Simon Fuller, singing along to 90s R&amp;B tracks; O’Neal is opposite, with two of his incredibly tall sons. David Beckham is at O’Neal’s right, his hoodie boldly advertising long-term sponsor, Adidas. That might appear awkward until you remember that Adidas owns Reebok, and the very Beckhamish synergy of the whole endeavour becomes even more mind-blowing. As this gathering of taut, glossy, hoodie-clad power brokers attests, Victoria Beckham’s decade-long transformation from flat-shoe-denier to trainer designer certainly reflects the times. If she can harness that shift into a successful workout range – the price points of which will expose her to a much wider audience than her four-figure catwalk line – she could even win over a few more of the naysayers. Certainly, the time is right to try. After all, if a Posh character was cultivated for a girl band in 2018, they would be the one rising every day at 5am to down a protein shake before boxing with their personal trainer. Today, having the ability – whether by dint of wealth, success, childcare or discipline – to cultivate triceps that look incredible in cap sleeves has become much more aspirational than any big-ticket fashion purchase. Unlike Birkin bags or Louboutin shoes, exercise is about more than money. It’s about money and discipline; it’s about mastering one’s time every day – and maybe even prolonging one’s life in the process. Right now, life doesn’t get much Posher than that.

This was as true in terms of fashion as it was in performance. Beyoncé is a full-package kind of superstar after all. All clothes were designed in collaboration with the creative director of Balmain, Olivier Rousteing, and two costume changes occurred in the first five minutes of a two-hour set. While they were all kinds of fabulous, they also contained secrets of your style for the months ahead, along with some insights into what Beyoncé is thinking. Here are five points of interest from the Beychella wardrobe. Bow down. 1912 is the year to namecheck That was when the bust of Nefertiti was discovered in Egypt. The queen has since been an icon of regal female beauty, so Beyoncé rightly feels an affinity. This dates back to Sorry, when the singer wore her hair to resemble the Nefertiti sculpture’s headpiece, while her most recent line of merch is dedicated to the Egyptian queen. Beychella’s opening outfit with headpiece and bodice is more than a little Nefertiti, and, to underline the point, she also features in sequins on the back of her cape. According to Rousteing, Jay-Z was a big fan of this look. Pharoah costume incoming. Education, Beyoncé-style Beyoncé is a woman who knows about optics. See a T-shirt she wore featuring a Beyoncé-themed crest: there’s a bee for her fans, the Beyhive; a black-power salute; a black panther; and Nefertiti, overseen by the Eye of Horus. The internet has said it nods to “black Greek” culture, and African-American sororities on university campuses. Political statement through icons – kind of like emojis if you think about it – feels very now. We would be willing to bet this crest will feature on merch at tour stops this summer. Blue and yellow A yellow hoodie and jean shorts are set to be the everyday outfit of Beyhive members this summer. It’s a bit surfer, a bit out-all-day-so-better-take-a-jumper. Beyoncé has history with yellow – she wore it in the Hold Up video from Lemonade – but this shade is slightly more urban, more multistorey car park, if you will. It is also a perfect match for denim and, if so inclined, white-fringed go-go boots. Army of Bey The accessory of the summer? For Beyoncé, it’s her former bandmates. Destiny’s Child collaborators Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams made a cameo at Beychella, all dressed in various versions of camo. OK, it was a route-one reference to them singing Soldier, and fitted the marching-band backdrop, but it was also an endorsement of a trend coming up in mortals’ wardrobes too, even onsite at Coachella. Make it your festival fabric of choice. And if you don’t have the other members of a 90s R&amp;B band to accessorise with, a pair of Timberlands will do just fine. The beret is the woke hat of choice The beret is Picasso in a Breton top, it’s Bonnie in Bonnie and Clyde, it’s Che Guevara. At the subtly politically charged Beychella, however, it’s the favoured headgear of the Black Panther party, one of whom described the beret as “an international hat for the revolutionary”. While Beyoncé herself was bare-headed most of the time, her dancers all wore matching berets, as did the 200-strong marching band sourced from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) across the US. This isn’t just a hat, then – it’s a radical statement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/apr/17/william-kennedy-ironweed-reading-group-saul-bellow","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T15:22:58Z","webTitle":"As William Kennedy shows, good writing is about what you can get away with","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/apr/17/william-kennedy-ironweed-reading-group-saul-bellow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/apr/17/william-kennedy-ironweed-reading-group-saul-bellow","fields":{"headline":"As William Kennedy shows, good writing is about what you can get away with","bodyText":"Saul Bellow was a big figure for William Kennedy. Prior to helping him find a publisher for Ironweed in 1983 (with some effective Bellow bluster), he also briefly taught Kennedy in Puerto Rico in the 1960s and provided some excellent advice, as Kennedy told the Paris Review: He would explain that my writing was ‘fatty’ — I was saying everything twice and I had too many adjectives. He said it was also occasionally ‘clotty’ — it was imprecision he was talking about, an effort to use a word that wasn’t quite as precise and so screwed up the clause or sentence … Kennedy took Bellow’s criticism “very seriously”, edited what he was working on “ruthlessly” and kept these lessons for life. But as Ironweed shows, what he took from Bellow’s lessons isn’t straightforward. Good writing craft is mysterious. Anyone can follow lessons; it takes extra alchemy to make advice work. Certainly, I didn’t feel there was any clotting in Ironweed. But fattiness – that’s more complicated. There is a lot of repetition in Ironweed: scenes are revisited, phrases are duplicated – sometimes in immediate succession – as are words. (If someone is “studying” something, chances are you’ll see that word again soon.) But it’s hard to see all that as a fault. It’s clear that Kennedy knows he’s doing it. The repetition is Kennedy reinforcing his meaning, rather than lapsing into redundancy. This is a book about piecing together recurring memories, revisiting old haunts, and receiving visits from ghosts – and the language reflects that. It’s not that Kennedy forgot Bellow’s words; rather, he created something different from the new awareness they lent him. There are many spare, lean pages in Ironweed where there are hardly any verbal embellishments. But there are also passages like this: Well not-me, Francis said to his unavailed-for self, and he smelled his own uncancelled stink again, aware that it had intensified since morning. The sweat of a workday, the sourness of dried earth on his hands and clothes, the putrid perfume of cemetery air with its pretension to wind-blown purity, all this lay in foul encrustation atop the private pestilence of his being. Is that “fatty”? The adjectives are piled on top of each other, spat out in plosives and sibilance. It could almost be Hamlet worrying about the rank sweat of an enseamed bed ... but, it works. That adjectival effluence reinforces Francis’s anger and resentment, as well as giving us a rich, physical sense of overpowering yuck. Good writing is mainly about getting away with it: you can do anything you want, so long as you do it well. Which Kennedy does, with his often poetic prose, making us feel the energy and potential of Albany, New York, his setting. Albany is the other key to Kennedy’s style. He has often spoken about the trouble he had writing about Puerto Rico. (It’s notable that he shared these troubles with his other famous friend there, Hunter S Thompson, who went on to write a pretty rotten novel about it.) Instead, it was Albany and the people trudging through it, that got his mojo working. In a preface to his non-fiction work about the town, O Albany, Kennedy wrote that he was: “a person whose imagination has become fused with a single place, and in that place finds all the elements that a man ever needs for the life of the soul.” All the flophouses and encampments, ball parks and tramways, homely streets and glowing nightclubs feel rich with history in Ironweed; it feels so special that the wannabe novelist in me even started to dream of going to Albany. But Kennedy may be its best spokesperson. “Misery, wretchedness, ennui and the devil. I’ve got to spend another evening in Albany,” moaned HH Richardson, an architect, in 1870. On the audiobook of Ironweed, James Atlas and Russell Banks discuss getting a tour of the town from Kennedy himself, and seeing little more than grimy street corners and dull strips where the Ironweed author saw astonishing stories and myth. He wrote of the town in O Albany: “I love its times of grace and greatness, its political secrets and its historical presence in every facet of the nation’s life, including the unutterable, the unspeakable, and the ineffable.” It’s these last three, I fear, that give the biggest clue to Kennedy’s success – and they’re hard lessons to teach."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/17/mps-vote-syria","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T12:05:16Z","webTitle":"What’s Theresa May’s stance on intervention?

Even after Syria, nobody knows","bodyText":"No military intervention without representation. Put like that, Jeremy Corbyn’s proposal to ensure no government could deploy troops again without first seeking parliament’s consent sounds virtually a no-brainer. After all, there is already a broad political consensus that the days of prime ministers declaring war and everyone meekly falling into line are over. To many, it won’t seem a huge leap to turn that into a legal duty to consult parliament – with exemptions, obviously, for emergencies such as Britain coming under imminent attack – and to require such consent for even strictly limited, one-off airstrikes like those Theresa May ordered last week. Every conflict starts somewhere, even if this particular Syrian operation turns out to have taken longer to debate than it did to carry out. But what’s true in sex and medicine is true in politics too: consent is worth nothing unless it’s informed, and that’s where the doubts creep in. Not everything can realistically be shared with parliament in advance. Ground wars are months in the planning, and can be debated more easily in their generality without giving too much away to the enemy since the biggest questions are all strategic: what we’re trying to achieve, at what cost, for what gain. But airstrikes are all about specifics: the nature of the targets (which dictates the likelihood of civilian casualties and the risk of blowback) and the strength of the intelligence case, neither of which can easily be shared in advance or in their entirety. Judging by the tone of Monday’s debate, May might have won a vote on bombing Syria had she sought one, but it might well have happened largely in the dark, with MPs given frustratingly little to go on. The most worrying aspect of last week, in some ways, wasn’t so much her refusal to offer a vote but her inability to offer a good explanation. If she didn’t want to recall MPs she could have spoken directly over their heads to voters in advance, making a serious pitch for whatever it is she believes in – the legal and moral case for intervening on humanitarian grounds maybe, or for circumventing an obviously paralysed UN, or simply the broad principles governing her view of military intervention. But where the May foreign policy doctrine should be there is an oddly blank space, barring the odd Sun column. We now know in unusually exhausting detail when the leader of the opposition would or wouldn’t go to war (not without the consent of parliament, not without UN backing – even if in practice that means not without Russian consent, given Moscow’s willingness to use its veto in service of its allies and itself – and probably not solely on the grounds of humanitarian intervention, given he seems to regard that as a legally dodgy fiction of the Blair era). You can think what you like of that position, and many Labour MPs evidently do, but it is crystal clear to voters. It is odd, then, that we know far less about the gut instincts of the one person who currently has the power to go to war. And that matters, because if MPs broadly understand a prime minster’s worldview they can make educated guesses at what they’re being asked to approve, even if some details must be withheld on security grounds (either our own or those of our allies, whose intelligence we may be using). If not, however, they’re left to fall back on gut feelings about war in general, past interventions in particular, and party loyalties. May was visibly furious when Labour’s Laura Smith accused her of mindlessly following American orders, which suggests she prides herself on having principles of her own. But what’s the point if she can’t articulate them? There may well be no going back to the days when Britain was essentially an explanatory democracy – one where prime minsters were expected to take the decisions and explain themselves afterwards to parliament, before falling on their swords if something went wrong. The Brexit referendum as much as Iraq marked the death knell for all that, a decisive shift towards a more representative model where everyone expects to have a say in advance. The catch, however, is that there’s no guarantee of it automatically leading to any better decisions, unless those voting are also better informed. The lesson we should have learned from Iraq, where parliament was consulted only to find out later that the evidence it considered in good faith was flawed, is that voting is no panacea in itself. What matters is having the information to do it well. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/17/trump-term-new-yorker-last-phase-presidency","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T12:15:12Z","webTitle":"Trump is made of Teflon: I wouldn't rule out a second – and third – term | Arwa Mahdawi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/17/trump-term-new-yorker-last-phase-presidency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/17/trump-term-new-yorker-last-phase-presidency","fields":{"headline":"Trump is made of Teflon: I wouldn't rule out a second – and third – term","bodyText":"The nightmare is almost over. Trump is going down! According to a widely shared New Yorker article, published on Sunday, we are “entering the last phase of the Trump presidency”. The article posits that the recent FBI raids on Michael Cohen, Trump’s lawyer and confidant, represent a significant turning point in the president’s political fortunes. It’s a comforting prognosis. However, I’m afraid it is wildly optimistic. While the president is clearly rattled by the Cohen raid, I’m not sure we are anywhere near the end of Trump’s presidency. Quite the contrary. As long as he doesn’t keel over from all the stress, I believe that not only will Trump see out his term, he’s likely to win another one. Heck, he might even win a third term! He has flirted with the idea, after all. Last month, Trump praised the elimination of the two-term presidency limit in China and joked that maybe the United States will “give that a shot some day”. Indeed, a Trump dynasty, in which Ivanka eventually takes over the reins of power, isn’t beyond the realm of possibility. If you’re tempted to dismiss it as farfetched, I’d urge you to cast your mind back to 2016, when the idea of a Trump presidency seemed ludicrous. What we consider normal can change quickly. If Trump’s improbable ascent to power has demonstrated anything, it’s that all bets are off. The New Yorker article bases its predictions of Trump’s demise on lessons from the past. But Trump defies precedent. By rights, after all, he should already have been ruined by any one of the many scandals he has weathered. It would seem that the man is made of Teflon; every new piece of breaking news slides right off him. Part of the reason Trump has proved so scandal-resistant is that he is a reality TV veteran; he understands how to spin facts into his preferred form of fiction. If something doesn’t fit with Trump’s narrative it is dismissed as “fake news”. Continually undermining trust in the media with such charges has proved a powerful strategy and authoritarian regimes around the world have taken note. Malaysia, for example, recently proposed laws that would make propagating “fake news” a jailable offence; a move many fear is an attempt to quell dissent before the general election. If Trump has been adept at using fake news to his advantage in the past, it’s nothing compared to what he might do in the future. Recent advances in AI-powered video manipulation technology mean tools are now available that enable you to literally put words in someone’s mouth, or make it look as if they are doing something they have never actually done. Some politicians have already warned they expect this technology to create such an abundance of “deepfakes” that it “nearly drowns out actual facts”. Bearing this in mind, it no longer seems safe to assume that the truth will out and due process will take its course, no matter how dogged special counsel Robert Mueller may be. While fake news may be a useful weapon in Trump’s arsenal, however, the most powerful thing he has going for him are his very real accomplishments: namely, that he has slashed tax and helped make the rich richer. When Trump first took office, we heard a lot of reassuring things about the institutional safeguards that would stop him breaking the law and prevent the US from turning into an autocracy. But it seems that, as long as Trump keeps enriching the powerful, he has carte blanche to do as he likes. As has become increasingly clear, constitutional checks and balances are nothing compared to cheques and bank balances. Philosophy from the Western world Trivia time! I’m going to give you a quote and you have to guess where it’s from. Ready? Here we go: “Often people working with the existing consciousness are jealous of those who are more in touch and they become hard-core capitalist in hopes of creating the illusion that the value of money is worth more than the value of time and friends.” Did you guess Jeremy Corbyn? Das Kapital? A trend piece in the Guardian? Well, I’m afraid you’re wrong. The correct answer is Kanye West. The rapper-slash-designer-slash-spouse of Kim Kardashian tweeted these words of wisdom a couple of days ago. Kanye is a philosopher now, you see. And not just on Twitter; according to a recent interview in the Hollywood Reporter, Kanye is currently writing a book of philosophy called Break the Simulation. While details are thus far limited, it appears to be about society’s image obsession. “I’m on the fence … about human beings being obsessed with photographs,” Kanye states in the interview, “because [photography] takes you out of the now and transports you into the past or … the future.” Please don’t transport yourself out of this article yet! There is more Western wisdom to impart. In the same interview, for example, Kanye announces that he doesn’t “wish to be number one any more, I wish to be water”. But before you can begin to fully explore the depths of this, he hits you with another profundity. “I feel like Stephen Hawking,” Kanye confesses. “He changed his ideas and his theories all the time. After proving something right, he proved something wrong, right? Because there is no wrong or right, it’s bipolarity.” It has been a full 48 hours since I read this and I’m still grappling with it. As the millennial philosophers say: “I Kant even!” Humanity’s melting point … Bad news: I’ve figured out how humans are going to go extinct. Forget nuclear war, it will be fondue that finishes us off. Yes, fondue. New research shows that the 1970s staple is enjoying a resurgence in the UK. Obviously, Brexit is to blame; an Oxford professor has suggested that “the nostalgic, reassuring element of fondue” may be particularly appetising at a time of global upheaval. Listen, I find melted cheese as reassuring as the next person, but I prefer it not to be tainted by the saliva of double-dippers. Fondue has always been gross and unhygienic but now, what with growing antibiotic resistance, it’s basically deadly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/25/six-best-quick-desserts-recipes-eton-mess-frozen-yoghurt-affogato-mousse","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"Pudding in ten minutes: six of the best quick dessert recipes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/25/six-best-quick-desserts-recipes-eton-mess-frozen-yoghurt-affogato-mousse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/25/six-best-quick-desserts-recipes-eton-mess-frozen-yoghurt-affogato-mousse","fields":{"headline":"Pudding in ten minutes: six of the best quick dessert recipes","bodyText":"Frozen yoghurt (pictured above) Prep 3 min Serves 2 230g frozen berries 100ml Greek yoghurt, or to taste 1 tsp honey Put the ingredients in a food processor or blender and blitz.

Corbyn whipped Labour MPs to oppose the motion, suggesting parliament had been given the chance to scrutinise the UK missile strikes in response to the chemical weapons attack in Douma, Syria. Introducing a second day of debates afterthe strikes, the Labour leader said Theresa May had shown flagrant disregard for the post-Iraq war convention that parliament should be consulted. May said she fully supported the principle for major action or a ground offensive, but that to debate the most recent attack in advance would have allowed Syria’s military to prepare missile defences or move the chemical weapons infrastructure targeted. The debate took place after the Speaker, John Bercow, allowed a Labour motion saying MPs had “considered parliament’s rights in relation to the approval of military action by British forces overseas”. Labour whips urged the party’s MPs to vote against the motion to indicate they did not believe parliament had been able to fully consider the idea. However, Conservative MPs turned out to back the motion, and it was passed by 317 votes to 256. The parliamentary gymnastics meant Tory MPs were in the unconventional position of voting for a motion that the leader of the opposition proposed, while Corbyn opposed, but meant Labour were denied the symbolism of MPs implicitly criticising the prime minister’s approach to parliamentary approval of airstrikes. Introducing the debate, Corbyn said there had been parliamentary votes in recent years over UK involvement in military action in Libya and Syria, including in 2013 when MPs voted against it. “I’m sorry to say that the prime minister’s decision not to recall parliament, and to engage in further military action in Syria last week, showed a flagrant disregard for this convention,” he said. “It seems the convention established in 2003, and in the cabinet manual, is being tossed aside as simply being inconvenient.” It was “necessary and urgent” for parliament to discuss its rights and responsibilities, and whether there should be a law compelling ministers to seek advance approval, he said. “It’s for this house to take matters into its own hands and back our control, as some might put it.” The Chilcot inquiry into the significant intelligence and political failings before the Iraq war should be “a salutary lesson to all of us on the importance of there being total scrutiny of what goes on, and the government being required to come to the house in advance of major decisions”, Corbyn said. A new law should, as a minimum, let MPs ask ministers in advance of any action that was planned, whether it was necessary and legal, and what it would achieve, he said. “It’s difficult to argue that requiring governments to answer those questions over matters of life and death would be anything other than a positive step.” May responded by saying she too agreed MPs “should be able to debate the deployment of British military forces into combat”. But, she added, that “does not mean it is always appropriate. It therefore cannot and should be not be codified into a parliamentary right to debate every possible overseas mission in advance. “For as the exception makes clear, there are also situations where coming to parliament in advance would undermine the security of our operations or constrain the ability of our armed forces to act quickly and decisively. In these situations it is right for the prime minister to take the decision and then to be held accountable to parliament for it.” On the specifics of Saturday’s strike, Syria had “one of most sophisticated air defence systems in the world”, May said. “To counter such a system it is vital to confuse the enemy as much as possible, and to conceal the timing and targets of the planned attack.” Even to allow questions in advance would have divulged vital information, May said: “All of this would have provided invaluable information that would have put our armed forces at greater risk and greatly increased the likelihood of the regime being able to shoot down our missiles and get their chemical weapons away from our targets.” Corbyn was backed by the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, who said parliamentary approval should be needed in all but exceptional circumstances. However, the Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg argued that while MPs must scrutinise the decision, this could happen retrospectively. “The executive is being held to account today,” he said. “The prime minister has spent six hours yesterday in this house being held to account, and a further hour today.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/apr/17/joe-hart-england-goalkeepers-world-cup-squad-russia-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T13:08:12Z","webTitle":"Experience the saving grace for Joe Hart in keepers’ World Cup battle | Ed Aarons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/17/joe-hart-england-goalkeepers-world-cup-squad-russia-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/apr/17/joe-hart-england-goalkeepers-world-cup-squad-russia-2018","fields":{"headline":"Experience the saving grace for Joe Hart in keepers’ World Cup battle","bodyText":"“Three days ago against Spain, I felt like crying,” said Vikash Dhorasoo. “I’m not a supporter, I’m not a spectator, I’m a football player and I’m not playing football.” Filmed before and during the 2006 World Cup, the docu-film Substitute details the existential isolation felt by the France international as he watches his team-mates reach the final in Germany. Released a year after the tournament, the film is an intriguing insight into life on the bench but it also spelled the end for Dhorasoo’s international career after the manager, Raymond Domenech, took exception. That scenario is unlikely to befall Joe Hart given his close relationship with Gareth Southgate but the West Ham goalkeeper’s place in the England squad is under scrutiny again after another mistake against Stoke in Monday’s 1-1 draw at West Ham. With the England manager watching on at the London Stadium and the game live on television, Hart’s timing could not have been worse. Having lost his place to Adrián earlier in the season, a run of three matches including a brilliant performance against Chelsea last week seemed to have put the debate to bed for good. Inevitably, the pundits were not slow to pile in, with Sky’s Gary Neville criticising the 30-year-old’s poor technique as he attempted to deal with Xherdan Shaqiri’s shot and Chris Sutton telling the BBC Hart had “dropped his ticket” for the World Cup. “You cannot take someone because they are a nice bloke and good in the dressing room,” Sutton added. “If England get two injuries to goalkeepers you need your third keeper to be strong. That is how it should be judged.” With Jordan Pickford and Jack Butland vying to be Southgate’s No 1 in Russia, it appears to be between Hart and Burnley’s Nick Pope for the third and final spot. Pope has enjoyed a spectacular debut season in the Premier League since replacing the injured Tom Heaton in the first half of the 1–0 home win over Crystal Palace in September and received a deserved call-up to Southgate’s last squad. The 25-year-old was an unused substitute in the friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy as the England manager took the unusual step of naming four goalkeepers, although Southgate also hinted Hart’s experience was likely to earn him the nod. “I’ve been really straight with him throughout,” he said. “I spoke to him three weeks ago before he was back in West Ham’s team and told him he would be in the squad on the basis of what he had done for us before. He’s a good leader to have around and he’s understood everything completely. He’s played that [back-up] role really well.” Given only four teams out of 435 who have reached the World Cup finals since the regulations were introduced for the 1934 tournament have ended up using all three goalkeepers, you may wonder what all the fuss is about. With Everton’s Pickford and Butland of Stoke having just turned 24 and 25 respectively, Southgate may just have a point. England’s goalkeepers have endured a torrid run at major tournaments in recent years – think David Seaman against Ronaldinho in 2002 and Rob Green’s gaffe against USA in 2010. Eight years ago in South Africa, a 23-year-old Hart was selected along with Green and David James following a brilliant debut season on loan at Birmingham but Fabio Capello opted for James’s experience. Even if that ended with the ignominious 4-1 defeat to Germany in the last 16, managers are generally more likely to place their trust in someone who has been there and done it. But therein lies the problem with Hart. After his mistake against Iceland which gifted them victory in the last 16 of the European Championship in France two years ago, he apologised “for ultimately costing us the game and the tournament” and has since been shipped out of Manchester City by Pep Guardiola. He has 75 caps and played in the last World Cup in Brazil but would England be better served by a younger keeper who has not been tainted with such failure? It would be extremely harsh on Pope if he were to miss out in a season that has seen Burnley defy all expectations to finish in the top half of the table with the league’s third-best defensive record. According to Opta, Pope has saved 80% of the shots he has faced this season, compared with 68.7% for Butland, 67.3% for Pickford and 57.8% for Hart. Ultimately, it may come down to how much trust Southgate places in Pickford or Butland. Never one to hide from the spotlight, Hart will not expect any charity, although he would undoubtedly prefer not to be known as the squad’s official cheerleader either."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/17/wayne-pivac-scarlets-no-worries-leinster-aviva-stadium-dublin-european-rugby-union-champions-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T18:15:00Z","webTitle":"Wayne Pivac says Scarlets have no worries about facing Leinster in Dublin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/17/wayne-pivac-scarlets-no-worries-leinster-aviva-stadium-dublin-european-rugby-union-champions-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/17/wayne-pivac-scarlets-no-worries-leinster-aviva-stadium-dublin-european-rugby-union-champions-cup","fields":{"headline":"Wayne Pivac says Scarlets have no worries about facing Leinster in Dublin","bodyText":"Scarlets’ head coach, Wayne Pivac, says the prospect of facing Leinster in Dublin holds no fears for his players and has questioned whether the Irish province will derive any huge benefit from the choice of the less-than-neutral Aviva Stadium as the venue for Saturday’s European Champions Cup semi-final. The Welsh region secured last season’s Pro12 title in Dublin and will be roared on by up to 5,000 travelling Scarlets fans as they seek to reach the final of Europe’s elite tournament for the first time. “I don’t know if it will be the cauldron that some people think,” said Pivac, the New Zealander currently heading the shortlist to succeed Warren Gatland as Welsh national coach after the 2019 World Cup. “It is a venue where we played in the final last year and we really enjoyed it. There will be plenty of support for the locals I am sure – they won’t have too far to travel – but one Scarlets supporter probably makes up for 10 of the opposition. We have worked really hard to get to the semi-final and wherever we played it was never going to bother us. “We have a lot of players who have played at international level and for us it is an opportunity: 80 minutes away from creating history, being in our first grand final. That’s the way we are approaching it. It is for other people to decide what is neutral and what is not.” Of greater concern for the Scarlets coaches is how to stop Leinster’s fly-half Johnny Sexton, who has already helped steer Ireland to a Six Nations grand slam this year. Pivac would prefer Sexton to be a non-starter but is hopeful the visitors will find a way to cramp his style. “Hopefully he gets the flu or something between now and then … he’s quality, isn’t he?” said Pivac. “It is no secret that all teams will try and put some pressure on and bring some line-speed. But he is just one player … if you focus on one player it can free up space for others.” A fine weather forecast, however, should suit the Scarlets’ all-court, offloading style and Pivac says Leinster should be wary of opponents for whom a final appearance would revive fond memories of Llanelli’s celebrated win over the All Blacks in 1972. “Going through their squad most people would have them as favourites, rightly so because of their form in the competition,” he added. “You give them the ball and you don’t see it for a while. “It could come down to the team that makes the least amount of mistakes. We’re going to have to be up for this game both mentally and physically. It’s going to be a huge challenge so we have to be prepared and ready to go into those trenches.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/18/somaliland-poet-naima-abwaan-qorane-jailed-for-three-years-in-crackdown-on-writers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T04:00:15Z","webTitle":"Somaliland poet jailed for three years in crackdown on writers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/18/somaliland-poet-naima-abwaan-qorane-jailed-for-three-years-in-crackdown-on-writers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/18/somaliland-poet-naima-abwaan-qorane-jailed-for-three-years-in-crackdown-on-writers","fields":{"headline":"Somaliland poet jailed for three years in crackdown on writers","bodyText":"A poet has been sentenced to three years in prison in Somaliland as part of a wide-ranging crackdown against activists and writers.

In a second case on Monday, the same court sentenced Mohamed Kayse Mohamoud, a 31-year-old author, to 18 months in prison on charges of “offending the honour of the president.” The case against Mohamoud was based on a Facebook post saying the “president is a local”, according to the charge sheet seen by activists. It was offensive to the president because the president was “a national president” and not a local official, the presiding judge said. Somaliland, a former British protectorate, declared unilateral independence from Somalia in 1991 as the regime of Mohamed Siad Barre collapsed, but has not been recognised as a fully autonomous state by the international community. It is effectively self-governing with its own elections, constitution, courts and currency. President Muse Bihi Abdi was elected last year. Since December there has been a series of arrests and detentions of activists, bloggers and writers. Local human rights workers say at least 12 journalists have been detained, some for up to three weeks. “The detention of my client was illegal, the charges made against her are politically motivated and the sentence is unfair,” Qorane’s lawyer, Mubarik Abdi Ismail, said. “The the judge was not independent and therefore he could not deliver a free trial.” He said the poet had been threatened during her interrogation. “On one night while Naima Qorane was in [police] detention in Hargeisa, two hooded men entered her cell and threatened that they will rape her if she would not provide passwords of her mobile phone and her social media pages particularly her Facebook. They took all passwords,” he said. “In March, two [police] and intelligence officers came to Qorane’s cell and demanded her to tell everything and confess her crimes ... they threatened that they will bring very strong men who would rape her, and then that they would kill her and dump her body into unknown place. They returned the second night and put a loaded pistol of her forehead and threatened that was her last minute in life.” Qorane was also denied visits from her family for a number of weeks after her father spoke to the media and, though held for political offences, she was not separated from other detainees. She is now being held in Gabiley women’s prison. Ahmed Hussein Qorane, Naima’s father, said he was given only limited access to visit his daughter and was not surprised by the sentence. “My daughter is innocent ... She has nothing to do with what they alleged. She must be released without condition. They did not allow her to see a doctor. She has bad toothache. They beat her in the detention and her left knee is swollen while she has an injury on her thumb,” he said. Much of Qorane’s poetry evokes the lost unity of Somalia, but does not explicitly mention Somaliland or its future, supporters say. She read her works at a TEDx conference in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, last year. Guleid Ahmed Jama, the chair of the Human Rights Centre-Hargeisa Somaliland, said the imprisonment of Qorane and Mahamoud were contrary to the constitution. “This shows that the judiciary is being used to suppress critical voices. We are very concerned about the judiciary’s acts that are putting people behind bars for expressing their opinion. Somaliland is a democracy. We have a very good constitution. The government needs to respect that constitution,” he said. Qorane said in 2016 that she had received death threats and been warned to leave Somaliland. “If it happens – though I am not expecting it – jail was built for people not for animals … I will be released one day and the prison experience is not going to change my views,” she said in a local media interview. There has been no official statement from the Somaliland authorities. The US mission in Somalia condemned the detention of Qorane and Mohamoud, and called on officials to safeguard freedom of expression. Said Abdi Hassan, an activist in Somaliland, said Qorane’s sentence was unfair. “She was detained because of her views which everybody has the right to express without fear,” he said. “How can a country claim to be seeking recognition while they disregard rights of the people. “But we want to tell Naima that even if she is jailed forever, her views will be active. She is a role model for many of our youth by calling for unity and against tribalism.” Officials contacted in Somaliland said they were unable to comment on the case.

Clegg garners a good mix of headline-grabbing quotes (Farage reveals his children have German passports and that he once gave Enoch Powell a lift) and even a glimpse of the man behind the rage. The podcast, from the makers of the consistently great Remaniacs, drops fortnightly with an open invitation to Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre. HV No Country For Young Women Podcast Sadia Azmat and Monty Onanuga’s podcast is a lot more freeform and unfiltered than the average BBC offering and the two friends’ style works well. Azmat is free with her funny quips, invariably ending in “innit”, and she has a very good habit of saying the first thing that comes into her head, especially when recalling her Idris Elba sex dreams. Onanuga’s experience of people pointing and staring because she was one of the few black people on holiday in Montenegro is frank and shocking. HV Your picks: whiteness, film picks and foodie favourites Seeing White Seeing White is a 14-part documentary series exploring whiteness and race in the United States. Scene on Radio host and producer John Biewen takes a deep dive into the issues, along with an array of leading scholars such as Dr Chenjerai Kumanyika. I think this podcast gives much for food for thought on the language and vocabulary we can use to call out the bigotry and casual racism in our social conversations. Recommended by Altaf Makhiawala One Good Thing There are probably more bad film podcasts out there than any other kind, but what I love about One Good Thing is that the hosts, Paul Goodman and Paul Salt, take a uniquely positive approach. Although they address why films fail, , they mostly focus on what works in a film; in doing so, they discover more about what makes good films work. It’s funny, too. Their most recent episode, on the last Twilight film, had me in stitches. Recommended by Jennifer Blundell Desert Island Dishes Desert Island Dishes is a foodie spin on the Radio 4 classic. Each week chef and host Margie Broadhead interviews inspiring people, whether foodies themselves (Levi Roots, Simon Rimmer, Mark Hix, Jasmine Hemsley) or interesting figures who are leaders in their chosen field (journalist Dolly Alderton, aerial photographer Ben Branson). The podcast delves into the seven dishes that mean the most to the guest. It’s a lovely, relaxing listen. Just don’t listen on an empty stomach.

His early career was not easy, and this remarkable 47-track retrospective is taken from 11 varied and experimental albums, many of which were never released in the UK. It’s crammed with great music that was not commercially successful, either because it was too angry or simply too far ahead of its time. The 1960s and 70s were a period of constant change for Masekela. Exiled from South Africa, he moved to the US, where he notched up a massive hit, the delightful instrumental Grazing in the Grass (which is included here). But his involvement with the black power and anti-Vietnam war movements, and new tracks such as Mace and Grenades, and Gold, upset his record company and conservative American audiences. His career began to suffer, but he continued to record such exquisite tracks as Minawa (on which he was joined by pianist Larry Willis and saxophonist Dudu Pukwana) before heading off to west Africa, where he recorded with the Ghanaian band Hedzoleh Soundz. The exuberant 1973 set Introducing Hedzoleh Soundz is included in full, as is the follow-up album, I Am Not Afraid, in which Masekela was joined by Hedzoleh along with pianist Joe Sample and drummer Stix Hooper from the Crusaders. A classic collaboration between African and American artists, it includes the original versions of Stimela and Masekela’s tribute to Dizzy Gillespie, Night in Tunisia. It’s extraordinary that so much great music has been unavailable for so long. This month’s other picks Soar (Bendigedig Records) is the long-awaited second album from Catrin Finch and Seckou Keita, in which the classically trained Welsh harpist and Senegalese-born griot and kora player demonstrate their musical empathy on a delicate and often exquisite set that celebrates the freedom of ospreys who nest in Wales and winter in west Africa, and includes, also, a remarkable treatment of an excerpt from Bach’s Goldberg Variations. From Australia, there’s Djarimirri (Skinnyfish Music) from Gurrumul, completed a few weeks before the aboriginal superstar’s death last year. His celebrated soulful voice is drowned beneath a soundscape of brass and strings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/23/anna-jones-quick-pasta-recipes-lasagne-supermarket-filled-pasta","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T11:00:10Z","webTitle":"Five quick recipes for supermarket pasta","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/23/anna-jones-quick-pasta-recipes-lasagne-supermarket-filled-pasta","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/23/anna-jones-quick-pasta-recipes-lasagne-supermarket-filled-pasta","fields":{"headline":"Five quick recipes for supermarket pasta","bodyText":"Pasta has me hooked like nothing else. My love affair with pasta was cemented in the making of stuffed agnolotti, caramelle and everything in between in restaurant kitchens, but it started with something simpler: my mum’s lasagne and her 10-minute weeknight dinners. When there is pasta in the house, there is a meal to be had. This lasagne is the quickest I’ve made, ready for the oven in 10 minutes (not the hour it normally takes), yet there is still a rich deep tomato sauce and those crisp, baked edges to fight over. And these four ways with supermarket filled pasta transform that shopping-trolley favourite, ready-made these lacklustre little parcels into a meal to be proud of. Cheat’s lasagne (pictured above) This speedy lasagne is inspired by one of my favourite cooks, Heidi Swanson of 101cookbooks.com. I have made a vegan version for my brother using a vegan cashew cheese. Prep 15 min Cook 40 min Serves 6 400g tomato passata 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil Salt and black pepper 2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped 1 good pinch dried chilli 1 x 400g tin puy lentils 50g black olives, stoned and chopped 2 tbsp capers Zest of 1 lemon 1 large handful basil leaves 250g dried lasagne sheets 2 x 125g balls mozzarella Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas 6. In a large bowl or jug, mix the passata with the oil, half a teaspoon of salt, garlic, chilli, lentils, olives, capers and lemon zest. Tear in half the basil leaves. Spoon a quarter of the sauce into an ovenproof dish roughly 20cm x 30cm, tear over a third of one of the balls of mozzarella, then cover with pasta sheets. Repeat for another two layers. Finish with a final layer of sauce, then tear over the second ball of mozzarella, sprinkle with salt and pepper and the remaining basil, and drizzle with a little more olive oil. Bake for 30-40 minutes, until the mozzarella is deeply golden. Serve with a sharply dressed salad (I mix it with lemon, cider vinegar, mustard and extra-virgin olive oil, and toss through a bowl of green leaves). Four fixes for supermarket pasta We’ve all bought a packet of ready-made tortellini for a quick dinner and finished it disappointed. Here are four ways to improve it. All the quantities below make enough to top a 250g pack of filled pasta. I’d advise picking subtly flavoured pasta, such as ricotta and spinach, as it will carry the flavours better. I also use a vegetarian parmesan and pecorino. Prep 5-10 min Cook 10-15 min Serves 2 Red onion and hazelnut (pictured above) Slowly cook a sliced red onion with a pinch of salt until sweet, add two handfuls of shredded greens or chard and the juice of half a lemon and wilt. Next add the cooked pasta straight from the pan, and finish with some toasted hazelnuts and a grating of parmesan. Pumpkin seed and basil Pulse a handful of toasted pumpkin seeds, most of a bunch of basil, the zest of one lemon and the juice of half in a blender. Add olive oil until you have a loose pesto. Toss in the cooked pasta and top with more toasted pumpkin seeds, the rest of the basil and a few handfuls of rocket. Finish with a little pecorino. Spiced tomato and feta Saute a bunch of sliced spring onions and a chopped garlic clove until soft, add a pinch of cinnamon, half a teaspoon of ground coriander and a pinch of dried chilli. Pour in a 400g tin of chopped tomatoes, and cook for 10 minutes. Toss the cooked pasta in the sauce and finish with olive oil and crumbled feta. Spring veg and soft herbs Fry a leek in a little butter or oil, add two handfuls of podded peas or broad beans and some chopped soft herbs (dill, basil or mint), toss with the cooked pasta and top with toasted almonds, lemon zest and a little more oil.

Speaking to the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, Kaiser said Cambridge Analytica had a suite of personality quizzes designed to extract personal data from the social network, of which Aleksandr Kogan’s This Is Your Digital Life app was just one example. In evidence to the committee, Kaiser wrote: “The Kogan/GSR datasets and questionnaires were not the only Facebook-connected questionnaires and datasets which Cambridge Analytica used. I am aware in a general sense of a wide range of surveys which were done by CA or its partners, usually with a Facebook login – for example, the ‘sex compass’ quiz. “I do not know the specifics of these surveys or how the data was acquired or processed. But I believe it is almost certain that the number of Facebook users whose data was compromised through routes similar to that used by Kogan is much greater than 87 million; and that both Cambridge Analytica and other unconnected companies and campaigns were involved in these activities.” Giving oral evidence on Tuesday, Kaiser said: “When I first joined the company, our creative and psychology teams, and data science teams, would work together to design some of these questionnaires. “In my pitches I used to give examples, even to clients, that if you go on Facebook and you see these viral personality quizzes, that not all of them would be designed by Cambridge Analytica, SCL group or our affiliates, but these applications were designed specifically to harvest data from individuals using Facebook as the tool. “So I know, at least of those two examples, the music version and the sex compass, which were both quizzes that were separate from Aleksandr Kogan’s quiz. Therefore it can be inferred or implied that there were many additional individuals as opposed to just the ones through Aleksandr Kogan’s test whose may have been compromised.” Facebook’s chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer ,wrote in a blogpost earlier this month that as many as 87 million users may have had their data taken, higher than the previous estimate of 50 million. Facebook told the Guardian: “We are currently investigating all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014. We will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity. And if we find developers that misused personally identifiable information, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.” Kaiser also said she had “specific concerns of legality” about the working practices of Leave.EU, the unofficial pro-Brexit campaign founded by the insurance magnate Arron Banks. She described Banks explicitly asking her if there could be savings on the work Cambridge Analytica was carrying out if the company could process data from Leave.EU, Ukip and Banks’ insurance company Eldon together. “We were never commissioned to do this work,” Kaiser said. “But I do believe that this work was carried out, just not by Cambridge Analytica.” Kaiser also described attending the headquarters of Leave.EU to supervise the organisation’s data collection team in order to ensure that the information they received through their phone banking operation was useful for the data analysis. When there, she said, she was surprised to discover that the people staffing the phones were employees of Eldon Insurance. “In regards to this proposal and work that I believe was undertaken, with or without us, there’s a few specific concerns of legality,” Kaiser said. “Firstly it’s in relations to breaches of electoral law, for chargeable work, some of which I did which was never paid for, and unreported to the electoral commission.” Kaiser alleged that Cambridge Analytica had carried out £41,500-worth of work for the Leave.EU campaign, which was billed to Ukip, but not paid for. “Secondly, I have evidence from my own eyes of possible breaches of the Data Protection Act concerning the usage of personal and commercial data of individuals in the Eldon Insurance database and possibly the Ukip database, being used for the benefit of the Leave.EU campaign,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/17/top-uk-companies-women-boardroom-persimmon-bp-tui","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T18:10:02Z","webTitle":"Top UK companies under fire over lack of women in boardroom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/17/top-uk-companies-women-boardroom-persimmon-bp-tui","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/17/top-uk-companies-women-boardroom-persimmon-bp-tui","fields":{"headline":"Top UK companies under fire over lack of women in boardroom","bodyText":"Some of the UK’s biggest stock market-listed companies including the oil giant BP, the housebuilder Persimmon and the travel firm Tui have been criticised for their lack of women in leadership roles and could face investor revolts in the coming months. The Investment Association, which represents fund managers who collectively own a third of all FTSE-traded shares, warned that investors were “becoming restless”, as the AGM season got under way. One of the biggest investors in the UK stock market, Legal &amp; General Investment Management, on Tuesday announced it would step up pressure on companies by voting against the chairs of FTSE 350 firms at annual meetings this year if their boards were not at least 25% female. The Investment Association, whose 240 members manage £6.9tn of assets, has written to 14 FTSE 100 companies, 35 FTSE 350 businesses and 21 firms in the FTSE 250 asking them to explain their poor gender balance and to call for change. They include companies in the FTSE 100 with all-male executive committees, such as BP and the packaging company Smurfit Kappa Group, and firms whose senior management have low proportions of women, such as Persimmon and Tui. Other listed companies with all-male management teams include the doorstep lender Provident Financial, the wealth management firm St James’s Place, the retailer Sports Direct and the infrastructure firm Stobart Group. Two years ago, the Hampton-Alexander review, an independent government-commissioned report, said smaller FTSE 350 companies should aim to fill at least a third of their boardroom positions with women by 2020. Large and medium-sized companies, listed on the FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250 respectively, should have at least a third of their executive committees and executive pipeline positions filled by women by 2020. The review was led by Sir Philip Hampton, the chairman of GlaxoSmithKline, and the late Dame Helen Alexander, former chair of UBM. The targets are voluntary. Chris Cummings, chief executive of the Investment Association, said research had suggested that firms with a diverse management team made better decisions and outperformed less diverse businesses. “A number of key investors have told us that they will vote against AGM resolutions on the grounds of gender representation,” he said. “With the AGM season now in full swing, companies who are falling short should take urgent steps to outline what they plan to do to increase diversity.” Ten FTSE 250 firms did not provide gender diversity data last year, including the AA, the turnaround specialist Melrose, which has just acquired GKN after a hostile takeover battle, JD Wetherspoon, WH Smith and Wizz Air. Hampton said: “Whilst the majority of FTSE companies are taking great strides to address the lack of women on boards and in their leadership teams, it is disappointing to see a significant minority of companies still making slow or no progress.” Hampton will next month write to all FTSE 350 companies urging them to submit their gender data as of 30 June. The full report will be published later in the year and will show the representation of women across 23,000 senior leadership roles. The new initiative comes as MPs investigate how government can help promote women to better-paid and more senior roles within business using the new gender pay gap reporting requirements. Earlier this month, more than 10,000 companies reported their gender pay gap. The data, which measures the difference in average hourly earnings between all men and all women working for an organisation regardless of their roles, rather than men and women in the same role, showed that, on average, women were being paid a median hourly rate 9.7% less than men. Sam Smethers, chief executive of the campaigning group the Fawcett Society, told MPs on Tuesday that the government should require all companies with more than 50 employees to report on their pay gap, drawing in far more organisations than the current 250 employee bar. Smethers, Brenda Trenowden, from the 30% Club campaigning group, and Alice Hood, from the Trades Union Congress, also called for the introduction of mandatory pay gap action plans in order to foster change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/17/rspca-investigates-report-of-cat-being-thrown-off-block-of-flats","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T11:51:11Z","webTitle":"RSPCA investigates report of cat being thrown off block of flats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/17/rspca-investigates-report-of-cat-being-thrown-off-block-of-flats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/17/rspca-investigates-report-of-cat-being-thrown-off-block-of-flats","fields":{"headline":"RSPCA investigates report of cat being thrown off block of flats","bodyText":"Animal cruelty investigators are appealing for information after a cat survived a 100ft fall having reportedly being thrown from a block of flats. The RSPCA said the animal suffered a broken jaw in the incident in Guild Close, Birmingham, on 6 April, and was lucky to be alive. The young white cat was taken to RSPCA Newbrook Farm animal hospital after CCTV controllers became concerned she may have been thrown from the building. The charity is trying to track down the owners to determine how she managed to fall from such a height. Inspector Mike Scargill said: “This is a very worrying incident and the cat is extremely lucky to be alive. I am appealing to the general public for any information that might help me investigate what happened. “The cat may have slipped and fallen on her own, but it’s very concerning to hear that the CCTV controllers think they may have seen someone actually throw the cat from the building, so I’m very keen to speak with anyone with information who might be able to tell us more. “I am also keen to find the person who owns this cat. She’s a young white female, with white patches of tabby markings on her tail, back and head. “She’s really been through it and suffering a broken jaw would have been incredibly painful for her, so I’m sure being reunited with her owners will give her a much-needed boost.” RSPCA inspectors undertake investigations when they have reason to believe that an animal cruelty or neglect offence has been committed. Unlike the police, they have no special powers to gather evidence, but they can prepare case files containing witness statements, photographs, and veterinary or other expert advice, which can be used in court."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"small-business-network/live/2018/apr/18/ask-the-experts-find-the-right-usp-crowded-market","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"small-business-network","sectionName":"Guardian Small Business Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T12:59:20Z","webTitle":"Ask the experts: how can your business stand out in a crowded market?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/live/2018/apr/18/ask-the-experts-find-the-right-usp-crowded-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/small-business-network/live/2018/apr/18/ask-the-experts-find-the-right-usp-crowded-market","fields":{"headline":"Ask the experts: how can your business stand out in a crowded market?","bodyText":"Thanks to all our panel and everyone who sent in questions The chat has ended. Many thanks to our panel and readers for taking the time to join us today.

Before we go, I’ve asked the panel to offer their top three tips on standing out as an entrepreneur Will Butler-Adams from Brompton doesn’t agree: An interesting point from Ben Spigel from the University of Edinburgh: A commenter has asked how she can cut through the noise of other crowdfunding campaigns to find investment for her business Luke Lang, founder of Crowdcube gives his advice on what he’s seen work best for crowdfunding campaigns: One reader is an eyewear designer selling his brand online and wants to know how he can stand out from the crowd What makes a good USP and how do you find one? How can entrepreneurs compete in established markets without huge marketing and PR spend? Our first question comes from a reader about how you find out if there’s a market for your business before you try to sell it. Welcome to today’s live chat. For the next hour, our panel will be discussing how entrepreneurs can find a USP in a crowded market, successfully compete against established players, find investment, and market their offering to customers. Please do put your questions and comments for our panel in the comment space below. Some background reading to kick off our debate this afternoon Featuring Will Butler-Adams, founder of Brompton Bicycles, who will be offering his advice on our expert panel this afternoon. Join us at 1pm. How to join in the discussion Make sure you are a registered user of the Guardian (if not, it’s quick to register) and join us in the comments section below on Thursday, 26 April, from 1-2pm (BST). How to submit a question You can post questions in the comments section below during the chat. Or you can send questions in advance by emailing emma.sheppard.casual@theguardian.com (please include Finding my USP in the subject line) or by tweeting us at @guardian_B2B with your question (using #FindingmyUSP). You can also post questions in the comments section at anytime before the chat, or in the comments sections of Facebook and LinkedIn. The panel will take a look when it begins. Entrepreneurs launching new businesses will often face direct competition from the market. It’s rare that products or services are wholly unique or start a movement all on their own. Competition is not always a bad thing – the fact that a profitable market already exists is often seen as an opportunity by investors, and customers are more likely to be aware your product or service exists. But finding a unique selling point (USP) in a crowded market can be tricky. Making sure people know about it can be even trickier. How do you make best use of what you have to offer? How do you compete with bigger companies that know your market inside out? Many British businesses are making waves, at home and abroad. In this webchat, we will discuss how you can make the most of your strengths in a crowded market, what challenges you will need to overcome, and the help you should seek along the way. Questions we’ll be looking to cover in this webchat include: What does it take for an entrepreneur to be successful in a crowded market? What makes a good USP? What’s the best way to compete in a market with established players? Can your business succeed if it doesn’t have a USP? How should your marketing or branding strategy differ when faced with a crowded market? What do investors look for when it comes to backing a new business with a lot of competition?

In the film, La Enfermedad del Domingo (Sunday’s Illness), an abandoned daughter confronts her well-to-do mother in a remote mountain village. The film’s director, Ramón Salazar, has a knack for epic melodrama that has drawn comparisons with the work of Pedro Almodóvar. “It was a fantastic film, and one that is made to be seen in cinema,” says Binns. “But it was only when I was sitting there watching it that I noticed the logo.” Alongside the name of the film’s Spanish production company, there rose the ubiquitous – and increasingly divisive – mark of Netflix. The streaming giant, which this week announced it has more than 125 million global subscribers, had financed the film. Binns immediately knew this drastically reduced her chances of getting anywhere near it. “We went straight to the producer to try to work out a way – in Spain, they are doing a theatrical release – but Netflix didn’t want to do anything else,” she adds. Instead, Netflix will add La Enfermedad del Domingo to its dizzying carousel of content in June, where users may enjoy it at home. “I don’t object to Netflix as a business,” says Binns, who is a subscriber herself. “But for a film like that to show just on a platform and not the big screen is just so depressing. It’s a disgrace.” Binns’ feelings echo an epic tussle in the global film and TV industries. Last week, a spat between Netflix and the European cinema establishment erupted a month before the Cannes film festival. The company, which declined to answer questions, only occasionally shows its movies in handfuls of cinemas, partly to make them eligible for awards. Even then, the films are made available for home viewing at the same time, a sacrilege in the world of cinema. Now the industry fears for the future of a business model – and an art form. The Netflix logo was greeted with boos at Cannes last year during screenings of Okja and The Meyerowitz Stories, acclaimed films that were eligible for the Palme d’Or. “When we selected these two films, I thought I could convince Netflix to release them in [French] cinemas,” Thierry Frémaux, Cannes’ artistic director, told the Hollywood Reporter last month. “I was presumptuous; they refused.” After further protests, Frémaux banned Netflix from competition. Last week, Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer at Netflix, breezily announced that Netflix would skip Cannes rather than show films out of competition. The festival had “set the tone”, he told Variety. “We are choosing to be about the future of cinema. If Cannes is choosing to be stuck in the history of cinema, that’s fine.” Cultural chasms have opened along the Croisette before, but this time the old guard is facing a rapidly evolving digital beast that can afford to dismiss the most prestigious festival in the business. Sarandos was so relaxed withdrawing that he found time to needle Frémaux. After the festival chief had also banned selfies on the Cannes red carpet (they “tarnish the quality and tempo of the ascending of the steps”), Sarandos wondered “what other advances in media Frémaux would like to address”. At the heart of the tension is Netflix’s growth this year. According to the new figures, the company added 7.4 million new subscribers between January and March. In the next few weeks, more than half of its viewers will be outside the US. (Only China, Crimea, North Korea and Syria lie beyond its reach.) Revenue has also grown 43% in the past year to $3.7bn (£2.6bn). Moreover, after two decades of sharing other people’s films and TV shows, gathering priceless consumer data in the process, Netflix is financing its own content in unprecedented quantities. This year, the company is spending $8bn on content, including 700 original TV shows and 80 movies, more than twice as many as any other studio – and almost five times the BBC’s annual spending on television. But to what extent is Netflix’s tightening grip on our screens irresistible, and how does the company’s culture – built around its sage-like founder and CEO, Reed Hastings – explain its success? Because, apart from the protectionist cries of cinephiles, Netflix is facing a coming onslaught from new- and old-world rivals. Streaming services, such as Amazon, Hulu and Apple, are investing fast, while – perhaps most significantly – Disney is pulling its own content from Netflix before its planned launch of a rival streaming platform late next year. “I think it’s going to be fascinating to watch,” says US journalist Gina Keating, author of Netflixed: The Epic Battle for America’s Eyeballs. When the book was published in 2012, that battle had been Netflix v Blockbuster, followed by one with HBO. Netflix had started as a DVD rent-by-post operation in 1997, mushrooming in the early 2000s. But Hastings, a Boston-born computer scientist, was biding his time. In 2002, Netflix said in the government filing attached to its first sale of shares: “When appropriate, [we] believe that we are well-positioned to offer digital distribution to our subscribers.” This was three years before YouTube was born, when dial-up internet was still common and when Netflix had just 600,000 DVD subscribers. (And it was five years before that, it is worth noting, that Hastings had decided to call his company Netflix.) “He is why I wanted to write the book,” Keating says of Hastings. “I had watched him consistently make call after call that nobody on Wall Street thought were good ideas – and he just knew. He just didn’t care when his share price tanked and I’d never seen a CEO like that.” Keating says the data Netflix has amassed – what its viewers like, how long they watch, when they watch – is “everything”. She adds: “They constantly have a finger on the pulse, and the demand curve that they have observed allows them to project into the future in a way that I don’t know anyone in any other industry can do … I just don’t think anybody knew what effect this model would have on how that content is created.” Gareth Neame has watched that transformation during more than 20 years in British television, having worked at both the BBC and independent production companies. He commissioned series including Spooks, State of Play and Hustle. In terms of funding, he says, “one way or another, a producer usually got to about £1m an hour”. That model endured until Neame made Downton Abbey for ITV. It marked a watershed for British drama abroad, particularly in the US, where PBS was a joint producer – and for a new form of lucrative collaboration. “The UK broadcasters are still spending up to about £850,000 an hour today, but, rather than that forming 80% or 90% of the budget, it’s now more like 50% or even 30%,” Neame says. The model shifted again when Netflix and others began bulk-buying content to satisfy its subscribers. Producers had yet another revenue stream and they began financing shows in anticipation of a streaming deal, pushing budgets and quality higher still. This increased Netflix’s subscriptions – and its own spending power once it began making its own shows. (The Crown, made for Netflix by the British production company Left Bank Pictures, has a budget of more than £10m an episode.) The centre of gravity has shifted and, for TV and film-makers, Netflix has become an attractive home. In 2015, BBC Two and BBC America showed the first series of The Last Kingdom, a big-budget drama based on Bernard Cornwell’s Saxon Stories. Neame had made it for the BBC, but Netflix came calling and found the show an enthusiastic global audience. “The first season didn’t break through on BBC America, but it did on Netflix in the US,” Neame says. So Netflix replaced BBC America for the second series, co-producing it with the BBC and Carnival. This month, Carnival announced that the third series of The Last Kingdom will be an exclusive production for Netflix. “Their mission seems to be to back storytellers and let them get on with it,” Neame says. For fledgling film-makers, that support can often be the difference between making a film and not. For years, Adam Randall, a British director, struggled to find funding for iBoy, a sci-fi teen thriller adapted from a 2010 young adult novel. By 2015, he and his producer had raised just $600,000. Then Netflix got hold of the script. “We got on the phone in early 2016 and an hour later they were on board,” Randall says. “They raised the budget to roughly $1.5m.” iBoy, released on Netflix in January last year, was the first British Netflix Original film. Had he made it without Netflix, with half the budget, Randall thinks the film, a London-set genre piece for teens, might have struggled to win the interest of distributors or festivals. “To get to a young audience with Netflix was perfect and it has been seen by a much wider international audience than I could ever have hoped for,” he says. Yet, beyond the premium originals Netflix now churns out, reruns of shows such as Friends, The Office and Gossip Girl still drive as much as 80% of the service’s traffic, according to analysis last October by the research firm Nielsen. As Netflix commissions so much, partly to keep its virtual shelves filled in case other content providers follow Disney out the door, do producers and directors fear getting lost in the crowd? James Murdoch, CEO of 21st Century Fox, said last year that Netflix and Amazon were “where shows go to die”. Netflix doesn’t reveal audience figures, even to programme-makers. “There’s a bit of a mystery to it, but if it works they say: ‘It works and we want [more of] it,’” Neame says. “It’s about living in the modern age of engagement on Twitter and Facebook, and the ways people consume now. It’s still nice to get your artwork on to the front of the Radio Times, but that’s not as important as it was five years ago.” For Netflix itself, under-the-radar content is as much a part of the business model as hits such as House of Cards and Stranger Things. “While it might be inconceivable for an old-style network to greenlight a series that appeals to 0.5% of its viewers, for Netflix, if that series is the reason that 0.5% choose to subscribe, that is enough to justify it,” Joshua Gans, an Australian economist and expert in competition policy, said in the Harvard Business Review last October. Disney’s streaming service, for which it is making Star Wars TV shows, appears to set the studio against Netflix in an epic battle for eyeballs, not least after its planned acquisition of 21st Century Fox. But not every industry observer sees it that way. “The reality is that Amazon, Hulu and even Apple are already further along than Disney,” says Rich Greenfield, a Silicon Valley analyst at San Francisco trading firm BTIG. “I think it’s a highly entrepreneurial culture that’s about a willingness to sacrifice near-term profits to win long-term.” Legacy media companies have neither the stomach nor culture to truly take on that fight, Greenfield believes. Nor do they have Netflix’s data, which will require a big additional investment in old-school marketing for Disney and others. And Netflix is big in that game, too. In January, the company said it would increase its marketing budget to $2bn. This month, it was reported that Netflix is bidding more than $300m for a billboard company in the heart of Hollywood. The reported move, which neither party commented on, appeared to reflect Netflix’s rampant growth strategy – but also the devil-may-care attitude that was evident in Cannes. “If it’s true, it would seem to confirm the idea in Hollywood that Netflix is taking over the world,” Keating says of the billboard ploy. The company’s culture has been an object of speculation for years, fuelled in part by its publication, in 2009, of a “freedom and responsibility” slide show for would-be employees (in January, the company had 5,500 employees globally). Last year, it updated and shortened the document, setting itself apart from the Silicon Valley archetype of free lunches and ping-pong tables with a tougher, more grownup atmosphere. Managers frequently judge teams against a “keeper test”; if Jim, say, were planning to leave, would you fight to keep him? If not, employees are “promptly and respectfully given a generous severance package”. “They describe themselves as being like a pro sports team,” Keating adds. Several former Netflix employees declined to contribute to this article. But where will Netflix’s win-at-all-costs mentality take it – and audiences? Hastings himself has committed only to doing more of the same, but many watchers see an eventual route into live TV, news and sports broadcasting as streaming services continue to grind down old broadcasters and channels. Netflix and other streaming services will become TV as we know it. “I also think we’ll see more experimentation with virtual reality and user-generated plot twists,” Keating says, pointing out the advantages a tech-first company would have in doing so. In the meantime, Netflix has work to do if it wants to make friends in the industries it is shaking up. The company’s logo may not be featuring at Cannes next month, but its executives will be there, buying yet more content. “I think everyone is frightened about the new world order,” says Binns at Picturehouse Cinemas, who will also be at the festival. “I just hope people start to recognise that we need to be talking to each other and working out a way of making sure we’re not killing the cinema.” This article was amended on 18 April 2018 to correct the spelling of Ted Sarandos.

Vanishing ice convulses Alaskans' way of life","bodyText":"A few days before Christmas last year, Harry Brower, mayor of Alaska’s North Slope Borough, was at home when he heard a stunning noise – the sound of waves lapping at the shore. The sound was as wrenching and misplaced as hearing hailstones thud into the Sahara. Until fairly recently, the Arctic ocean regularly froze up hard up against the far north coast of Alaska by October. In 2017, it wasn’t until the final few days of the year that the ice encased the waves. “We’ve had a few warmer days in the past but there was nothing like the past winter,” said Anne Jensen, an anthropologist who has worked in Utqiaġvik, the US’s most northerly town, for the past three decades. It was so warm that the snow melted on Jensen’s roof, causing it to leak. “This year’s winter stuck out, insanely. It was crazy. Even the younger people noticed that this is something that hasn’t happened before.” A certain stoicism is required to live in the North Slope Borough, an area of sprawling tundra larger than 39 of the 50 US states that takes in Alaska’s northern coast. The native Iñupiat population have carved out a life here in the brutal cold of the Arctic Circle for at least 4,000 years, subsisting on bowhead whales, seals and caribou. Utqiaġvik, formerly known as Barrow, is the largest of the region’s scattered settlements and remains a flinty and unforgiving frontier town despite the arrival of the internet, buzzy snowmobiles and exotic vegetables (a pineapple costs around $9.50 (£6.70) at the main grocery store). But the past winter, following a string of warm years, points to a pace of change not before experienced by this community. The winter was the warmest on record in the Arctic, with sea ice extent hitting record lows in January and February, ending up at the second-smallest seasonal peak in the 39-year satellite record in March. The smallest was in 2017. The Bering Sea, which separates Alaska and Russia, lost a third of its winter ice in just eight February days. Otherworldly temperatures were felt across the region, with the weather station closest to the North Pole spending more than 60 hours above freezing in February, around 25C (45F) warmer than normal, which is equivalent to Washington DC spending a February day at 35C (95F) or Miami baking at 51C (124F). The Arctic was, in spells, warmer than much of Europe. Utqiaġvik, pronounced oot-ki-ahh-vik or “place where snowy owls are hunted”, got to -1C, around 22C warmer than normal. In December, the temperature readings from the weather station at Utqiaġvik were so freakish that it triggered an automatic shutdown of the system to protect the data from “artificial” figures. It temporarily wiped a year’s worth of numbers. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration called the incident an “ironic exclamation point” to the climate change gripping the Arctic, which is warming at twice the rate of the global average. This winter’s extreme warmth was, in part, driven by an unusual number of storms in the Atlantic that brought balmier air to the Arctic. But scientists warned that 2017 and 2018 should not be dismissed as mere outliers. “There’s no reason why this sort of warmth won’t continue. Within the lifetime of middle-aged adults, the Arctic has completely changed,” said Rick Thoman, a Noaa climate scientist based in Fairbanks, Alaska. “The magnitude of change is utterly unprecedented. For a lot of the people who live there, it’s completely shocking.” The changes are potentially existential on the north slope, where sea ice provides a crucial platform for catching and hauling in whales – a key food source and cultural totem for the Iñupiat. The spring whale hunt, where emerging cracks, or “leads”, in the sea ice funnel whales into the path of waiting hunting crews, requires dependable environmental cycles that have served the Iñupiat for thousands of years. “All the indications are there will be a very early loss of ice this year,” Thoman said. “In the 1990s they could do whale hunting in Utqiaġvik up until May or even June. There’s no real chance of that now – the ice will probably start breaking up by early May. “Native peoples of Alaska are very resilient; they’ve lived here for many millennia for a reason. Some will have to move, hunting will have to change. It can be done but it won’t be easy, it won’t be cheap. There will be a big cost, both financially and culturally.” Utqiaġvik is wrestling with a number of climate impacts. Its coastline, increasingly shorn of sea ice, is eroding at a concerning rate. The melting of permafrost, long-frozen soils that scientists forecast could end up releasing huge amounts of carbon, is causing some buildings to slump, their walls radiating with cracks. But it’s the potential threat to the whale quota that causes most angst. Slain whales need to be quickly pulled up on to the sea ice and butchered before the cetaceans’ cooling systems halt and they essentially cook from within. Lack of thick, multi-year ice could hinder the haul-out. Caught whales could even fall through the ice if it’s too thin. “A couple of years ago the ice was rubble, it was just breaking up,” said Nagruk Harcharek, who has spent many of his 33 years whaling near Utqiaġvik. “It was really late this year and everyone noticed. I’d be lying if I said people aren’t worried. “Some families rely upon whales for their food. It’s so central to our culture. The spring hunt is spiritual – sitting out there on the ice edge is pretty quiet. There’s the unknown. There’s not much going on. You’re watching, waiting.” Other heritage is already being lost, with archaeological sites along the coast being washed away at a quickening rate. In September, a major storm crunched into the coast and threatened Birnirk, a village that was inhabited for 1,000 years and is a national historic landmark. “It’s very, very grim,” said Jensen, who has worked to excavate and protect several sites. “Most of the coastal sites will be gone in the next 10 to 15 years if the rate of erosion keeps up.” Across Alaska, dozens of coastal towns are at risk of becoming uninhabitable, with a handful actively seeking to relocate. Melting permafrost is buckling roads into potentially deadly big dipper rollercoasters, as well as threatening to dislodge doses of locked-up mercury. Glaciers near Denali, the tallest mountain in the US, are disappearing faster than at any time in the past 400 years. The Alaskan government recently warned this bewildering rate of change risks the physical and mental health of its citizens, citing a condition called solastalgia, the distress caused by severe disruption to the environment near home. “Alaska is on the frontlines of climate change,” Bill Walker, the state’s governor, warned last year. Walker, an independent, has convened a panel to come up with some sort of climate change strategy by September. Somehow, it will have to suggest a way forward that doesn’t rattle its economically important oil and gas industry, which has received staunch support from a Trump administration that has started to dismantle help for those pummeled by rising seas and storms. For a reliably Republican state, polling shows unusual numbers of Alaskans are concerned about climate change and, at least sometimes, openly fret over its consequences. “People are feeling the impacts of climate change, we hear that on a daily basis,” said Nikoosh Carlo, the governor’s climate adviser. “It’s a non-partisan issue here. For some communities, the next storm could wipe out critical infrastructure.” The lack of any federal or state plan to deal with the looming climate crisis isn’t causing mass panic in Utqiaġvik, at least. “We are capable of adapting to any changes,” said Charlie Hopson, a veteran Utqiaġvik whaler. “We’ve been around for thousands of years and we’re going to keep living. We do our own thing here. The government doesn’t know shit. We don’t need them.” On Sunday read how weird wildlife is venturing to northern Alaska in the second dispatch from Oliver Milman’s trip."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/18/migrants-britain-city-greed-union-cleaners-tate-modern","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T05:00:18Z","webTitle":"Here’s another job for migrants in Britain – taking on the City’s greed | Aditya Chakrabortty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/18/migrants-britain-city-greed-union-cleaners-tate-modern","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/18/migrants-britain-city-greed-union-cleaners-tate-modern","fields":{"headline":"Here’s another job for migrants in Britain – taking on the City’s greed","bodyText":"Late last Saturday afternoon, and the queue is growing outside Tate Modern. They’re here for the exhibition of Picasso 1932: Love, Fame, Tragedy. There’s no ducking the sponsor, EY (Ernst &amp; Young): its name is emblazoned on ads, plastered across the gallery cafe and on every £22 ticket (dropping to a mere £20 if you’re unemployed). All is audio-guided, gift-shopped and regimented with a smile. Until a siren goes off. Massed outside the gallery’s doors are around three dozen people. They are beating drums, blaring on vuvuzelas. A megaphone tells us that at the City firm bankrolling this exhibition, office cleaners face losing their jobs to save a bit of cash; that same business raked in tens of billions of pounds in revenue last year. Cleaners chant: “Ernst &amp; Young, shame on you!” One of Britain’s biggest museums has turned into something between an industrial dispute and a carnival. After obediently filing past framed pictures and curated erudition, European baby boomers happily rubberneck these largely Latin-American protesters. A boy behind me whispers to his mum, “What on earth is going on?” One security guard tries to clear the hall, before capitulating to the general impassiveness. Smiling down on the scene must be Pablo himself, lifelong communist and author of the aphorism, “Art is never chaste. Art is dangerous.” After a half-hour standoff, the cleaners are cajoled out, still megaphoning and handing out leaflets. Smartphone cameras are flashing every few seconds. What those pictures capture are the extraordinary beginnings of a vital battle. Saturday’s protest was staged by the Independent Workers of Great Britain: a tiny, scrappy trade union I’ve been reporting on since 2011 as it has fought for the rights of cleaners and cycle couriers and Uber drivers. It has faced down smug university vice-chancellors and lavishly paid bosses of outsourcing companies – and, time after time, bulldozed them into defeat. In a political culture that mists up over the white working class, the IWGB has been one of the few outfits to cotton on to the fact that in today’s London, a working-class person will as likely as not be a migrant woman, battling not just class snobbery and sexist behaviour but on occasion racist bile to boot. Along with others, such as the equally small and scrappy United Voices of the World, it has changed the face of industrial relations in our booming zero-hours jobs market. “The old complacent union logic says: ‘These migrant workers can’t organise, and if they do organise they can’t win’,” says Jamie Woodcock, an Oxford University researcher on precarious work. “And what these tiny unions have shown is, actually, they can do both.” In keeping with IWGB tradition, this fight is directed against both the office where the cleaners actually work and their direct employer, the outsourcing company ISS, which they fear is seeking to make them redundant. The union’s custom is to make these “invisible”, low-paid workers visible. Only now, by flashmobbing art shows sponsored by EY, are Britain’s precarious workers taking on their biggest and most important targets yet. EY and ISS are both multibillion-dollar global companies that service other massive multinationals. They help shape the business world the rest of us have to live in. Where university managers ineptly ape private-sector practices such as outsourcing, EY invents and markets them. On its website is a typical PowerPoint presentation that lists the benefits of outsourcing for its clients: no social security contributions, no employee protection laws and no protection against dismissal. Employers can shuck off all such tiresome responsibilities, leaving the rest of society to pick up the tab by topping up poverty pay, stumping up for welfare benefits and plugging the tax gap. But then, EY can be a tad careless about its social obligations. These are the accountants who invented a £30m tax-avoidance scheme for big companies that the government defeated in court in 2016. As auditor for Google, it was hauled in front of MPs in 2013 to explain why the internet giant was paying so little tax in this country. It and the other big accountants were lashed in the resulting parliamentary report for displaying “no clarity” on where they “draw the line between acceptable tax planning and aggressive tax avoidance”. Yet the Tate is apparently happy to help EY launder its reputation by plastering its name as a sponsor of good works across the country. Neither organisation would say how much this sponsorship deal is worth (or, indeed, answer any of my other questions), but the gallery’s sponsorship deal with BP came in at £350,000 for most years between 2007 and 2011. So, at reportedly less than 0.5% of the Tate’s annual income, the company that brought us the giant oil spill of Deepwater Horizon bought itself a lot of reputation for a very reasonable price. EY claims its sponsorship of the Tate is part of its “commitment to building a better working world”. When I tell that to one of its cleaners, Isabella, she laughs sardonically. She helps clean its headquarters every evening. Wielding heavy vacuum cleaners has left her with a shoulder injury that makes it hard for her to sleep at night. The other thing that keeps her awake at night is the prospect of losing her job. That’s why we’re in her flat talking, even though she’s scared witless of reprisals from her employer. In the past few weeks, ISS has warned staff against “unofficial strikes” (there have been none, nor does the IWGB plan any). I have seen an ISS letter listing five different criminal offences related to industrial action. These threats mean I am not giving Isabella’s real name. Rather than answer questions about this correspondence, ISS said: “It is our sincere desire that we will avoid the need for redundancy and that suitable alternative employment can be found within ISS for any affected individual.” This makes the entire redundancy process sound like an accident the company is having to weather rather than cuts it is opting to make. Isabella’s two sparky daughters are in the flat’s one bedroom watching cartoons. Lose her job, and Isabella thinks they’ll have to move to a studio. But if her colleagues are let go instead, she will have to work far harder for the same money. EY’s only comment is that it supports the London Living Wage, “and this is part of our contractual agreement with ISS”. As it is, Isabella spends all her money on her daughters – she buys herself no clothes, no treats. She tells me about the office she cleans – “so fancy, with beautiful plants and paintings. Those people work in a magic circle.” As for herself, “I think I am at the bottom of society.” Imagine what it must be like to wake up every day feeling like this. Imagine going to work in one of the richest companies in one of the wealthiest cities in the world and coming away without a single penny to spend on yourself at the end of the month. Imagine losing even that in order to save two of the world’s biggest businesses a bit more money. Isabella joined a union only a month ago, and she is already attending meetings about how to fight the cuts. I remember her waving a placard in a museum where she had never previously spent a single afternoon. And I think that she and her colleagues may very well win their fight. • Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"media/2018/apr/17/fox-news-gives-sean-hannity-full-support-over-michael-cohen-revelation","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T19:32:02Z","webTitle":"Fox News gives Sean Hannity 'full support' over Michael Cohen revelation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/17/fox-news-gives-sean-hannity-full-support-over-michael-cohen-revelation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/apr/17/fox-news-gives-sean-hannity-full-support-over-michael-cohen-revelation","fields":{"headline":"Fox News gives Sean Hannity 'full support' over Michael Cohen revelation","bodyText":"Fox News gave Sean Hannity its “full support” on Tuesday, a day after the revelation that he was a client of Michael Cohen, Donald Trump’s embattled personal lawyer and a man the Fox star had vociferously defended on the news channel without disclosing the relationship. Hannity, Fox’s biggest draw, was revealed to be a client of Cohen’s at a court hearing on Monday – an announcement that drew gasps from those in court. Cohen’s offices, home and hotel were raided on 9 April by the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan as party of a criminal investigation into Trump’s lawyer. The conservative commentator has dedicated much of his primetime opinion show to supporting Trump and called the raid on Cohen’s office part of “an all-hands-on-deck effort to totally malign, and if possible, impeach the president of the United States”. He did not disclose his professional relationship with Cohen and fought over the weekend to keep his name out of court. In a statement Fox News said: “While Fox News was unaware of Sean Hannity’s informal relationship with Michael Cohen and was surprised by the announcement in court yesterday, we have reviewed the matter and spoken to Sean and he continues to have our full support.” Hannity has denied he was a client of Cohen’s and characterized his professional relationship with Cohen as trivial, stating that he asked him only for some small advice on property deals, never formally engaged him and “might have handed him 10 bucks”. But the potential conflict of interest has sparked criticism even on his own show. On Monday the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz told Hannity: “I want to say that I really think that you should have disclosed your relationship with Cohen when you talked about him on this show.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/apr/18/is-primarks-owner-too-big-and-diverse-to-fail-possibly","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"Is Primark's owner too big – and diverse – to fail?

Possibly","bodyText":"If Associated British Foods didn’t have a controlling shareholder, an uppity US hedge fund would probably have demanded the company be split into pieces years ago. Whitbread is somehow deemed offensively diverse because it owns Costa Coffee and Premier Inn, but take a look at AB Foods’ portfolio: it runs from sugar production around the globe, takes in grocery brands such as Twinings, Ovaltine and Kingsmill, and has spawned discount clothing chain Primark. Outside shareholders should give thanks for the refusal to bend to the demand for focus. Primark, one suspects, wouldn’t be the same conquering force without AB Foods’ willingness to experiment slowly, a quality that may flow from the 54.5% ownership by Wittington Investments, itself controlled by the charitable Garfield Weston Foundation. These days, Primark contributes just over half the group’s operating profits: £341m out of £648m at the half-year stage. Primark’s astonishing run hasn’t stopped the City fretting on two fronts. First, there is the worry that the chain’s refusal to sell online is a historic mistake. Second, is expansion into the US, graveyard of British retailers, a step too far? Amid the general gloominess about retailers, AB Foods’ share price had fallen by a fifth in six months before Tuesday’s 4% bounce. The US concern won’t be answered quickly since some of the nine stores in the north-east have been open for less than a year. The company admits it is still tweaking ranges to improve sales densities. But the news that Primark is already looking to open a store in Florida suggests something is going right in the US. As for the supposed threat from online rivals, it’s hard to spot. Like-for-like for sales fell 1.5%, not helped by cold European weather, but the UK was up 3%. Between sermons on the effect on sugar prices from the end of EU quotas, management offered a persuasive argument that pinging promotional videos across Instagram is a smarter way to drive Primark sales than shouldering the distribution costs of an online shop. The store-only logic probably only applies at the cut-price end of the clothing market and, eventually, even Primark may have to rethink. But there’s currently no reason to mess with a formula that, even in a soft half-year, produced a profit margin of almost 10%. Most of the online-only brigade would love that. Intu takeover: time to call it off? Sadly for Intu, the shopping centre group, there aren’t more Primarks. If there were, the owner of Lakeside and Trafford Centre wouldn’t have felt obliged to make an extended plea that everything in the world of malls is lovely, despite the rise of Amazon and the troubles of the likes of New Look, Toys R Us and Prezzo. The point of the breathless release about “record retail demand” and “increased rents” in its centres, one assumes, was to try to convince Hammerson not to walk away from its £3.4bn bid for Intu. That cause isn’t completely hopeless since Hammerson chairman David Tyler would happily seal the deal if he had a free hand. He shares the view that good shopping centres have a decent future. The trouble is, Tyler and Hammerson’s board must know their adventure is in deep trouble. Dutch pension fund group APG, the second-biggest shareholder in Hammerson with a 7% stake, is opposed to the Intu purchase and it won’t be alone. Put simply, many Hammerson investors think their own company’s assets, including Brent Cross and Birmingham Bullring, are superior to Intu’s estate with its rump of smaller centres. They can’t see the appeal of diluting the mix via an all-share takeover. Tyler &amp; co were right to reject the under-priced approach for Hammerson itself from French group Klépierre, but their shareholders’ patience is wearing thin. If Intu won’t renegotiate terms, call the whole thing off. Time for a new broom at WPP? None of the names being thrown around as a potential next chief executive for WPP sounds worth a bet. Jeremy Darroch of Sky? Why would he want it? He’s made a fortune at Sky and untangling Sir Martin Sorrell’s creation would be a very different gig. Adam Crozier, lately of ITV and once of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, seems happy on the non-executive circuit. Andrew Robertson, chief of advertising agency BBDO, has been floated, but importing a long-serving big name from a direct rival would be risky at a company with a culture as distinct as WPP’s. Almost by default, an internal pick – with Mark Read, one of the stand-in chief operating officers, the obvious name – starts as favourite. But one suspects shareholders would prefer an outsider with zero attachment to WPP’s current structure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/17/everton-fans-assess-sam-allardyce-abilities-manager-zero-hero","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T17:17:28Z","webTitle":"Zero or hero?

Everton fans to assess Sam Allardyce’s abilities as manager","bodyText":"Everton have sent a survey to season-ticket holders and club members asking them to rate Sam Allardyce’s ability to “get the best out of the team” on a scale of zero to 10. The question about the team manager is part of a wide-ranging survey designed to shape the club’s engagement strategy with supporters. A questionnaire has been emailed to members of the fans’ panel seeking opinions on the direction of the club, match-day experience, the team and the senior management at Goodison Park. On Allardyce supporters are asked to rate his performance on the basis of: “I have a high level of trust in the current manager and coaching staff of Everton eg, in making the right decisions to get the best out of the team.” Ratings range from zero – “completely disagree” – to 10 – “completely agree”. The survey also asks fans to rate their trust in Everton players “being loyal and performing at their best” and the club’s leadership in “making the right decisions for the club’s future”. Belief in the direction of the club, whether or not Everton are portrayed fairly by the media and how strongly fans feel connected to the club are additional questions. Everton have endured a dreadful season having embarked on the biggest spending spree in their history last summer and, while the club’s reversal predates Allardyce’s appointment in November, Ronald Koeman’s successor as manager has attracted fierce criticism. Allardyce was again barracked by Evertonians during the 1-1 draw at Swansea City on Saturday and, despite planning for next season and being under contract until 2019, doubt surrounds his position at Goodison. The club sent the same questions to the panel at the end of last season in response to the Premier League reducing the range of questions in their fans’ survey. Everton intend to use the results to shape communication with supporters on what emerges as the most important issues at the club."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/17/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-inquiry-new-york-attorney-general","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T18:56:38Z","webTitle":"Cryptocurrency: New York launches inquiry, saying people lack 'basic facts'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/17/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-inquiry-new-york-attorney-general","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/17/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-inquiry-new-york-attorney-general","fields":{"headline":"Cryptocurrency: New York launches inquiry, saying people lack 'basic facts'","bodyText":"The New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, launched an inquiry into cryptocurrency exchanges on Tuesday arguing that consumers often don’t have access to “basic facts” about how they operate. Schneiderman described the inquiry into the policies and practices of platforms used by consumers to trade cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as part of a broader effort to protect cryptocurrency investors and consumers. “With cryptocurrency on the rise, consumers in New York and across the country have a right to transparency and accountability when they invest their money,” Schneiderman said. “Yet too often, consumers don’t have the basic facts they need to assess the fairness, integrity, and security of these trading platforms.” The New York prosecutor said his investigators had sent out letters to leading exchange platforms, including Coinbase, requesting disclosures on their operations and conflicts of interest. The prosecutor described virtual currency as a “highly speculative sector, featuring significant volatility, instability, and risk. Moreover, published reports indicate the sector has attracted fraudsters, market manipulators, and thieves.” As the state’s chief law enforcement agency, Schneiderman said in a press release, it is his office’s responsibility to protect “consumers and investors from these bad actors and ensuring the fairness and integrity of New York’s financial markets”. The moves comes as regulators and banking officials express increasing concern at the wild ride some investors have experienced with the nascent digital currencies and the exchanges that consumers use to access them. Early on Tuesday, Bitcoin shot up in value by more than $1,000 in a surge that came after months of decline that has reduced the value of a single token from near $20,000 to around $7,000. Bitcoin’s rise to $8,000 came as Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) touted the global benefits of cryptocurrency. The IMF chief said cryptocurrencies could enable fast and inexpensive transactions, while the underlying blockchain technology could make financial markets safer. “Just as a few technologies that emerged from the dotcom era have transformed our lives, the crypto assets that survive could have a significant impact on how we save, invest and pay our bills,” Lagarde wrote in the blogpost. But Lagarde warned that “before crypto-assets can transform financial activity in a meaningful and lasting way, they must earn the confidence and support of consumers and authorities”. “An important initial step will be to reach a consensus within the global regulatory community on the role crypto-assets should play. Because crypto-assets know no boundaries, international cooperation will be essential.” In a separate blogpost last month, Lagarde warned of the “peril of crypto-assets”. The problems she described included the emergence of sites like AlphaBay, “the largest online criminal marketplace on the internet” that was shut down by US authorities last year. Lagarde wrote she was also concerned by “the rapid growth of crypto-assets, the extreme volatility in their traded prices, and their ill-defined connections to the traditional financial world could easily create new vulnerabilities”. The virtues of decentralization and anonymity were also what made crypto-currencies so dangerous. “The result is a potentially major new vehicle for money laundering and the financing of terrorism,” she wrote. Lagarde said that European authorities, including the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) were already looking at what new rules might be needed to meet the advancements in financial technology."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/24/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-amy-chozick-chasing-hillary-book","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T04:01:09Z","webTitle":"Hillary Clinton unleashed foul-mouthed tirade in Trump debate prep session","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/24/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-amy-chozick-chasing-hillary-book","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/24/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-amy-chozick-chasing-hillary-book","fields":{"headline":"Hillary Clinton unleashed foul-mouthed tirade in Trump debate prep session","bodyText":"Hillary Clinton unleashed a “fuck-laced fusillade” on aides in a 2016 debate prep session, according to a new book about the presidential campaign by New York Times journalist Amy Chozick. The candidate was squirming with frustration over lingering concerns about her “authenticity” and racked with loathing for Donald Trump she was determined not to vent in public. “Aides understood that in order to keep it all together onstage, Hillary sometimes needed to unleash on them in private,” Chozick writes in Chasing Hillary: Ten Years, Two Presidential Campaigns and One Intact Glass Ceiling. “‘You want authentic, here it is!’ she’d yelled in one prep session, followed by a fuck-laced fusillade about what a ‘disgusting’ human being Trump was and how he didn’t deserve to even be in the arena.” Rife with such anecdotes, Chozick’s book, a copy of which the Guardian obtained from a bookseller in New York, is released on Tuesday. It comes hard on the heels of the current politics blockbuster, A Higher Loyalty by James Comey. The former FBI director devotes a chapter of his book to his handling of the Clinton emails investigation, which the candidate and her team still blame for her loss. Chozick captures the reaction in the campaign’s Brooklyn headquarters to what they saw as Comey’s reckless and misguided behavior. “Brooklyn is freaking the fuck out,” Chozick recalls telling an editor. Eleven days before the election, Comey had written a letter informing Congress that the FBI was investigating emails that had turned up on the computer of Anthony Weiner, the disgraced estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Chozick reveals that an unnamed top Clinton donor had previously confronted Abedin, pleading with her to step aside for Clinton’s sake in 2013, when a second sexting scandal involving Weiner broke out. “I’m good at what I do and that’s Hillary’s decision,” Abedin replied. The struggle inside the Clinton campaign for message clarity is starkly illustrated by Chozick with a three-page section listing 84 possible slogans the campaign considered but discarded. Rejects included “You’ve earned a fair chance”, “A new bargain we can count on” and the succinct “No quit”. Apart from issues with authenticity and messaging, the campaign struggled with an internal generation gap that spawned disagreements on everything from basic strategy to the question of how to handle Trump’s attack over sexual assault allegations against Bill Clinton, Chozick reports. Campaign manager Robby Mook, who was 36 years old on election night, “always listened patiently, respectfully” to the two-term president talk about campaign strategy, Chozick writes. “But [Mook] mostly saw in the former president a relic, a brilliant tactician of a bygone era. “Behind his back, Robby did a Bill impersonation (‘And let me tell you another thing about the white working class …’) waving a finger in a Clintonian motion.” Hillary Clinton reportedly “erupted” when Chozick reported in January 2016 that the actress and writer Lena Dunham, a prominent supporter and 29 at the time, told a Manhattan dinner party “she was disturbed by how, in the 1990s, the Clintons and their allies discredited women” who had accused Bill Clinton of misconduct. The former president, meanwhile, was painfully aware of Trump’s potential appeal in territory he thought of as his own, Chozick reports. “By late February,” she writes, “Bill went red in the face on almost daily conference calls trying to warn Brooklyn that Trump had a shrewd understanding of the angst that so many voters – his voters, the white working class whom Clinton brought back to the Democratic party in 1992 – were feeling.” But Hillary Clinton failed to collect many of those voters, skipping their states as she made campaign stops and alienating some with her grouping of certain Trump supporters in a “basket of deplorables”, a line Chozick reports the candidate liked and deployed at big-ticket fundraisers from New York to Los Angeles. “In the Hamptons, Hillary felt loved,” Chozick writes. Clinton, however, grew weary of hearing pollsters report on her lagging favorability. “Oh what’s the point? They’re never going to like me,” she told a friend at one point, according to Chozick. In the end, nearly 3 million more voters liked Clinton’s message – the slogan the campaign went with was Stronger Together – than Trump’s promise to Make America Great Again. But it wasn’t enough to win."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/02/local-elections-havering-brexit-stronghold-immigration-less-of-an-issue-now","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T19:14:11Z","webTitle":"In Brexit stronghold of Havering, immigration is less of an issue now","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/02/local-elections-havering-brexit-stronghold-immigration-less-of-an-issue-now","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/02/local-elections-havering-brexit-stronghold-immigration-less-of-an-issue-now","fields":{"headline":"In Brexit stronghold of Havering, immigration is less of an issue now","bodyText":"Last summer a row erupted over Havering council’s plan to split from the rest of London. The motion, tabled by a Ukip councillor and dubbed “Hexit”, was an attempt to solve the east London borough’s so-called “identity crisis”. “It was laughed out of the chamber,” says Fay Hough, the 30-year-old Labour candidate for the Rainham &amp; Wennington ward in the upcoming local elections, “because there were no positives. We would have lost funding, the London living wage, even the Freedom pass.” The vote, Hough adds, was part of a trend in which Labour’s opposition has billed the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, as a figure of dislike from whom they want a divorce. A recent Tory campaign to “Keep Havering Safe”, for example, was accused of “dog-whistle racism” after leaflets were distributed warning that the borough could soon resemble diverse “inner city” areas under Khan. “I think there are local politicians who are playing on people’s fear of difference,” says Kim Arrowsmith, another Labour candidate. “The demographic of the area is changing, and over time that will make that kind of politics very difficult to sell. The fear will dissipate.” Havering was one of London’s most pro-Brexit areas, with 70% of the borough’s population voting leave in the EU referendum. As a pro-Europe party, Labour was almost wiped out in the last local elections and currently holds only two out of 54 council seats. But while the predominance of successful candidates from residents associations means the party is unlikely to win control from the Tories, it hopes to make gains and believes the decline of Ukip could prove to be helpful. Immigration, the candidates say, is less of an issue now, with housing and crime coming up most often on the doorstep. “We’ve got a bidding system for council housing which is seen as not-fit-for-purpose,” says Arrowsmith. “And a lot of privately rented places aren’t accepting benefits any more. What I find comes up a lot is single mums who can’t work full-time but can’t rent a place.” “And I’ve had a few people who say ‘my 28-year-old daughter’s still living with me at home, there’s no way she can afford to move in on her own’,” says Hough, who has been volunteering for local MP Jon Cruddas’s office for two years. Havering is no stranger to regeneration, and estates are being knocked down to make way for new developments. But Labour say there are no assurances of right to return. The borough is also the site of Orchard Village, a housing development so plagued with issues related to building quality that it has faced calls for demolition. On the streets of Rainham, which the candidates call “the forgotten part of Havering”, most of the people who open the door are friendly and responsive. “Crime often comes up,” says Nicholas West, a 23-year-old prospective Labour councillor. “The anxiety last summer was so extreme because of moped robberies. Knife crime has been an issue too. When I was growing up I had youth centres to go to, now there’s nothing for the kids. Over the Easter holidays the kids are just on the street bored. And that’s when they’re most vulnerable to being taken in by gangs.” A police station in the area had to recently shut because of cuts, West adds. All this plays into the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s strategy of putting housing and crime at the heart of his party’s bid to take over Tory local authorities. Such national politics can work for and against the local candidates on the doorstep, Arrowsmith says. “People sometimes say ‘you’re all the same’. National politics helped with that, because no one can say Labour and the Tories are the same any more. We’re seeing a much more positive picture because voters are ready for change. Jeremy represents a break from the past. The Tories really targeted Dagenham and Rainham in the general election but Jon Cruddas’ majority went up.” As we’re walking through Rainham, one woman stops us in the street. “Just so you know I’ll be voting Labour,” she says. “I’m a new member. I’ve worked in the public sector for 15 years. I just thought I’d stop you and say good luck.” “I swear we did not set that up,” Hough says cheerfully afterwards. “People are becoming more aware now. When I was door-knocking for Brexit, a few houses had massive Ukip posters saying ‘vote leave’. “I’ve door-knocked them recently and they’re all Labour. Work that one out.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/19/true-horror-review-dead-goats-ghostly-old-woman-scary-electricity-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T22:05:04Z","webTitle":"True Horror review – a few dead goats, a ghostly old woman and a scary electricity bill, but no terror","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/19/true-horror-review-dead-goats-ghostly-old-woman-scary-electricity-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/19/true-horror-review-dead-goats-ghostly-old-woman-scary-electricity-bill","fields":{"headline":"True Horror review – a few dead goats, a ghostly old woman and a scary electricity bill, but no terror","bodyText":"There is a certain type of television programme, just as there is a certain type of everything from restaurant to painting to handicrafted item, of which the best that can be said is that for those who like that sort of thing, that is the sort of thing they like. No one would have rolled her eyes harder than me at last night’s Hellfire Farm, the opening episode in Channel 4’s new docudrama series True Horror. This was the reconstructed-with-actors tale of the Sanders family, who moved to a farmhouse in the Brecon Beacons to allow Bill, artist husband of Liz, to turn an outbuilding into a studio and paint in the soft Cambrian light while children and lambs gambolled outside. Unfortunately, they found things going a bit more druidic than Sunday supplement. Blue streaks of electricity crackled round the house. Goats looked first bemused, then pained, then dead. The children didn’t notice anything amiss. They thought everyone could see the silent old woman who stood motionless in the corner of the playroom all the time. Kids are so stupid. The drama is interspersed with docu from some of the people who were there. Liz herself, Becca (one of her children), journalist Mark Chadbourn and pastor Matt Tricker, who is quite as disturbing a presence as any of the spooks and spectres on offer. “Wales is a very mystical place,” he says. “Witchcraft is on the rise … people trying to contact spirits. And that’s when they get into trouble, because they open doorways and spirits come through.” No, I thought, they don’t. And I kept thinking that as another minister reckoned that Bill’s books on the occult and his increasingly tortured and frenetically created paintings were also portals to the underworld, and as their pig’s madness was blamed on the spiritual infestation and the increased electricity bill was thought to be a sign of more of the same. Of course, I am not denying that electricity companies are a malign force; just that they are not anything other than a profoundly earthbound one. And that is the problem. You either believe in this sort of guff – in which case, the following hour should have had you gibbering with fear and clawing behind you for the holy water you surely keep to hand at all times – or you don’t. In which case you might start gibbering with rage instead, at the waste of time and resources devoted to shoring up the credulity and preying on the gullibility of others at a time when, frankly, we have got more than enough purveyors of idiocy in the world. I suspect that even for those who do like this sort of thing, it will have fallen short. The drama, chopped into messes as it was by the interviews, couldn’t build any real tension even if it had had more in its armoury than the very tamest of directorial and narrative weapons; one mildly gory scene and a few heavily telegraphed Big Boos! and that was yer basic horror-flicky lot. Any psychological terror was automatically dissipated by the fact that it depends on the protagonists’ subjective experience and interpretation of events. The minute you show that secret, black and midnight hag, she ceases to be a haunting suggestion of infinite depravity and evil and becomes an extra in a wig, about whom the most frightening thing is the suggestion that she is a Lamda graduate who once dreamed of giving her Hedda Gabler at the Royal Court. There is no doubt that the Sanders family were terrified by what they truly believe to be supernatural forces, and that it was a terrible experience that eventually drove them to leave their home and to divorce. But the question that most suggested itself to a non-supernaturalist was whether any of their experience might be put down to the possible effects of mental illness on a family. Bill’s “personality change”, obsessional painting and visions of bloodied bodies were blamed on malevolent spirits, but what if they were a manifestation of a disequilibrium within rather than an imbalance without? Was it possible to envisage a version of events in which his frustration at having to take on commissions rather than pursue “pure” art to help the family finances in the wake of those electricity bills – which, let us imagine for now, were the result of corporate incompetence rather than Cthulhu – deepened into something more serious? It wasn’t a programme that asked any questions or probed to any depth, which – particularly when added to the shambolic rendering of the Sanders’ genuine fear – did both the family and the viewer a great disservice. May a better spirit move through the rest of the series. Otherwise the whole thing will indeed be a true horror."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/19/on-the-pulse-why-beans-peas-and-lentils-are-making-a-comeback","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"On the pulse: why beans, peas and lentils are making a comeback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/19/on-the-pulse-why-beans-peas-and-lentils-are-making-a-comeback","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/19/on-the-pulse-why-beans-peas-and-lentils-are-making-a-comeback","fields":{"headline":"On the pulse: why beans, peas and lentils are making a comeback","bodyText":"Radical politics, psychedelic drugs, experimental sex: there were many dangers haunting nervous parents as they sent their children to university in the 1970s. But Jenny Chandler was warned about a different threat: “My father gave me this lecture about being sensible, not getting drunk at parties and never eating red kidney beans, because back then there was this whole thing about the toxins you have to boil out of [raw] red kidney beans. As a student, I was terrified of them.” Now a teacher and writer, author of the cookbook Pulse, and formerly the UN’s European ambassador during its 2016 pulse campaign, Chandler has overcome that fear in style. Yet pulses (dried legume seeds including lentils, chickpeas, beans and peas) still suffer from a serious image problem. Britain hoovers up hummus and baked beans, but, outside foodie circles, cooking with pulses – especially dried pulses, which need pre-soaking – is often regarded as too much hassle, for a food that is commonly portrayed as a right-on penance rather than a source of pleasure. Clean-eating’s wispy gurus have given many obscure health foods a glossy modern sheen, but, in pop cultural terms, the lentil’s most famous exponent remains Neil from The Young Ones. Yet, despite all that, quietly, British pulses are rising. I meet Chandler at the British Dal festival in Bristol, a new event held in March, funded by the British Edible Pulses Association (Bepa). A week-long patchwork of community events from lentil planting in Millennium Square to a dal cook-off at the closing Grand Dal Finale (attended by almost 1,000 people), it sought to celebrate all pulse stews, from mushy peas to chana dal. Fresh from a primary school dal cookery class and lunch at Bristol farmers’ market (where Thali Cafe gave away more than 200 portions of dal), Chandler is evangelical about pulses – be it dried or tinned. “They’re incredibly economical and versatile chameleons in that they’ll take on whatever Italian, Spanish, Mexican or Indian flavours you want, and they’re delicious,” she says. “They’re also nutritious, full of protein and fibre, and a no-brainer if you’re worried about gaining weight or blood-sugar levels because you’ve got this complex carbohydrate, slow-release energy. They keep you full for hours, and feeling content rather than sluggish.” Across town in Bristol’s staunchly indie Stokes Croft enclave, the eco-focused Poco Tapas is fully engaged with the potential of pulses. In particular, it is an early adopter of the UK-grown pulses distributed by Suffolk’s pioneering Hodmedod. A bustling, unvarnished bar-restaurant, Poco uses Hodmedod’s fava beans to make silky hummus and crisp, airy falafel, just as the Egyptians do. It also uses earthy carlin peas (AKA Lancashire’s black peas) in a dish of merguez sausage and labneh, and Hodmedod’s yellow split peas – larger than a lentil, but with that same creamy, melting quality – in its dal. “People overlook pulses because we’re brought up eating tins of overcooked processed pulses or sad, stale [dried pulses] which have sat in the cupboard for years,” says Poco co-owner Ben Pryor. “But when they’re fresh and high-quality, split peas or carlin peas can be an exceptional part of a meal. They’re the most amazing colour, shape and texture.” A diminutive cousin of the common broad bean, the fava bean has been grown here since the iron age. However, its fate in modern Britain (the best beans are exported to Egypt, most are sold as animal feed) encapsulates how UK pulses have faded. A hardcore of farmers take advantage of pulses’ nitrogen-fixing qualities to use them as a natural fertiliser in crop rotation, while a coterie pride themselves on growing traditional UK varieties, such as the marrowfat peas used in mushy peas. But pulses are grown on just 4% of UK arable land (cereals take up more than 50%) and many farmers grow pulses only sporadically, when prices rise. Currently, we export tonnes of fava beans, while importing three times as many lentils, chickpeas, haricot beans and other more popular pulses. Sitting in Poco, fresh from manning Hodmedod’s stall for the dal festival, Nick Saltmarsh, one of its co-founders, explains: “All over the world, as societies become richer, pulses are shunted away as the food of the poor, and those who can afford it eat meat. In Britain, from the Black Death onwards, we ate more meat and dairy, stopped relying on beans as a main protein source and they fell out of fashion.” However, the growing cost and ecological impact of eating meat, along with concerns about food security, could help pulses stage a comeback. The few hundred tonnes of UK pulses that Hodmedod distributes annually, sourced from a small network of dedicated farms, is a tiny fraction of total UK production, estimated at 730,000 tonnes, and Hodmedod’s wackier projects, such as last year’s first commercial UK lentil harvest, are at this stage totemic. But its rapid growth has demonstrated that you can create an appetite for UK pulses, even the neglected, mysterious fava bean, and that is has been noted by the larger pulse players. Originally inspired by a research project looking at the future of sustainable food in East Anglia, Hodmedod found its plan to retail fava beans laughed at by pulse processors. “They thought it was ludicrous,” says Saltmarsh. Five years later, Hodmedod is regarded as a trailblazer. “Before [Hodmedod] existed, the only UK market [for fava beans] was for cattle or fish feed,” says the president of Bepa, Franek Smith. “Hodmedod is developing a new and more profitable human consumption market for farmers and processing businesses.” Long-term, Hodmedod wants to see a transformative shift in UK agricultural policy, away from huge, monocultural cereal farms reliant on artificial fertilisers, to a more diverse farming culture that would include the cultivation of a variety of low-intensity pulses for UK consumers. This would be hugely beneficial, it argues, ecologically and for public health. There are precedents for such a change. In the past 30 years, Canada has radically increased its pulse production. It is now the world’s largest exporter of peas and lentils. However, as outlined in a recent Processors and Growers Research Organisation report, a similar British revolution would require significant state intervention, in everything from the funding of seed research to procurement directives for schools and hospitals. Bepa met MPs at Westminster in 2016 and Bristol East MP (and vegan) Kerry McCarthy has, says Smith, made Bepa’s case to ministers Liam Fox and Michael Gove. But getting the cabinet interested in pulses is difficult. “We’re starting to make waves, which is good, but until the last six to 12 months, we’ve had absolutely no impact at governmental level,” he says. For its part, Hodmedod continues to scatter its seed beyond wholefood stores by introducing products into delis and farm shops, promoting UK pulses to restaurants such as River Cottage, Mark Hix and Honey &amp; Co, and embracing convenience with its tinned fava, haricot and carlin peas. It even makes its own baked beans and salted beans, the latter tapping into what Saltmarsh believes could be a big growth area: pulse-based snacks (he namechecks Yushoi’s baked pea crisps and PepsiCo’s Off the Eaten Path brand). “The increased interest in pulses is striking,” he says. Hodmedod’s 99p-a-tin pulses are not the cheapest. “We can’t compete with 30p imported chickpeas. At our scale that’s hardly the cost of the can,” admits Saltmarsh, but, perversely, the wider visibility of premium pulses – which gram-for-gram are still cheaper than most meat and other proteins – may positively improve the image of fava beans and field peas. “Pulses became maligned as this really cheap thing. You’ve got to take the deprivation out of it and make people realise how delicious pulse dishes are,” says Chandler. But what of another significant problem? Not one of price or convenience, but flatulence? Will pulses always be followed by an ill wind that inhibits their popularity? Chandler thinks the issue is overblown: “My family had 18 months of serious pulse-eating for my book and, this sounds bizarre, I think you become more tolerant and less windy as you get used to them.” Failing that, there are ingredients you can add, such as cumin or seaweed, that are thought to break down the oligosaccharides that cause those explosive after-effects. If you are keen to explore the world of pulses beyond baked beans, it’s worth bearing in mind. Your family and friends will be forever grateful."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/17/jeremy-corbyn-accused-of-lacking-moral-clarity-on-antisemitism","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T17:26:34Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn accused of lacking moral clarity on antisemitism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/17/jeremy-corbyn-accused-of-lacking-moral-clarity-on-antisemitism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/17/jeremy-corbyn-accused-of-lacking-moral-clarity-on-antisemitism","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn accused of lacking moral clarity on antisemitism","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn’s backbenchers have rounded on the failure of the party to tackle antisemitism in a blistering three hours that ended with a Labour MP calling closing remarks by the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, worthy of horror. The antisemitism debate was called by the government, a move that often blunts opposition anger. Instead, furious speeches from many Labour MPs will threaten the Labour leader’s efforts to show that he is a “militant opponent” of antisemitism. Almost every Labour MP who spoke described in powerful terms the depths of the abuse they and Jewish friends and colleagues were experiencing. Luciana Berger, who has received antisemitic death threats, warned that while antisemitism was growing everywhere, the problem was worse within the Labour party. With Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, sitting beside her, Berger said: “ Anti-racism is one our essential values and there was a time not long ago when the left actively confronted antisemitism. “One antisemitic member of the Labour party is one member too many ... It pains me to say this in 2018 that within the Labour party antisemitism is now more commonplace, is more conspicuous and is more corrosive. She received a standing ovation for her speech. Labour’s Ian Austin, MP for Dudley North, was also cheered when he called on his party’s leadership to expel Ken Livingstone, who claimed Hitler was a Zionist, from the party to show it was taking antisemitism seriously. Livingstone has been suspended from the party for two years. Another Labour backbencher, Joan Ryan, said she had just been in Poland to take part in the March of the Living visiting the places “where history’s greatest shame was committed”. “When I first became an MP 21 years ago, I never imagined that some in my party would suggest that this horror should be a matter for debate. [Would he join me in saying] shame on them, and shame on any who fails to speak out against them.” Among several MPs cheered and applauded by colleagues for their speeches, Ruth Smeeth, Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, criticised the “poison” of antisemitism that was “engulfing” part of her own party and wider political discourse. Dame Margaret Hodge, MP for Barking, described how she had seen a battered suitcase with her uncle’s initials on it when she visited Auschwitz and how she had “never felt as nervous and frightened as I do today” about being Jewish. “It feels that my party has given permission for antisemitism to go unchallenged. Antisemitism is making me an outsider in my Labour party. Enough is enough.” John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw – who chairs the all party group on antisemitism, criticised those on the left who claim that calling out antisemitism is a way of attacking Corbyn. “Those who say it is a smear raising this issue need to publicly apologise and publicly understand what they are doing,” he said. “Where this stuff ends is what happened in Copenhagen, what happened in Brussels, what happened in France repeatedly including four weeks ago … it is because they are Jewish that’s where this ends and we know where history takes us.” The communities secretary Sajid Javid opened the debate accusing Corbyn, who was sitting in the Commons for almost every speech, of displaying a “worrying lack of leadership and moral clarity” on antisemitism. Javid urged the Labour leader to “once and for all” clarify his opposition to antisemitism as the Commons took the highly unusual step of debating the issue. Corbyn is holding talks next week with two leading Jewish organisation, the Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies, although a proposed roundtable discussion with community leaders is in doubt after mainstream invitees objected to the inclusion of an anti-Israel Jewish group. In a move to underline how it has responded in the month since a demonstration by the two organisations outside parliament, the new general secretary Jennie Formby emailed every Labour MP on Tuesday night to set out progress since she began work a fortnight ago. “Jeremy and I are determined to eradicate the stain of antisemitic attitudes in our party, and this will be a central priority in my role as general secretary,” she said in email. But her words were almost immediately undermined according to some Labour MPs by the closing remarks of the shadow home secretary, who devoted more than half her speech to addressing the concerns of the Haredi community of ultra-orthodox Jews in her Hackney constituency. Abbott also quoted a rabbi who had suggested that antisemitism was part of a wider social discontent. Louise Ellman, who had made a powerful speech in the debate, said afterwards “I was appalled. It was a grave misjudgement.” Another Labour MP, Wes Streeting, told MPs that he feared the wider Jewish community would be “horrified by the response from our front bench to this debate today.” The home secretary, Amber Rudd, concluded: “Labour is a noble and honourable party and it is absolutely wrong that this corner of antisemitism has been allowed to flourish. [Corbyn] has an obligation to take action. We expect nothing less.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2018/apr/17/parents-of-alfie-evans-apply-to-take-sons-case-back-to-supreme-court","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T16:29:07Z","webTitle":"Parents of Alfie Evans apply to take son's case back to supreme court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/apr/17/parents-of-alfie-evans-apply-to-take-sons-case-back-to-supreme-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/apr/17/parents-of-alfie-evans-apply-to-take-sons-case-back-to-supreme-court","fields":{"headline":"Parents of Alfie Evans apply to take son's case back to supreme court","bodyText":"The parents of a 23-month-old boy at the centre of a life-support treatment battle have applied to the supreme court to appeal against a ruling that treatment should be removed from the child. Court of appeal judges ruled on Monday that Tom Evans, 21, and Kate James, 20, could not take their son, Alfie Evans, abroad to receive treatment for a rare degenerative brain disease. The couple, from Liverpool, have so far lost cases in the high court, court of appeal, supreme court and European court of human rights. The child’s parents insist they have seen improvements in their son’s condition and want to move him to a hospital in Rome where they believe he will receive better treatment. Judges have heard that Alfie is in a “semi-vegetative state” and that further treatment would be futile. The supreme court confirmed on Tuesday that the couple had filed an application to appeal. “They wish to challenge the decision that Alder Hey children’s NHS foundation trust can withdraw artificial ventilation from their child,” it said. “The application will be referred to the president of the supreme court, Lady Hale, and two other members of the court who will form the decision panel. The hospital and Alfie’s legal guardian (the person who provides the independent voice of the child in court) will then be asked to provide their views. The court is aware of the urgency of this matter.” The basis of the couple’s latest appeal is that their son is being wrongly detained by Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool. They have made a habeas corpus application. The Habeas Corpus Act 1679 allows anybody to have the legality of a detention examined. On Monday, an appeal court panel of Lord Justice Davis, Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Moylan upheld a ruling by the high court judge Mr Justice Hayden, who endorsed a detailed plan put forward by Alder Hey doctors for withdrawing life-support treatment. The judge said the unanimous view of medical experts was that Alfie’s brain had been eroded by disease and further assessment was pointless. Reading a statement outside the hospital two hours after the appeal court decision, Evans thanked the supporters surrounding him and again asked for his son’s life not be terminated. “They can’t break us, we are never going to back down,” he said. “Alfie, the family and all of our supporters are stronger than ever and we will keep fighting all the way. We will never give up on you Alfie.” An Alder Hey spokesman said: “The supreme court will now consider the application for permission to appeal the decision of the court of appeal. Our priority is to continue providing Alfie with the best care possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2018/apr/25/drama-performing-mental-health-may-contain-nuts","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T08:28:23Z","webTitle":"'Drama saved my life': how performing can help mental health problems","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2018/apr/25/drama-performing-mental-health-may-contain-nuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/2018/apr/25/drama-performing-mental-health-may-contain-nuts","fields":{"headline":"'Drama saved my life': how performing can help mental health problems","bodyText":"Kerry Shadbolt feared for her life as she approached the end of two years of drama therapy, provided by the NHS to help her manage her emotionally unstable personality disorder. Shadbolt, 47, had formed close friendships within her group and it was a place where she felt she could be herself. It was also sometimes the only thing she could leave her house for. She says: “When you get therapy it’s always time limited. When you get to the end of the prescribed period, that’s it. Off you go. There’s no discussion or follow on. There’s no safety net and you get left to fend for yourself.” It was a massive relief, then, when Gerald Maiello, the drama therapist she had been working with, put up a poster asking for interest in forming a theatre company that would mean the group could keep meeting and performing. And so May Contain Nuts was born. The group meets every Tuesday at the Hertfordshire partnership NHS foundation trust in Watford, and improvises scenes that explore topics such as self-harm and suicide, inspired by members’ real-life experiences. It also puts on performances for audiences – including staff at the trust and university students studying psychology and drama therapy – to raise awareness of mental health problems and how they can affect people. A cross-party inquiry co-chaired by former arts ministers Alan Howarth and Ed Vaizey last year concluded that the arts can keep people well, aid recovery from illness, help people live longer, have better lives and save money in health and social care services. Despite this, they are still not used enough in the NHS, according to Maiello, who works at the trust. “It’s wrong, because they can offer a lot,” he says. Another benefit of the project is that it offers current and former mental health patients a lifeline when the help prescribed to them by the NHS stops. The consequences of leaving people with mental health problems to drift can be dire, as a report into mental health care by the parliamentary and health service ombudsman highlighted. The report cited one case where an individual who had bipolar disorder and a personality disorder took their life after being discharged from a community team. Shadbolt says May Contain Nutssaved her life. “When I’m suicidal, just knowing that these guys are rooting for me is what gets me through,” she says. “These are the only people that understand and know where I’m coming from. I wouldn’t survive without them.” Another member, Katie Allen-Smith, 34, who also lives with emotionally unstable personality disorder, says: “This group has been the difference between an ambulance being called for someone in time or not. I’ve been in touch with members of the group on Whatsapp or Messenger and they’ve contacted my husband and said ‘You need to go and get her’ when I couldn’t do anything.” As well as the peer support on offer, the group educates people on living with mental health issues. It puts on performances and then holds a workshop to discuss what the audience has just seen. Healthcare students find this particularly helpful as they can ask candid and probing questions that they might be afraid to in a clinical setting. Kevin Smith, 56, who has post traumatic stress disorder and depression, says: “When we’ve done a performance, sometimes we take a bow and the audience stands there clapping. You think, ‘Wow. I’ve made an impression. I’m getting the message out there.’” Audiences have been moved to tears by the sometimes difficult drama on display, especially seeing a character crumple under the weight of mental health problems. Students have said they’ve learned more in a couple of hours with the group than in two years of their course. It’s this performance aspect that Maiello is most proud of. “Every performance is an achievement,” he says. He has noticed that the key themes the group explores are rejection, loss, abandonment and grief – which are at odds with going up on stage. “If you’ve experienced a lot of rejection, why go on stage to receive more?” He adds that the performances aim to highlight the need for healthcare professionals to see people above and beyond a diagnosis. “If it enables them to see more than just a mental health diagnosis, then we’ve won the day.” May Contain Nuts won in the mental health category, sponsored by the Guardian, at the UK Advancing Healthcare Awards for allied health professionals and healthcare scientists leading innovative healthcare practice.

But it seems that the description might be accurate. A series of volcanic eruptions in the sixth century blocked out the sunlight. This would have caused crop failures, famine and disease. New research shows a dramatic reduction in available sunlight in AD536 and again between AD541 and 544. This affected the whole of the northern hemisphere and led to severe vitamin D deficiency, making already hungry people susceptible to disease. These unusually poor years coincide with a bubonic plague epidemic, which killed half the inhabitants in the Eastern Roman Empire. The findings are confirmed by tree ring data which show that, following the eruptions, trees hardly grew at all in Europe because there was not enough light for photosynthesis. So none of the food crops would have thrived enough to produce grain. The chances are that, at least in the 6th Century, people in Britain must have been too pre-occupied with staying alive to worry about anything else, a seriously dark age. •Paul Brown will be one of the panel of Weatherwatch contributors taking part in Freak Weather in History at the British Library on Wednesday 2 May, at 7pm"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/apr/17/a-right-to-tuition-fees-compensation","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T17:35:40Z","webTitle":"A right to tuition fees compensation | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/17/a-right-to-tuition-fees-compensation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/apr/17/a-right-to-tuition-fees-compensation","fields":{"headline":"A right to tuition fees compensation","bodyText":"Students who feel their universities are not taking their complaints about lost teaching time seriously (Letters, 16 April) have tried signing petitions, writing letters and speaking to the media. The universities have stood firm in refusing to pay a penny in compensation. No other service provider would get away with charging for 25 weeks of a service and cutting that to 22 with no price reduction. There is no question that universities owe students fair compensation. Because of the huge numbers of students affected, universities could have to pay out millions of pounds. This is why petitions have proven ineffective. Universities might act when a petition calls for a lecturer to be sacked or for a change in investment policy. But they are much less likely to respond to a petition for them to pay out millions to students. Students therefore need to turn to the independent adjudicator or the courts to claim compensation. Our firm is coordinating an action group for that purpose, via www.universitycompensation.co.uk. Shimon Goldwater Solicitor, Asserson Law Offices • The question of what universities will do with the money they did not pay striking staff is a good one and students (and staff, and the public) should continue to press this point. However, your readers should not get the impression that students do not understand what drove their lecturers and administrators to strike. None of us did it lightly and most of our students know this. On a personal note, university-based student feedback on a course that I taught – one interrupted by strikes – included the following suggestion for course improvements: “Don’t take the teacher’s pension away, forcing industrial action that prevents me from learning.” We have all been moved by extraordinary sympathy and practical support from many, many students. Name and address supplied • Of course students see themselves as consumers. Since Thatcher’s privatisation of everything from the water we drink to the bus, we take to work we are all consumers. The students of today cannot afford to be the carefree undergrads of my era (free tuition and a local authority maintenance grant). In many cases their parents have remortgaged or plundered their superannuation fund to invest in their children’s education in the fond hope that the expensive qualification they get at the end of it will guarantee a job well enough paid to cover the tuition fees and a lot more. Otherwise why bother? Tuition fees and student loans are already a massive misselling scandal. And if the elite universities decide to opt out of state regulation and go after the money (Education, 17 April), well then we are back 100 years to the days of privilege and patronage, when the only students that could get to Oxford and Cambridge were the public and private school-educated sons and, occasionally daughters of the landed gentry, plutocrats and rich foreign potentates.

And since the reggae star is appearing at the Queen’s 92nd birthday party with Sting, she shouldn’t have to sit through Sting, either. Or Shawn Mendes or Kylie or Craig David or any of the other acts appearing at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday. That is not to criticise any of the artists in question, more a reflection of the fact that few 92-year-olds, monarchs or otherwise, would be desperate to hear Sting and Shaggy playing live at their party. If the bill had been left up to the Queen, it would have looked very different. Not least because most of her favourite singers are dead. The one sop to her own tastes this weekend is the band of the George Formby Society (we know she likes Formby because Leaning on a Lamp-post was one of the 10 songs she named as her favourites for her 90th birthday), but Howard Keel, Fred Astaire, Dolores Gray and Bill Johnson are unavailable, owing to commitments in the afterlife. Plus, it is probably unreasonable to expect Vera Lynn, aged 101, to commit to a gig. But what if the rest of the royal family had helped with the booking? Prince Charles As heir to the throne, he gets first choice. His favourite, Leonard Cohen, is dead and hardly party central anyway, so Charles can have the Three Degrees. Sadly, Sheila Ferguson – with whom Charles had a close friendship and who claims she once turned down his advances – is no longer in the group, but maybe that’s better for the Duchess of Cornwall’s peace of mind. Prince Andrew Let’s not exclude another of the Queen’s sons, either, a fan of will.i.am. “He is a major inspiration to a lot of young people from all sorts of backgrounds,” Andrew said in 2014, evidently having never met any young people from any sort of background. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Wills and Kate would bring the star power: they had Ellie Goulding perform at their wedding reception, while William used to sing Coldplay songs to baby George. Lock those two in and you have something to justify the whole shebang being broadcast on BBC television and radio. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle These two could try to add a touch of cool. He is a fan of UK grime star Skream (we don’t know if he has moved on to Skepta and Stormzy since), while last year she posted on her now-defunct blog, The Tig, about her listening habits, which included Crystal Fighters, Maggie Rogers and Janelle Monáe. So, there we have it: Coldplay headlining, with Ellie Goulding, the Three Degrees in the “legends” slot, Janelle Monáe, Skream, Crystal Fighters and Maggie Rogers. will.i.am can MC and make pointless guest appearances.

Birth (One Born Every Minute), childhood and school (The Secret Life of 4-year-olds; Educating Yorkshire), dating (First Dates) and work (The Job Interview). It looks like Sex Tape – expected some time this year – will cover the revenge-porn side of things. All it needs is a good death show then that’s it: everything important will be seen to. The Secret Life of the Zoo attempts to do pretty much all of the above, except with captive animals. Not as interesting as proper in-the-wild natural history, because it’s basically Big Brother, rather than the real world. But it’s easier – and much cheaper – to make. Chester Zoo is not so hard to get to. Procreation is the name of the game in this series opener. Orangutan sisters Emma and Subis are both pregnant, both by Puluh. That could get a bit tricky later. And will the babies be half siblings, cousins or what? In the tropical realm of Chester, there are three new two-horned chameleons from Cameroon. They came from a customs seizure after they were imported illegally with the wrong paperwork and now they are being encouraged to make babies, too. It is a complicated business, though, chameleon sex, about which little is known, even at Chester. It seems to require fights and colour changes before any actual copulation can occur. This female has changed colour, but into the wrong one: black, which means she is not up for it, the reason for which will become clear later. It is a similar story with the vampire crabs. No interest, no action, so another male is introduced to spice things up a little, which may lead to brutal combat, we are warned, with limbs and claws getting ripped off. That sounds exciting … The fight doesn’t happen, though, and if there is any mating it is not caught on camera. No crabby sex tapes here. At least we can rely upon the meerkats to do the business; normally, they breed like rabbits, as well as living like them, in burrows. But, for some reason, the staff at Chester have put a pair of aadvarks in with them. The thing about aadvarks – the other thing, the first being that they come early alphabetically – is that they are loud and messy and disruptive and not at all conducive to love-making. Aardvarks are like the opposite of putting a Barry White record on. And they snore very loudly. Actually it is slightly suspect, the sound of aardvarks snoring. Likewise the loud crunch of a cricket being munched by a chameleon; it sounds like a nut being cracked. And the plinkety-plonky be-amused-by-this-bit music is annoying. Things do happen, it is just that “the latest camera technology” fails to capture it. Some of the secrets of the zoo remain secret. Emma the orangutan sneaks off to have her baby (like One Born Every Minute minus the birth scenes, and actually I am OK with that). It is orange and fluffy and very cute. Also very human – about 97% so, DNA-wise. One morning, in the crab tank, there are six or seven tiny baby vampire crabs, although we don’t get to see any of the behaviour that led to them. And they need to be got out of there, fast. Cronos crabs would be a better name for them. A bit like Cromer crabs, except these ones eat their children. Plus there are three baby two-horned chameleons as well, each the size of a fingernail. It seems that it probably wasn’t to do with the efforts to breed them, but that the mother was pregnant when she arrived. That is why she turned black; it’s chameleon for: “Back off, I’m knocked up already.” She was seized by customs, remember? An illegal immigrant, the wrong paperwork. The staff at Chester need to sort that out – the paperwork – for the babies quickly, before they are put on a plane to Cameroon, even though Chester is the only place they have lived and known. In case the Home Office is watching. Finally, some excitement, in the form of a proper story. Subis, the other orangutan, who has been unwell, is examined to see how her baby is doing. Nothing there!

Analysis by ComRes on behalf of the Leonard Cheshire Disability charity shows almost a quarter of disabled adults aged 18-65 in the UK missed at least one meal in the last year, while a fifth said they were not able to keep their home warm. Previous studies of disabled people by the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the charity Scope show a considerably higher rate of deprivation than in the general population; in 2017, less than 8% of non-disabled people were in food poverty while those without disabilities have to spend half as much on energy bills as people with health conditions. The Leonard Cheshire research into the human cost of cuts to services and financial support for disabled people paints a bleak picture of families struggling to cope. More than one in four (27%) working age disabled adults reported having less than £50 to spend each week after deducting income tax, council tax and housing costs. The financial situation is compounded by a growing social care crisis, with more than half (55%) of disabled people of working age saying they did not receive the vital support they needed in 2017. This suggests deteriorating social care for disabled people, with comparable research released by the charity in 2016 finding 48% of respondents were without social care. The findings follow a recent report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission that found disabled people had disproportionately borne the brunt of tax and welfare changes since 2010, with disabled families facing an annual income loss of up to £10,000. Leonard Cheshire said their latest research shows the impact has been “catastrophic” with essential heating, food or travel often becoming unaffordable. Neil Heslop, the CEO of Leonard Cheshire, said: “Our research lays bare the appalling situation many disabled individuals and families find themselves in. Every day, thousands of people are teetering on the financial brink, unsupported and isolated. When high quality social care is provided, it has the power to transform lives. It can empower disabled people to live, learn and work as they choose.” Absence of any social care, or inadequate support, also left more than half (54%) of those who need it feeling isolated and lonely, according to the latest research. Meanwhile 53% said the lack of help had a negative impact on their mental health. A government spokesperson said: “We know that people often face additional costs as a result of their disability, which is why we’re spending more than ever before to support disabled people and those with health conditions. We introduced PIP to replace the old system, and now 29% of people receive the highest rate of support, compared to 15% under DLA. “We expect disabled adults with care needs to receive high-quality support. We know the social care system is under pressure, which is why we provided an extra £2bn funding and a further £150m for this year. We will shortly outline plans to reform social care, ensuring it is sustainable for the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/30/deer-road-collisions-where-notes-queries","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T10:15:09Z","webTitle":"Where do all the road collisions with deer occur? | Notes and queries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/30/deer-road-collisions-where-notes-queries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/30/deer-road-collisions-where-notes-queries","fields":{"headline":"Where do all the road collisions with deer occur?","bodyText":"More than 42,000 deer are killed in collisions on the UK’s roads every year, according to the AA.

Di Venuto, a former one-day international batsman who was Australia’s batting coach for three years until 2016, also launched a strident defence of the changing-room culture in the Australia team. The 44-year-old urged that the investigation into culture and conduct begins “at the top” with Cricket Australia management rather than the players, defending the environment fostered by Darren Lehmann, who stepped down as Australia’s coach in the aftermath. “I didn’t think there was any cultural issues during my involvement with the Australian team,” Di Venuto said. “I love the culture [Lehmann] created and the players loved the environment as well. Obviously, with the events that have happened recently, all of a sudden people are blaming culture and things like that. Take it back a couple of months, when we won the Ashes, there wasn’t too many people complaining.” Noting the close relationships he built with Steve Smith and David Warner during his time on the staff, Di Venuto described the decision made by the former team leaders and Cameron Bancroft to scuff the ball with sandpaper as “pretty dumb” but argued that the response has been disproportionate. “There has been a real assassination of their characters,” he said. “They are good people who have made mistakes. They are quality people who I have spent a lot of time with. It was tough to watch and see them treated as criminals for something that goes on in sport.” Di Venuto believes that having accepted their international bans, the players have “suffered enough” and should be able to “get on with their lives”. In turn he has opened the door to Smith and Warner at Surrey should the ECB allow them to play domestic cricket. “It is probably important that they play a bit of cricket at some stage,” he said. “If they are in the right mental state to play cricket, and the ECB will have to allow it to start with, then we’d be mad not to look at some of the world’s best players potentially playing.” Elaborating on his response to the review that Cricket Australia announced into the men’s team following the fiasco in Cape Town, Di Venuto made it clear that he would like the scrutiny to start further up the line. “It will be interesting to see what comes out of this culture stuff,” he added. “Hopefully they start from the top and work their way down to the team.” When asked about the influence of the Cricket Australia organisation on the team’s hyper-aggressive disposition during the Ashes series, Di Venuto repeated that position. “You can’t lose to England,” he said. “That’s built up. When it does happen, and it is no different to what happens in this country when England lose to Australia, all hell breaks loose.” Of the situation during the third Test against South Africa, he said: “When you are in a different country and copping from all angles, you don’t know what sort of state the players were in to make that sort of decision. And the will to win. The Australian cricket team just wins. It’s not allowed to lose.” Despite Australia’s coaching job still being vacant, Di Venuto said he is yet to consider it given he is halfway through a four-year deal with Surrey, but as a self-described career coach, he stopped short of ruling it out. “You never say never [but] I am really happy doing what I am doing,” he said. “As you’ve seen, you take on that [international] role and you are away for 11 months a year, you are on the road. It is hard work.” In the current climate it is perhaps harder than ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/18/rotherham-council-apologise-abuse-grooming-jayne-senior-whistleblower","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T17:34:47Z","webTitle":"Rotherham council told to apologise to abuse whistleblower","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/18/rotherham-council-apologise-abuse-grooming-jayne-senior-whistleblower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/18/rotherham-council-apologise-abuse-grooming-jayne-senior-whistleblower","fields":{"headline":"Rotherham council told to apologise to abuse whistleblower","bodyText":"Rotherham council has been ordered to apologise to a whistleblower who helped to expose the town’s grooming scandal after council officials raided her charity without proper explanation – years after she risked imprisonment by revealing how the council, police and social services turned a blind eye to the abuse of at least 1,400 children. Jayne Senior, who has worked with grooming victims since the 1999 in Rotherham and is now a Labour councillor, has been under investigation by the council since August 2016, two months after she was made an MBE for her services to child protection. Her MP, Sarah Champion, said she was “appalled” it had taken so long to resolve. She questioned how much money had been spent investigating her. The council has spent the last 20 months investigating complaints made by survivors of child sexual exploitation (CSE) who believe Senior earned up to £1m by charging for interviews about their plight and sharing information inappropriately, which she denies. A few months before they made allegations against her she published her memoirs, called Broken and Betrayed. The book revealed how she became the whistleblower who risked imprisonment to provide evidence of their abuse at the hands of men of Pakistani origin. Now the local government ombudsman has ordered Rotherham council to apologise to Senior and her charity, Swinton Lock, an arts and activity centre that sometimes works with CSE survivors. The Guardian has seen a leaked copy of the report by the ombudsman, which found the council misled Senior about the progress of their investigation, keeping her waiting for a year to find out details of allegations made against her by three grooming victims. The three women made a series of allegations to the council in August 2016, two years after they featured in Prof Alexis Jay’s report into Rotherham’s grooming problem. On 13 December 2016, four months after the complaints were made, nine council officials visited Swinton Locks unannounced and carried out a “monitoring visit”, which those present view as a raid. They confiscated HR files and the laptop Senior was given by Rotherham council when she became a councillor in 2016. Champion described the number of people involved in the operation as “excessive”.During the visit the officials refused to tell either Senior or the charity’s trustees why they were being investigated, saying they had not finished interviewing the complainants. But the ombudsman found that they had in fact completed the complainants’ interviews four days before the raid, and yet waited another eight months, until 16 August 2017, to tell Senior what claims had been made against her. The ombudsman, which looks at complaints about councils and social care providers in England, found the council was at fault for taking so long to investigate. It also said the council was at fault for misleading Senior about why she was being investigated. In August 2016 the council said the complaints related to her current work with Swinton Lock. A year later the ombudsman found “the nature of the complaints had completely changed” and “the complaints were now wholly about the actions of [Senior], with some relating to her actions before she was employed by the charity”. Champion said: “I’m appalled it’s taken so long. It’s crazy how ill informed she has been through the process. In the five years I have been an MP I have never come across something like this affecting a constituent, let alone a councillor and a well-known whistleblower. You would think that the council would be trying to do everything in a timely manner. In fact, the opposite has happened.” In a statement Senior said: “As one of those who helped bring the Rotherham CSE scandal to light, I will continue to support children and families who were systematically failed by those whose statutory duty was to protect them and I will continue to work with the authorities to ensure justice is served. I welcome the Ombudsman’s decision but am disappointed that I have had to endure many months of unnecessary stress. Matters are now in the hands of our lawyers and consequently I cannot make any further comment.” A spokeswoman from Rotherham council said: “The council received complaints from survivors of child sexual exploitation about the practice at Swinton Lock Activity Centre, which at that time was commissioned by the council to provide post-child-sexual-exploitation support to survivors and their families. “Given the history of child sexual exploitation in Rotherham and the previous failure of agencies to properly support survivors, the council commissioned an independent investigation into complaints about Swinton Lock Activity Centre.” She said the council had apologised in writing to the trustees of the charity and have complied with the agreed actions. “We are committed to completing the matter as soon as possible for all involved,” she said. Senior helped reveal the systematic grooming and sexual exploitation of more than 1,400 children in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013 by handing over more than 200 restricted access documents to the Times in 2012. The files showed that police and social services had been aware of extensive evidence of sex grooming by groups of men of Pakistani heritage for more than a decade. Offenders had been identified but no prosecutions followed. The publication of Senior’s information shamed the council into commissioning an independent inquiry, led by Jay. Her report, published in 2014, concluded that at least 1,400 children had been sexually exploited in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2018/apr/17/16th-century-fashion-police-for-barristers","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T17:35:29Z","webTitle":"16th-century fashion police for barristers | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/apr/17/16th-century-fashion-police-for-barristers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/apr/17/16th-century-fashion-police-for-barristers","fields":{"headline":"16th-century fashion police for barristers","bodyText":"You suggest with alarm that trainee barristers’ dress code is “extremely conservative” and “highly prescriptive”. But such restrictions on student (and practicing) barristers are nothing new. The Middle Temple, one of the four Inns of Court mentioned in your article, passed a dizzying range of sartorial diktats in the 16th century, governing its students’ and members’ dress from head to toe. Between 1556 and 1558 members of the Inn were forbidden from wearing beards of more than three weeks’ growth, breeches “of any light colour”, and any “great breeches in their hoses made after the Dutch or Spanish fashion”. In 1584 things were even stricter, with the Inn’s passing an order that members must not wear “great ruffs”, “white colour in doublet or hose”, “velvet facings”, “hat nor long nor curled hair”, and that all gowns must be of “sad colour”. A ten shilling fine was imposed in 1596 on anyone coming to breakfast in boots, and in 1668 one Mr John Hanham was fined the same for coming to supper in a white hat, described as an “indecent habit”. Evidently, while the fashion choices of young barristers may change, their curtailment can reliably be counted upon!

You asked Google – here’s the answer","bodyText":"According to films – yes. But if you move to W11 thinking you’ll nab a cute one-bed on a bookseller’s salary and bump into Julia Roberts, well, think again. The average flat price in Notting Hill is currently £890,000 according to (shudder) Foxtons. Julia Roberts is based in Malibu. And there are just an estimated 112 independent bookshops left in London. I am afraid that, as with a lot of big cities, living in London is a bit like playing roulette. Some win big, some struggle to catch a break. Either way, there is always someone waiting to take your place. Why live in London? Some feel they have to. Mostly this is for work. It goes without saying that for national political careers, one must be London-based, as the Houses of Parliament are situated in Westminster. In the media, all of the big national papers are located in London, as are the majority of broadcasters, and the regional press is struggling. The City of London is the world’s financial capital (there’s an annual arm wrestle in a cocktail bar with Wall Street bankers to maintain the title). Hospitality, tourism and services are all booming. In fact, London’s economy, as it is never tires of boasting, props up the whole of the UK – and grows at twice the national rate. There are signs, however, of shifts. Birmingham is a growing financial hub and Channel 4 has been given a government deadline to move from the capital. The BBC moved a chunk of its production to Salford (Greater Manchester) in 2011. The “northern powerhouse”, who knows, might grow to be an actual thing rather than a line repeated in every speech circa 2015, and the election of the regional “metro” mayors has gone some way towards devolving power. Some things, though, are moving further afield: post-Brexit, the European Medicines Agency moved to Amsterdam. But London is still “where it is at”. For culture vultures, London is a heaven inside a ring-road. There are an estimated 241 theatres and more than 250 registered art galleries and museums. London is the birthplace of punk and grime. For foodies, there are 72 Michelin-starred restaurants in the capital, and thousands of local cafes and establishments that are the gems of their own communities. The Turkish restaurants on Green Lanes are said to be some of the best in Europe. Marie’s Cafe on Lower Marsh is a new genre – Thai greasy spoon. For lovers of scenery, Hampstead Heath offers one of the UK’s most beautiful spaces. The city’s history rises like damp from the underground (the first tube journey took place in 1863) and floats to the surface of the Thames (where, no biggie, woolly mammoths used to quench their thirst). London state schools, once a significant cause for concern, are now among the best in the UK after a transformation effort (noticeably the London Challenge in 2003) that is studied around the world. The Times Higher Education rankings put 20 of the top 93 UK universities in London, which makes London’s 400,000 student population understandable. So why wouldn’t someone live in London? Well: money. A pint of beer costs £4.08 on average (it’s roughly three quid in the country). Almost everything is expensive in London. The things listed above: expensive. (Not all, mind, many museums are free.) But, oof: the cost of living for those without concessions. You see, one of the things to come to terms with about living in London is that that view you love so much, the glass skyline glittering in the sun, is a half-illusion punctured by the Shard, given that 27% of Londoners live in poverty, and that is after housing costs have been accounted for. Communities who have called London home for generations are being pushed out by rising rents and gentrification. Local businesses lock their premises for the final time. Commutes grow longer and more expensive. Landlords run riot. As for crime, London by many measures is not worse than the rest of the UK. Though a recent surge in knife crime has caught attention, its homicide level is not the highest in the UK for its population size (that would be Greater Manchester) and a lot of people who think of London as a big scary kraken of crime have never lived in London. But many have had enough. Almost 300,000 people left the city in the year to mid-2016, a 10-year high. Has it grown too big for its Dover Market-bought boots? Watch the capital’s housing market plummet. It is down 15% post-Brexit, and we’re about to watch it go full Jenga, while the rest of the UK property market upticks nicely. Brexit means Brexit which actually means banks are packing up and moving to Frankfurt. Meanwhile youngsters are picking up seashells and affordable flats on the Kent coast. The Arts Council just announced plans to spend £170m more outside London; Manchester City just won the Premier League; and a show about Derry is the greatest thing on television. So, the answer to the question: should you live in London? Well, I apologise for sounding like a life coach but it depends on who you are, and what you want in life. If you are someone who enjoys a leisurely stroll during rush hour and takes a relaxed attitude to escalator etiquette, absolutely not. If you are a burgeoning family already based in London, with a need for a garden and, struggling on a budget of what elsewhere would be a very sizeable sum of money, perhaps. (If, however, you’re the type of parent who enjoys, say, baby raves, then, yeah … stay in London.) If you are an immigrant, consider it: more than 300 languages are spoken, there’s an immigrant population of 3 million already, and our economy needs you, despite what some are saying of late. If you want to be able to see the stars at night and breathe clean air, then no (this is something I have been considering recently, on both an existential and a lung-based level), because London has some of the worst pollution in the UK. If you are a money launderer, hun, you don’t even have to live in London, the city welcomes you with open arms. If you like friendliness in strangers … still live in London, because I don’t agree (and I’m a northerner), with the trope of it being an unfriendly place. Should you live in London if you are homeless and have lived in the city for years and your entire support network is based here, yet your council is trying to move to you to some faraway part of the country? Hell yes, you should live in London. Write to your MP. If you want a transport network that means five minutes for the next train is deemed an annoyingly lengthy wait, also yes. If you don’t enjoy quasi-jaunty pub signs that crush the soul, then no. Or, yes, but know that you shall have to endure them. Day after day, after day.

Nickname: Wiggy. Age: 51. Appearance: Retired footballer. His name isn’t ringing any bells. That’s because Wiggy likes to operate in the shadows. “He loves being one of the gang but he is happy to let Nigel and Arron take most of the limelight,” one acquaintance is reported to have said. “He sees himself as the guy behind the scenes pulling the strings.” Nigel, Arron? Nigel Farage and Arron Banks – the architects of Brexit. Wigmore is a business associate of Banks’s and, as director of communications for Leave.EU, was a key figure in convincing the country to quit the EU. The Bad Boys of Brexit! That was how they styled themselves, yes. Vote Leave did the intellectual stuff about sovereignty, while the Brex Pistols – another name they liked – concentrated on more visceral immigration-based campaigning. Wasn’t there a photograph of the Bad Boys alongside Donald Trump outside his golden elevator in Trump Tower? There was indeed, with Wigmore putting a friendly arm round Farage’s shoulder. What’s Wiggy up to now? He’s in a spot of bother. For what? Allegedly claiming the Nazis were inspired communicators and highly effective campaigners. Never a wise move. Very true. You’d better quote me chapter and verse. “The propaganda machine of the Nazis – if you take away all the hideous horror and that kind of stuff – it was very clever, the way they managed to do what they did,” he reportedly told Essex University researcher Dr Emma Briant. “In its pure marketing sense, you can see the logic of what they were saying.” If you take away all the hideous horror and that kind of stuff. Yes, quite a big if. How have people reacted? Not well. Conservative MP Damian Collins, chairman of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, which released a recording of Wigmore’s interview with Briant, said it gave a “unique insight” into the Brexit campaign. Collins claims the leave campaign relied on “extreme messaging around immigration” and used data analytics to target voters worried about the issue. How has Wigmore responded? He dismissed the release as “wilful deception and trickery” – part of an establishment plot to block Brexit – and says his references to the Nazis actually came up in a discussion of the scare tactics used by remain. Moderately interesting fact about Wigmore: Although born in Chipping Norton, he has Belizean nationality and acted as an official trade emissary for the country before the UK foreign office had him stripped of his diplomatic status after the Trump picture appeared, because diplomats are not supposed to get involved in the politics of other countries. Slightly less interesting fact about Wigmore: He apparently represented Belize in clay pigeon shooting at the Commonwealth Games in 2014, but failed to qualify for the final round. Do say: “Given everything that’s come to light, shouldn’t we re-run the referendum?” Don’t say: “Hitler may not have got everything right, but he certainly knew how to get his message across.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/17/diamonds-in-sudan-meteorite-are-remnants-of-lost-planet","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T07:51:22Z","webTitle":"Diamonds in Sudan meteorite 'are remnants of lost planet'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/17/diamonds-in-sudan-meteorite-are-remnants-of-lost-planet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/17/diamonds-in-sudan-meteorite-are-remnants-of-lost-planet","fields":{"headline":"Diamonds in Sudan meteorite 'are remnants of lost planet'","bodyText":"Diamonds found in a meteorite that exploded over the Nubian desert in Sudan a decade ago were formed deep inside a “lost planet” that once circled the sun in the early solar system, scientists say.

Astronomers have long hypothesised that dozens of fledgling planets, ranging in size from the moon to Mars, formed in the first 10m years of the solar system and were broken apart and repackaged in violent collisions that ultimately created the terrestrial planets that orbit the sun today. If the latest findings are confirmed, the Almahata Sitta meteorite will be the only known remnants of one of these long-lost planets. The material will give scientists a unique window into the cosmic conditions that prevailed in the deep history of the solar system. “Simulations have suggested that the early solar system had tens of these embryonic planets that collided with each other to form the terrestrial planets, but having evidence of one of them? I wasn’t expecting that,” said Farhang Nabiei, who studied pieces of the meteorite at the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland. Philippe Gillet, a senior author on the study, said: “We are doing archaeology, looking into the past, and trying to decipher the story of the solar system.” The Almahata Sitta meteorite was the first to be tracked by telescopes as it sped towards Earth and exploded over the Nubian desert in 2008. The event prompted a recovery effort by the University of Khartoum, which gathered 480 pieces of the meteorite amounting to 4kg of battered material. Early inspections of the meteorite revealed it to be a ureilite, an unusual composition that does not match other space rocks known to have come from the moon or Mars. The finding led some scientists to speculate that it may have had a more exotic origin. That suspicion grew when researchers noticed little diamonds in the meteorite material. While other meteorites are known to contain diamond crystals, they are generally far smaller. Typical meteorite diamonds are only a few millionths of a millimetre across and are thought to form in collisions with other space rocks that send brief but intense shockwaves through the carbon-rich asteroids. In 2015, researchers at the Swiss lab teamed up with Japanese scientists to argue that the diamonds in the Almahata Sitta meteorite, which are up to 100 micrometres long, were much larger than could be formed in collisions with other asteroids. They speculated at the time that the meteorite might have come from a lost planet, but sought more evidence to bolster their theory. Writing in the journal Nature Communications, the Swiss team now describe fresh analyses that show that diamonds in the meteorite contain specks of an iron-sulphur compound that is thought only to form at pressures greater than 20 gigapascals. They conclude that the diamonds formed with the specks inside them, deep beneath the surface of an unknown world. “We are probably looking at an object that was one of the first planets to circle the sun before they collided with each other to create the actual planets we have today,” said Gillet. James Wittke, who runs the meteorite laboratory at Northern Arizona University, said the scientists’ conclusions were reasonable. “We think that there were probably many larger ‘parent’ bodies in the early solar system, which have since been destroyed, so a since-destroyed body the size of Mercury is reasonable,” he said. “One as large as Mars seems a little surprising, but this paper presents the best, and perhaps only, type of evidence for determining the sizes of these parent bodies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/16/brexiters-tend-to-dislike-uncertainty-and-love-routine-study-says","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T19:00:16Z","webTitle":"Brexiters tend to dislike uncertainty and love routine, study says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/16/brexiters-tend-to-dislike-uncertainty-and-love-routine-study-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/16/brexiters-tend-to-dislike-uncertainty-and-love-routine-study-says","fields":{"headline":"Brexiters tend to dislike uncertainty and love routine, study says","bodyText":"Boris Johnson’s call to “take back control” in the 2016 EU referendum was a rallying cry that cut across political parties and split families, but quite why it had such a wide appeal has had academics puzzled. Now researchers say a fervour for Brexit could at least in part be linked to the way individuals process information. Research has revealed that those in favour of cutting loose from the EU are more categorical and “think outside the box” less than those who favour remain, with a stronger dislike for uncertainty and a greater love of daily routine. “What we were interested in is really trying to get at the psychological processes that shape our nationalistic attitudes [and] how we evaluate policy,” said Leor Zmigrod, first author of the study from the University of Cambridge. The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, involved more than 330 UK residents recruited online, just over 62% of whom voted to remain in the EU. Each participant completed a number of tasks, including choosing the correct image to complete a sequence of shapes for which the underlying rule could suddenly change, and coming up with a word that could be linked to other words – for example, “fire” could be linked to fly, fighter and cracker. Participants also completed a number of questionnaires designed to probe attitudes including their response to uncertainty, having a routine, nationalism, political conservatism, authoritarianism, Brexit, immigration and how British or European they felt. Participants’ personalities were also examined. The results reveal that while Brexit can get many people hot under the collar, it is not just emotions that underpin which vote they cast. When factors including age, sex and education levels were taken into account, Brexit support was linked to more nationalistic, authoritarian and conservative attitudes, as well as support for the political and social status quo. Leave voters were also found, from self-reported questionnaires, to be more conscientious and emotionally stable than Remain voters, and more likely to put success down to their own skills and hard work. But the study also showed the importance of ways of thinking. Among the findings, a lower propensity to think creatively and a greater tendency to be categorical appeared to help drive ideologies linked to support of Brexit, opposition towards immigration and free movement of labour, and agreement with Theresa May’s controversial statement that a “citizen of the world is a citizen of nowhere”. The analysis suggests differences in “cognitive flexibility” could play a large role in shaping how we vote, but Zmigrod said that was not the whole story. “There are so many other factors that shape our political attitudes [and] our ideologies that cognitive flexibility is really just one piece of a much more intricate puzzle,” she said. Zmigrod also stressed that the findings cannot be generalised to individuals, noting that “simply because you are a Remain voter, it doesn’t mean that you are cognitively flexible”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/16/theresa-may-caribbean-representatives-windrush-immigration","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T19:48:30Z","webTitle":"Amber Rudd 'sorry' for appalling treatment of Windrush-era citizens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/16/theresa-may-caribbean-representatives-windrush-immigration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/16/theresa-may-caribbean-representatives-windrush-immigration","fields":{"headline":"Amber Rudd 'sorry' for appalling treatment of Windrush-era citizens","bodyText":"The British home secretary has delivered an unprecedented apology for the “appalling” actions of her own department towards Windrush-era citizens, acknowledging that the Home Office had “lost sight of individuals” and become “too concerned with policy”. In the face of mounting criticism, Amber Rudd announced the creation of a new Home Office team, staffed by 20 officials, dedicated to ensuring that Commonwealth-born long-term UK residents will no longer find themselves classified as illegal immigrants. She promised that cases would be resolved within two weeks and application fees would be waived. In a highly unusual acknowledgement that the government’s hostile immigration policy is having a catastrophic effects on individuals’ lives, Rudd said: “Frankly, how they have been treated has been wrong – has been appalling – and I am sorry. That is why I am setting up a new area in my department to ensure that we have a completely new approach to how their situation is regularised.” She made a significant criticism of her own department, adding: “I am concerned that the Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the individual. This is about individuals, and we have heard the individual stories, some of which have been terrible to hear.” She said she was very sorry for the anxiety suffered by numerous people who arrived in the UK as children after newly tightened immigration laws required them to prove that they were here legally. The Guardian has been documenting a growing scandal over the past five months affecting an unknown number of people who arrived in the UK as children from the Caribbean as children (often on parents’ or siblings’ passports) but were never formally naturalised or hadn’t applied for a British passport. Because newly tightened immigration rules mean individuals are increasingly required to show documents proving a right to be in the UK before they can take up work, rent properties, access healthcare, or claim benefits, many have lost their jobs or been made homeless or refused urgent healthcare. Some have been sent to immigration removal centres or threatened with deportation. A colleague of Rudd’s, immigration minister Caroline Nokes, earlier appeared to suggest that people had been deported in error back to countries they left as children for not having the right documents. Rudd said she was unable to confirm if this was the case, and had asked Caribbean diplomats if they were aware of mistaken deportations. Rudd’s announcement came after the prime minister was forced into an embarrassing U-turn over Downing Street’s refusal to schedule a meeting requested by 12 Caribbean heads of government to discuss the problem at a meeting of the Commonwealth heads of government (Chogm), which opened in London on Monday. The rebuffal was described as “most unfortunate” by the Barbados high commissioner, just before the meeting began. Within hours, Theresa May’s spokesman announced that she had agreed to set up a meeting after all. He added that the prime minister “deeply values” the contribution the Windrush generation have made, but the outrage over the initial refusal overshadowed the opening of the conference. The decision to back down on the refusal to schedule a Chogm meeting on the issue followed rising anger from politicians of all parties. Over 140 MPs from all parties sent a letter to May, expressing concern about the incorrect classification of many Commonwealth-born, long-term British as “illegal immigrants” and calling on her to find a “swift resolution of this growing crisis”. Communities secretary Sajid Javid said he was “deeply concerned” about the Windrush scandal, adding ”this should not happen to people who have been longstanding pillars of our community.” Rudd’s announcement came in response to an urgent question called by Labour’s David Lammy who said it was “inhumane and cruel” for so many in the Windrush generation “to have suffered so long in this condition”. “This is a day of national shame and it has come about because of a hostile environment policy that was begun under her prime minister. Let us call it as it is. If you lay down with dogs, you get fleas, and that is what has happened with this far-right rhetoric in this country,” he said. “Can she [Rudd] tell the house how many have been detained as prisoners in their own country? Can she tell us how many have been denied healthcare under the National Health Service, how many have been denied pensions and how many have lost their jobs?” he asked. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, expressed scepticism about whether the new Home Office team would really resolve the problems faced by hundreds of people. “How much confidence can people have in the special team when people with lawyers have been unable to resolve their situations?” she asked. She also called on the government to apologise to those people wrongfully detained. Neither Paulette Wilson, 61 nor Anthony Bryan, 60, who were both told they were illegal immigrants and detained in immigration removal centres – despite each having lived and worked in this country for over half a century – have had any apology from the Home Office for their treatment. Until now individuals have struggled to provide the evidence required by the Home Office to resolve their status problems – often unable to submit the recommended four pieces of documentary evidence for every year spent in the UK, not least because relatives have died, schools have shut down and records have been destroyed. Decades of national insurance records have not been deemed sufficient proof, but Rudd said that would change, and Home Office staff would attempt to work with other departments to source paperwork. “The team will be tasked with helping these applicants demonstrate they are entitled to live in the UK and will be tasked with resolving cases within two weeks of the evidence being provided. They will work across government to help these applicants prove they have been working and living in the UK,” she said. Satbir Singh, the CEO of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, welcomed the new team. “But that on its own is not enough: the Home Office must commit to a system which treats affected people with fairness, humanity and flexibility,” he added. “In the past few days we’ve witnessed the culmination of years of government policy explicitly designed to turn us into a hostile society and which have made the Home Office into an island of inhumanity and incompetence. This is the first time that the government has been forced to account for these deliberate decisions. We hope it marks the start of a conversation about how we treat all those who seek to make a life here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/16/a-real-life-lord-of-the-flies-the-troubling-legacy-of-the-robbers-cave-experiment","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T11:59:27Z","webTitle":"A real-life Lord of the Flies: the troubling legacy of the Robbers Cave experiment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/16/a-real-life-lord-of-the-flies-the-troubling-legacy-of-the-robbers-cave-experiment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/16/a-real-life-lord-of-the-flies-the-troubling-legacy-of-the-robbers-cave-experiment","fields":{"headline":"A real-life Lord of the Flies: the troubling legacy of the Robbers Cave experiment","bodyText":"July 1953: late one evening in the woods outside Middle Grove, New York state, three men are having a furious argument. One of them, drunk, draws back his fist, ready to smash it into his opponent’s face. Seeing what is about to happen, the third grabs a block of wood from a nearby pile. “Dr Sherif! If you do it, I’m gonna hit you,” he shouts. The man with the raised fist isn’t just anybody. He is one of the world’s foremost social psychologists, Muzafer Sherif. The two others are his research assistants. Sherif is angry because the experiment he has spent months preparing for has just fallen apart. Born in the summer of 1905 and raised in İzmir province, Turkey, during the dying days of the Ottoman empire, Sherif won a place at Harvard to study psychology. But he found himself frustrated by the narrowness of the discipline, which mainly involved tedious observation of lab rats. He was drawn instead to the emerging field of social psychology, which looks at the way human behaviour is influenced by others. In particular, he became obsessed by group dynamics: how individuals band together to form cohesive units and how these units can find themselves at each other’s throats. In the aftermath of the second world war, he wasn’t the only one interested in this idea. Early in 1953, the Rockefeller Foundation gave Sherif $38,000 – $350,000 (£245,000) in today’s money – to carry out what he hoped would be a career-defining piece of research. This time there would be no rats: the subjects were 11-year-olds, and neither they nor their parents had any idea what they were signing up for. This is the scene Gina Perry sets at the beginning of The Lost Boys, her new book about Sherif. It’s her second foray into social psychology: Behind the Shock Machine (2013) looked at the notorious Milgram experiments of the early 60s, which studied the extent to which people are prepared to follow orders. Stanley Milgram made subjects think they were delivering potentially fatal electric shocks to participants in another room, and provided a scream soundtrack to make it sound convincing. Two-thirds went along with it, despite the terrifying noises. Sherif’s cover story was that he was running a summer camp in Middle Grove. His plan was to bring a group of boys together, allow them to make friends, then separate them into two factions to compete for a prize. At this point, he believed, they would forget their friendships and start demonising one another. The pièce de résistance was to come at the end: Sherif planned to set a forest fire in the vicinity of the camp. Facing a shared threat, they would be forced to work as one team again. This was a year before the publication of Lord of the Flies. But whereas William Golding sought to show that boys were, by their nature, little devils, Sherif believed that context was everything. Competition over scarce resources could drive people to enmity; place a common obstacle in their way, and they cooperate. During his youth, Perry writes, Sherif witnessed interethnic violence between Turks, Greeks and Armenians that claimed tens of thousands of lives. She believes his desire to understand the causes of that catastrophe – and to show the world a way to prevent another like it – was what drove him. His work seems particularly relevant in an age of resurgent tribalism. During the 2016 US election, psychologists Yarrow Dunham and David Rand invoked Sherif in a discussion of the apparently unbridgeable divide between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders supporters. They cited his recognition of the “human tendency to forge alliances as the context demands”, writing that “for Democrats, the context is now the threat of a President Trump”. This, they believed, was grounds for optimism. Unfortunately, even a united Democratic party wasn’t enough to see off a tribe that recruited from Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, and stormed the White House. In 50s Middle Grove, things didn’t go according to plan either, though the surprise was of a different nature. Despite his pretence of leaving the 11-year-olds to their own devices, Sherif and his research staff, posing as camp counsellors and caretakers, interfered to engineer the result they wanted. He believed he could make the two groups, called the Pythons and the Panthers, sworn enemies via a series of well-timed “frustration exercises”. These included his assistants stealing items of clothing from the boys’ tents and cutting the rope that held up the Panthers’ homemade flag, in the hope they would blame the Pythons. One of the researchers crushed the Panthers’ tent, flung their suitcases into the bushes and broke a boy’s beloved ukulele. To Sherif’s dismay, however, the children just couldn’t be persuaded to hate each other. After losing a tug-of-war, the Pythons declared that the Panthers were in fact the better team and deserved to win. The boys concluded that the missing clothes were the result of a mix-up at the laundry. And, after each of the Pythons swore on a Bible that they didn’t cut down the Panthers’ flag, any conflict “fizzled”. By the time of the incident with the suitcases and the ukulele, the boys had worked out that they were being manipulated. Instead of turning on each other, they helped put the tent back up and eyed their “camp counsellors” with suspicion. “Maybe you just wanted to see what our reactions would be,” one of them said. The robustness of the boy’s “civilised” values came as a blow to Sherif, making him angry enough to want to punch one of his young academic helpers. It turned out that the strong bonds forged at the beginning of the camp weren’t easily broken. Thankfully, he never did start the forest fire – he aborted the experiment when he realised it wasn’t going to support his hypothesis. But the Rockefeller Foundation had given Sherif $38,000. In his mind, perhaps, if he came back empty-handed, he would face not just their anger but the ruin of his reputation. So, within a year, he had recruited boys for a second camp, this time in Robbers Cave state park in Oklahoma. He was determined not to repeat the mistakes of Middle Grove. There was no mixing at the beginning – neither of the two groups, the Rattlers and the Eagles, were aware of the other’s existence until the second day. But, perhaps more importantly, Sherif relinquished his role as puppet master; a condition laid down by his research associate, OJ Harvey, who knew how volatile Sherif could be and insisted on taking control himself. At Robbers Cave, things went more to plan. After a tug-of-war in which they were defeated, the Eagles burned the Rattler’s flag. Then all hell broke loose, with raids on cabins, vandalism and food fights. Each moment of confrontation, however, was subtly manipulated by the research team. They egged the boys on, providing them with the means to provoke one another – who else, asks Perry in her book, could have supplied the matches for the flag-burning? Having got them fighting, the next stage was the all-important reconciliation – and the vindication of Sherif’s theory. One morning, the boys found that their water supply had been cut off. They would have to locate the water tank high on the mountain and work together to remove the rocks Harvey and Sherif had placed over the valve, so they could open it again. “Slowly,” Perry writes, “with the sun beating down and their water canteens emptying, the boundaries between the groups began to blur.” First, she says, they “took turns lifting and carrying the rocks away. But, realising there was a better and faster way of getting the job done, they soon formed a chain, passing the rocks down the line and working as a single team.” Sherif was elated. And, with the publication of his findings that same year, his status as world-class scholar was confirmed. The “Robbers Cave experiment” is considered seminal by social psychologists, still one of the best-known examples of “realistic conflict theory”. It is often cited in modern research. But was it scientifically rigorous? And why were the results of the Middle Grove experiment – where the researchers couldn’t get the boys to fight – suppressed? “Sherif was clearly driven by a kind of a passion,” Perry says. “That shaped his view and it also shaped the methods he used. He really did come from that tradition in the 30s of using experiments as demonstrations – as a confirmation, not to try to find something new.” In other words, think of the theory first and then find a way to get the results that match it. If the results say something else? Bury them. Perry has called her book The Lost Boys because she traced several of Sherif’s subjects, now men in their 70s, to ask them how they felt about having been guinea pigs. Astonishingly, none of them were aware that the rather unusual camps they had attended were fake. “I’m not traumatised by the experiment, but I don’t like lakes, camps, cabins or tents,” Doug Griset tells Perry, wryly undermining his own point. He was sent home from Middle Grove after succumbing to a bout of homesickness that Sherif worried would become contagious. Griset marvels at a letter sent to his parents more than 50 years ago to recruit him for the experiment. Those letters, writes Perry, “are a lesson in the art of skilful deception and subtle persuasion”. In them, Sherif explains that “camp directors are interested in finding out what things can be done to give the boys … a wholesome cooperative living experience which will prepare the youngsters for better citizenship and to be leaders in their communities”. How could the parents have known his real aim was to make their sons hate each other – then leave them to deal with a forest fire? Subterfuge of this kind was to become unacceptable to academic psychologists after Milgram’s experiments, which provoked an outcry. Sherif’s ethical blunders seem milder, but they still had lasting effects. Having expected to act as inquisitor, Perry found herself treated more like an interviewee. “Really, I felt I had to answer their questions: ‘Who was this guy? Why was I involved? How did my parents agree to me going away? What did I do during the experiment?’ All the boys I spoke to had an uneasy feeling about this experience. It has troubled people,” she says. Does Sherif really deserve his place in social psychology’s hall of fame, given what Perry has uncovered about his methods? Robbers Cave is, after all, a staple of textbooks. “I think people are aware now that there are real ethical problems with Sherif’s research,” she tells me, “but probably much less aware of the backstage [manipulation] that I’ve found. And that’s understandable because the way a scientist writes about their research is accepted at face value.” The published report of Robbers Cave uses studiedly neutral language. “It’s not until you are able to compare the published version with the archival material that you can see how that story is shaped and edited and made more respectable in the process.” That polishing up still happens today, she explains. “I wouldn’t describe him as a charlatan … every journal article, every textbook is written to convince, persuade and to provide evidence for a point of view. So I don’t think Sherif is unusual in that way.” If Middle Grove and Robbers Cave aren’t scientifically rigorous, does that mean they’re of no value? Perry doesn’t think so. “There was a kind of breadth of vision about Robbers Cave that is very much missing in that tightly controlled laboratory deception of something like Milgram. He was trying to tackle big issues.” And, from today’s perspective, perhaps there is some reassurance to be gleaned from boys’ behaviour at Middle Grove. Despite attempts to influence them that a Russian troll farm would be proud of, they remained independent-minded and did what they thought was best. “I do think it is a kind of optimistic view,” says Perry. “It makes you smile, doesn’t it? The fact that they mutinied against these guys, really, and refused to be drawn into it.” The Lost Boys: Inside Muzafer Sherif’s Robbers Cave Experiment by Gina Perry is published by Scribe in Australia on 16 April and in the UK on 26 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/16/obese-couples-could-be-risking-health-of-future-children-studies-say","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T22:30:20Z","webTitle":"Obese couples could be risking health of future children, studies say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/16/obese-couples-could-be-risking-health-of-future-children-studies-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/16/obese-couples-could-be-risking-health-of-future-children-studies-say","fields":{"headline":"Obese couples could be risking health of future children, studies say","bodyText":"Couples who are obese, as well as those who smoke and drink alcohol, could be risking the health of their future children, say experts who are calling for far more awareness of the effects of modern lifestyles on babies in the womb. A series of three scientific papers in a leading medical journal spell out the consequences of poor diet and lifestyles for the next generation. They urge schools, GPs and nurses to talk to young people and those who may be planning a family about how to be fitter and healthier before they embark on pregnancy. What happens in the “pre-conception” period can have a profound impact on the growth, development and long-term health of children, they say. Some of the interventions that exist to help pregnant women be healthier are taken up too late. Folic acid helps prevent neural defects, but most women do not start to take it until they have seen a GP to confirm their pregnancy, which can be after a month or two. The crucial time is in the early days and weeks. Lead author Prof Judith Stephenson of University College London said: “The key message is to act earlier, before conception. The idea that there are things you can do before the pregnancy that will affect the health of the baby is not always grasped. “The general view of most women is, ‘Once I’m pregnant I will go and see the GP and things will get going from there.’” But she said the scientists did not want to distress parents who might have been overweight when they had their children. “All the evidence points to early events being very influential in later life, but you are not doomed at that stage,” she said. “Things you do throughout childhood and adolescence also have a powerful influence on future health.” The global series of three papers in the Lancet also highlights the risks of undernourished girls in the developing world having stunted babies with poor cognitive development. It is a very serious problem that needs to be better tackled, but obesity is now more widespread. “In many low, middle, and high-income countries, up to 50% of women are overweight or obese when they become pregnant,” say the experts. “In high-income countries, adolescents have the poorest diets of any age group … it is a crucial period for establishing long-term health risk.” Obesity, they say, is associated with increased risk of most major adverse outcomes for pregnant women and their babies. It can make it hard to conceive and complicate pregnancy – women are at risk of high blood pressure, called pre-eclampsia, for instance. It increases the chances of birth defects, stillbirth, low-weight babies, unsuccessful breastfeeding and even the death of the mother. The issues are not just with the weight of the mother. Obesity in the father has been linked to impaired fertility and an increased risk of chronic disease in the child. Couples are already advised to stop smoking and drinking when a woman is pregnant. Now they should be counselled about their nutrition and losing weight as well. One of the best opportunities to intervene is when a woman visits a nurse or a family planning clinic to have a contraceptive implant or coil removed. But GPs could also ask whether couples are considering having a family during any other routine visit. There is a window of opportunity to get the healthy message across when couples are thinking of having a child, said Stephenson. “Couples are very motivated around this time,” she said. In one pilot study, a researcher suggested to obese women planning to get pregnant that they lose a lot of weight first. “Two-thirds gave it a go and a third completed it,” she said. Couples need support, however. “It is usually not enough to simply educate or give advice, as knowing something is good for you is rarely sufficient to change behaviour,” says one of the papers. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said it was very concerned that 96% of women of reproductive age had low levels of iron and folic acid. “This is yet another piece of evidence adding to the overwhelming need for the government to add folic acid to flour,” said Prof Janice Rymer, vice-president. “This simple measure will reach women most at risk in our society who have poor dietary and socioeconomic status, as well as those women who may not have planned their pregnancy.” The college also supported the call for education about health and fitness prior to having children. “Education from an early age – ideally from adolescence – about the need to maintain a healthy diet and weight will not only improve the health of individuals, but also the health and quality of life of future generations,” Rymer said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/16/syria-chemical-attack-inspectors-unable-to-access-douma-site","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T19:34:53Z","webTitle":"Syria: chemical weapons inspectors barred from Douma site","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/16/syria-chemical-attack-inspectors-unable-to-access-douma-site","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/16/syria-chemical-attack-inspectors-unable-to-access-douma-site","fields":{"headline":"Syria: chemical weapons inspectors barred from Douma site","bodyText":"Russia and the Syrian regime have been accused by western diplomats of denying chemical weapons inspectors access to sites in the town of Douma, where an attack killed dozens and prompted US-led missile strikes over the weekend. Russia and Syria had cited “pending security issues” before inspectors could deploy to the town outside Damascus, said Ahmet Üzümcü, the director general of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), at a meeting of its executive council. Syrian authorities were offering 22 people to interview as witnesses instead, he said, adding that he hoped “all necessary arrangements will be made … to allow the team to deploy to Douma as soon as possible”. Meanwhile, the Trump administration delayed action on sanctions against Russians suspected of helping Syria’s chemical weapons programme, contradicting remarks on Sunday by the US envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley. Haley had said in a television interview that sanctions would be “coming down” on Monday. But the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, said on Monday that “a decision will be made in the near future. We’ll keep you guys posted.” The Washington Post reported that Trump had intervened personally to delay the implementation of sanctions, citing unnamed sources as saying the president “was upset the sanctions were being officially rolled out because he was not yet comfortable executing them”. And a senior administration source told Reuters that Trump was unlikely to approve more sanctions unless Moscow carries out a new cyber-attack or some other provocation. Speaking in parliament on Monday, Theresa May accused Syria and Russia of blocking access and attempting to cover up the attack. “The Syrian regime has reportedly been attempting to conceal the evidence by searching evacuees from Douma to ensure samples are not being smuggled from this area, and a wider operation to conceal the facts of the attack is under way, supported by the Russians,” the prime minister said. The UK’s OPCW delegation tweeted: “Russia &amp; Syria have not yet allowed access to Douma. Unfettered access essential. Russia &amp; Syria must cooperate.” The Russian deputy envoy at the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said the obstacles were caused by the western bombing. “If you go to a site which was just bombed I imagine you might have certain logistic problems,” he said. Earlier, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said the inspectors could not access the site because they did not have the appropriate United Nations permission. In response the UN said it had provided the necessary clearances for a fact-finding mission. Russian military officials were at the site of the Douma attack days before the OPCW reached Damascus. “It is our concern that they may have tampered with it,” Kenneth Ward, the US ambassador to the OPCW, told the council meeting. In an interview with the BBC the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said he could “guarantee that Russia has not tampered with the site” and reiterated the Russian line that any attack on Douma was “staged”. The US launched military strikes, alongside UK and French forces, in the early hours of Saturday morning local time aimed at degrading the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons facilities. Over the weekend the OPCW sent inspectors on a fact-finding visit to Douma to search for evidence and interview witnesses. Their arrival coincided with a Syrian military announcement that it had “purified” the region of eastern Ghouta, of which Douma is a part, after a two-month campaign that has killed nearly 2,000 civilians, following years of siege. Western countries are making a push both at the OPCW in The Hague and the UN in New York to secure wider diplomatic support for a clampdown on the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The suspicion is that the Syrian government previously misled inspectors when it declared its entire chemical weapons stockpile had been disclosed and destroyed. In an attempt to create some diplomatic momentum from the strikes, the French mission to the UN circulated a resolution that sought to establish some consensus on future chemical weapon use, measures to offer more protection to civilians and to stimulate the dormant Geneva peace process. The French ambassador, François Delattre, said he was not pressing for an immediate security council debate. “There is no artificial timeframe for the discussions,” Delattre said. “It cannot happen overnight and we will engage with each and every one of them and collectively to have hopefully thorough, in-depth serious discussions.” EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg threatened new sanctions against Syria, but offered little support among member states for fresh US measures against Russia. A joint statement from the 28 also fell short of wholehearted support for the US-led strikes. Syria joined the OPCW in 2013 after a sarin gas attack that killed hundreds of people in Ghouta. The move was part of a joint Russian-US deal that averted military action threatened by the then US president, Barack Obama. The OPCW needs a two-thirds majority to take decisions, and faces the threat of being fatally weakened as Russia and the west fight over the OPCW’s mandate to ascribe responsibility for attacks. A Russian veto at the UN last November means the OPCW is empowered only to state if chemical weapons have been used, and not to attribute responsibility. Russia is also challenging an OPCW finding that a nerve agent was found in an attack in Salisbury on the Russian double agent Sergei Skripal. A joint United Nations-OPCW mission concluded the Syrian air force was responsible for a sarin attack that killed nearly 100 people a year ago in the town of Khan Sheikhoun. The finding led Russia to object to the way in which the joint mission reached its conclusions, and to demand changes in its methodology before its mandate could be renewed. The British envoy to the OPCW, Peter Wilson, told the executive meeting: “The time has come for all members of this executive council to take a stand. Too many duck the responsibility that comes with being a member of this council. Failure to act to hold perpetrators to account will only risk further barbaric use of chemical weapons, in Syria and beyond.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/17/ex-offenders-face-bleak-future-after-reforms-fail-report-says","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T23:01:21Z","webTitle":"Ex-offenders face bleak future after reforms fail, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/17/ex-offenders-face-bleak-future-after-reforms-fail-report-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/17/ex-offenders-face-bleak-future-after-reforms-fail-report-says","fields":{"headline":"Ex-offenders face bleak future after reforms fail, report says","bodyText":"Ex-offenders trying to turn their lives around face a bleak future, a probation inspector has warned, as ambitious government plans to boost the role of charities and volunteers in the probation service have failed to materialise. Dame Glenys Stacey, the chief inspector of probation, described the low involvement of non-profits, charities and voluntary groups in the rehabilitation and supervision of ex-offenders as “an exasperating situation”. The probation sector in England and Wales was overhauled in 2014 by the then justice secretary, Chris Grayling, who broke up existing probation trusts and replaced them with a public sector service dealing with high-risk offenders and 21 privately run companies that manage low-to-medium risk offenders. In a report on “probation supply chains”, or the outsourcing of services to a range of providers, the Inspectorate of Probation said Ministry of Justice (MoJ) press releases around 2013 to 2014 “gave the impression” that there would be a wide array of organisations involved in the delivery of probation services. But the inspectorate found that “almost four years on, this expectation has not been realised”. “It seems that the third sector is less involved than ever in probation services, despite its best efforts,” Stacey said. Grayling’s hopes that third-sector organisations would wholly run some of the community rehabilitation companies (CRCs) were disappointed when the charities and voluntary groups were unable to bid because of the financial guarantees demanded by the government. However, it was still expected that third-sector organisations would provide specialist support – such as bespoke services for women, drug and alcohol abuse or gang membership – through sub-contracts. But most CRCs have not sub-contracted services to the third-sector owing to their own “financial instability”, the inspectorate found, and many of the contracts in place before the reforms were not renewed. The CRCs told inspectors that the payment-by-results model pushed by Grayling, by which companies are paid depending on whether or not they hit re-offending targets and also face penalties when contract targets are not met, was at the root of their financial insecurity. Among the specialist services lacking are those relating to gang membership, financial management, discriminatory attitudes and accommodation, the inspectorate found. And when a specialist service is provided, the feedback from ex-offenders was positive, with the assistance making a difference in the lives of two-thirds of offenders, the report said. “It is an exasperating situation. Third-sector providers remain eager to work in the sector, and we found the quality of their work reasonable overall,” Stacey said. “As things stand, the future looks bleak for some organisations, and particularly for those individuals who could benefit so much from the services they can provide.” The reforms were a cornerstone of Grayling’s time heading the MoJ. An employee of a charity that works with ex-offenders, speaking anonymously, told the Guardian: “The findings in this report are not surprising. While there was undoubtedly a genuine desire for diverse supply chains at the design phase of Transforming Rehabilitation, innovation has been hamstrung by overly prescriptive contract targets which carry heavy penalties but do little to promote desistance [reducing offending], if anything diverting resources away from it. “A healthy supply chain with the specialist expertise to support a wide spectrum of needs will invariably cost more than doing everything ‘in house’, yet the drive for efficiencies that underpins Transforming Rehabilitation drastically limits CRCs’ capacity to commission the range of services that their clients require.” The prisons and probation minister, Rory Stewart, said: “As Dame Glenys highlights in this insightful report, there have been challenges facing CRCs and involving the voluntary sector in the delivery of probation services. “We now have a more diverse range of probation providers than ever before, and I want to see the voluntary sector play a key role in this. The expertise and commitment of third sector organisations has a crucial part to play in reforming offenders and ultimately keeping the public safe. “I have been absolutely clear that I want probation to work better and there is much more to be done – particularly on getting the basics right – and we are working closely with providers to make sure this happens.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/apr/16/serie-as-goalless-draws-leave-one-predictable-outcome-joy-for-juventus","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T10:30:23Z","webTitle":"Serie A's goalless draws leave one predictable outcome: joy for Juventus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/16/serie-as-goalless-draws-leave-one-predictable-outcome-joy-for-juventus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/apr/16/serie-as-goalless-draws-leave-one-predictable-outcome-joy-for-juventus","fields":{"headline":"Serie A's goalless draws leave one predictable outcome: joy for Juventus","bodyText":"What a weekend it promised to be. A Rome derby on Sunday night, with the capital clubs joint-third and fighting desperately to cling to their Champions League berths. Inter, one point behind, kicking off 24 hours earlier away to an Atalanta team with European ambitions of its own. In between those two games, Milan-Napoli at San Siro. Anything could happen. And so, inevitably, nothing did. All three of the aforementioned games, along with two others, finished without a goal being scored. Put your preconceptions about Italian football to one side. This is hardly the norm in a division that has averaged more goals per game than the Premier League in 2017-18. Even this weekend, chances were created, woodwork struck and forwards denied by extraordinary saves. If there was one truly predictable element, it was this: by the end of it all, Juventus were celebrating. But let us start at the beginning. The stalemate in Bergamo might have set the tone for some of what came next. Inter knew a win would guarantee them a place in the top four, since Roma and Lazio were going head-to-head. To qualify for Champions League football, though, typically requires a consistent capacity for sticking the ball in the net. And if there’s one thing Inter do not do, it’s consistency. A team that scored eight times in the space of two games last month has failed to do so even once in three since. Inter can boast Serie A’s second-most prolific striker in Mauro Icardi, while Ivan Perisic has chipped in nine goals from the left flank, and yet somehow 10 of this season’s opponents have walked away with clean sheets. If anything, they were fortunate not to lose to Atalanta, who had comfortably the better of the first half. Papu Gómez and Musa Barrow were each guilty of missing presentable chances, though Samir Handanovic also played his part in the Inter goal. In any case, that draw did take some of the edge off the Rome derby. Not for supporters – who produced stunning choreographies at both ends of the Stadio Olimpico – but perhaps for the teams, who now knew a draw would preserve their top-four status quo. To evoke a phrase famously used by Gigi Buffon: “Better two wounded than one dead.” Perhaps it would be better to frame this match in the language of exhaustion rather than injury. Both teams looked spent from their midweek exertions in Europe. The results might have been very different but the physical and emotional investment was similar. And so what we got on Sunday was a game high on tension but lacking in sharpness on either side. Chances came and went sporadically. Bruno Peres hit the post for Roma. Sergej-Milinkovic-Savic set up Marco Parolo and Ciro Immobile with delicate chips only for both to get the finish all wrong. The only period of sustained pressure came right at the death, when Edin Dzeko saw one header well saved, then hit the crossbar with another and flashed a further shot wide, all in the space of not much more than a minute. He and Immobile have combined for more goals this season than any previous pair of strikers facing off in a Rome derby, yet neither could find a finishing touch. Was there much to be learned from this game? From a tactical standpoint, it was interesting to see Eusebio Di Francesco repeat the three-man defence he used against Barcelona. Untested before last Tuesday night, will it become a feature of the remaining part of this season, or did he simply see the merit here in mirroring Lazio’s formation? The other great question for Roma concerns their capacity to manage players’ energy levels through this final part of the campaign. Di Francesco made only one change to his midweek starting XI, replacing Alessandro Florenzi with Peres. But Roma face a further six games in three weeks, including the two legs of their Champions League semi with Liverpool. Given the precariousness of their hold on a top-four spot, none of them can be taken lightly. What were Serie A’s schedule-makers thinking when they arranged a midweek round between the Champions League quarter- and semi-finals? Given that Juventus have been habitually involved in the latter stages of continental competition in recent seasons, it seems a significant oversight. The Bianconeri presumably will not mind, after they were eliminated by Real Madrid. There was no hint of a Champions League hangover as they beat Sampdoria 3-0, with an inspired Douglas Costa providing all three assists, though Massimiliano Allegri admitted the sound of his team being applauded before kick-off by supporters “twisted my nuts all over again about how we went out.” That win moved them six points clear at the top, following Napoli’s draw away to Milan. The match at San Siro had – despite the lack of goals – been perhaps the most entertaining of the weekend, and not only for the bizarre spectacle of a half-time penalty shootout featuring Bruce Grobbelaar and Geri Haliwell. This was a match played at a helter-skelter tempo and in a cacophony of noise, with opportunities arriving at both ends. But the scene was stolen by Gianluigi Donnarumma, making his 100th appearance in Serie A at the age of 19 and producing an absolutely sensational save to deny Arkadiusz Milik a last-gasp winner. It might not have been a stop that turned the title race – the Partenopei were, after all, already four points off first place – but it was certainly celebrated in Turin. Napoli’s performances have faded over the past six weeks, yet their capacity for grinding out late results has endured. Five of their last nine goals have been scored inside the final 10 minutes. So when Lorenzo Insigne flicked a Christian Maggio cross into Milik’s path in the 91st minute, the narrative seemed set. Six yards out, the striker took aim at the bottom corner: the correct choice when facing a keeper as tall as Donnarumma, who does sometimes struggle to get down in close quarters. Not here. The teenager plunged to his left and pushed the ball around the post. In Monday’s Gazzetta dello Sport, Fabio Licari defined it as a “Cristiano Ronaldo overhead in reverse”. Sometimes even no goals can be beautiful. Not for Napoli, clearly, not for the title race and not even for a Milan team whose four-game winless run has cost them a shot at the Champions League and may yet put their Europa League spot in jeopardy. But for a young keeper who has been through the wringer this season, targeted by his own fans for a perceived lack of loyalty and by Neapolitans on Sunday for “betraying” his hometown? “That was one of the most beautiful I’ve made in these few years of my career,” said Donnarumma. He has time yet for many more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/16/theresa-may-children-windrush-ministers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T09:53:21Z","webTitle":"May leads with coldness and cruelty.

Just ask the children of Windrush","bodyText":"One of the most appalling elements of the Windrush generation immigration scandal is that the mess is so easily fixable. The government has long had the right and the facility to grant indefinite leave to remain to those whose presence in the country may be technically questionable but socially desirable. That it has chosen not to do so tells us much, as does today’s revelation that No 10 has snubbed a plea from Commonwealth heads of government for talks about the debacle. The government has not acted decisively so far because it has not felt compelled to do so. For many months now, the Guardian reporter Amelia Gentleman has trodden a lonely path in trying to highlight these stories, without exciting the sort of supplementary interest from other media that might persuade ministers and their advisers that failure to do so placed their own futures in jeopardy. But in recent days, other newspapers and broadcasters have begun to expose the government’s failure to act. The equation, and with it the level of risk to politicians and bureaucrats, has changed. That speaks to the power of the media even now to hold the system to account, a vital component of our democracy. But it also says some sorry things about Theresa May and those who do her bidding. This is a government that lacks purpose and obvious competence. We see that in its stewardship of the NHS, the benefits system, and most of all, its muddling towards an ill-considered, undefined, illogical Brexit. But what is just as disturbing, given the might of government and the extent to which its activities have a direct effect on people’s lives, is the lack of any moral grounding or emotional intelligence. It wields power disproportionately and clumsily. It tramples on the cares of ordinary people like a drunk in hobnail boots. It is said that up close, May herself is thoughtful and personable, but when it’s time to go to work, she is the leader who thought the best way to allay immigration concerns was to hire vans with advertising boards telling undesired immigrants to “go home”. She is the one who sent the signal to her officials that, henceforth, those whose immigration status was questionable should find Britain a “hostile environment”. She is the one who went to Grenfell and, initially at least, couldn’t spare the time to speak to victims. She runs a government that tells the infirm that they must work and disabled people that they aren’t really disabled. Leaders lead. Followers follow. If you look at May’s bloodless, technocratic approach to government, you easily understand how those who serve her feel able, or perhaps compelled, to do their jobs unburdened by any demand for compassion or empathy. She sets the tone. She must change it. She could start today by meeting the Caribbean leaders and responding to their concerns, as well as those voiced by 140 MPs from across the political spectrum. Of course, that will require political navigation. She knows that after the poisonous Brexit campaign – and thanks to her lieutenants, messrs Gove and Johnson – the public expectation is that by fair means or foul, she will be tough towards immigrants. But even her own logic dictates a different approach. Along with the “deep and special” relationship she envisages with the EU post-Brexit, her ministers promise a new and vital recoupling with the Commonwealth. How does this mistreatment of its people, this trashing of historic ties and this deaf ear to the concerns of its representatives, forward that strategy? It could be that, in their calculations, ministers believed that there would be no groundswell of support for middle-aged black people, irrespective of any ties they have or the contributions they have made to communities up and down the country. In that, again, the technocrats are being proved wrong by the media, MPs and the public. That may be the only heartening development so far in this sorry affair. • Hugh Muir is associate editor of Guardian Opinion"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/17/brexit-legislation-caught-in-parliamentary-logjam","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T05:00:29Z","webTitle":"Brexit legislation caught in parliamentary logjam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/17/brexit-legislation-caught-in-parliamentary-logjam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/17/brexit-legislation-caught-in-parliamentary-logjam","fields":{"headline":"Brexit legislation caught in parliamentary logjam","bodyText":"A parliamentary logjam will mean the government is likely to struggle to pass vital legislation paving the way for leaving the EU before the parliamentary vote on the final Brexit deal. Almost half of all the legislation that is needed has yet to be even introduced by ministers. MPs returned to parliament on Monday after the Easter recess – the 123rd day that parliament has sat since the general election – but the government is still to pass a single piece of Brexit legislation. Parliament will only sit for another 80 days before MPs are expected to vote on the final Brexit deal struck between Theresa May and the European Union, scheduled for October. The shadow Brexit minister, Jenny Chapman, said there was now “a real danger” that MPs would be ask to vote on the final Brexit deal without having approved crucial legislation, such as the immigration bill, and would be voting blind. The prime minister has promised the UK parliament will be the first to ratify the deal, before it goes to the EU parliament and the other 27 states, though the timeline may slip. Last June, May said this parliament would be a “busy legislative session.” In total, the government has only passed four bills from last year’s Queen’s speech. By comparison, the 2010 coalition government had passed twice as many laws at this stage of the parliament. The general election delivered a hung parliament, leaving May able to pass bills only with the support of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party and dependent on the discipline of Conservative MPs. In December, pro-EU Tory MPs defeated the government to guarantee parliament a meaningful vote on the final deal. The Lords is currently debating the bill and may yet inflict another defeat on the government by passing an amendment to keep the UK in a customs arrangement with the EU. The amendment, sponsored by former Conservative party chair Lord Patten, calls for the government to negotiate an arrangement “which enables the United Kingdom to continue participating in a customs union with the EU”. Several other key pieces of legislation have been delayed, in part because of concerns about the possibility of Conservative rebellions. Chapman said MPs may be expected to vote on the final Brexit deal before they have even had the chance to scrutinise important details such as the government’s immigration plan. “Take back control didn’t mean running away from parliament,” she said. “It’s frankly embarrassing that, more than 10 months since the general election, the government hasn’t passed a single piece of Brexit legislation. Ministers have delayed crucial votes and failed to introduce vital bills.” An analysis by Labour found 44% of Brexit legislation was still to be introduced by ministers – including the immigration, fisheries and withdrawal agreement and implementation bills. MPs have not voted on Brexit in more than two months, while crucial votes on the customs bill and trade bill have been delayed for more than two months – and are now not expected until after the local elections next month. Conservative MPs in favour of a soft Brexit, including two of the party’s select committee chairmen and three former ministers, have put their name to amendments that would force the prime minister to put Britain’s membership of a customs union back on the negotiating table. Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour’s policy is to support such an arrangement, raising concerns in No 10 that May could be defeated on a key plank of her Brexit strategy. However, it remains unclear whether the Tory MPs behind the amendment would go as far as pushing for a vote if there was a real possibility of fatally undermining the prime minister. A government spokesperson said: “Brexit is an issue of national importance and clearly it is important that parliament is given the proper opportunity to scrutinise the legislation that will underpin it. “We are making good progress and we are confident that we can pass the necessary legislation in good time. For example, the EU (withdrawal) bill has already moved through the Commons and is now at report stage in the Lords while the nuclear safeguards bill and sanctions and anti-money laundering bill have made good progress through both Houses.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/23/dan-jarvis-labour-sheffield-city-region-mayor-election","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"No agreed power, no agreed budget: Dan Jarvis on his fight to be Sheffield mayor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/23/dan-jarvis-labour-sheffield-city-region-mayor-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/23/dan-jarvis-labour-sheffield-city-region-mayor-election","fields":{"headline":"No agreed power, no agreed budget: Dan Jarvis on his fight to be Sheffield mayor","bodyText":"On a grey weekday morning in Scawsby, Doncaster, the Labour MP Dan Jarvis is knocking on doors to garner support for his bid to be the first mayor for the Sheffield city region – a role that comes with no agreed powers, no agreed budget and no agreed salary. “Apart from that, what’s not to like about it?” he jokes. The government’s decision to push ahead with the election on 3 May, despite south Yorkshire’s local authorities – Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster – failing to agree a devolution settlement, has been criticised as strange and undemocratic. Barnsley and Doncaster pulled out of an initial deal agreed in 2015 last September, following disputes over the route HS2 would take through the region. The two authorities are now among 18 of 20 Yorkshire councils to back proposals for a devolution deal for the whole historic county area, while the government has insisted that the Sheffield city region mayoral election will take place as it was legislated to do so by parliament. The role of Sheffield city region mayor is, therefore, less about wielding power and more about trying to obtain some. “If I’m elected mayor then the very first thing that I will do on my first day is sit down with the four leaders and work out precisely how we are going to reach an agreement that satisfies all of the constituent parts of south Yorkshire,” says the MP for Barnsley Central. “We need an agreement that enables us to start drawing down on the maximum amount of power and the maximum amount of money.” The former army major, who was once tipped as a possible future Labour leader, was finally formally endorsed as the party’s candidate earlier this month after a row with the NEC over whether he should be able to keep his parliamentary seat if he wins. He had won a vote by local party members by 58% in March. Jarvis’s plan to remain in Westminster was permitted after protests by the Yorkshire and Humber group of Labour MPs. As far as Jarvis is concerned, the Sheffield devolution deal is an interim step. He is one of an increasing number of politicians to have been converted by arguments for a Yorkshire-wide devolution deal and his eventual goal is to see the Sheffield city region join a settlement for the whole county, something Jeremy Corbyn endorsed last week. Jarvis admits that this is not a particularly catchy electoral pitch, but he insists that it works. “There is a strong awareness of the arguments for a wider devolved arrangement for Yorkshire,” he says. In December, 85% of those who voted in a community poll held by Barnsley and Doncaster councils said they would prefer to be part of a Yorkshire deal as opposed to a Sheffield city region one. “There is solid support for it, not just in Barnsley and Doncaster, but across south Yorkshire as well,” Jarvis says. In what has been dubbed the Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire, Jarvis’s win seems assured. All of the county’s 15 MPs are Labour, save for Jared O’Mara in Sheffield Hallam, who was suspended from the party following complaints about homophobic and sexist comments. Jarvis’s main opposition in the mayoral race is split, with pockets of strong Green and Liberal Democrat support in parts of Sheffield and some Tory support in Barnsley and Doncaster. He has six opponents, including candidates for the Yorkshire party, South Yorkshire Save Our NHS and the English Democrats. The Conservative candidate, Ian Geoffrey Walker, a local businessman, stood against Nick Clegg in Sheffield Hallam in the 2015 and 2017 general elections. The Lib Dem candidate, Hannah Ruth Kitching, runs a manufacturing business and is also standing to be a councillor in Barnsley. The Green party candidate is Robert Murphy, a heating engineer and councillor in Sheffield. Out canvassing with Jarvis is Kevin Rodgers, a Labour councillor in Doncaster. He says he would be astonished if Jarvis did not win, but adds: “Thinking back to 2009 in Doncaster, at the height of the expenses scandal, we got a real protest vote and we got an English Democrat mayor.” (Peter Davies served a four-year term in the role, resigning from his party in early 2013, citing a big influx of new members from the British National party.) “So, never say never,” Rodgers says. Unlike Sheffield and Barnsley, Rotherham and Doncaster are not holding council elections in May, meaning turnout in the towns could be low. A prominent campaign against tree-felling taking place in Sheffield could result in its Labour council losing some seats in the city’s comparatively affluent south-west, but it is not an issue Jarvis thinks will affect the mayoral race. He acknowledges voices on either side of the argument, but welcomes the council’s decision to pause the felling. Many people opening their doors to Labour activists in Doncaster seem unaware of the upcoming mayoral election. Rebecca Chambers, 20, is coming out of her newly built council house on her way to start her first day in a beauty therapist job, when she runs into the canvassers. “I’d vote if I understood it,” she says. Asked whether she identifies as being from the Sheffield city region, she says no. “Donny first, then Yorkshire.” Even if the four south Yorkshire councils reach a devolution agreement, the new mayor is unlikely to be rolling in cash. The offer on the table includes just £30m a year over 30 years. Jarvis, however, argues that the mayor’s power goes beyond that given to them by central government. “The greatest power that any mayor has is the power to bring people together,” he says. Jarvis is running on a Labour and Co-operative ticket and boasts that his manifesto has “co-op principles hardwired through it”, with plans to help set up more mutuals, cooperatives and community interest companies in south Yorkshire. “I think I’m possibly the only person who was simultaneously in the parachute regiment and the Co-op party,” he says. “And although there are many differences between those organisations, there is one very strong principle that underpins both and that is the need and importance of working alongside other people. At a point when resource is scarce, we have to think even more carefully about how we pool our resources.” • This article was amended on 23 April 2018 because an earlier version said in May local elections will take place in Rotherham, and not in Barnsley.

The Office for National Statistics data contradicts the widely held belief that most Britons in Europe are pensioners sunning themselves in southern France or Spain. ONS figures show two-thirds of the 784,900 British citizens recorded as long-term residents in the EU, excluding the UK and Ireland, are aged between 15 and 64 and more of them live in Spain than any other country. Estimates using data from the Labour Force Survey and the 2011 European censuses put the number of British people resident long-term in Spain at 293,500. France is the next most popular country to live in, with 152,900, followed by Germany, with 96,500, and the Netherlands with 45,300. The data has been published as part of the last of a series of ONS reports called Living Abroad: British residents living in the EU, designed to build a picture of those outside the UK who are affected by Brexit. Ireland has been excluded from the report partly because British citizens in Ireland and Irish citizens in the UK will not be affected by changes to citizens’ rights after Brexit. The report uses UN migrant data to show that, when it comes to emigration, the UK is the least Europhile nation in Europe. It came bottom when comparing the proportion of the population emigrating to another EU country, just behind Malta and Croatia. Just 26% of migrants who were born in the UK and living abroad were living in the EU. In contrast, 44% of emigrants born in Germany moved to another EU state, while 49% of those born in France followed suit. Of the EU countries, citizens of Luxembourg are most likely to move to another state in the bloc. That is likely to reflect its size and geographical location close to biggercities such as Brussels, Paris and Frankfurt. “Spain continues to be the most desirable location for the three quarters of a million Brits living in the EU. However, the EU as a whole is not the most popular destination for British expats, with more than half preferring to live in English-speaking countries,” said Jay Lindop, the deputy director of migration statistics at the ONS. The most common destination for the 4.9m UK-born emigrants were English-speaking countries. Australia and New Zealand are home to 33% of all emigrants. The US and Canada are the next most popular, accounting for 28% of UK emigrants between them. For retirement, Spain is still the No 1 destination for Brits, followed by Portugal and Bulgaria, which rocketed up the league of nations attractive to British and Irish people just before the financial crash because of cheap property in Black Sea resorts. Among the countries with most British children under 15 are Luxembourg, Slovakia, France and Belgium. The highest proportion of British citizens of working age are in Finland and the Czech Republic, at 88% and 87%. By contrast, 53% of those in Spain are aged 65 or over."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/16/ben-stokes-ipl-t20-england-cricket-joe-root-captain","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T12:59:43Z","webTitle":"Ben Stokes: ‘I lived every moment of the Ashes ...

I was just as gutted’","bodyText":"It’s 6pm at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore. A drowsy sun has already slunk below the stands, kites glide overhead and after three hours of intense training in the heat, where he has batted twice, thundered in with the ball for the first time in weeks and stayed late to work on his flying boundary catches, Ben Stokes strolls over for a chat. There is of course one almighty elephant in the ground. We both briefly acknowledge this but it remains just that. This is his first in-depth interview since the incident in Bristol on 25 September last year but regarding events that night Stokes must wait to have his say in court this summer after he and two other men pleaded not guilty to affray. For now it is only cricket, both England and Indian Premier League, that can be on the agenda in the Garden City. The Indian Premier League first, where the 26-year-old is in his second season and at his second side, Rajasthan Royals. Eoin Morgan, one of his two international captains, has recently credited the all-rounder’s MVP-winning stint with the runners-up Rising Pune Supergiant last year for “breaking down barriers” and causing the English invasion that has a record 12 players spread across six of the eight franchises. Stokes appreciates their presence in Twenty20’s great tamasha, rather than with their counties, is not to everyone’s taste back home. The subject of his £1.7m deal with Pune last year – a record for an overseas player – and new price tag at just a shade under, is one at which he squirms. “Last year there was so much said about me and the money. I just shy away from it. I don’t want to come across as arrogant. I don’t know how to answer it. It’s just weird,” he says. “Some people think we’re going for one reason but as a sportsman that is genuinely not what it is about. It’s about being exposed to the best T20 players in the world in front of capacity crowds every three or four days. I don’t think people understand that or see it for what it is. We don’t quite get that in our T20 right now – there aren’t many international matches – but when the new competition kicks off [in 2020] maybe that will happen more.” Stokes is clearly enjoying his time with the Royals. The inaugural IPL winners in 2008, they are now trying to rebuild public trust in their first season back as the result of a two-year ban for the spot-fixing scandal that cost three players their careers. He has struck up a particular rapport with Shane Warne, the team’s mentor, while Jos Buttler is a familiar face in the ranks. But as is the case with England, all team‑mates tend to gravitate towards him. His only off-field struggle in India has come from some of the commercial demands that pack out the schedule on non-match days. “They ask you to do things that are so far out of your comfort zone – it’s just not me,” he says, perhaps in reference to some lively Bollywood-style dancing of his that can be witnessed during the IPL’s numerous TV ad breaks. The feet are moving better on the field even if the returns do not yet jump off the page. His third match against Royal Challengers Bangalore – a high-scoring 19-run win on the day after the interview – is the most impactful yet, with a 21-ball 27 from No 4, his first wicket of the campaign and a leaping boundary catch to remove Brendon McCullum that kickstarted the RCB struggle in their pursuit of 218. While the latter was a classic case of Stokes making the ridiculous look sublimely simple – his extra training 24 hours earlier leapt to mind as he sprung high – it is likely the bowling will have given Stokes most satisfaction, purely for the fact he was charging in at full tilt for the first time in a long time. A pre-Christmas spell in New Zealand with Canterbury notwithstanding, the general lack of action leading into his return for England in February had affected his body. Bowling in the one-day series saw wickets follow but he found his legs seized up after spells. Then, just before the Tests that followed, some historical stress fractures in his lower back suddenly began to cause him grief and injections were required. Just 10 laboured overs were sent down in the two Tests that followed the jabs but Stokes says he is feeling himself again; to prevent a recurrence he is remodelling his bowling action. The late step into the crease that pointed him to fine leg and left him needing to twist in order to straighten up is being eased out. He is happy with the results but the true test is in the middle. The return to the England camp – he has been restored to the side until the end of proceedings – was probably as smooth as he and his employers could have hoped. Stokes says the squad’s response felt no different to before from his perspective – “it’s not like we hadn’t stayed in touch” – but admits watching his Test colleagues among them go down 4-0 in Australia was tough. “I lived every moment of the Ashes. I’m sure it was nowhere near the emotions of the guys out there but I was just as gutted.” Readjustment batting-wise took little time either, with one low-key score of 12 in the first one-dayer at Hamilton – “I was anxious. I was guilty of thinking too far ahead and trying to make an impression. It was like I was at the start of my career,” – before a less flustered unbeaten 63 steered Morgan’s side to a series‑levelling win at Mount Maunganui. “I was really emotional after getting man of the match in that second game back. It was such a relief to perform and be there at the end. I had five minutes to myself after getting back to the dressing room, sat in my bubble and taking it all in. The lads appreciated that and gave me space. It was a great feeling.” For the Tests that followed that eventual 3-2 win, a setback – albeit one that was widely expected – took place when Stokes was told by Joe Root and Trevor Bayliss he would not return to the vice‑captaincy. “They just said they wanted to stick with Jimmy [Anderson]. But regardless, I know my role and it won’t change how I go about things. It won’t be in the back of my mind and I won’t hold it against anyone,” he says. “It’s all about what I’m going to do in the future. I just want to get us back to playing the way we want to play. We were so close to being one of the best teams in the world. We’ve slacked off in the past two years but knowing how close we were gives you that desire to get back there.” That slacking off, as he puts it, bottomed out with the 58 all out in Auckland – “It was like the pins in a bowling alley falling down in slow motion” – from which a 1-0 series defeat followed. From being one Test win away from holding all nine bilateral Test trophies in 2016, only for Pakistan to win at the Oval and square the series, England have five in the cabinet to match their world ranking of fifth. Root, Bayliss and the as-yet reformed selection panel have a job on their hands. The former is battling to turn half-centuries into three figures, too – his last nine have gone unconverted – and it is a topic Stokes has been discussing with one of his new friends in India. “I have seen a lot of people saying he shouldn’t be captain – I won’t say who – and that his batting is being affected by it. I had a chat with Warnie about this, because I don’t see it. Look at his average [52.6] and all the runs scored – why do people have a big thing about not converting? He said Joe is a great player but this is what can make him one of the greatest. I sort of understand it … “But the thing about Joe is he doesn’t bat for himself. If he thinks it is time to take a team down, he will go for it. That’s how he wants us to play as a team and as captain, he feels he has to set the standard. People can have a go at him but the bigger picture, that’s what he is trying to build. When it clicks – and that is coming – those scores will become 150s and 200s. Hopefully when people read what I have said here they will understand a bit more.” Doubtless much of the heat from the end of England’s sorry Test travails this winter was drawn by Australia’s ball-tampering scandal and before Stokes heads up to the dressing room at the Chinnaswamy, before his new team’s departure from the ground, his views on the topic are sought. “I’m keeping my mouth shut. Certain people said some things and it then comes back to get you …” he says, before stopping himself from elaborating on who and what he means. Given the aforementioned elephant, it is probably for the best."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/16/university-pensions-strikes-union-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T12:07:36Z","webTitle":"Universities ending the strikes is not a climbdown – the fight goes on | Des Freedman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/16/university-pensions-strikes-union-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/16/university-pensions-strikes-union-campaign","fields":{"headline":"Universities ending the strikes is not a climbdown – the fight goes on","bodyText":"Members of the University and College Union have voted 64% to 36% to suspend industrial action in their campaign to defend guaranteed pensions. They have accepted the proposals of the employers’ organisation, Universities UK, to set up a “joint expert panel” to consider the valuation of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) fund. They have not done so with any great faith in Universities UK’s commitment to sustaining existing levels of provision, nor with any conviction that the employers’ underlying determination to reduce their pension liabilities has suddenly disappeared. This was a decision driven more by short-term calculations about what further strike action in the summer term might deliver than about accepting Universities UK’s claim that it now recognises “the clear wish of staff to have a guaranteed pension comparable with current provision”. Let’s be clear: the employers have not shifted their position because they have been enlightened or become newly benevolent. Fourteen days of strike action, the ongoing work to rule and the threat of significant disruption to the exam period forced them to change their tune and belatedly to recognise that the campaign to defend a defined benefits pension scheme might have some justification. The dispute has changed the union: thousands have joined up, moribund branches have revived, and a process of radical political education has taken place. While ordinary members have become experts in superannuation schemes and actuarial arguments, we have all learned that the debate is about far more than pensions. Instead it concerns the broad direction of travel of the university sector under neoliberalism. Pension obligations, far from being a technical and opaque issue, are in fact one of the main constraints on the ability of entrepreneurial-minded institutions to operate as autonomous companies in a higher education (and shiny new buildings) market. Many branches have already started to ask some fundamental questions about governance and democracy – not just about the secrecy and lack of transparency of the USS valuation process, but about decision-making in their own institutions. FOI requests about how resources are allocated and campaigns for democratic representation on decision-making committees and structures are likely to become bread-and-butter elements of branch agendas. The dispute has further illustrated the precarious position of hourly paid staff who can barely afford pension contributions. At the same time, it has highlighted the bloated nature of a higher education system that gobbles up tuition fees in order to generate surpluses which it then spends on infrastructure and inflated salaries for vice-chancellors, while pleading poverty when it comes to adequately compensating staff. Acceptance of the offer does not signal the end of the pensions campaign. The composition and work of the proposed panel needs to be scrutinised. The issue of fair pensions must not be kicked into the long grass. The suspension of the action, however, will make it harder to maintain the energy and militancy that emerged so dramatically during the strikes. As the academic Jack Saunders has noted, a “pause” in a dispute is always dangerous: “With momentum gone, attention dissipates and people move on to new problems … Examples of workers successfully prosecuting disputes with a substantial pause in the middle are rare to non-existent.” Oversight of the expert panel is linked to the accountability of union negotiators to its members. And accountability has been in short supply in recent weeks. First, the University and College Union’s general secretary, Sally Hunt, proposed an Acas-aided deal with Universities UK – rejected vociferously by members – which was so unpopular that #NoCapitulation started to trend on Twitter. The union’s higher education committee then voted to put Universities UK’s fresh offer to members, even though this offer had not been negotiated with the union and dozens of branches had requested revisions and clarifications. Finally, the handling of the ballot itself raises questions about the conduct of the leadership, not least because the ballot was accompanied by a lengthy text from the general secretary urging a “yes” vote without any countervailing arguments. Yet democracy was everywhere on the ground during the strikes: in action committees, grassroots initiatives such as teach-outs and staff-student forums, lively branch meetings and indeed the grassroots rebellion against the deal reached at Acas. University staff will now have to rebuild these democratic spaces and galvanise themselves if they are to maintain pressure on both employers and their own negotiators to deliver a pension settlement that is meaningfully comparable to existing provision. Meanwhile, there is unfinished business. Ordinary union members and student supporters, radicalised by the dispute, are now set to play a key role in campaigns against university marketisation. They are best placed both to protect the memory of the dispute and to learn its lessons. They will need not only to scrutinise the work of the forthcoming joint experts panel in future revaluations of the pension scheme, but, more broadly, to coordinate the resistance against the corruption of public higher education by a market that knows the price of everything but the value of nothing. • Des Freedman is professor of media and communications at Goldsmiths, University of London, and is the author of The Politics of Media Policy"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/live/2018/apr/17/david-morrissey-webchat-post-your-questions-now","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T13:32:58Z","webTitle":"David Morrissey webchat – your questions answered on working-class actors, Mo Salah and Basic Instinct 2","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/live/2018/apr/17/david-morrissey-webchat-post-your-questions-now","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/live/2018/apr/17/david-morrissey-webchat-post-your-questions-now","fields":{"headline":"David Morrissey webchat – your questions answered on working-class actors, Mo Salah and Basic Instinct 2","bodyText":"We’re out of time.

A working-class Liverpudlian, when he told his parents about his chosen career path it didn’t go down too well. “It was like telling them I wanted to be an astronaut,” he told the Guardian in 2015. “Not because it was highfalutin’, but because it was a world they didn’t know. They were worried about the unknown.” Starting out at the Everyman theatre in his home city, Morrissey studied at Rada before a breakthrough role in Anand Tucker’s Hilary and Jackie, followed by one as Captain Weber in Captain Corelli’s Mandolin in 2001. But, arguably, it’s his small-screen roles that have defined his career. His turn as a compromised politician in Paul Abbott’s State of Play astonished, as did his portrayal of Gordon Brown in The Deal, while his more recent stint as the Governor on The Walking Dead made him a global star. He is currently starring in the BBC’s sci-fi crime thriller The City and the City, a four-part adaptation of China Miéville’s award-winning novel, which is available in full on iPlayer. Morrissey plays Inspector Tyador Borlú, who is caught between two parallel worlds. David will be joining us for a live webchat at 1.15pm GMT on Friday 20 April.

Mehri, who has a background in biochemical science and wrote the poetry chapbook sugah. lump. prayer, has been shortlisted for this year’s Brunel African poetry prize and won last year’s Out-Spoken Page poetry prize. As laureate, Mehri hopes to encourage young people to voice their concerns and experiences through poetry. The poet, from Kilburn in north-west London, was selected for the role by a panel of arts organisations and poets, and is, according to Spread the Word’s chair of trustees Rishi Dastidar, “an inspired choice” and a “poet to watch”. “For young people to have an artist who is an ambassador for them, who brings their concerns, struggles and joys to those in authority, and the wider world, is vital,” Dastidar said. “Her poetry is precise and powerful, and rich with images that are haunting. She is not afraid to tackle the biggest of subjects, which, combined with her talent, is going to give the role a renewed sense of purpose and visibility.” Mehri said she was exposed to oral forms of poetry by her family when growing up, but only began writing for publication around four years ago. “Over time I honed, or found, my voice, and that allowed me to feel comfortable, finding the poetic voice I felt was most suited to me. Obviously at the beginning you’re very much inspired by your influences,” she said. “I think the poetry I write is interested in questions or ideas around disruption or movement, whether it’s movement of people or places, movement between different ideas, between how things change over different generations, and in themes of migration and urban spaces.” During her time in the role, Mehri will be looking to amplify the voices of Londoners aged between 13 and 25, “to let them lead conversations, to be as inspired by them as hopefully they can be inspired by me”. She will work with writer-development agency Spread the Word on youth-focused residencies across London, head a tour to six outer London boroughs, and co-host a special project for young London poets called The Young People’s Poetry Lab. According to research from the National Literacy Trust, 84% of teachers who participated in a poetry programme for disadvantaged children in London schools over a five-year period said their writing skills had improved. Outgoing young people’s laureate for London, Caleb Femi, said that “poetry has the potential to play a vital part in self-expression and artistic enjoyment in the lives of young people”. “We need a dedicated person who can assist in integrating the joys of poetry into the everydayness of young Londoners,” he added. “We are extremely lucky to have a talented and dedicated poet such as Momtaza Mehri appointed as the new young people’s laureate for London. Her tenure is sure to be an extraordinary one.” Mehri said that she wanted to: “Reach everybody, to allow people to see poetry as part of everyday living in London, and all the different poetry traditions that people bring to London.” “I am very much aware of the fact that I came out of a very different poetic tradition, and what that’s brought to my writing of the English language. So I want to be aware of the fact that people are carrying different poetic influences, whether they consider themselves poets or not,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/16/talking-horses-in-praise-of-windsor-racecourse-plus-mondays-top-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T09:55:33Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: in praise of Windsor racecourse, plus Monday's top tips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/16/talking-horses-in-praise-of-windsor-racecourse-plus-mondays-top-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/16/talking-horses-in-praise-of-windsor-racecourse-plus-mondays-top-tips","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: in praise of Windsor racecourse, plus Monday's top tips","bodyText":"Four of Britain’s five Flat Classics will be run over the course of the next seven weeks, and the domestic run towards Guineas weekend at Newmarket begins on Tuesday with the opening of the three-day Craven meeting. But for fans of Windsor racecourse – and I very much count myself as one of those – the season starts with an afternoon meeting ahead of the much-loved Monday evening cards, which begin next week with a meeting for which entry is free if you register in advance. If there is a better way to arrive at a racecourse than the boat that chugs down the Thames from Windsor &amp; Eton Riverside, I’ve yet to discover it, and while some moan about the prize money and the standard of racing, it’s possible to turn up for an evening meeting in late April and see a dual Group One winner and a Royal Ascot winner make their racecourse debuts within two hours of each other. I know, because I was there back in 1992 when both Lyric Fantasy (Queen Mary &amp; Nunthorpe) and Niche (the Norfolk Stakes winner two months later) kicked off their racecourse careers. Anyway, Monday’s meeting has survived an inspection but will take place on heavy ground. There are, however, a few heavy-ground specialists on the card who deserve close consideration, including Mobsta (4.20), who found trouble in running after being the subject of a gamble on his seasonal debut up at Doncaster. Off the same mark today and with Silvestre de Sousa booked to ride, he will take plenty of beating. Bombero (3.50) also goes well on deep ground and would stand every chance if he can return to the form of his six-length win off an 8lb lower mark on heavy going at Nottingham last year, and Bakht A Rawan (5.25), who has gone well after a break in the past, also looks solid in the last."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/16/west-ham-united-v-stoke-city-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T21:08:32Z","webTitle":"West Ham United 1-1 Stoke City: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/16/west-ham-united-v-stoke-city-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/16/west-ham-united-v-stoke-city-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"West Ham United 1-1 Stoke City: Premier League – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s all from me. It’s been incredibly boring, and then extremely exciting. Here’s Daniel Taylor’s match report. Bye! Peter Crouch and Andy Carroll speak to Sky. Before the microphones are turned on, Crouch tells Carroll that he had “killed us”. This is what he then told the world: It would have been a vital win for us, a massive win. Three points would give us a lifeline. A point’s a massive result, but three would have done us the world of good. It’s a shame, we defended so well during the game. But it’s a great goal from Andy. It did kill us a bit. It’s a kick in the teeth. Since the manager’s come in we’ve shown a lot of fight, but we’ve been a little bit unlucky in places. We’ve got Burnley, Palace, Swansea and Liverpool. I think there’s winnable games in there. If we can win three, who knows what will happen? Statistical and analytical updates for you: The second half was a lot of fun. The first half, well, let’s not speak of that. Joe Hart is bleeding from the nose, which makes a change from haemorrhaging goals, I suppose. 90+6 mins: It’s over, and neither side has the three points they desperately desired. 90+5 mins: Stoke break, Ireland chips the ball into the area and Zouma, with Cresswell at his shoulder, crumples to the ground. The referee blows his whistle! For offside! 90+4 mins: Into the last of four added minutes. Can anyone strike the killer blow? 90+3 mins: This time Shaqiri’s delivery is poor, the ball loops well past the far post, and Crouch’s header back in is caught by Hart. 90+3 mins: It’s a fine cross from Shaqiri, but it’s met by a West Ham head, and Stoke have their first corner at last. 90+2 mins: Cresswell fouls Shaqiri, is booked, and Stoke have a free kick from the right wing, their first chance to threaten the West Ham goal since they actually put the ball into it. 90+2 mins: Another disallowed goal! This time Hernandez fires in, but Carroll had used his arm in setting up the chance. 90+1 mins: The ball is crossed in from the left, and lands a foot inside the penalty area. Martins Indi makes a poor attempt to stop it, and Carroll caresses a volley back across goal and just inside the post! That is a super goal from Carroll! Lovely! 90 mins: Now Crouch is playing at left-back, and booting the ball clear. 88 mins: The first thing Carroll does is go down inside the area after a tussle with Martins Indi. The referee isn’t impressed, though the defender seemed to be holding Carroll back quite obviously, for quite a long time. 86 mins: And Stoke take off Diouf, who strolls slowly over from the far side of the pitch. Ireland will replace him, if and when he leaves the pitch. 86 mins: David Moyes throws on another striker, bringing Carroll on for Joao Mario. 85 mins: Stoke are defending deep and desperate, but the ball falls to Shaqiri, who flicks it over his head, draws a foul from Kouyate, and then uses up some precious time with some agonised rolling around. 84 mins: Joao Mario tries a speculative 30-yarder, which flies well high. 83 mins: Questions will be asked of Joe Hart’s goalkeeping after that goal – and Gareth Southgate was in the stands to see it. 82 mins: Lanzini, just on as a substitute in place of Masuaku, takes the free-kick, and hits the wall. 81 mins: Hernandez tries to make something for West Ham, so Martins Indi brings him down. Another shooting chance for West Ham, and a yellow card for the Stoke man. 79 mins: Pieters passes the ball into the area, where Diouf spins on it and passes to Allen, who lays back to Shaqiri. It was perfectly weighted for a first-time, right-foot shot but of course Shaqiri doesn’t do those, so instead he takes a touch, sets himself on his left but also gives West Ham a chance to close him down. The chance seems to have gone, but his shot from 18 yards somehow evades the defenders and flies low to Hart, who can’t hold it and Crouch taps in the rebound! Stoke have only gone and scored! 76 mins: West Ham make a change, bringing Fernandes off and Hernandez on. 75 mins: Since he came on, Cameron has definitely kicked opponents more frequently than he’s kicked the ball. He gives away another free kick, but this one’s on the half-way line. 74 mins: Cresswell crosses this one, which is a mistake. The ball goes out for a goal kick. 72 mins: Joao Mario is tripped by Cameron, and West Ham can have another shot from the set piece. 72 mins: This one’s no better. To be fair, with Zouma, Shawcross and Martins Indi in the defence headers are the one thing that Stoke can win. 71 mins: West Ham win a seventh corner. They haven’t so much as won a header from the first six, but eventually one’s going to pay off. 70 mins: Stoke trigger Plan B: Bauer has come off, and Peter Crouch is on. 69 mins: Now West Ham win a free kick, and Cresswell’s shot is well saved by the increasingly busy Butland! 67 mins: The ball zipped towards goal through Arnautovic’s legs, and though he didn’t touch it, he must have completely blocked Butland’s view. 66 mins: Another disallowed goal! This time Fernandes rifles the ball in from just outside the area, but the linesman thinks somebody is interfering with play! 65 mins: West Ham are having a period of supremacy, and the crowd for the first time seems involved, entertained and also awake. 63 mins: West Ham break, but Arnautovic is excellently challenged by Martins Indi. Moments later Cresswell’s decent cross from the left is booted clear by Shawcross. West Ham have their sixth corner (Stoke haven’t had any). 61 mins: Cameron is now on, and Sobhi has come off. 60 mins: Joao Mario scuffs a shot from the edge of the area. This game has improved so much since half-time that some people would probably now deem it interesting. 59 mins: Cometh the hour, cometh Geoff Cameron, who is currently being readied by Stoke. 57 mins: More on this evening’s Bundesliga VAR madness: 56 mins: And Stoke miss a great chance! Bauer rampages down the right, bursts into the box, pulls back to Diouf and, with the ball just behind him, the striker scoops over the bar! 55 mins: Disallowed goal! Cresswell crosses from the left and it’s a brilliant ball, curling and dipping onto the head of Arnautovic, who nods in from six yards … but he was just offside! 54 mins: Stoke keep the ball for a bit, until Zouma tries to pass it to Pieters and hits into touch instead. Still, the visitors have had the best of the second half so far. 50 mins: At the other end, Zabaleta’s cross loops just over the head of Fernandes, six yards out, and Zouma thumps it behind. 49 mins: Pieters picks out Shaqiri in the penalty area, who controls, spins and then, with Bauer to his right, falls over. 47 mins: Sobhi is played into space on the left. He checks back. He performs a couple of lollipops. He checks onto his left foot, doubles back onto his right, and then scoops a hopeless cross into the arms of Joe Hart. 46 mins: Peeeeeeep! The game is back on, with both sides unchanged at the interval. The players are back out, and after 10 minutes spent thumping my head repeatedly against my desk I am feeling refreshed and ready for another 45 minutes of fun. Meanwhile in Germany: 45+1 mins: Noble’s 25-yard shot zips into the arms of Butland, and that’s the end of the first half. 45+1 mins: There will be one additional minute of Ryan-Shawcross-tied-his-shoelaces-a-while-ago time. 44 mins: Jack Pitt-Brooke (23 mins) was woefully misguided. This game is getting progressively worse. 41 mins: Chance for Stoke! Shaqiri’s pass finds Sobhi running into the area from the left. He controls well, spins well, and then totally miskicks his shot with his left foot, sending the ball rolling miserably towards Hart. 40 mins: Cagey? Cagey? I can think of a different, and slightly briefer, adjective beginning with C that would be a bit more accurate. 37 mins: West Ham are starting to genuinely dominate. Kouyaté is played in on the right, and his low cross is cleared by Martins Indi. Behind him, Arnautovic and Zouma run into each other, and the defender goes down, but the referee thinks it’s accidental. 35 mins: A fine chance for Arnautovic! Zabaleta is played in on the right, nods the ball back to Arnautovic, and he hammers the ball goalwards from a tight angle, and right into Butland’s shoulder. Corner. 33 mins: A shot! A proper shot on target! Sobhi flicks the ball around the corner to Diouf, who hammers it low and hard towards goal from the edge of the area, but it’s too close to Hart. 32 mins: Joao Mario plays in Arnautovic, who drags his shot wide from 12 yards (and a bit to the right of goal). 30 mins: Turns out Ryan Shawcross was the man being booed, because he was doing up his shoelaces. 29 mins: The crowd is booing lustily. I’m not sure why, because Sky are showing me Peter Crouch and Andy Carroll having a chat on the touchline. 28 mins: Arnautovic’s fine dummy allows the ball to run through to Joao Mario, and then there’s a moment’s hesitation as both Pieters and Martins Indi leave the ball to each other, thereby almost allowing Arnautovic to reach the pass. But then the latter sticks out a foot and boots clear. 26 mins: I thought I might try to simultaneously liveblog the match and Karren Brady’s new TV show, just to help out any conflicted Hammer (and also to make life a little more interesting), but just as I turned on ITV the first episode of Give It a Year ended. Sorry. 25 mins: Sobhi is fouled, but Shaqiri’s free-kick into the box is poor, West Ham break and Arnautovic has an opportunity to make them pay, but is dispossessed as he tries to work a shooting chance. 23 mins: I’m with Jack here. The only way is up. Baby. 19 mins: I’d like to see them use “SAVE!” here, instead of “STOP!”. “STOP!” makes you feel you’ve just been caught stealing apples from your grumpy old neighbour’s garden. All I’ve done is try to read a tweet. Leave me alone. 17 mins: Cresswell takes an optimistic shot, which bounces just in front of Butland and is palmed behind. The corner is eventually booted clear. 16 mins: Arnautovic tries a first-time pass to Fernandes and gets a nudge in the back from Martins Indi as he does so. The pass doesn’t amount to much, so Michael Oliver blows his whistle, and West Ham have a free kick, about 40 yards out. 14 mins: Here’s one person who presumably isn’t watching the match tonight: 12 mins: Shaqiri, who seems a bit sulky, trips Ogbonna and gives away a free kick. But moments later he slides a pass to Bauer, whose shot is decent, but saved. 9 mins: “Here at Stoke I can not exert too much influence, simply because there is a lack of quality around me,” Xerdan Shaqiri said a couple of weeks back, moaning that “even a Ronaldinho could do little in this team”. So far he’s fallen over in a desperate attempt to win a free kick, and given the ball away twice on the right flank. 6 mins: Arnautovic runs onto Noble’s long pass and from precisely the same spot from which Masuaku shot a couple of minutes ago, he tries to pull the ball back. It deflects off a defender, though, so Butland still has to make a save. West Ham win a corner, from which nothing much happens. 4 mins: And another save! Stoke zip down the other end, where Sobhi’s 20-yarder is easily claimed by Hart. 3 mins: Save! West Ham are first to find their shooting boots, as a right-wing cross flicks off a head in the centre and goes to Masuaku, who seems to have taken the ball down the nearest blind alley but still manages to shoot low from a tight angle, and Butland saves with his feet. 1 min: Peeeeep! Stoke get the game started! A quick song about bubbles and we’ll be on our way … They players have left the tunnel! The players are in the tunnel! We’re about to get some football to watch/read about! In many ways Stoke’s whole season has been an overlong trudge towards disaster, but there’s an opportunity to change the narrative. Rationally, the window of opportunity closes in a couple of hours. After that, it can either be a death march, or a survival skip. Or a brief and cruelly optimism-inducing skip, and then back to the death march. This isn’t encouraging: David Moyes speaks! If you’d given me this position when I took over I’d have said thanks very much. We can take a big step tonight if we win, we know that. They’ve got match winners as well, so we have to be careful and mindful of them. And so does Paul Lambert! Well Zouma comes in for Johnson. It’s the same formation, because I think we’re playing well without getting the results. It’s the same formation, the same lads apart from Glen. I’m 100% confident [of avoiding relegation]. I don’t have any stress. I know the job in hand but I’ve got a group of lads that are giving me everything, and at the end of the day that’s all I can ever ask for. I’m not detecting a great amount of enthusiasm for this fixture. Head-to-head update: West Ham’s last three home matches against Stoke have all ended in draws, and in the decade since Stoke’s promotion to the top flight they have won at the Hammers twice, lost twice, and drawn the rest. So 21 of the 22 starting players also started their team’s last game – the odd one out is Kurt Zouma, who replaces Glen Johnson for Stoke. On West Ham’s bench, though, are Andy Carroll, who last played on 4 January, and Manuel Lanzini, who has been out for over a month. The team sheets are in, and these are the names upon them: West Ham: Hart, Rice, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Zabaleta, Noble, Kouyaté, Masuaku, Fernandes, Joao Mario, Arnautovic. Subs: Carroll, Lanzini, Hugill, Adrian, Hernandez, Evra, Cullen. Stoke: Butland, Shawcross, Zouma, Martins Indi, Bauer, Ndiaye, Allen, Pieters, Shaqiri, Sobhi, Diouf. Subs: Ireland, Cameron, Fletcher, Crouch, Grant, Campbell, Sorenson. Referee: Michael Oliver. So the title is decided, the top four have a healthy cushion over Chelsea in fifth, and Antonio Conte’s side are themselves six points ahead of Arsenal in sixth. Seventh-placed Burnley are nine points clear of Leicester in eighth. As far as important top-half business goes, the Premier League season is over. Thus it is in everyone’s interest, except those teams actually involved in it, to keep the relegation scrap going until the bitter end. This game is important for both sides, but the world wants, needs and deserves more important games, an entire month of them. A home win tonight would drag West Ham to 37 points and 12th place, and take them to the very edge of certain safety. Great for them, of course – particularly with four testy fixtures to come before the season-ending visit of Everton – but not for anyone else. The neutral must want as many teams as possible to go into the final day at risk of disaster, and in particular for the one fixture that day that pits two struggling-but-not-yet-completely-doomed sides against each other – Swansea v Stoke – to be a win-or-bust spectacular. A win tonight will take Stoke within an achievable four points of their opponents and within three of the Swans, and the fight will be on. Sadly Stoke’s away record is the worst in the division – there has been just one win, back in October, and a total haul of a meagre eight points. There has been just one win of any sort, in any competition, in a dismal run since Christmas. Their goal difference is the worst in the division, by a distance. They have been, in short, rubbish. And yet there is hope, though Paul Lambert is aware that now is crunch time: I’ve never thought about relegation. I’ve just thought about staying in the league and that is still my aim. This club was built on sheer graft and hard work with a sprinkling of gold dust at the top end and we have to get that back and give the fans what was happening here before. We have to come away [from West Ham] with something without a doubt. The intent is to go and win and we will do everything we can to get three points. If we get a win it drags a few back in and that’s the most important thing. David Moyes, meanwhile, appears to have been at the drinks cupboard again: The ideal situation is to go unbeaten between now and the end of the season, there is no reason why we can’t do that. [There are 32 reasons why they can’t do that here] Oh, and by way of added spice there’s also this bloke, who scored one and hit the bar twice in a 3-0 victory on his return to the Bet365 Stadium in December: Remaining fixtures: West Ham: Arsenal (away); Manchester City (home); Leicester (away); Manchester United (home); Everton (home). Stoke: Burnley (home); Liverpool (away); Crystal Palace (home); Swansea City (away)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/16/labor-states-urged-to-reject-woefully-inadequate-emissions-reduction-target","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T18:00:17Z","webTitle":"Labor states urged to reject 'woefully inadequate' emissions reduction target","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/16/labor-states-urged-to-reject-woefully-inadequate-emissions-reduction-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/16/labor-states-urged-to-reject-woefully-inadequate-emissions-reduction-target","fields":{"headline":"Labor states urged to reject 'woefully inadequate' emissions reduction target","bodyText":"A key environment group is urging the Labor states not to rubber stamp the Turnbull government’s national energy guarantee at Friday’s meeting of energy ministers. The Australian Conservation Foundation has warned that a low emissions reduction target for electricity would put at risk the states’ own energy plans and any chance of effective climate change action. It says the the national emissions reduction target, confirmed in a new commonwealth paper, of a 26% cut on 2005 levels by 2030 is “woefully inadequate”. “Many state governments have made strong commitments to make deeper pollution cuts and embrace clean energy,” said Suzanne Harter, from the ACF’s climate change and clean energy campaign. “They should not wave through a Neg that jeopardises fulfilling these commitments to the communities they represent. “At Friday’s meeting state governments must insist on a national climate change plan for electricity that, unlike the Neg, will facilitate a rapid rollout of clean energy that makes deep cuts to planet warming pollution.” Key stakeholders, including state and territory governments, are absorbing new technical details circulated by the Energy Security Board and the Turnbull government before Friday’s meeting of energy ministers. Behind the scenes, a group of business and energy market stakeholders eager to settle Australia’s decade-long climate wars is trying to draft a joint statement in support of the policy. They hope to persuade the states and territories to agree to keep the proposal moving through the Coag energy council. The Energy Security Board has provided all jurisdictions with a 54-page document outlining the technical design of the new scheme and the mechanisms that will be deployed under the Neg – a policy that would impose a reliability obligation and an emissions reduction requirement on energy retailers and a small number of large electricity users from 2020. The Energy Security Board paper addresses a range of concerns expressed to it about the potential for the Neg to increase market concentration in the electricity sector. The commonwealth has also circulated a second 11-page paper dealing with the emissions reduction framework, the treatment of emissions intensive trade exposed activities and the potential use of offsets. The second paper proposes the emissions reduction target for electricity be set for 10 years, then updated with five years’ notice to create policy certainty for investors. It also makes it clear that more ambitious emissions reduction activities undertaken by state and territory governments through their renewable energy schemes will not ultimately boost the federal target – a development which could put several jurisdictions offside. The coming week is critical for the fate of the policy because any single jurisdiction has the power to break the concept. Changes to the national electricity market rules require consensus between the commonwealth and the states. While the federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, is confident he can get his colleagues over the line, some Labor state and territory governments are yet to signal public support. Victoria’s energy, environment and climate change minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said in a statement to Guardian Australia the energy ministers can only make the Neg work “if we are presented with a sound policy proposal backed by evidence and consultation”. “We want a genuine commitment from the Turnbull government for bipartisanship in lowering emissions, growing renewables and market reform,” she said. “There are thousands of Victorians jobs and billions of dollars of investment riding on this – and we will not compromise on that”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/22/lifting-the-lid-bright-eyeliners-strong-colours-makeup","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T05:00:14Z","webTitle":"Lifting the lid: eyeliners are brightening up | Eva Wiseman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/22/lifting-the-lid-bright-eyeliners-strong-colours-makeup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/22/lifting-the-lid-bright-eyeliners-strong-colours-makeup","fields":{"headline":"Lifting the lid: eyeliners are brightening up","bodyText":"At Missoni, graphic swooshes of colour above the eyes were mixed in shades of the rainbow; big blocks visible from the other side of the room.

Following on from two of jump racing’s all-time greats was always going to be a difficult role to execute, but Cue Card did so with a flourish. He was, by some way, the most popular chaser of recent seasons, as well as being one of the most talented and durable, and the only disappointment following the news of his well-earned retirement was that Colin Tizzard’s 12-year-old would not get a chance to remove the concluding “P” (for pulled-up) from his form figures after his disappointing run in the Gold Cup at Cheltenham last month. Cue Card will still be at Sandown on Saturday week on the final day of the jumps season, when he will parade rather than line up one last time in the Oaksey Chase. “He wasn’t working quite as well as he can and we didn’t want to take him to Sandown if we weren’t 100% happy with him,” Joe Tizzard, the trainer’s son and also Cue Card’s jockey during the first four years of his career, said on Tuesday. “We will still take him to Sandown, to celebrate a great career. He has been an incredible horse for us and now he can look forward to a new chapter in his life.” Cue Card retires with nine Grade One wins on his record, stretching from his Bumper win at Cheltenham at odds of 40-1 to the Betfair Ascot Chase in February 2017. But it was not so much his record as the way he went about compiling it that endeared him so thoroughly to racing fans. Cue Card loved to bowl along towards the head of the field, where his usually impeccable jumping would force his opponents to match him, or risk giving up ground that could prove essential in the closing stages. Cue Card had the bounce-back factor too, after a fallow period for much of 2014 and 2015 that followed a pelvic injury and then a wind operation. And at a time when National Hunt racing was increasingly becoming dominated by multimillionaires with many dozens of horses, Jean Bishop and her late husband Bob, who died just days after Cue Card’s memorable defeat of Vautour in the 2015 King George VI Chase at Kempton, were a throwback to a time when winning was not everything. Cue Card’s first win in the Betfair Chase at Haydock, in 2013, summed up his appeal. He was sent off at 9-1 to beat an outstanding field that included previous Grade One chase winners in Silviniaco Conti, Long Run and Bobs Worth, but Tizzard and Cue Card were undaunted and took the race to their rivals in familiar style. Cue Card had the race won two out, and stayed on strongly to win in thrilling fashion by nearly five lengths. Cue Card’s last win came in that Ascot Chase, though a close second place in the same race this year offered hope that he might yet claim a Gold Cup at Cheltenham. It was not to be and he was pulled up before the 12th, but Cue Card may still receive a warmer reception than some of the winners at Sandown next week. “I think his longevity made him stand out,” Bishop said. “Even after his fall [in 2016], he went back to win at Aintree. For a few seasons he was the highest-rated chaser in Britain. Look how hard it is for Gold Cup winners to come back the following season. He might not have won the Gold Cup but he kept coming back.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/political-science/2018/apr/18/smart-cities-need-thick-data-not-big-data","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T16:00:28Z","webTitle":"Smart cities need thick data, not big data","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2018/apr/18/smart-cities-need-thick-data-not-big-data","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2018/apr/18/smart-cities-need-thick-data-not-big-data","fields":{"headline":"Smart cities need thick data, not big data","bodyText":"Residents living around Plaça del Sol joke that theirs is the only square where, despite the name, rain is preferable. Rain means fewer people gather to socialise and drink, reducing noise for the flats overlooking the square. Residents know this with considerable precision because they’ve developed a digital platform for measuring noise levels and mobilising action. I was told the joke by Remei, one of the residents who, with her ‘citizen scientist’ neighbours, are challenging assumptions about Big Data and the Smart City. The Smart City and data sovereignty The Smart City is an alluring prospect for many city leaders. Even if you haven’t heard of it, you may have already joined in by looking up bus movements on your phone, accessing Council services online or learning about air contamination levels. By inserting sensors across city infrastructures and creating new data sources - including citizens via their mobile devices – Smart City managers can apply Big Data analysis to monitor and anticipate urban phenomena in new ways, and, so the argument goes, efficiently manage urban activity for the benefit of ‘smart citizens’. Barcelona has been a pioneering Smart City. The Council’s business partners have been installing sensors and opening data platforms for years. Not everyone is comfortable with this technocratic turn. After Ada Colau was elected Mayor on a mandate of democratising the city and putting citizens centre-stage, digital policy has sought to go ‘beyond the Smart City’. Chief Technology Officer Francesca Bria is opening digital platforms to greater citizen participation and oversight. Worried that the city’s knowledge was being ceded to tech vendors, the Council now promotes technological sovereignty. On the surface, the noise project in Plaça del Sol is an example of such sovereignty. It even features in Council presentations. Look more deeply, however, and it becomes apparent that neighbourhood activists are really appropriating new technologies into the old-fashioned politics of community development. Community developments Plaça de Sol has always been a meeting place. But as the neighbourhood of Gràcia has changed, so the intensity and character of socialising in the square has altered. More bars, restaurants, hotels, tourists and youngsters have arrived, and Plaça del Sol’s long-standing position as venue for large, noisy groups drinking late into the night has become more entrenched. For years, resident complaints to the Council fell on deaf ears. For the Council, Gràcia signified an open, welcoming city and leisure economy. Residents I spoke with were proud of their vibrant neighbourhood. But they recalled a more convivial square, with kids playing games and families and friends socialising. Visitors attracted by Gràcia’s atmosphere also contributed to it, but residents in Plaça del Sol felt this had become a nuisance. It is a story familiar to many cities. Much urban politics turns on the negotiation of convivial uses of space. What made Plaça del Sol stand out can be traced to a group of technology activists who got in touch with residents early in 2017. The activists were seeking participants in their project called Making Sense, which sought to resurrect a struggling ‘Smart Citizen Kit’ for environmental monitoring. The idea was to provide residents with the tools to measure noise levels, compare them with officially permissible levels, and reduce noise in the square. More than 40 neighbours signed up and installed 25 sensors on balconies and inside apartments. The neighbours had what project coordinator Mara Balestrini from Ideas for Change calls ‘a matter of concern’. The earlier Smart Citizen Kit had begun as a technological solution looking for a problem: a crowd-funded gadget for measuring pollution, whose data users could upload to a web-platform for comparison with information from other users. Early adopters found the technology trickier to install than developers had presumed. Even successful users stopped monitoring because there was little community purpose. A new approach was needed. Noise in Plaça del Sol provided a problem for this technology fix. Through meetings and workshops residents learnt about noise monitoring, and, importantly, activists learnt how to make technology matter for residents. The noise data they generated, unsurprisingly, exceeded norms recommended by both the World Health Organisation and municipal guidelines. Residents were codifying something already known: their square is very noisy. However, in rendering their experience into data, these citizen scientists could also compare their experience with official noise levels, refer to scientific studies about health impacts, and correlate levels to different activities in the square during the day and night. The project decided to compare their square with other places in the city. At this point, they discovered the Council’s Sentilo Smart City platform already included a noise monitor in their square. Officials had been monitoring noise but not publicising the open data. Presented with citizen data, officials initially challenged the competence of resident monitoring, even though official data confirmed a noise problem. But as Rosa, one of the residents, said to me, “This is my data. They cannot deny it”. Thick data Residents were learning that data is rarely neutral. The kinds of data gathered, the methods used, how it gets interpreted, what gets overlooked, the context in which it is generated, and by whom, and what to do as a result, are all choices that shape the facts of a matter. For experts building Big Data city platforms, one sensor in one square is simply a data point. On the other side of that point, however, are residents connecting that data to life in all its richness in their square. Anthropologist Clifford Geertz argued many years ago that situations can only be made meaningful through ‘thick description’. Applied to the Smart City, this means data cannot really be explained and used without understanding the contexts in which it arises and gets used. Data can only mobilise people and change things when it becomes thick with social meaning. Noise data in Plaça del Sol was becoming thick with social meaning. Collective data gathering proved more potent than decibel levels alone: it was simultaneously mobilising people into changing the situation. Noise was no longer an individual problem, but a collective issue. And it was no longer just noise. The data project arose through face-to-face meetings in a physical workshop space. Importantly, this meant that neighbours got to know one another better, and had reasons for discussing life in the square when they bumped into one another. Attention turned to solutions. A citizen assembly convened in the square one weekend publicised the campaign and discuss ideas with passers-by. Some people wanted the local police to impose fines on noisy drinkers, whereas others were wary of heavy-handed approaches. Some suggested installing a children’s playground. Architects helped locals examine material changes that could dampen sound. The Council response has been cautious. New flowerbeds along one side of the square remove steps where groups used to sit and drink. Banners and community police officers remind people to respect the neighbourhood. The Council recently announced plans for a movable playground (whose occupation of the centre of the square can be removed for events, like the Festa Major de Gràcia). Residents will be able to monitor how these interventions change noise in the square. Their demands confront an established leisure economy. As local councillor Robert Soro explained to me, convivial uses have also to address the interests of bar owners, public space managers, tourism, commerce, and others. Beyond economic issues are questions of rights to public space, young peoples’ needs to socialise, neighbouring squares worried about displaced activity, the Council’s vision for Gràcia, and of course, the residents suffering the noise. The politics beneath Smart City platforms For the Council, technology activists, and residents of Plaça del Sol, data alone cannot solve their issues. Data cannot transcend the lively and contradictory social worlds that it measures. If data is to act then it needs ultimately to be brought back into those generative social contexts - which, as Jordi Giró at the Catalan Confederation of Neighbourhood Associations reminds us, means cultivating people skills and political capacity. Going beyond the Smart City demands something its technocratic efficiency is supposed to make redundant: investment in old-fashioned, street-level skills in community development. Technology vendors cannot sell such skills. They are cultivated through the kinds of community activism that first brought Ada Colau to prominence, and eventually into office.

This is not your mum’s godson Rupert, who spent his gap yah in Nepal ‘finding himself’ – and several STIs. The Observer Magazine travelled to India in August 1971 to chart the rise of the hippy trail, which had grown from a few inquisitive stragglers to a fully fledged community of 5,000 largely bearded members. ‘India is a country of exotic sights. But perhaps most exotic of all, nowadays, are the groups of... white youths in pantaloons and vests, walking through the most prosperous parts of Delhi, Calcutta or Bombay.’ Really, nothing’s changed, has it? However, in 1971, people like Audrey were still rather rare. After passing her A Levels in her native Blackpool, she decided not to take up a place at the London School of Economics and instead sailed for the subcontinent with £25 in her pocket. When her money ran out she began to walk, covering 12 to 15 miles a day. As she did not know the local language she communicated by gesture, mostly signalling for cigarettes and Coca-Cola. Where did penniless Audrey sleep? ‘At present, under the Gateway of India, Bombay - flanked by two male hippies - for warmth, not sex.’ Ah, of course, that old chestnut. Audrey, our reporter notes, is rather exceptional as hippies go – mostly because she was able to string a sentence together. Her peers were mostly engulfed in a weed-induced stupor, making them ‘listless and apathetic’. What do these long-haired wastrels do all day? ‘The hippies in Goa sleep, cook, talk (mainly about who sent hash), listen to music, read, swim, make love, roam around and visit friends. The climax of the day is the communal smoking of marijuana, a ritual which starts in the evening and goes on late at night, so that most of the colony members get up late in the day.’ Brb, moving to Goa with immediate effect."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"travel/2018/apr/24/five-best-fly-fishing-spots-rivers-in-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T05:30:11Z","webTitle":"5 of the best fly-fishing spots in the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/apr/24/five-best-fly-fishing-spots-rivers-in-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/apr/24/five-best-fly-fishing-spots-rivers-in-uk","fields":{"headline":"5 of the best fly-fishing spots in the UK","bodyText":"Assynt, Sutherland Under the shadow of massive mountains like Suilven and Quinag, it’s an awe-inspiring experience to discover waters like Fionn Loch, which is home to arctic char as well as native brown trout.

Gates told the heads of Commonwealth states that innovation was needed to tackle the resurgence of the disease. “If there is one lesson we have learned … it’s that we have to keep innovating to control malaria, because conditions evolve,” he told the meeting in London, where a total of £2.7bn was pledged in a drive to halve the number of malaria cases across the Commonwealth. “The mosquito and the parasite develop resistance to the interventions we use to fight them. People move around and constantly change the patterns of transmission.” He added: “We need surveillance with much more geographical detail, we need it in real time, and we need it to capture more information.” Gates, chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation – which announced it will extend its investments in malaria by an additional £700m through to 2023 – said advances in satellite imaging would help track the patches and spikes in malaria. The newest frontier of surveillance is genetic sequencing of geolocated mosquito and parasite samples. These processes will be able to tell scientists whether cases in a given area are the result of residual transmission or imported from elsewhere. Gates said: “It will serve as an early warning system about strains that are developing resistance to our tools.” For the first time in 10 years, malaria cases are no longer falling. Not only has progress stalled but in some countries the trend has reversed. Six out of 10 malaria cases globally occur in Commonwealth countries. The leaders of those nations are being urged to make a historic commitment to halve the number of malaria cases by 2023 – a goal that, if successful, would prevent 350 million cases and save 650,000 lives. The heads of 16 out of 53 Commonwealth countries attended Wednesday’s summit, hosted by the governments of Rwanda, Swaziland and the UK. Rwanda is one of the countries experiencing a rise in malaria cases. Pedro Alonso, director of the World Health Organization global malaria programme, warned that the fight against the disease is at a crossroads. “History has taught us well that when we lift our foot from the accelerator malaria comes back with a vengeance. We must take a decisive leap forward or we risk going backwards and we have seen that already happening in a number of countries,” he told the Guardian. Last year, a report by the WHO found that Rwanda and Nigeria saw more than 1 million new cases of malaria between 2015 and 2016. Twenty-four countries had an increase of more than 50,500 cases in 2016. Just five of the 29 high-burden countries, including Gambia and Madagascar, saw a significant decrease in malaria cases. “We are stalling and unless we do something urgently we are going to see this trend continue in the coming years,” said Alonso. The summit will call for greater investment in new ways to combat the disease as the existing methods – nets, sprays and treatments – come under threat from drug and insecticide resistance. Pharma company GSK has pledged £175m in research and development on top of existing funding that includes work to implement the world’s first malaria vaccine, due to be piloted in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi later this year. It is anticipated the company’s new interventions – delivered on a not-for-profit basis – will reach more than 3 million people worldwide. Meanwhile the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria announced $2bn of funding from 46 countries affected by malaria between 2018 and 2020. The UK has already pledged £500m a year to tackling the disease until 2020-2021. Of that £100m will be used to fund-match contributions from private donors through the Global Fund. The prime minister, Theresa May, said: “We will support and incentivise others to invest in what is needed, from cutting edge research to ensuring access to malaria treatment and prevention for those most at risk.” Global funding for malaria has plateaued since 2010 and is disproportionately provided by donor countries rather than those with malaria risk. The cost of malaria to African economies is estimated at $12bn (£8bn) a year in direct costs. It consumes 25% of household income in high-burden areas due to lost productivity and healthcare-related expenses. The Ghanian president, Nana Akufo-Addo, said: “We are on a cliff edge. Either we step back and save millions more lives or we fall and see a deadly resurgence that could take half a century to recover from. “This is not a plea for more aid money from western donors. I have publicly committed myself to African leaders finding African solutions to African problems. It is right we take responsibility for our own destiny.” He assured: “Where greater domestic funding is needed we will find the money.” Joy Phumaphi, executive secretary of the African Leaders Malaria Alliance, said the reasons for a resurgence in some countries varied. “The east African countries have had a distinct challenge because of the El Niño phenomenon – they have had flooding every year now for several years. There has also been an increase across all countries in temperature attributed to climate change.” These conditions have led to an increase in mosquito populations, she said. “In Rwanda, they have massively increased their rice production, and rice paddy fields provide ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes.” James Whiting, executive director at Malaria No More UK, said it would be a huge step forward if Commonwealth countries, where about half of all global malaria cases are found, were to meet the 2023 target. “Our hope is that this is the beginning of a tidal wave across the world of reigniting the malaria campaign.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2018/apr/22/amy-schumer-interview-film-i-feel-pretty-marriage-love-stand-up","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"Amy Schumer: ‘I’m not invincible.

I need to slow down’","bodyText":"When I meet Amy Schumer, she has been married for exactly one month and is working on a joke about her husband’s penis. Something along the lines of, my husband is uncircumcised – for now. She had jotted it down on the Notes app on her iPhone, where she keeps a lot of ideas, but it duplicated the note five times “so now it looks like I really have plans to mutilate him,” she says. She then admits that she actually first used that line about another man she used to date, “but you have to update it so it’s about the person you’re with now. And really, my husband is good, he can keep everything he has. At this point in my life, I’m cool with foreskin or not – God bless everyone and their penii,” she says, breezily, as if she might have exhausted herself by creating a persona who is supposed to care so much. Amy Schumer is a conundrum. A native New Yorker, she made her incredibly successful name doing stand-up comedy about raw, rude sex and all of its discontents, about dating and dirtiness and blacking out drunk and doing the walk of shame home. Her TV sketch show, Inside Amy Schumer, ran for four series on Comedy Central and often mercilessly skewered the gender hypocrisy of what our culture allows men and women to do, in particular the beauty myths that silently surround women, in sketches such as “Girl You Don’t Need Makeup” and “Her Last Fuckable Day”. At the Glamour awards in London in 2015, after various female celebrities had tottered up to the stage to receive awards in heels they could barely walk in and dresses they could barely breathe in, Schumer strode on. “I’m probably 160lb right now,” she said, looking out over the audience with disdain, “and I can catch a dick whenever I want. That’s the truth.” I was there; she changed the mood of the room from faux modesty to explosive, spluttering laughter, and all the disdained women ran up to her afterwards, desperate to be her friend. It felt like a tipping point in that industry; famous women have been letting their guard down ever since. Yet a couple of months later, her debut movie Trainwreck came out, which she wrote and starred in. It began promisingly and originally, but ended with her character giving up her competitive career and literally becoming a cheerleader – an actual cheerleader – for her clever, high-achieving man. The next year Schumer published her autobiography, The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo, in which, alongside stories of a childhood going from riches to rags on Long Island with her dad’s dodgy business skills and then illness, and both her parents’ philandering, she wrote that, actually, she had only ever had a one-night stand once, and it was lovely and respectful, thank you very much. Now she has made I Feel Pretty, a film about a woman who gets a bash on the head and wrongly believes herself to have become as beautiful as a supermodel, and so creates a whole new life for her sexy self. The film asks if beauty is a state of mind – while also involving Schumeresque motifs such as a vaginal injury on an exercise bike. Meanwhile, Schumer has surprised the gossip papers by suddenly getting married, to a chef called Chris Fischer, in a lacy white wedding dress on a clifftop in Malibu. For celebrities, this is as traditional as your father walking you down the aisle in your village church. Coverage of the wedding made it all sound rather giddy and impulsive, but when I ask her about it, she is anything but. “I feel exactly the same as before I was married – but I’m psyched. I love him,” she says, her face deadly serious, like she’s been through a thing or two in this life. “Like, I’m fucking – it feels like having a partner. It feels like not being alone.” We are sitting in a rather fancy hotel suite overlooking Central Park, where Schumer is promoting her new movie. Her bodyguard is in the next room, along with two assistants who have taken Schumer’s tiny black poodle Tatiana, who was barking too much for the interview. “He’s 38, I’m 36, so, you know, we are not completing each other. We already are who we are and just want to support and encourage each other. And so I’m psyched that I don’t have to be zipping up my knee boots, leaving someone’s apartment at 3am. I’m done.” She says this wasn’t like other relationships, “where you’re like, come on, pleeease meet my parents. I can’t believe I dealt with any of that bullshit before! This was like, oh my God I fucking love this person, and I admire him, and we’re a team and he was ready.” I ask her if it is hard, having created such a bold sexual persona, ever to find the space to feel shy, but she looks baffled by that question and says that she isn’t ever shy. In fact, she looks baffled by quite a few of my questions: interviews are clearly not her favourite thing. I want to discuss her work being about the concept of fuckability, but she says that that’s not accurate, and turns her nose up a bit. She says this film is about her character Renee simply wanting to be seen, and though there’s a boyfriend angle, “I don’t think of this movie as a love story. It’s about her and her friends.” She says the dressing-up is for other women, because she has learned, with age, that we don’t really dress for men. “In my experience, men are not that psyched and the guys that I’m attracted to aren’t the guys who are like, ‘Oh, is that the new Givenchy line?’ I think, her thing is about confidence and about feeling attractive.” Well, yes and no. I mean if it’s all about women, then her character entering a bikini competition and shaking her stuff all over the stage in a dive bar full of men does seem an interesting move. Yet the thing about the bikini scene is – it becomes lovely. You start watching it behind your hands, cringing – and by the end you’re charmed by the sight of someone just thoroughly, unabashedly enjoying herself. Schumer is glad I liked that scene, and says she fought for it. She was supposed to just stand there, “but I said no, I’m going to go nuts on stage, I’m going to dump water on myself, do the whole thing. And I seriously fought everybody and I’m so glad I did.” She also has a sex scene, and fought to be allowed to reveal more flesh but still have the film rated 13. “I think we should see more, you know, and I’m not letting them retouch any of me in the movie.” There is an idiosyncratic, pioneering power to Schumer’s comedy work that I keep looking for in her films. They veer towards slapstick whereas her solo material has brains and guts. I do not make myself popular by suggesting this, and Schumer bristles when I ask what sort of movies she would make if there was no financial compulsion for feelgood endings. “You know, I said no to a movie where I would have made five times this amount of money,” she says. Really? Someone else’s project? “Mmm,” she replies, mysteriously. “For me, it’s not so much about the money. Like, I wouldn’t want to spend three years of my life working on The Revenant. I filmed a drama two years ago and it was a bummer. I don’t want to show people what I can do – I just want to do stuff that will make people feel better.” Hot women, once the butt of her jokes, now get cast in her films. I Feel Pretty co-stars Emily Ratajkowski, who rose to fame dancing topless in the Blurred Lines music video, and also features a cameo from Naomi Campbell. “I did a lot of press yesterday sitting next to Emily and I think that probably would have been kind of hard for me 10 years ago,” she admits. They were wearing similar clothes, “and I would have made a joke about it before – but now it’s just – I just feel like that’s over. I kind of feel done with the self-ranking thing.” She says this comes from growing up and realising that she feels most beautiful when she’s away with her girls, or on a night out where she’s just “so happy, so comfortable, you know who you are. And then it’s like, well, why can’t we just feel like that all the time?” One of those girls is her best buddy Jennifer Lawrence. “I texted her yesterday and I was like, ‘I did an interview today and I told them you were really hideous up close.’ And she wrote, ‘Actual LOL’, and then she added in parenthesis ‘(Because I’m so pretty, you know?)’ And I was like, ‘Exactly.’” I ask about their shared sense of humour. “Well, Jen’s quick. She picks up on things that I just mutter to make myself laugh. I’ll just say something under my breath, and she’ll be like, ‘I heard that.’” Speaking of comic actors, Michelle Williams is an absolute revelation in I Feel Pretty. It’s perhaps the biggest shock of the film. “Me too,” says Schumer. “I didn’t know she was really funny. Like she’s really funny. Why didn’t we know? It’s because they always put her in some awful thing where she’s got to be on the floor, crying.” As for the #MeToo movement, Schumer wholly supports it but isn’t jumping up and down whooping about it “because, while it’s exciting, it’s also really triggering and upsetting. It makes everybody feel super vulnerable. But to think that this generation is going to say, ‘This isn’t acceptable,’ and not just bury the things that our mothers buried – that feels really good. It feels like, across the board, we’re getting closer to equality. Which is – it’s such a gut-wrenching thing to even have to say that.” She must have seen a few of her own male colleagues in comedy go down. “Right, there are people you love that can have really shitty behaviour that needs to be called out. And then there are so many men who are just scared, they’re just waiting for the phone to ring, they’re waiting to open their computer and see their faces and it’s a frightening time for them. But then we’re going, ‘We’ve been frightened our whole lives.’” As for the future, Schumer continues to campaign for gun control, aided by her distant cousin the US senator Chuck Schumer, and to call out certain other senators and their links to the NRA. It’s a subject even closer to her heart after two young women were shot in an American cinema while watching her movie Trainwreck. The day we meet, schoolkids are pouring out of their classrooms across the USA to demonstrate, “and I think once I start looking at that news footage I’ll just be crying all day,” she says. We discuss the Florida survivors, such as Emma Gonzalez. “These kids are really making an impact and I feel more hopeful right now than I thought possible,” she says. “This has been more movement than I thought that I would see in my lifetime. I think what they’re just realising is that the adults are not actually in control.” It’s also time for a change in Schumer’s own life. I ask about a typical day for her and she says that for the past 10 years, from the moment she woke up till she went to sleep, “I was driven and working and writing. Doing stand-up, you know, promoting something or filming something. I would say that, for 15 years, I was getting up at seven, going boxing, showering, going to the writer’s room all day, and having an interview during lunch. Afterward, maybe getting some sort of acupuncture before going and doing stand-up, and then having, like, 90 minutes when I could write when I got home. You know? That’s been it. I’ve been hustling for so long, I want to take care of myself now. I got really sick and it just made me realise I wasn’t invincible. I need to slow down.” One last thing though – can we just clear up the one-night-stand thing? Do you really mean you only had sex within relationships? “No! See to me, a one-night stand is where you meet someone that same day, you have sex with them, and then you never see them again. Sleeping with a friend or having sex with someone you know just once, no, I don’t consider that a one-night stand. I should make an addendum to that book. Something else I realised: I wrote that I don’t like watercress in the book. But I meant water chestnuts. So I need to publish two corrections, I guess.” I Feel Pretty is in cinemas in the UK and Ireland on 4 May"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/20/judge-trial-of-richard-iii-play-lady-justice-hallett","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T15:49:45Z","webTitle":"My naked villany: top judge to preside over West End trial of Richard III","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/20/judge-trial-of-richard-iii-play-lady-justice-hallett","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/20/judge-trial-of-richard-iii-play-lady-justice-hallett","fields":{"headline":"My naked villany: top judge to preside over West End trial of Richard III","bodyText":"He was one of the most maligned monarchs in English history. Half a millennium on, the quest for the truth about Richard III has not faded. Will Crookback Dick ever receive the justice he deserves? That is the question Lady Justice Hallett, who adjudicated in the dispute over last Plantagenet king’s reburial, hopes to settle later this month when she will preside over his fictional resurrection and trial for serial murder. An expert in the divisive legal legacy of Richard, the senior judge will take to the stage to oversee the case against his common portrayal as a scheming, Machiavellian hunchback in a one-night only dramatic reassessment at the Novello theatre in London on 29 April. The audience will act as jury, voting on whether or not to find the 15th-century king guilty of ordering the death of his two nephews in the Tower. The play’s immediate aim is to raise money for the Shakespeare Schools Foundation and provide entertainment on a Sunday evening when most theatres are closed. Like the playwright’s s own work, however, the Trial of Richard III is multilayered, offering more subtle messages about comic improvisation, the significance of the law and educational empowerment. A fridge magnet of Richard rests on Hallett’s mantelpiece in the Royal Courts of Justice, a gift from a colleague, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, who sat alongside her during an extraordinary hearing in 2014 into where the remains of the king – disinterred by archaeologists from under a car park in Leicester – should eventually be entombed. The Plantagenet Alliance, made up of members of Richard’s distant Yorkist descendants, argued that the monarch, who was killed at the battle of Bosworth in 1485,in should not be buried in nearby Leicester Cathedral but returned to York Minster. Hallett, Haddon-Cave and Mr Justice Ousely eventually ruled in Leicester’s favour. The justice secretary at the time, Chris Grayling, dismissed the case as a “complete waste of taxpayer’s money” but, Hallett insisted, it was “pretty fascinating”. She discovered “how many millions of descendants you can acquire over a few hundred years”. Adding that case was really important to a lot of people, Hallett said judges should be “about providing access to justice for as many people as possible. I can see that some people thought it was a waste of time. As a judge, I didn’t feel it was.” In The Trial of Richard III, the comedian Hugh Dennis will play the role of jury foreman, while children from three London schools will act out scenes to form evidence in the case. It has been partially scripted by the Bafta-winning writer Jonathan Myerson. The QCs John Kelsey-Fry and Sallie Bennett-Jenkins will appear for the defence and Ian Winter and Jonathan Laidlaw for the prosecution. Hallett said she always wanted to act and that the play combined her love of law and theatre. “It also helps improve public understanding of the law,” she said. “It’s time people realise how important it is. Without the rule of law we won’t have a society worth living in.” Courtroom re-enactments, Hallett said, engaged the public’s imagination in legal issues. One of the questions in The Trial of Richard III, may be whether royalty can be tried in their own courts – or do they have immunity? Theatre audiences are more fickle than juries in deciding who to acquit, Hallett acknowledged, adding: “I suspect it depends on who is playing the part. I’m a great believer in the jury system. In a jury, you know you have someone’s fate in your hands.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/22/after-a-miscarriage-and-divorce-my-friends-showed-me-true-love","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T04:59:12Z","webTitle":"After a miscarriage and divorce, my friends showed me true love","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/22/after-a-miscarriage-and-divorce-my-friends-showed-me-true-love","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/22/after-a-miscarriage-and-divorce-my-friends-showed-me-true-love","fields":{"headline":"After a miscarriage and divorce, my friends showed me true love","bodyText":"As a child, I remember being pretty certain about a few things. I was sure I’d get married. I was convinced I’d write a book. Then I’d have children – two, of course, just like my parents. Preferably girls because they were better. When you’re younger, you assume life will turn out a particular way because you haven’t lived it yet. It sometimes strikes me that getting older is a gradual erasure of the nonchalant confidence that comes with that naivety. For much of my childhood I was weaned on a diet of romantic love. The happy coupling between man and woman was the end-goal of every schmaltzy 1980s film. The photo-stories I read in teenage girls’ magazines all involved a boy whose attention they wanted to grab. On Neighbours, the wedding of Scott and Charlene in 1988 was an event of grandiose proportions. At school, we measured out our popularity in the Valentine’s cards and long-stemmed red roses we received on 14 February. I developed furious, unrequited crushes on boys who never noticed me in the way I wanted them to. Later, when I went to an all-girls boarding school, I covered my wardrobe with ripped-out pictures of Levi’s models and Brad Pitt in A River Runs Through It. Everyone was obsessed with Take That. I once wrote a fan letter to Robbie Williams, including some Russian phrases I’d learned, in the hope it would make me stand out, not realising that my mastery of the Cyrillic alphabet wasn’t going to make a globally famous pop star fall in love with me when I was 14 and still wearing DM boots with purple laces. Throughout the 80s and early 90s, the mainstream pumped out this theory that there was only one way to be loved and validated, and it was a straight, heterosexual, man-woman partnership. This was the era before gay marriage became legal, before the necessary acceptance of gender fluidity and the trans community, all of which are comparatively recent progressions that have made our lives so much richer and so much less binary. But it’s strange how, despite being so liberal in my outlook in other respects, I adhered for so long to the notion that true happiness existed only when you found a partner and settled down to a family life. In my 30s, it’s what everyone else seemed to be doing: they were buying Bugaboos and going to church to get their kids into a faith school and moving to leafier parts of London because a café had just opened down the road that did good flat whites and organic seeded sourdough. Unthinkingly, in the grip of some sort of collective middle-class hypnosis, I tried to follow the herd. I pursued my childhood certainties: I did get married and I did write a book (four, in fact). But in other ways things didn’t turn out quite how I’d imagined. I didn’t have children. I went through two failed cycles of IVF, followed by a natural pregnancy during which a scan revealed a healthy heartbeat at seven weeks and we were told confidently the chances of miscarriage were now less than 5%. But the weeks passed, and it turned out I was part of that 5%. At three months, I miscarried. It’s a strange word, isn’t it? Miscarry. As if losing a baby were a matter of carelessness: a bag of grocery shopping I was unable to lift. The miscarriage caused a gradual implosion of self. I got divorced. I left the country. I changed jobs. Everything in my life was in flux apart from one constant: my friends. It was my friends who rallied round and picked me up and were there at the end of the phone line whenever I called. It was a friend who dropped everything to come to the hospital when I needed her. It was a friend who gave me somewhere to stay, refusing to take rent until I insisted and even then, not allowing me to pay nearly enough. It was a friend who told me I was going to be OK and allowed me to believe her when I no longer believed in myself. It was a friend who gave me a T-shirt emblazoned with the words “Rock Solid” because, she explained, “I’m rock solid for your future and I know you’re going to be OK”. It was a friend who poured me glasses of red wine. A friend who passed on the details of her therapist. A friend who took me out to watch Magic Mike XXL. A friend who helped me move house. A friend who hugged me close and helped me through one of the scariest, most emotionally draining times of my life. My friends helped me survive. Without them, I honestly don’t know where I’d be now. When my marriage ended, I realised that another kind of life existed. It was one in which I got to know myself a lot better and where there was freedom in choosing not to conform. For a long time, I felt I had failed to be a wife and failed to be a mother, and that these things spoke badly of me as a person. I had tried so hard to put a positive gloss on things and keep going that I was ashamed when this facade crumbled. But it was my friends who made me realise this was nonsense. They preferred me as someone who made mistakes, as long as I was honest about them. “It’s more real to fuck up,” my best friend told me one day. “You don’t have to try to be better than you are, because who you are already is why I love you. The real you. Not the you where you are pretending to be someone and tailoring all your needs just to make other people happy.” In the aftermath of divorce, I tried to be myself. That sounds trite, but what I mean is that I tried to feel good about who I was, on my own, without the scaffolding of the romantic relationship I had always dreamed of. It didn’t happen straight away. I got into another relationship that ended last October, even though I had made different decisions this time; even though I had worked so hard to be honest and open to another way of being. The break-up was tough. Once again, my friends stepped in. Once again, they held me close and told me they had faith and built me up with love. Once again, I was reminded of how incredibly lucky I was to have them. Once again, I got over it and emerged far stronger. Unlike my romantic partners, my closest friends have never once let me down. My friends are the people to whom I never have to explain or make excuses. They accept me for who I am, whether we’re eating a takeaway in front of Queer Eye or drunkenly requesting Salt-N-Pepa’s Push It from some startled DJ in the middle of the night. It’s why I’ve dedicated my latest novel to them: a permanent reminder of how much I love them. These days, I’m more comfortable with the realisation that I don’t know how the future will pan out. I’ve learned that life is sometimes confusing, often messy and always surprising. To pretend otherwise is to kid yourself you have control, and that means you can’t possibly hope to experience anything authentically. If you’re trying to shape what happens next, you are probably not paying enough attention to what’s happening right now. By consciously attempting to quell all those fears, hooked to a future that doesn’t even exist yet, I’ve got better at just being. I suppose the best way to express it is to say simply that I’ve started feeling more “me” than I ever have before. I think I’ve got back some of that childlike confidence in myself. That’s due, in large part, to having friends who have taught me I am enough, just as I am, without trying to be something else. And if I do ever have a freak-out about where on earth this colossal gamble called life is headed, I pick up the phone and I call one of them and we will talk and probably laugh and maybe weep and when the conversation ends, I will feel less alone and happier and more confident that there are good and beautiful things in this world. I know I can rely on my friends. This is a gift. It makes me feel that whatever life holds, I will be OK. Better than OK, in fact, because just as I imagined all those years ago, I am part of a great, lifelong love affair. Not with a man, but with the people who have been there for me all along, if only I’d stopped to notice it sooner.

So people can see he had a life, not just in death, but before.” Asif Kapadia and James Gay-Rees’s new three-part documentary (BBC One) begins with Doreen. She is getting ready for her interview and taking a sip from a cup of tea while sitting in front of a dark-grey backdrop. The look of the film is immediately arresting. The interviews are all filmed with the same backdrop, which is a little less dark where it has been lit around the subject. Then the subjects are filmed close up, sometime very close, so that only part of the face is visible. It gives a uniformity to it – and a seriousness. More like testimony than interview. Everyone is treated the same: Doreen and Neville Lawrence; family friends and relations; various (invariably) former police officers. Duwayne Brooks, who was attacked with his best friend but then treated more like a suspect than a victim, features heavily, as does the Lawrence’s lawyer, Imran Khan. Paul Dacre is here, because he is the editor of the Daily Mail, as well as once having employed Neville as a plasterer. Theresa May features in Thursday’s final part. Alexandra Marie, who was a 19-year-old au pair in south London in April 1993 and who witnessed the attack, is also present, as is Marianne Jean-Baptiste, who played Doreen in Paul Greengrass’s drama The Murder of Stephen Lawrence, clips of which are used here between the testimony, like classy reconstructions. Yes, there have been many other films about Stephen’s murder, but none so exhaustive and meticulous. It puts it into the context of early 90s Britain: happy and Soul II Soul inclusive on the surface, but with pockets of hatred, no-go areas for people of colour, more racially motivated attacks and murders, a BNP on the rise, and institutional racism coursing through the veins of the police. This first episode, called The Loss of Joy – a double meaning, because Joy was Doreen’s pet name in Jamaica – puts it into an even wider context. It covers Doreen coming to Britain in 1963, where she met and married Neville and had Stephen. She found joy for 30 years, until 22 April 1993, when it was torn away. Doreen was away that morning, on a course. “Dad, are you OK?” the 18-year-old asked Neville, who was staring out of the window. Those were the last words Neville heard from his son. Later that day, Stephen and Duwayne were at a bus stop, waiting, for too long – you know how it goes. The passing of 25 years doesn’t make it any less hard to hear Duwayne describe what happened. Then came a family’s grief, no arrests, a breakdown in communication and of trust. It took a visit from the most famous man in the world, Nelson Mandela, for anything to happen. One of the most chilling moments in the first episode is audio of police interviews with the suspects. The repeated, cocky “No comment” and “No reply” from Jamie Acourt, Neil Acourt and David Norris, as you would expect. But what DS John Davidson says to Gary Dobson is just as shocking. “Personally, I don’t think it was a racist attack,” Davidson says to the suspect. “I think it’s incidental.” Two black youths are attacked, unprovoked, by a bunch of white strangers shouting the N-word. Yeah, nothing obviously racist about that, more like incidental. Even if it was the last incident in Stephen’s life, while some of his killers remain free. A quarter of a century doesn’t make it any less pertinent or relevant, either. The anniversary is the reason for the timing of the film. But its broadcast coincides with the National Crime Agency considering a new inquiry that could see four former detectives face criminal charges. The investigation continues. Add to that the rise of hate crimes that Brexit and economic uncertainty have triggered and a resurgence of the far right. Meanwhile, people who came to this country at the same time as Doreen and Neville are being threatened with deportation. Stephen’s murder asked searching questions and had a profound effect on Britain. The conversation isn’t over, though. It is, as his mother says, important to continue to talk about him and about his death. Because it continues to be important."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/17/joy-neville-male-dominated-world-rugby-referee-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T10:56:38Z","webTitle":"Joy Neville: ‘Coping in a male-dominated world?

I don’t know anything else’","bodyText":"Joy Neville never wanted to be a referee. The former Ireland rugby captain had only just retired – euphoric after winning the Six Nations in 2013 – and was planning some quality time with her family when the IRFU’s referee development manager, David McHugh, called and asked if she would consider a career change. “Absolutely not,” came her reply, “I thought it was a thankless job.” But McHugh would not let it go. So Neville picked up the phone to one of the most senior and respected men she knew in rugby union and asked him if he thought a woman could ever referee the top men’s division in Ireland. He said: “Joy, not in my lifetime.” “So I called Dave back and said: ‘Right, I’m in,’” chuckles the 34-year-old. Not only did Neville successfully go on to referee in Division 1A of the Ulster Bank League but over the past five years she has set multiple milestones, culminating in a remarkable 12 months in which she has become the first woman to officiate a Pro 14 match, the first woman to officiate in the Challenge Cup, and along with Spain’s Alhambra Nievas, one of the first women to officiate a men’s international match when she took charge of Norway v Denmark. In what marks a remarkable trajectory for the once reluctant official, Neville was also named the Referee of the Year in November 2017, following her performance in the women’s World Cup final. After that the tributes poured in, including Ireland’s president sending a congratulatory tweet. “I did not fully comprehend what a big deal [the award] was,” she says now, “probably down to naivety. I was told [the result] beforehand but I actually thought there were two categories: male and female. I didn’t know it was for the overall category until I went up to receive it. I was blown away. The last year has been amazing.” To top it off, on Sunday Neville received yet another gong at Ireland’s prestigious Person of the Year awards. Along the way she has developed a thick skin and a wicked sense of humour. When, early on, a groundsman asked her if a female could really be a referee, she grabbed both boobs, grinned and quipped: “Yep, last time I checked.” “It’s funny because people say how are you coping in a male-dominated world? But I don’t know anything else.” Growing up in Limerick, with four rugby-playing older brothers, Neville frequently clashed heads in the back garden. When she was eight she broke her nose so badly she could see it through her right eye. “To this day I can’t breathe properly. I have so much trouble with my sinuses, my wife’s always telling me to get it fixed.” During a kickaround in the local park, she went to save a ball and dislocated her thumb. “My brother Gary popped it back in but I still can’t hold a pint.” Back then there was little rugby provision for girls. So Neville started in earnest, aged 17, following a chance meeting with the former Ireland international Jackie McCarthy at the local leisure centre. “Eight months later I was in the Munster squad.” It was her brother Dave (the one who broke her nose) who predicted she would captain her country – after he had taught her how to tackle. “He took me down to the park and a couple of hours later the two of us could barely walk home. A few months after that I got selected for Ireland.” Not yet under the IRFU, women’s rugby was hugely under-resourced at the time and Ireland regularly lost by big margins to England and France. “It was tough, we slept on each others’ floors, we chipped in for lunches.” The 2012 Six Nations provided a watershed moment. As the squad travelled to France they were forced to take an overnight train in an horrendous 17-hour journey, arriving in Pau on the morning of the match. Ireland lost by a point, and the IRFU were roundly criticised. The following year, bolstered by new resources, Ireland won the Grand Slam. Neville says to this day she does not know what McHugh saw in her. Perhaps it was her ability to outwit the referee. The former Ireland captain and friend Fiona Coghlan still ribs her about the time the analyst Dave McBrien came into their dressing room and highlighted Neville’s illegal moves. “My name kept cropping up,” says Neville, laughing. “It’s a running joke between Fiona and I. I knew how to get away with things. It’s part and parcel of 11 years on the international stage.” But for the poacher turned gamekeeper, that experience is proving a distinct advantage. “Oh I’ve had conversations with players, like: ‘I love your style … except I know exactly what you’re doing. Don’t do it again.’ I think they admire the humour. Having been a player myself I have an understanding of what they’re trying to achieve and my approach is probably softer than most referees.” Starting out, however, was a disaster. She was going into each game expecting to be as polished in officiating as she was in playing. She was also painfully conscious of her gender. “At first I was very stern. I probably had a barrier up because I was very concerned that being a female would impact on how the players saw me – bearing in mind most of them would never have had a female refereeing them. I was worried that if I went in too soft they would take advantage. But when I reflected I thought to myself: ‘Joy what are you doing? When you were a player how would you like to have been treated?’ And so that’s how I approached it after that, and it’s been way more successful. Once you have players on your side it makes your job a lot easier.” “As a player I remember saying to referees: ‘You missed that call’ and they’d say: ‘No I didn’t’ and I really didn’t respect them. You could tell by their body language they knew they’d got it wrong. I brought that into my game. A player said to me: ‘Ah ref you missed that,’ and at the next break in play I said: ‘You know what? You’re dead right, I’m really sorry lads.’ They said: ‘It’s fine.’ They respect it if you put your hand up and admit you’ve got something wrong.” It was her wife, Simona, who convinced Neville to stick with refereeing. The two were married in 2015, weeks after Ireland voted in favour of same-sex marriage. “Compared to other countries around the world we’ve come an awful long way and what I’m really happy about, everything I’ve done, the main topic has been me being a female in a male-dominated world and there’s been no talk about “the lesbian female”. I’m really, really proud of that because I think sexuality doesn’t define who you are. That’s a mark of where we are in society.” Neville will oversee the women’s World Rugby Women’s Sevens Series in Japan this weekend but her long-term goal is to run the line at the men’s Six Nations. “I assisted in the international tier one matches so that shows I’m in the sight of the selectors, so it’s about maintaining high standard performances. If it happens it would be an amazing thing to achieve, and if it doesn’t, well, it wasn’t meant to be and I’ve done so much already I’m very lucky and thankful.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/17/theresa-mays-hostile-environment-policy-at-heart-of-windrush-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T16:31:39Z","webTitle":"Theresa May's 'hostile environment' at heart of Windrush scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/17/theresa-mays-hostile-environment-policy-at-heart-of-windrush-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/17/theresa-mays-hostile-environment-policy-at-heart-of-windrush-scandal","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May's 'hostile environment' at heart of Windrush scandal","bodyText":"Theresa May was two years into her job as home secretary when she made her strategy explicit, telling the Telegraph in 2012 her aim “was to create here in Britain a really hostile environment for illegal migration”. The outcry over the treatment of the Windrush generation of migrants in Britain legally, but sometimes without the paperwork to prove it, has exposed the scale of that strategy. The hostile environment created by new legislation and regulation has meant migrants do not face border officials only when they enter the country for the first time, but as a constant part of daily life. They must prove their immigration status whenever they try to rent a property, open a bank account or access the health services. Landlords and employers become immigration enforcers – or risk hefty fines. At the Home Office, May was tasked with delivering David Cameron’s election promise that immigration would be reduced to the tens of thousands, a pledge that has still yet to be realised. May’s decision to repeat the promise in the June general election campaign and her refusal to discount international students from the net migration figures – despite discomfort over both issues from her cabinet colleagues – underlines how much controlling immigration is not an electoral strategy but an ideological driver for the prime minister. Labour MP David Lammy, who has led the charge in parliament calling for justice for the Windrush families who have been unfairly targeted, suggested the atmosphere of distrust was a feature, not a bug, in the system. “It is public policy to send ‘go home’ vans around areas of high immigration like my own, to send immigration officers to churches that offer help to refugees, to make concerted efforts to establish immigration tourism as a significant feature of our health service when it is not and to deny access to healthcare for people with cancer,” he said. “There is also the huge cost involved, it can be £40,000 for one family, constantly having to seek renewed leave to remain.” Sarah Teather, a former Liberal Democrat MP who was minister for children and families, revealed in 2013 that an internal working group on immigration was initially named the Hostile Environment Working Group, with its name only changed following Lib Dem objections. Teather, who is now the director of the Jesuit Refugee Service, said: “Theresa May was determined to transform things. She was proud of wanting to generate a really hostile environment. “The Home Office has a culture of enforcement and disbelief which runs deep into the walls, but it is politically led. It’s a culture from the top, and it has been a bit rich for the home secretary, Amber Rudd, to blame civil servants. When you’ve had a Conservative home secretary that long, you cannot moan when civil servants deliver those policies.” Apologies to the Windrush generation by Rudd and the prime minister also made clear ministers and officials believed the migrants’ poor treatment to be an anomaly. Home Office guidance says the rules are “a proportionate measure to maintain effective immigration control.” Sent out to answer media questions about the affair on Tuesday morning, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington denied that May’s tough approach in the Home Office had caused the crisis. Downing Street said the strategy was intended to target illegal immigrants alone, some of whom had been working in conditions akin to slavery. The prime minister’s spokesman said the rules were “specifically designed to deal with the problem of illegal immigration and issues such as people working illegally and in the black market in conditions that are not suitable for anyone.” Asked whether the government stood by the hostile environment programme, he said: “The system was put in place to deter illegal immigration and to prevent people who didn’t have the right to be in the country to access public services. It’s in the country’s interests to have a secure immigration system in relation to these cases.” However, campaigners, MPs and legal experts say the treatment of those Windrush-era Caribbean migrants was a logical consequence of the hostile environment strategy. Colin Yeo, an immigration barrister from Garden Court chambers, said the strategy had been applied without much consideration of the social consequences. “We now effectively have in-country immigration controls, carried out by private citizens on each other,” he said. “It’s done through fear of penalties, or it can be done through bureaucracy, the system of checks in healthcare or education which are so onerous. “Black and ethnic minority people are disproportionally affected too – a landlord will ask for your papers if you look or sound foreign. We know this is happening in practice.” Nick Timothy, May’s adviser at the Home Office and her joint chief of staff at No 10 until the last election, criticised the treatment, but said: “The solution lies in formalising their status, not abandoning sensible policies to limit illegal immigration.” Yeo said limited resources were also a factor, meaning the Home Office was unable to carry out large numbers of forced removals and the hostile environment was in part about incentivising people to “self-deport” by making their lives unpleasant. “That seems to be the rationale, but there is no evidence that is the case and the number of voluntary departures also seems to be falling,” he said. When the system is enforced, errors can be widespread. A recent report found one in 10 bank account refusals because of immigration checks occurred in error. A Law Society report last week found almost 50% of UK immigration and asylum appeals were upheld, which it said was “clear evidence of serious flaws in the way visa and asylum applications are being dealt with”. The embarrassment over the Windrush cases is unlikely to herald a long-term change of heart, Yeo said. “It is embedded in law, May would have to repeal her landmark legislation as home secretary. I very much doubt they will reverse course.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/ng-interactive/2018/jun/05/world-cup-2018-complete-guide-players-ratings-goals-caps","type":"interactive","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T10:29:16Z","webTitle":"World Cup 2018: complete guide to all 736 players","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/jun/05/world-cup-2018-complete-guide-players-ratings-goals-caps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/jun/05/world-cup-2018-complete-guide-players-ratings-goals-caps","fields":{"headline":"World Cup 2018: complete guide to all 736 players","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/22/hanya-yanagihara-new-york-times-magazine-editor-and-best-selling-novelist","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T07:00:18Z","webTitle":"Hanya Yanagihara: influential magazine editor by day, best-selling author by night","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/22/hanya-yanagihara-new-york-times-magazine-editor-and-best-selling-novelist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/22/hanya-yanagihara-new-york-times-magazine-editor-and-best-selling-novelist","fields":{"headline":"Hanya Yanagihara: influential magazine editor by day, best-selling author by night","bodyText":"When Hanya Yanagihara was 10 years old, her father let her visit a pathologist’s lab. He was a doctor and an artist, twin interests his young daughter shared so that when the pathologist opened the cadaver, she whipped out a sketch pad and started to draw. “I was always interested in the disease, not the human,” she says of that early fascination with medicine, a forensic interest that foreshadowed the themes of her fiction and, 30 years later, found Yanagihara in an unusual life: writing acclaimed novels at night, with a day job as a senior editor at the New York Times. Fiction, says the 43-year-old, “is a completely other realm that’s untouchable and unknown”. Editing a magazine – in this case, T magazine, the New York Times style supplement – is not. She smiles. “I’ve never done it any other way.” We are in Yanagihara’s office at the New York Times, where the wall is adorned with page proofs for forthcoming issues of T and a blown-up cover of A Little Life, her second novel, a 700-page weepy about a group of male friends in New York that was a big hit in 2015. (The cover features the now-familiar image of a man who appears to be in agony, but is actually drawn from a series of photos taken by Peter Hujar of men in the throes of orgasm.) There are plenty of precedents for best-selling novelists who also held down a day job: Arthur Conan Doyle was a surgeon; Joseph Heller wrote Catch-22 in the evenings while working as a copywriter during the day; Anthony Trollope did three hours on his novel before going to work at the post office, and Toni Morrison raised two sons on her own while writing novels at night and working every day as an editor at Random House. Where Yanagihara is unusual, perhaps, is in the fact that the demands of her day job require an enormous amount of nervous, creative and managerial energy, which the casual observer might imagine she’d prefer to invest in her fiction. To Yanagihara, the commitment to journalism is a vital expression of the practical side of her nature: she likes the adrenalin of short deadlines and the satisfaction of making a new product each week. Still, after A Little Life made the best-seller lists three years ago, her decision to take the job at the New York Times was greeted in the publishing world – a milieu she describes as “a provincial community, more or less as snobby as the fashion industry” – with some bafflement. “I’d get these underhanded comments like, ‘Oh, I never knew there were words [in T magazine] worth reading.’” She laughs. In Yanagihara’s case, returning to the magazine world was a question of disposition and financial necessity. While a big seller by the standards of literary fiction, A Little Life was hardly Fifty Shades of Grey and Yanagihara lives in an apartment in downtown Manhattan with overheads that serious novels don’t support. It’s a stylish life and while she is dressed today in workman-like denim, an advertisement for the daylight-hours side of her nature, elsewhere whimsy reigns. In a recent photo shoot, Yanagihara’s apartment was shown to be stuffed with 12,000 books and various treasures (a plaster bust of Ho Chi Minh from Saigon; a solid-silver cow from Mumbai; a print by the Japanese photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto), a space she characterises as “dusty and cluttered” and about which, she says smiling, T magazine’s design editor “can’t say anything nice”. The magazine, which she calls “a culture magazine masquerading as a fashion magazine”, expresses not only the range and depth of her interests, but also a commitment to her belief in good writing. “Style writing shouldn’t be dumb,” she says. “It should be done with finesse, but also with as much authority and background as you would have reporting a piece about the NSA, or the Trump White House. We are part of a great reportorial institution, and I think style writing has become lumped in with squiffy opinions and laziness.” And while this may be a bad time to be American and an indifferent time, as ever, to be a literary novelist, it is a terrific time to be an editor, particularly at a newspaper as well funded as the New York Times. It is Yanagihara’s belief that “Art is always at its best when it’s in disagreement with the government,” and if the politics in T are by design sotto voce, she also hopes she can bring to it “this sense of urgency. If you look at how art has been responding [to Trump] even in the past six months, you see it on the runways, you see it in the galleries, you see it in museums, even in restaurants. You don’t see it in novels yet, because the Trump novels will come out in a couple of years. But you know people are working on it. There is this sense of collective response and one of the things I knew I would have to address was how to keep track of how the culture is responding to the moment. To pretend that artwork is happening in some sort of bubble is a provincial way to think. Anyway, whoever dismisses art, or fashion, or any kind of design coming out of this moment and doesn’t see that isn’t giving proper respect to the form itself.” All of this may come as something of a surprise to those who only know Yanagihara through her novels, both the rigour of her journalistic engagement – she very much believes in reporting, quoting an old editor of hers who used to say: “When the writer does a story, I want them to talk to 10 sources and read three books,” an ethos which the New York Times, increasingly rarely among newspapers, still has deep enough pockets to support – and her discipline. In person she comes across as pragmatic, quick-talking, unsentimental about the costs of doing two difficult jobs, one of which is perennially living alone. A Little Life, by contrast, is expansive, overblown, at times almost mawkish, with a child abuse sub-plot of such startlingly graphic description that although it was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize, it has about it a whiff of the Pat Conroy pot-boiler. There are other contradictions. As anyone who has ever worked for a newspaper knows, management is not most writers’ and journalists’ strong suit. But, “I really love managing,” says Yanagihara. “It’s important to me to be a good boss. One of the things I found most offensive about [comments arising from] the recent #MeToo movement was this implication that in order to run a creative or semi-creative business, a certain amount of bad behaviour is tolerable, or even desirable, because from that comes great creative vision. I really don’t think that’s true! I know plenty of people who have been at the helm of various creative galleries, or production companies, and have never felt the need to behave poorly. It’s just a lazy justification. And as someone who has managed to go 25 years without conflating sex with power, or bullying my colleagues, I find it particularly offensive.” Working a day job actively helps with the other side of her life and offers some relief from the worst aspects of novel writing. “Magazines are very collaborative. It is something that’s created by many and that’s wonderful, because fiction writing is so interior and makes you into an awful person in a lot of ways. The private,” she says, “becomes much more sharply private when you have a job, especially one that’s in the world. It reminds you on a daily basis of what people sound like, how they move, what their concerns are, how they think.” When she started editing the magazine at the end of 2017, she felt as if she was “being hit by a bus every day”. But slowly, as she “gets used to the rhythm,” she feels the machinery of the fiction-writing side of her brain firing up. “I worked through the first novel, too,” she says. “Some people are very disciplined, but I’m not. I need something to parse my time.” Her job as an editor offers this, too: a daily reminder that writing is a business that should, to her mind, be characterised by “a useful lack of romance” that rests on the principle: “No one will read it if you don’t turn it in.” Hanya Yanagihara’s first novel, The People in the Trees, was published in 2013 and was partly based on the true story of Daniel Carleton Gajdusek, an American medical researcher who won the Nobel Prize in 1976 for his work in Papua New Guinea and who was later ostracised after being convicted of child abuse. The story established the novelist’s twin interests in the traumas of the body and the way in which the mind seeks to absorb them – a theme she would return to in A Little Life, which has its roots in aspects of her childhood. Glancing at her biography, I had wondered if Yanagihara, who moved around a lot as a child, from California, to her father’s native Hawaii, to New York and Connecticut before returning to Hawaii again, missed out on having a single point of origin, the equivalent of John Updike’s Shillington, Pennsylvania, or Philip Roth’s Newark, New Jersey. In fact, she says, “I think of Hawaii as my Newark. I always say that for Asian Americans, Hawaii is the imaginary homeland. It’s the closest thing that Asian Americans have to Harlem, the place where everything about the culture at large feels familiar, or invented by you. It’s where I consider home even after all these years in New York.” Yanagihara’s parents – her mother was born in Seoul but grew up in Hawaii – met on the island and those early books by Roth were recommended to Yanagihara by her father, a great and eclectic reader whose tastes have informed her own. “He liked a British female writer of a certain age; he loved Anita Brookner – and I do, too – and he loved Iris Murdoch and Barbara Pym. They’re books about loneliness and ageing, and they’re funny and a little devilish. Pym always has a few asides about how awful writers are, and Brookner does, too. There is a suspicion of the craft that the male writers of their generation didn’t have, a metaphysical reckoning of what is it actually doing for the world?” They are also books characterised by a stark lack of sentimentality. As a child, she wasn’t squeamish when she watched the pathologist at work, she says, “because death was a frequent topic of conversation and my father was never hesitant about showing me pictures of different kinds of skin illnesses, and so forth. It wasn’t something to be ashamed of – the body. Many cultures in the world are taught to be so ashamed of it that death is somehow embarrassing; the naked corpse – you can’t see past its nakedness. Embarrassment about death, which is obviously linked to fear of death, is somehow equivalent to embarrassment about the body. This idea that the body is not about the form, but about the spirit animating it and once it leaves then it’s nothing, was never something that I grew up being taught to believe.” She would love to have gone to medical school, she says, and in fact after that early experience watching an autopsy, would like to have been a pathologist. “My father said it’s a good career because you’re left alone a lot and it takes a certain amount of artistry and technicality, and other doctors defer to the pathologist.” The secrets of the dead? “Exactly. But I just didn’t have the grades for it.” Instead, after graduating from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, she moved to New York and went into publishing. Yanagihara wasn’t a good editor, she says. She couldn’t pick hits – “I didn’t have the eye for it. I bought one book the entire time I was there” – and so after a few years she side-stepped into magazines, working first at the now defunct Brill’s Content and later for many years as an editor at Condé Nast Traveller. “I liked the personalities there, I liked the brashness of it, I liked the democracy of it, the pace, working with visuals, and I liked the kind of sense, unlike a book, where it takes however many years for the poor writer to write and then 18 months to produce, that with a magazine you have a chance to make it new every single time.” It is her mother’s sensibility that has informed Yanagihara’s style, not only her taste but her belief in the importance of “material culture”. Her mother, she says, “has a great sense of design. She really understood textiles, she was a wonderful seamstress, she understands colour, she has excellent taste, and she can make anything with her hands. When I was growing up almost everything I had, from toys to clothes, were made. And she understands flowers – she could name a lot of things; so could my father. It was important for them that I knew how to identify different chairs from different periods, or different fabrics, and they were interested in the people who made them. The idea of being a ‘maker’ was important; the person who actually made things to beautify one’s life was essential to them. And they still make things. They’re currently learning how to weave Hawaiian straw hats. My mother makes beautiful flower leis. Doing things with their hands – they were both illustrators when they met.” The integrity of the product is its own reward and, to that extent, Yanagihara’s success as a novelist has been a surprise bonus. She expected A Little Life to sell 5,000 copies and would have been happy with that. Instead, it sold tens of thousands and inspired many rapturous reviews, including one in the New Yorker, which described it as a novel that could “drive you mad, consume you, and take over your life” – although, says Yanagihara, it often surprises people that after its success, she couldn’t put her feet up and retire. The money, she says, is not “enough for me to live on, which I think people assume it is”. One of the many reasons she returned to the New York Times was for the health insurance. When she took the job, she told her employers: “I won’t go out at night.” She judges this to be an important part of maintaining her stamina and preserving what energy she has left for her fiction. “I’ll go out occasionally for an advertiser event, if it’s deeply important; but I typically only go out once a week. And the rest of the nights I spend at home, thinking and doing what I want.” (The only time she misses living with someone, she says, is “when something breaks”.) We get up to look at the page proofs for a forthcoming edition of the magazine, which is devoted to New York in the early 1980s, a period of cultural dominance in the city she compares to Berlin in the 1930s. “Every magazine editor has that period, an aesthetic set point they return to again and again, and for me it’s always been this one,” says Yanagihara. One photo spread features a group shot of people who got their start in early 1980s New York and looking at the line up – Willem Dafoe, Glenn Close, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, Harvey Fierstein, Elizabeth McGovern, Joan Allen, Cynthia Nixon, among others – you can only marvel at the hours that must have gone into arranging it. On another page, Yanagihara reproduces the spine-chilling news story from the New York Times of 3 July 1981: “Rare cancer seen in 41 homosexuals”. Michael Cunningham writes the issue’s closing essay. It is a love letter not only to New York, but to the idea of the centrality of art and culture to one’s life and Yanagihara explains her own life – its fullness and sacrifices – by quoting from a poem by Kenneth Koch: “You want a social life, with friends / A passionate love life and as well / To work hard every day. What’s true / Is of these three you may have two.” If half the battle in life is in knowing what you want and, by extension, what you don’t want, then Yanagihara seems to have it down pat. “The things the book have given me have been so unexpected and lovely,” she says of A Little Life. “But it’s not something that informs my daily life. It’s something that happens at night and when you’re specifically called. The rest of the time you’re Bruce Wayne.” She smiles at the strangeness of it. “But it worked well for Batman.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/17/plantwatch-planning-loophole-threatens-ancient-woodlands","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T20:30:05Z","webTitle":"Plantwatch: Planning loophole threatens ancient woodlands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/17/plantwatch-planning-loophole-threatens-ancient-woodlands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/17/plantwatch-planning-loophole-threatens-ancient-woodlands","fields":{"headline":"Plantwatch: Planning loophole threatens ancient woodlands","bodyText":"Many of Britain’s ancient woodlands are being threatened by a loophole in national planning policy. Ancient woodlands cover less than 3% of the UK, and have existed since 1600 in England and Wales, and 1750 in Scotland. These are our richest places for wildlife on land, home to more threatened species than any other land habitat, and once destroyed can never be replaced. As the Woodland Trust points out, listed buildings have far more protection from development than ancient woodlands. Under the national planning policy framework, developers can destroy ancient trees if they can show “sufficient need”. This has allowed developments such as housing, roads, quarries, fracking, tourism and railways. The Woodland Trust has more than 700 cases of ancient woods under threat from development, mostly in England. One development at Smithy Wood near Sheffield has proposed a new service station on the M1, while in Sherwood Forest permission was granted for seismic surveying for shale gas in ancient woodland.

During a visit to Hong Kong in 1978, Choi was allegedly lured on to a boat and transferred to a cargo ship destined for North Korea, under the orders of Kim Jong-il, an avid film fan. Her husband, the film director Shin Sang-ok, was taken there soon after. The couple remained trapped in the country for eight years, making several films together under the instruction of Kim, who would later become North Korea’s leader. Shin at first refused to cooperate in making propaganda movies and was imprisoned for almost five years. In his memoirs, he wrote how he and his wife were reunited in 1983 at a party thrown by Kim, who outlined his artistic vision and how he wanted them to improve North Korean cinema. In a 2011 interview, Choi said Kim “respected us as artists and fully supported us”, but she could never forgive him for the kidnapping. She said she and Shin were allowed to make “films with artistic values, instead of just propaganda films extolling the regime”, but always longed for their freedom. While making films for Kim, the couple travelled overseas extensively for movie production missions and to attend film festivals, but always under heavy surveillance by North Korean agents. During this period, Choi won the best actress award at the 1985 Moscow international film festival for her role in Salt, a film about Korean guerrillas fighting against Japanese colonial rule. The couple had divorced in 1976, but remarried during a trip to Hungary, apparently at Kim’s urging. They finally escaped in Vienna after attending the 1986 Berlin film festival, reaching the US embassy, where they claimed asylum. The couple returned to South Korea permanently in 1999, after spending more than a decade in the US. Shin died in 2006. The North Korean regime has always disputed the couple’s version of events, claiming Shin willingly defected because of disenchantment with the government in Seoul. The couple were the subject of the 2016 documentary The Lovers and the Despot. Choi made her cinematic debut in 1942, and was referred to as the queen of South Korean cinema from the 1950s to the 70s, while appearing in more than 100 films, many of which were made by Shin. Her funeral will be held in Seoul on Thursday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/ng-interactive/2018/apr/17/david-squires-on-celebrating-victory-celebrating-together","type":"interactive","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T10:03:47Z","webTitle":"David Squires on … celebrating victory, celebrating together!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/apr/17/david-squires-on-celebrating-victory-celebrating-together","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/apr/17/david-squires-on-celebrating-victory-celebrating-together","fields":{"headline":"David Squires on … celebrating victory, celebrating together!","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"social-care-network/2018/apr/25/social-care-green-paper-business-as-usual","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T07:28:26Z","webTitle":"Social care green paper: it would be wrong to bail out business as usual | Paul Burstow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2018/apr/25/social-care-green-paper-business-as-usual","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2018/apr/25/social-care-green-paper-business-as-usual","fields":{"headline":"Social care green paper: it would be wrong to bail out business as usual","bodyText":"Few would deny that social care in England is under huge financial pressure, but is more cash all that the sector needs? While it may be essential, it is not sufficient. The Care Act raised the bar when it made the promotion of individual wellbeing the organising principle of adult social care. It requires a different approach, one that is based on the strengths and the gifts people have. Its goal is to prevent and postpone dependency. But, too often, proving dependency is still the currency of our system and social care seems like an exercise in border control, keeping people out. Yet around the country, pioneers are introducing a new order of things. Starting with people’s strengths and relationships, they adopt a problem solving approach; they are about having conversations not making assessments. An example of this way of working is the Rotherham Social Prescribing Service. Funded by Rotherham Better Care Fund and the town’s clinical commissioning group, a team of advisers provide a single gateway to voluntary and community support for GPs and people with complex long-term conditions who are the most intensive users of primary care. The service receives GP referrals of eligible patients and carers, and assesses their needs before helping them to access a range of support including advocacy, respite for carers, welfare advice, befriending, low level counselling and bereavement support. The service also administers a grant funding pot, through which a variety of these activities are commissioned. Evaluation of the programme covering 2012 to 2015 estimated the return on social investment as between £570,000 and £620,000. It has also reported a 7% reduction in unplanned, often urgent, admissions to hospital and a 17% reduction in A&amp;E attendances. Developing a place- and asset–based approach to promoting individual wellbeing and preventing dependency should be the goal of a sustainably and public funded social care system. Indeed, an asset-based approach is essential to achieving sustainability. The trouble is that these new models are stuck; resources are constricted to propping up business as usual, making it hard to secure the sustained financing needed to expand and improve them. Access to the state-subsidised social care system depends on where you live. As reports by the Care Quality Commission and Competition and Markets Authority have made clear, care providers’ finances are precarious. The whole edifice rests on the shoulders of a poorly-paid, under-valued workforce with a high turnover. The legal fiction is that all eligible needs are being met. But those needs deemed ineligible are real needs too and as budget pressures have grown, more and more people are deemed ineligible. Dollops of cash cannot hide a broken system. One way or another, the demographics are inescapable, the costs of care are and will increasingly fall due, as the ageing population grows and the number of people living with more than one chronic illness rises. Do we share the burden and pool the risk, or do we leave it to chance and personal responsibility? In its industrial strategy, the government says “the modern nation state is the most powerful means we have of pooling risk”. I would add that it is also the most cost-effective means of pooling risk. The green paper must spell out the government’s preferred approach to pooling risk and raising the extra money needed to put social care on a sustainable footing. There is no pain free option – someone has to pay more. There are needs to be met and bills to be paid. General taxation has a part to play in sharing the burden across society and National Insurance rules should be changed so that those who work beyond state pension age continue to contribute. Increasing National Insurance to fund the NHS and social care would pool risk and give the public confidence that the money will go where it is intended – but there is still room for personal responsibility. Social care has one of the meanest of means-tests in our welfare state. People who draw the short straw and need care in later life face losing most of their savings, or having to sell their home. A cap on people’s lifetime care costs, as well as a floor that protects at least £100,000, would ease the deep sense of injustice many feel. Reform must take a long-term view and lay the foundations for funding social care well beyond the next decade. We should look for lessons from other nations grappling with the challenge of ageing populations. Some form of social insurance or auto-enrolment model that begins in our 40s could offer a way of pooling risk and offering peace of mind in later life, by creating a dedicated source of funds to meet care costs. A green paper that is silent or vague on long-term funding will have fallen at the first hurdle. But a green paper that simply offers the prospect of a better funded status quo would be a mistake.

In autumn, I change my route to admire the dinner-plate saffron dahlia that grows by the Hindu Centre. In summer, it is the Bengali amaranth in window boxes with gourds clambering over a neighbouring wall.

It is the secret talismans I look for – the less obvious wild flowers. When I was a boy there was a hidden bluebell wood on my river roam: deep blue in summer shade if you took a right turn at the right time by Devon’s small Avon estuary. Today, when I turn into the allotment road, there is an intense patch of snowdrops which I look out for; then there’s the almost invisible violets that come up every year, and the rare wild lilies only a few of us know about. Most mornings at my beach hut we first take a walkabout: a rummage around the plot to see if our wood anemones are there yet, or the occasional white violets, cowslips and pink campions that appear out the back. What I am looking for is the idea of a wild meadow where wild flowers can flourish. But it is the quiet hepatica that makes me happiest. A few stray blue flowers half-hidden in the hedges that tell me that spring has really arrived. I know a bank where the wild thyme blows, says Shakespeare, where oxlips and the nodding violet grows.

Tuchel, who has been out of work since leaving Borussia Dortmund in May 2017, would replace Unai Emery at the end of the season despite the Spaniard sealing his first Ligue 1 title at the weekend with a 7-1 thrashing of Monaco. Chelsea’s Antonio Conte had also been a leading candidate to move to the French capital but it is understood the club’s president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, favours the appointment of Tuchel over the Italian. More meetings to finalise details on the 44-year-old’s contract are scheduled for this week, with Emery linked with a return to Sevilla when he finally departs the Parc des Princes. Tuchel had been a target for Bayern Munich as a replacement for the interim manager Jupp Heynckes but indicated he was not interested, with Bayern’s chief executive, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, telling German broadcasters ZDF on Monday that “he will almost certainly be going to PSG”. On Sunday, Khelaifi denied that any agreement had been reached but PSG’s comprehensive 5-2 aggregate defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League last 16 under the Spaniard is believed to have convinced him of the need for change. “If we had signed with someone, we would have announced it to you,” he told Canal+. “Today we have a coach who was on the pitch. We are very honest; we have a coach today who works with us, with a contract until the end of the season. “Let’s be positive tonight, we’ve done a lot of positive things. We’re champions, it’s a wonderful thing, I thank everyone. And the season is not over yet, there is the cup to win. The Champions League is our big goal, but it’s not easy. We work hard, but the other clubs do it too. We are very proud today.” Tuchel spent two years at Dortmund, following five at Mainz, and was widely admired for the job he did in replacing Jürgen Klopp at the Westfalenstadion.

The UK consumer prices index only rose by 2.5% in March, down from 2.7% in February. That’s good news for households, as wages rose by 2.8% per year in the last three months. The Office for National Statistics said the drop in inflation was due to weaker-than-usual price rises for women’s clothing, and the lack of new duties on alcohol and tobacco also helped (because the budge has been moved to the Autumn). Here’s the full story: Britain’s Retail Price Index rose by 3.3% - meaning that student loans will rise by up to 6.3% from September. The government, though, says relatively few people will earn enough to be affected by the change. Economists are split over whether falling inflation will deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates next month. The International Monetary Fund has warned that global debt levels are now higher than before the 2008 crisis, as it urges governments to get a grip. America, though, is on track for higher borrowings thanks to Donald Trump’s tax cuts: The Fund also warned that the world economy faces a bumpy road, with risks of a downturn rising. The slowdown in London’s housing market has driven prices down, year-on-year, for the first time since 2009. Oil prices have hit a three-year high, thanks to falling stocks and reports that Saudi want prices to head higher, perhaps to $100. In the City, the FTSE 100 is up 88 points - or 1.2% - its highest level since late February. That’s probably all for today. Newsflash: Oil has hit a new three-year high, as new figures show a surprise fall in US energy stocks. Brent crude has jumped over 2% to $73.30, the highest level since November 2014. US crude oil has also risen sharply, to $68.48. The surge came after America’s Energy Information Administration reported that crude supplies fell by 1.1 million barrels last week. Oil was also boosted by speculation that Saudi Arabia is keen for crude to rise to $80 or even $100 per barrel. Reuters reported: Over the past year, Saudi Arabia has emerged as OPEC’s leading supporter of measures to boost prices, a change from its more moderate stance in earlier years. Iran, once a keen OPEC price hawk, now wants lower prices than Saudi Arabia. Industry sources have linked this shift in Saudi Arabia’s stance to its desire to support the valuation of state oil company Aramco ahead of the kingdom’s planned sale of a minority stake in an initial public offering.... “We have come full circle,” a separate high-level industry source said of the change in Saudi thinking. “I would not be surprised if Saudi Arabia wanted oil at $100 until this IPO is out of the way.” More here: Exclusive: OPEC’s new price hawk Saudi Arabia seeks oil as high as $100 - sources The Department for Education has got in touch about the rise in student loan interest rates to up to 6.3%. They confirm that March’s RPI inflation figure will indeed be used to calculate repayments from September, but they also insist that relatively few people will be affected by the change. That’s because only the better-paid borrowers will clear their debts within the 30-year timescale anyway, due to the way they are repaid. For everyone else, it will simply affect the total that is eventually written off. A government spokesperson said: “Our decision to raise the minimum repayment threshold for student loans to £25,000 is saving 600,000 graduates up to £360 per year from this month. “This change in interest rate will make no impact on a borrowers’ monthly repayments and very few people are likely to be affected by the increase. Once the loans are in repayment, only borrowers earning over £45K are charged the maximum rate. This ensures that they make a fair contribution to the system. “The government’s review of post-18 education and funding is also underway and will look at how students and taxpayers are getting value for money, including the role of interest rates.” Here’s a handy table showing the new repayment rates, depending on how much one earns. Under £25K: 3.30% (March’s Retail Price Index reading) £30K: 4.05% £35K: 4.80% £40K: 5.55% Over £45K: 6.30% Here’s some reaction to the IMF’s warnings on global debt, and bitcoin: Newsflash: The IMF has issued a stark warning that country’s need to tackle their debt levels, before the next crisis strikes. From Washington, our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: The global economy is more deeply indebted than before the financial crisis and countries need to take immediate action to improve their finances before the next downturn, the International Monetary Fund has said. The IMF said a prolonged period of low interest rates had stimulated a build-up of debt worth 225% of world GDP in 2016, 12 points above the previous record level reached in 2009. China was responsible for much of the increase, the IMF said, but noted that developed, emerging market and low-income countries all now looked vulnerable. The Washington-based institution used its half-yearly fiscal monitor to single out the US for particular criticism, saying that Donald Trump’s fiscal stimulus – a package of tax cuts and spending increases – was leading to a bigger budget deficit at a time when it should be on the way down. More here: Over in Washington, the International Monetary Fund is warning that the world’s financial system faces a ‘bumpy road’. In its new Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR), the IMF says that the short-term risks have risen, thanks to rising geopolitical tensions and fears of a trade war. ...and there’s even a (small) danger that the entire global economy suffers a contraction in the medium term. The Fund says: Given current financial conditions, risks to financial stability and growth are high over the medium-term. This reflects the fact that recent years of low interest rates—needed to support economic growth—have provided an environment in which vulnerabilities have been building. These vulnerabilities could exacerbate the next economic downturn and could also make the road ahead bumpy. The IMF’s concerns include: Weaker credit quality: as companies with more dubious credit records have borrowed heavily in the market External debt in emerging-market and low-income countries: the ultraloose monetary conditions in advanced economies sent a flood of funds into the developing world, and there could be turbulence if it flows out again. The Fund is also worried about the rise of crypto assets such as bitcoin, saying they could destabilise the global economy unless regulators are alert: Some of the technologies behind these assets could make financial market infrastructures, such as payment systems, more efficient. But they have also been afflicted by fraud, security breaches, and operational failures—and have been associated with illicit activities. While the limited size of crypto assets suggests they currently pose little risk to financial stability, risks could grow if their use became more widespread without appropriate safeguards. The fall in the pound today has helped to push shares in London to a six-week high. The FTSE 100 has gained 63 points to 7289, its highest level since the end of February. A weaker sterling will, all things being equal, push up the value of exporters’ income from overseas, and thus their share price. Mining companies are leading the risers, thanks to a rise in the price of commodities today. Nickel is surging, on predictions that it could be included in any further sanctions against Russia. Today’s inflation report is bad news for Britain’s students - and anyone paying off a student loan. That’s because the UK’s Retail Prices Index, another inflation measure, is used to calculate the repayment rate on student debt. The system uses a sliding scale -- those earnings less than £21,000 per year are charged RPI, then there is a sliding scale up to RPI +3% (6.1%) where income is £41,000 or more. Current students are also charged RPI +3% on their loans. RPI rose by 3.3% in March - high than the 3.1% recorded in March 2017. So, the interest rate on student debt is going to be as much as 6.3% from this autumn (up from 6.1%). That’s eye-wateringly steep, given Bank of England base rate is just 0.5%. It’s a complicated situation -- only the wealthier ex-students will ever end up earning enough to clear their debts (MoneySavingExpert have a good explanation here) The BBC’s Sean Coughlan thinks the government might intervene.... Those affected may feel aggrieved that RPI, rather than the (lower) CPI, is used. And they have a good case. The ONS itself has ruled that RPI is flawed and over, and should not be designated as a National Statistic at all! Paul Johnson, the well-respected head of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, says RPI is simply not up to the job: Danielle Haralambous, UK Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, also suspects the Bank of England will hike borrowing costs next month: “Inflation was softer than expected, but the decline in the headline rate won’t be a complete surprise to the Bank of England’s policy-setting committee, which expects annual inflation to ease this year as the impact of the pound’s past depreciation fades. But the committee is also looking at other data showing domestic price pressure still in the pipeline, notably a pick-up in wage growth and firm input prices. We expect these factors to keep inflation well above the bank’s target for much of this year and support the case for a gradual normalisation of UK monetary policy. In our view, there is still a high chance that the bank raises interest rates again next month.” ING’s Viraj Patel points out that weaker inflation might make two rate hikes in 2018 less likely: The pound is continuing to slide, as traders ponder what this morning’s drop in inflation means for UK interest rates. Sterling has now fallen by a whole cent against the US dollar, to $1.419. It’s also down 0.7% against the euro, to €1.147. At the start of this week, a May rate hike looked to be nailed on. But the news that the Consumer Prices Index has fallen back towards the Bank of England’s 2% target is prompting a rethink. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool suspects that the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee might vote for a rate hike, to 0.75%.... but he also thinks it would be a mistake. He tells us: Despite the drop in inflation, I still suspect MPC members might hike. After all they have done it in the past: From my database, MPC members voted in July 2007 for a hike (to 5.75%) despite CPI inflation ‘dropping like a stone’ by recording three (!) successive falls from 3.1% in March 2007 to 2.8% in April, to 2.5% in May and to 2.4% in June 2007! But, they shouldn’t as my colleague Michael Ellington from Liverpool University and I show in a brand new paper (available here) that interest rate hikes are more powerful in reducing inflation when inflation exceeds 3%. Far from a done deal next month’s decision! However, Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, argues that the BoE should raise borrowing costs, as inflation is likely to remain above target this year. Though the impact of a weakened pound appears to be dropping out of the inflation numbers, three other factors are likely to exert an offsetting upward pressure on the pace of price increases. Productivity growth remains sluggish, with GDP rising not much above the rate of employment growth. Wage increases are also picking up - and could easily reach 3%per annum in the second half of this year. In addition, a buoyant global economy is likely to continue to push up food and energy prices, with the oil price now already above $70/barrel. “The Bank of England should not therefore treat this latest fallback in inflation as a dovish signal for interest rate policy. The MPC’s approach has normally been to look through short-term fluctuations and focus on the longer term influences on the inflation outlook. With unemployment at its lowest level since the mid-1970s, continued UK economic growth, a strong global economy, and inflation likely to remain above-target, there is still a very strong case for a rise in interest rates to 0.75% at next month’s MPC meeting.” So, next month’s Bank of England meeting - on 10th May - will be rather exciting.... There’s no inflation in London’s property market right now. Instead, house prices in the capital have fallen by 1% year-on-year -- the first annual decline since 2009 (when Britain was in recession). This makes London the only region where house prices have dropped in the last year; on average, UK house prices rose by 4.4% in the year to February. The Office for National Statistics blames the decline on the increase on stamp duty on more expensive houses, and the long-running affordability challenge with buying a house in London. It says: This is the lowest annual growth in London since September 2009, when it was negative 3.2%. London has shown a general slowdown in its annual growth rate since mid-2016. The second-lowest annual growth was in Yorkshire and The Humber, where prices increased by 3.1% in the year to February 2018. At £472,000, the average London house price is more than double the UK average (£225,000). Inflation across the eurozone has risen, but by less than expected. Figures just released by Eurostat show that prices in the euro area rose by 1.3% per year last month. That’s up from February’s 1.1%, but weaker than expected (‘flash data’ suggested a rise of 1.4%, closer to the ECB’s target of almost 2%). Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, is urging the Bank of England not to raise borrowing costs next month: “Wages are still worth less than before the financial crisis, leaving many working people struggling to get by. A hike in interest rates is the last thing they need, and the fall in inflation shows the Bank of England should hold off. Tej Parikh, Senior Economist at the Institute of Directors, says the drop in inflation could spur growth in the UK economy: “Today’s figures show a significant drop in inflation, and it is expected to continue to fall over the course of this year. This will be welcomed by the business community who have seen high inflation act as a major speed bump on economic growth ever since the beginning of last year. The drop in inflation will also offer much-needed breathing space for households who have been wedged between weak wage growth and rising price levels, which in turn will hopefully bolster consumer confidence and sales activity. The drop in Britain’s inflation rate is welcome news for UK households. Many have suffered a cost of living squeeze, as wages failed to keep pace with the cost of living for the last year. Philip Smeaton, chief investment officer at wealth manager Sanlam UK, points out that the jump in inflation last year forced many people deeper into debt: “With inflation falling back towards the Bank of England’s 2% target and wage growth overtaking inflation for the first time in over a year, it finally looks like the squeeze on living is easing. These positive signs of a strengthening economy could be all the Bank of England needs to pull the interest rate lever in May – moving policy back towards monetary normalisation. However, the MPC should consider what impact this could have on consumer debt. Since the shock vote to leave the EU, consumers have continued to spend despite immense pressure on their pockets – meaning they have likely accumulated debt. Should too much pressure be applied through higher interest rates this could impact consumers ability to spend, which is a vital element of the UK economy.” Alistair Wilson, Head of Retail Platform Strategy at Zurich, points out that savers have also found times tough: “While households can breathe a sigh of relief thanks to another easing of inflationary pressures, family disposable income remains squeezed, particularly after the news that disposable income has fallen for the first time in six years. Even with the inevitable rate rise, it’s clear that more needs to be done to help make what little savings people can afford to put away, go that bit further. This is the first time since summer 2015 that Britain’s inflation rate has fallen for two months running. The inflationary impact of the pound’s slump, after the EU referendum, seems to be fading. Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, explains: “CPI is at its lowest in a year and March’s decline is the 2nd consecutive month of weaker price rises – we haven’t seen that since August – September 2015. The majority of the slip is courtesy of the continual pricing out of the devaluation of sterling post the EU referendum, lower clothing prices as well as idiosyncratic changes courtesy of the rescheduling of the Budget until Autumn.” The absence of new ‘sin taxes’ on booze and cigarettes this spring helped to keep inflation down (because the government has moved the annual Budget statement to the autumn). Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the Office for National Statistics, says: “Inflation fell to its lowest rate in a year, with women’s clothing prices rising slower than usual for this time of year. “Alcohol and tobacco also helped ease inflation pressures, with tobacco duty rises linked to the Budget not appearing this March, thanks to its new autumn billing. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, says the drop in inflation undermines the case for raising UK interest rates next month: The TUC agrees: The pound is sliding, as the City of London reacts to March’s unexpectedly weak inflation figures. Sterling has dropped by three quarters of a cent against the US dollar to $1.42. Tat shows that traders think a May interest rate rise is now less likely. If inflation is falling back towards the Bank of England’s 2% target, then the central bank might decide to leave borrowing costs unchanged. NEWSFLASH: Britain’s inflation rate has fallen to 2.5%, a one-year low. That’s down from 2.7% in February, and another sign that the cost of living crisis is easing, given that wages are currently rising at 2.8%. The Office for National Statistics says: The largest downward contribution to the change in the rate between February 2018 and March 2018 came from prices for clothing and footwear rising by less than they did a year ago, with the effect coming mainly from a range of items of women’s clothing. Price movements for alcoholic drinks and tobacco also made a downward contribution to the change in the rate; this in part reflects changes to the Budget cycle that were introduced in 2017, with tax changes for tobacco being announced in November 2017 instead of March 2018. More to follow! The Unite union are demanding answers from De La Rue, following its decision not to appeal over the UK passport contract. Here’s Tony Burke, Unite’s assistant general secretary. After a strong run, European car sales have suffered their biggest fall in five years. New car registrations across the EU fell by 5.2% in March, new figures show, driven by drops in the UK, Germany and Italy. Industry body ACEA, which compiled the data, warns: “Momentum is starting to slow in some markets and especially in the United Kingdom.” It could be another sign that growth in the eurozone economy is slowing, after a strong 2017. Bloomberg says: Auto sales dropped in March at eight of the 10 top-selling carmaking groups, with the steepest declines at Ford Motor Co., Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, BMW AG and Nissan Motor Co. A planned merger to create Britain’s biggest property company has been abandoned, in the face of UK retail gloom. Hammerson, which owns Bicester Village and Birmingham’s Bullring, has ditched its takeover of smaller rival INTU, which owns a string of shopping centres around the UK. Hammerson walked away after concluding that the deal was too risky, given the weakness in the UK retail sector at present. It says: The Board of Hammerson reassessed the proposed acquisition of Intu in light of updated information on current market dynamics in the UK. Over the last five months, the financial strength of retailers and other tenants in the UK has softened and a number of retailers have entered into administrations or CVAs, while consumer confidence has also remained subdued. It’s an embarrassing u-turn for the company, which really ought to have spotted such problems in its own sector. But given the recent collapse of Toys R Us and Maplin, and profit warnings at Debenhams and Mothercare, it also feels like the right decision. Shares in Hammerson have risen by almost 3% this morning, while Intu have slumped almost 6%. There are red faces at banknote printer De La Rue this morning, as it counts the cost of the ‘Brexit blue passport’ farrago. De La Rue has abandoned its attempt to appeal against the decision to award the contract to print Britain’s new passports to French-Dutch rival Gemalto. In an unscheduled announcement to the City, De La Rue hit shareholders with a profits warning - the second in a month - and revealed it is taking a £4m hit on the UK passport contract. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: The company, which also makes the new polymer bank notes, warned that underlying operating profit was now expected to be in low to mid £60m range for the year to 31 March. It followed a profits warning less than month ago, when De La Rue predicted profits of between £71m and £73m. The firm said the lower profits expectation reflected “the write off of the [about] £4m bid costs related to the UK passport tender and delays in the shipment of certain contracts in the last week of the period”. Shares in De La Rue have fallen 5% in early trading. Today’s UK inflation report could send traders racing to buy, or sell, the British pound. It all depend whether the data make an early interest rate rise more likely, as Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at ADS Securities, explains: Inflation in Britain is one of the key data investors and traders are following as it relates to how fast and aggressively the Bank of England will hike rates. We know that the BoE want to raise their key interest rate levels during their next two meetings but the actual timing of the move is still under debate. The pound’s price action largely depends on when market participants believe the British central bank will pull the trigger and the pace of inflation is key in gauging when this will be. The pound is trading at $1.429 this morning - a weak inflation report could send it sliding to $1.425, Anthis says. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the global economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Inflation is centre-stage today as we find out how the cost of living changed in the UK and the eurozone last month. Britain’s consumer prices index is tipped to come in around 2.7% in March, matching February’s reading and away from January’s 3% peak. If so, that would confirm that the cost of living squeeze is easing - yesterday we learned that UK wages rose by 2.8% in the last quarter. The data may also influence the chances of the Bank of England raising interest rates next month, which has already driven the pound to 22-month highs yesterday. Royal Bank of Canada’s analysts predict that inflation might actually drop to 2.6% today, given the recent easing in petrol prices. They add: The recently announced price increases by British Gas, of 5.5% for both gas and electricity, don’t take effect until the end of May so won’t have any impact on the forthcoming release, however, in the second half of 2018, factoring in this utility bill hike will add an estimated 0.05-0.1ppts to annual CPI rates. It remains to be seen whether other energy providers follow British Gas, but in any case it reaffirms expectations that inflation will remain above the 2% target into 2019. Inflation is rather lower in the eurozone, of course. The annual euro area consumer prices index is expected to remain at 1.4% for March, although prices probably picked up during the month. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: Today’s inflation data from the eurozone could show signs of a pickup having been lacklustre for the past year. Whilst CPI is forecast to be 1.4% on an annualised basis, on a monthly basis an uptick to 1% from 0.2% is forecast. Weak eurozone inflation is great for consumers in the region, of course, but it could also make it harder for the European Central Bank to end its massive money-printing Quantitative Easing stimulus programme this autumn. The International Monetary Fund’s Spring Meeting is continuing in Washington; two new reports on the state of the global economy will be released later. Plus, the Bank of Canada is setting interest rates today; it’s likely to leave borrowing costs unchanged at 1.25%.

In September last year the Wall Street Journal headlined a story: “Meet New Zealand’s Justin Trudeau – except she’s more like Trump on immigration.” In an interview with America’s NBC television Ardern said the story was completely off the mark. “That infuriated me, it infuriated me,” she said. “We are a party who were at that time campaigning to double our refugee quota. We are a nation built on immigration. I am only a third-generation New Zealander. “The suggestion in any way that New Zealand wasn’t an open, outward-facing country – the suggestion that I was leading something that was counter to that value – made me extremely angry.” The NBC interview said the partnership between Ardern and her conservative deputy prime minister, Winston Peters, was equivalent to the US politicians Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz teaming up to govern. Ardern’s Labour Coalition government has promised to slash immigration by 20,000 to 30,000 people during its three-year term, with a focus on international students who come to New Zealand on student visas to study at low-quality institutions and then stay on in the country. The government also plans to introduce stricter criteria for which New Zealand companies recruit employees from overseas, in an effort to encourage businesses to hire locals first. Record high levels of immigration to New Zealand have put pressure on roads, infrastructure and the housing market, said Labour, and taking a “breather” would allow the country to catch up in these areas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/26/trump-plan-epa-lead-drinking-water-crisis-flint","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T10:00:14Z","webTitle":"Trump plan to tackle lead in drinking water criticized as 'empty exercise'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/26/trump-plan-epa-lead-drinking-water-crisis-flint","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/26/trump-plan-epa-lead-drinking-water-crisis-flint","fields":{"headline":"Trump plan to tackle lead in drinking water criticized as 'empty exercise'","bodyText":"Donald Trump has overseen an onslaught against environmental regulations while insisting, in the wake of the Flint lead crisis, that he would ensure “crystal-clean water” for Americans. The federal government says it is currently drawing up a new plan to tackle lead contamination, which the Environmental Protection Agency says will be unveiled in June. Public details of the plans are, however, scant. And some sources inside the EPA, speaking to the Guardian anonymously, said they were skeptical about whether what was being developed could meet such a challenge. “It’s a fig leaf,” one source claimed. Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the EPA, which is spearheading the new strategy, has vowed to eliminate lead from drinking water and banish the specter of Flint. Wednesday this week was the fourth anniversary of the decision to switch the Michigan city’s water supply to the Flint river, without lead corrosion controls, prompting the public health crisis. In February, Pruitt met fellow Trump cabinet members, including Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, and Ben Carson, the housing and urban development secretary, and other agencies to tout a new approach for a presidential taskforce aimed at reducing lead exposure in children. “I really believe that we can eradicate lead from our drinking supply within a decade,” said Pruitt, who has touted a “back-to-basics approach” that has steered the EPA towards toxic clean-ups and away from challenges such as climate change. The agency’s administrator warned the “mental-acuity levels of our children are being impacted adversely” by lead and called for a coordinated approach to ensure the disaster in Flint is not replicated. One of the few concrete proposals put forward by Pruitt is to replace the millions of lead lines that funnel drinking water to Americans’ homes, a process that could cost about $45bn. A recent EPA analysis of the nation’s water utilities found that nearly half a trillion dollars of investment is required to restore crumbling drinking water systems and ensure lead and other pollutants don’t endanger the public. Some agency staff, while pleased that the administration is raising the profile of lead poisoning, described the new plan as threadbare and muddled. “Everyone was running around talking about a war on lead, but there was no conversation about how it will work, which is typical of this administration,” said one senior EPA official. “The lead problem is huge and multifaceted and they are just making it up as they go along,” the source said. Asked about progress of the plan, this week an EPA spokeswoman declined to discuss details but said: “The 17 federal agencies that comprise the president’s taskforce on environmental health risks and safety risks to children is developing a new federal strategy to address childhood lead exposure and expects the strategy to be finalized and made public in mid-June.” Pruitt has, according to staff sources, used meetings to demand a “single standard” for lead, which has caused confusion as the EPA has an actionable level of 15 parts per billion in water samples, although the agency and other health bodies concur there is no safe limit of lead exposure. The Flint disaster came about after the city switched its drinking water supply to the Flint river on 25 April 2014 but then failed to add proper controls to prevent lead, a known neurotoxin, leeching from pipes and joints into the water. Lead levels in children’s blood soared and a further dozen people died from a legionnaire’s outbreak linked to the lead contamination. A total of 15 people have been charged by the Michigan attorney general over the disaster. Nationally, the risk of a similar outcome is vast – about 18 million Americans are served by 5,300 water systems that have violated the EPA’s lead and copper rule by, among other things, failing to properly test water for lead or neglecting to adequately treat systems to avoid lead contamination. Many cities, as the Guardian revealed, have used techniques known to mask the true level of lead in drinking water. Lead can also be present in soil and paint, particularly in older buildings. Lead line replacement – which Pruitt has backed – would provide an overdue upgrade on a huge tangle of ageing underground pipes, many of which were installed in the wake of the civil war. But experts have warned that tearing up lead lines, even if funding could be found, could exacerbate the problem by dislodging lead during replacement work. Utilities only have jurisdiction over pipes up to the curbside, with residents potentially either unwilling or unable to afford to pay for their share of pipe replacement. “It can be incredibly expensive to replace lines but also complicated because so much pipe is privately owned,” said Maura Allaire, a water resources expert at the University of California. “The other problem is we don’t even know where the lead service lines are. You could spend a ton of money and make the problem worse. There are smarter ways of doing things rather than hodge-podge lead-line replacements.” Allaire said the EPA could demand improvements to lead corrosion treatments and tighten up a unusual patchwork testing regime that relies on individual utilities to get volunteer homeowners to test their own water. Another glaring problem is the EPA’s lack of data on what the vast range of water utilities, some servicing just a few hundred people, are doing. Other uncertainties abound. Trump’s vision of repealing two federal rules for any new regulation enacted could dampen any enthusiasm for introducing new standards. And Pruitt’s own future as EPA head remains unclear because of a series of controversies over his use of taxpayer money for first-class flights, office furniture and personal security. “I think this is likely to be an empty exercise,” said a former EPA water official, who declined to be named. “Pruitt needs a fig leaf to suggest he’s doing something protective of the environment and has landed on eradicating lead. It wouldn’t surprise me if we got to the end of the administration and there’s no significant change to the rules.” Tim Epp, a lawyer with no prior experience in dealing with lead in water, has been handed the role within the EPA of coordinating the new plan. That move, along with the administration’s previous attempt to slash funding for lead clean-ups, has led to some cynicism about the new strategy within and outside the EPA. But staff insist that any effort to address the issue is worthwhile. “It could’ve been handled better but it’s good it’s out there, it can build momentum,” said an EPA source. “Everyone in the building wants to work on lead, we all want progress on this. No one gives a shit about dissenting with the administration over this. If it’s lead, we’re all in.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/17/san-francisco-electric-scooter-schemes-backlash-cease-desist","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T23:25:17Z","webTitle":"San Francisco's scooter war: city hits back as 'unlawful' schemes flood streets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/17/san-francisco-electric-scooter-schemes-backlash-cease-desist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/17/san-francisco-electric-scooter-schemes-backlash-cease-desist","fields":{"headline":"San Francisco's scooter war: city hits back as 'unlawful' schemes flood streets","bodyText":"Some people are tossing the scooters into trash cans and lakes. Others are tripping over them on the sidewalk, complaining of broken toes and dangerous collisions. The San Francisco war over electric scooters – which several startups have dumped on to sidewalks in a competitive rush to launch unregulated rental programs – dramatically escalated on Monday when the city attorney sent cease-and-desist letters, warning that authorities would “impound” the motorized devices to stop the “dangerous” and “unlawful operation”. The battle has made international headlines and sparked hyperbolic statements from the companies, some implying that the regulatory efforts ran counter to a democratic process. In San Francisco, the scooters have become the latest target in debates over public space, inequality and tech-induced gentrification. The makers of the stand-up scooters say they are providing a transportation alternative that is vital to combating climate change. However, critics have slammed the un-permitted rollout as yet another brazen maneuver from startups breaking the law and snubbing regulators under the guise of “innovation”. “They are just coming off as a bunch of spoiled brats,” said Aaron Peskin, a San Francisco supervisor who pushed legislation on Tuesday to create a regulatory permitting program for scooters. “They have harkened back to the bad old days of tech arrogance … of petulant children who think they can have whatever they want without any government oversight.” The scooters of companies like LimeBike, Bird and Spin are dockless and available for rent through an app, resembling popular bike-share initiatives, allowing users to do short trips. And similar to the cycling programs, the shiny, colorful scooters have for some become symbols of the inequitable tech economy – products designed to attract wealthier newcomers to neighborhoods that were once working class. Roberto Hernandez, a lifelong resident of the Mission, a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood, said he was surprised to see the scooters appear one day and that he had since seen children bump into them and a woman in a wheelchair struggle to maneuver around them. “This is for white techies,” added Hernandez, co-founder of a group called Our Mission No Eviction. “I don’t know one Latino that knows anything about this.” The backlash is reminiscent of the fight over robots in San Francisco, where lawmakers have cracked down on the automated delivery machines that have increasingly roamed the sidewalks. Companies have marketed the technology as a futuristic and efficient system, but pedestrian groups and disability rights advocates have resisted, some lambasting the robots as “aggressively entrepreneurial wet dreams”. The scooter firms also appear to be borrowing from the playbook of some of the most powerful “sharing economy” firms, such as Airbnb and Uber, which have repeatedly clashed with cities like San Francisco by ignoring traditional regulations and claiming “disruption”. Rebecca Kaplan, a councilmember in Oakland, where the new scooters have also faced criticisms and vandalism, compared the current debate to California’s historical battles over marijuana legislation. The city is believed to be the first in the country to have licensed medical pot dispensaries – and Kaplan said she was pushing a similar approach with scooters. “The answer isn’t to ban them, but to regulate them and have them be responsible.” Opponents of the regulatory efforts have argued that new laws could stifle an important mode of transportation in a region that is supposed to be dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on cars. But Jane Kim, a San Francisco supervisor co-sponsoring the regulatory proposal, said she was not opposed to the overall concept: “Honestly, it looks fun. I don’t have any problems with alternative forms of transportation … I don’t see what the issue is with having rules.” Kim said her office had fielded repeated complaints about tipped-over scooters blocking sidewalks. Another major complaint is that users are frequently riding on the sidewalk, which is illegal and dangerous, said Cathy DeLuca, a policy and program director with Walk SF, a not-for-profit organization. “People who live here and who struggle to live here are tired of being used as a testing ground without regard for the consequences on everyday folks who are just trying to get around the city.” A spokesperson for Bird, Kenneth Baer, said in a statement that since the company’s San Francisco launch a few weeks ago, users had logged more than 90,000 miles, “which shows that there is great demand for new, environmentally friendly ways to get around this great city”. Bird is also taking action to suspend or deactivate users who violate rules and pledged to give $1 per vehicle per day to support bike lanes, street work and “safe riding”. A Spin spokesperson said the company proactively reached out to city officials before deploying and said it supports the legislation. LimeBike did not respond to a request for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/18/uk-weather-england-hottest-day-of-year-so-far","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T07:08:52Z","webTitle":"UK weather: England set for hottest day of the year so far","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/18/uk-weather-england-hottest-day-of-year-so-far","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/18/uk-weather-england-hottest-day-of-year-so-far","fields":{"headline":"UK weather: England set for hottest day of the year so far","bodyText":"The “beast from the east” will seem like a distant memory in parts of England as temperatures soar on what is expected to be the hottest day of the year so far.

But amid the projections for GDP growth the IMF delivers not only some warnings about the risks ahead, but also a slap to governments around the world who are now seeing the chickens of decades of policy that has driven inequality coming home to roost. Gone are the days of the pessimistic IMF world economic outlook reports that seemed like conversations at an emo-economists convention. Just two years ago the April 2016 outlook was titled “Too Slow for Too Long”, but the latest outlook released this week is much more upbeat – “Cyclical Upswing, Structural Change”. And there has certainly been an upswing. Whereas in 2016 the world economy grew by just 3.2% – the slowest since the GFC year of 2009, in 2017 the IMF estimates the world’s GDP grew by 3.8% – the fastest since 2011: The big strength came from the advanced economies of Europe, the USA and Japan, while China’s steadily slowing growth improved to 6.9% - the first time growth had increased since 2011. The really good news has been the US – the stimulus from the tax cuts, which look set to massively increase the US government’s budget deficit, has seen the IMF over the past year increase its estimate of growth for 2017 and 2018. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday A year ago the IMF was projecting the US economy would grow by 2.5% over the following 12 months. It then revised that figure down to 2.3% in the October 2017 outlook, before increasing it in January to 2.7%. Now it projects growth of 2.9%: For Australia, the IMF sees growth much in line with that projected by the treasury and RBA (not surprising given they use these projections as a guide) and has the economy set to grow at 3% this calendar year – which is roughly what it has been estimating would be the case for the past five years. Our unemployment rate is projected to continue to fall from its current level. The IMF however is less optimistic now about how quickly it will fall. A year ago the IMF projected Australia’s unemployment rate in 2019 would average 4.97%, whereas the current estimate remains in line with its projections of October last year of 5.16% and that it will only get to 4.97% in 2020. What has changed since October is that rather than continue to fall in 2021 and 2022, the IMF now believes it will remain at that 4.97% level: The IMF’s projections are rather more optimistic than those of either last year’s budget or the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook issues in December. The Myefo has our unemployment rate in 2019-20 falling only to 5.25%. It will be interesting to see if these more optimistic figures are reflected in the projections in next month’s budget: But the IMF is rather hesitant to remain optimistic. The IMF’s economic counsellor and director of the research department, Maurice Obstfeld, told the media that “the present good times will not last for long”, which rather begs the response of, “wait, these are the good times?!” One reason the IMF sees bad news ahead is that the US tax cuts which have provided some stimulus are unfunded, and thus there will need to be some severe spending cuts in the coming years. Trump’s economic plan is essentially the equivalent of a party host passing around the tequila bottle at a party and telling everyone they’re having so much fun now that they won’t get a hangover tomorrow. The IMF also throws into the ring the issue of Trump’s trade wars, suggesting that “an escalating cycle of trade restrictions and retaliation is another risk”. And Trump is not exactly someone who has shown himself able to mitigate risk. But the problems are more structural than just a Trump presidency. The IMF notes that “in advanced economies, aging populations and lower projected advances in total factor productivity will make it hard to return to the pre-crisis pace for the average household’s income growth”. Certainly GDP per capita is suggested to slow across the major economies – including Australia: Here the IMF hands out a well-deserved slap to governments (and to be honest, itself, given its own policies prescriptions of the past 30 years). The outlook suggests that one of the risks ahead is that following from the GFC there are higher debt levels and “widespread public scepticism about policymakers’ capacity and willingness to generate robust and inclusive growth”. It argues that “diminished prospects for household income growth in advanced economies, coupled with trends of higher polarisation in jobs and incomes, have fuelled a widespread political backlash hostile to traditional political modalities”. Or in other words – when you spend 30 years telling everyone we need greater labour market flexibility, greater international competitiveness, and you find households incomes don’t grow, don’t be surprised if voters start getting antsy when you suggest more of the same. It’s not that all the economics policies of the past 30 years have failed to deliver – the problem is what they failed to consider – that growth needs to be inclusive, not geared towards the top end. And yet here the IMF remains hostage to its own history. In its most recent review of Australia’s economy, it noted approvingly plans to cut the company tax rate. And yet such a policy is hardly inclusive and merely continues the trend since 1980 which has seen the richest 1% in this county go from holding 4.5% of national income to more than 9%. The IMF notes that “ scepticism will only be reinforced – with negative political consequences down the road – if economic policy does not rise to the challenge of enacting reforms and building fiscal buffers”. I would suggest that means being willing to note that the race to the bottom of the company tax rates is not the way to improve things, lest you wish to continue calling a period of flat household income growth “the good times”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/18/us-syria-arab-force-replace-american-troops-saudi-arabia-egypt-uae","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T18:35:46Z","webTitle":"Syria: proposal to replace US troops with Arab force comes with grave risks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/18/us-syria-arab-force-replace-american-troops-saudi-arabia-egypt-uae","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/18/us-syria-arab-force-replace-american-troops-saudi-arabia-egypt-uae","fields":{"headline":"Syria: proposal to replace US troops with Arab force comes with grave risks","bodyText":"The Trump administration is renewing an effort to replace US troops in Syria with an Arab force, but the proposal faces substantial obstacles and could potentially exacerbate the conflict. The Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said his government was talking to Washington about raising such a force, confirming a report in the Wall Street Journal that said the new US national security adviser, John Bolton, had called the Egyptian intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel, to ask Cairo to play a part in building one. There are about 2,000 US troops in Syria fighting Islamic State, but Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed a desire to withdraw them. The idea of an Arab coalition force playing a role in Syria to combat extremist groups and contain Iranian influence has surfaced several times since 2015, but faces severe problems. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are bogged down in a brutal war in Yemen, and have little manpower and few military resources to spare. They are also locked in a dispute with Qatar, another potential contributor to a force, while Egypt is much closer to the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria than its would-be Gulf partners. Middle East experts said it was feasible Arab states could fund an army run by private contractors and possibly help recruit soldiers from developing countries such as Sudan. Erik Prince, a Trump ally who founded the military contractor Blackwater USA and now advises the UAE, is lobbying to play a role, according to the Wall Street Journal. A similar offer he made last year to replace US troops with private contractors in Afghanistan was turned down by the Pentagon. But Prince may have more traction in the White House over Syria. Bolton has argued that the US has taken too much of the military burden in Syria and Arab states should supply troops and material assistance in the fight against Isis. Meanwhile, the Saudi monarchy and its regional allies are uneasy that events on the ground in Syria are being dictated by external powers, none of which are Arab. Emile Hokayem, the senior fellow for Middle East security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said: “The idea of an Arab expeditionary force emerges every couple of years, and it’s always seen as a politically brilliant idea to create a sense of ownership in the region. “In reality, the politics of putting a force like that together are almost impossible. “The question is: have the Saudis consulted the other countries before speaking on their behalf? The Saudis thought Egypt and Pakistan would come to help Yemen and they didn’t.” The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has launched an Islamic military counter-terrorism coalition, which held its first high-level meeting last year, but it has not appeared to be intended for combat. Charles Lister, the director of the extremism and counter-terrorism programme at the Middle East Institute (MEI), attended the inaugural conference and said the force was intended for training and assistance programmes, rather than combat operations. Lister said there was “no precedent” for an Arab expeditionary force in Syria. “It sounds like the Saudis are continuing to align themselves with President Trump and not speaking the 100% truth about their intent,” he said. Any Saudi troops deployed to Syria would find themselves directly confronting Iranian fighters and their allies, which could prompt a dangerous escalation in the conflict. Randa Slim, who directs the back-channel Track II diplomacy programme at MEI said: “It is one thing for the Saudis to pay for other ‘Islamic forces’ to do the job, and a totally different thing to send their men to a conflict theatre where they are bound to enter into direct confrontation with an entrenched Iranian-Hezbollah force. “The other factor to consider is: what is Turkey’s response to this proposal? I do not see Ankara welcoming the positions of Egyptian and/or Emirati forces on its border,” Slim said. The Obama administration also looked at the possibility of Arab allies deploying counter-terrorist forces against Isis in Syria, but Saudi Arabia and the UAE were drawn into the battle for Yemen against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. Nicholas Heras, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said: “They preferred to send intelligence officers and money, rather than put troops on the ground. “But for the Saudis, the trouble is their territory is being breached by Houthis every day. It doesn’t make sense for them to shift their ground forces when they have trouble securing their own border.” Heras said it was more likely Saudi Arabia would seek to outsource recruitment to countries such as Pakistan and Sudan. “I’m sure the Saudis are up for fighting in Syria to the very last Sudanese soldier,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/18/attack-of-the-giant-tumbleweed-california-town-swamped-in-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T03:28:55Z","webTitle":"Attack of the giant tumbleweed: California town swamped in invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/18/attack-of-the-giant-tumbleweed-california-town-swamped-in-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/18/attack-of-the-giant-tumbleweed-california-town-swamped-in-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Attack of the giant tumbleweed: California town swamped in invasion","bodyText":"They struck Victorville with little warning, rolling and tumbling up streets, barrelling past cars, virtually burying homes and prompting calls to 911 about a mass invasion. No, not Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, but the tumbleweeds that took over the California desert town this week did evoke the 1978 film and cult horror pastiche. Heavy winds sent thousands of tumbleweeds into Victorville on Monday in what some residents called an invasion, with the prickly intruders blanketing yards and piling up outside homes. “It was just too much... they were just coming and coming,” Ralph Zavale told ABC7. “It’s an invasion, definitely,” said Tanya Speight. “Normally you get a few flying down the street or whatnot but never this many. It’s never been this bad.” Nav Mangat told the network one of her neighbors was trapped for two hours until work crews could remove the pileup from his front doorway and garage. “There was like a hundred of these bushes. They were just flowing like it was a tornado yesterday,” Mangat said. A city spokeswoman estimated 100 to 150 homes were affected. Victorville, a high desert community north-east of Los Angeles, is routinely buffeted by the weeds. However 60mph winds unleashed an unusually big swarm on Monday, prompting surreal scenes posted on social media. “Attack of the Killer Tomatoes sequel,” one commenter tweeted. “Mother Earth is not happy,” said another. The San Bernardino county fire department and a company called Burrtec Waste Industries helped crews from Victorville’s public works, code enforcement and community services division to purge the tumbleweeds on Tuesday. “The primary goal is to clear the front of the houses, to remove the tumbleweeds in order to allow residents safe access to their homes,” Sue Jones, a city spokeswoman, told the Daily Press. “With the winds as strong as they are, as soon as they clear certain areas, more tumbleweeds are blowing right back in.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/19/50-a-week-wage-rise-would-create-up-to-87000-jobs-unions-say","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T18:00:31Z","webTitle":"$50-a-week wage rise would create up to 87,000 jobs, unions say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/19/50-a-week-wage-rise-would-create-up-to-87000-jobs-unions-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/19/50-a-week-wage-rise-would-create-up-to-87000-jobs-unions-say","fields":{"headline":"$50-a-week wage rise would create up to 87,000 jobs, unions say","bodyText":"A $50-a-week increase to the minimum wage would create up to 87,000 jobs in the first two years, unions have claimed in new economic modelling. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has made the submission to the Fair Work Commission, which is considering its claim for a uniform 7.2% increase to the minimum and award wages to take effect from 1 July. Unions have argued that low-paid workers spend most of their extra income, meaning an increase to the minimum wage would boost aggregate demand and create jobs. When the commission asked for an estimate of how many jobs the pay increase could create, the ACTU responded that – using estimates of low-income households’ spending in the government’s submissions – the number would be 50,000 to 57,000 in the first year and 30,000 in the second year. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Using a second method with figures from the Treasury’s budget papers, the model predicted a 40,000-job increase in the first year and 27,000 in the next year. Both models calculate the total increase in wages for different types of households, find the amount they are likely to spend and uses that to estimate the number of jobs created. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, said the modelling showed “pay rises will create jobs and move our economy forward”. “The Turnbull government and the business lobby are trying to keep wages down by running a scare campaign against higher wages,” she said. “That’s the same discredited, untruthful, damaging trickle-down economics this government loves to roll out.” In its 2017 minimum wage decision, the Fair Work Commission concluded, based on international research, that “modest and regular wage increases” do not add to unemployment. As a result, the ACTU modelling assumes there will be no decrease in jobs due to the increased price of labour. In a negative sign for employer groups who have asked for a minimum wage rise of 1.9% or less, the commission also concluded that those studies suggest “that the panel’s past assessment of what constitutes a ‘modest’ increase may have been overly cautious, in terms of its assessed disemployment effects. “We are also of the view that minimum and award wage increases would likely lead to some positive, but probably small, effect on consumer demand and this needs to be taken into account.” In its reply submissions the Australian Industry Group called the ACTU claim for a $50-a-week increase “manifestly excessive and completely unrealistic”. “Such an increase would inflict significant harm on businesses,” it said. “As a consequence, significant harm would be inflicted on low-paid workers, the unemployed and the underemployed, because their job security and employment prospects would be substantially reduced.” The Australian Industry Group also disputed the ACTU’s jobs claims, arguing that when businesses have to pay more in wages it reduces spending and investment by employers and subtracts from aggregate demand. Employers may offer fewer hours to workers as a result of minimum wage rises, another drag on the claimed increased income and spending, it said. In its reply submissions the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that aggregated household consumption was best encouraged not by “regulated wage growth” but rather “policies that promote greater workforce participation, employment growth and a low unemployment rate”. The Turnbull government has made a submission giving evidence about the state of the economy but has not nominated its preferred minimum wage level."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/17/north-korea-trump-kim-jong-un-meetings","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T06:21:15Z","webTitle":"North Korea: Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong-un over Easter, Trump confirms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/17/north-korea-trump-kim-jong-un-meetings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/17/north-korea-trump-kim-jong-un-meetings","fields":{"headline":"North Korea: Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong-un over Easter, Trump confirms","bodyText":"Mike Pompeo, the director of the CIA, had a secret meeting with Kim Jong-un in North Korea over Easter as part of an effort to lay the groundwork for direct talks between Donald Trump and Kim. The US president confirmed the meeting early on Wednesday morning, tweeting: On Tuesday night two people with direct knowledge of the trip told the Washington Post that Pompeo met the North Korean leader over Easter while other outlets including the Associated Press news agency carried reports saying the visit was confirmed to them by US officials. The mission came soon after Pompeo was nominated to be secretary of state. It is the highest level meeting between the two countries since 2000, when then secretary of state Madeleine Albright met Kim Jong-il, Kim’s father, in Pyongyang. It also marks the first time the previously reclusive Kim Jong-un has met a senior western official. The New York Times also reported Pompeo’s secret trip to North Korea over the Easter holiday, which fell this year at the end of March and beginning of April. A few hours before the Washington Post report was published, Trump told the press about an unspecified high-level meeting. “We have ... started talking to North Korea directly. We have had direct talks at very high levels, extremely high levels, with North Korea. And I truly believe there is a a lot of good will. A lot of things are happening. Good things are happening,” Trump said at a meeting with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe at his Florida resort of Mar-a-Lago. “We’ll see what happens. Because it’s the end result that counts, not the fact that we’re thinking about having a meeting.” Trump added that his planned summit with Kim could be “in early June or a little before” and that five possible venues are being discussed. But he conceded it was possible that the unprecedented meeting might not happen at all. “It’s possible things won’t go well and we won’t have the meetings, and we’ll just continue to go along this very strong path that we’ve taken,” the president said. “But we will see what happens.” Trump also said he gave his “blessing” to North and South Korea, whose presidents are due to meet on 27 April, to declare a formal end to the Korean conflict. Three years of fighting ended in an armistice in July 1953, but there was never a formal peace agreement. Last week, after his reported meeting with Kim Jong-un, Pompeo discussed North Korea at his confirmation hearing for the secretary of state post before the Senate foreign relations committee. “I’m optimistic that the United States government can set the conditions for that appropriately so that the president and the North Korean leader can have that conversation [that] will set us down the course of achieving a diplomatic outcome that America so desperately — America and the world so desperately need,” Pompeo said. Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the New America thinktank who has led back-channel diplomatic initiatives with the North Korean, called the news of the Pompeo visit “stunning”. “Just weeks out from the proposed Trump-KJU summit, we had better be engaged in direct talks in preparation,” DiMaggio said in a tweet. “And all the better if some interactions are face-to-face – this is the only way to set the groundwork for sustained, productive talks/negotiations.” The key question at any summit between Trump and Kim Jong-un is whether the North Korean leader is serious about dismantling his regime’s nuclear weapons and missiles programme and what he would demand from the US in return. There has never been a summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, though Bill Clinton came close to agreeing to meet Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, at the end of Clinton’s spell in office in late 2000. Referring to the coming summit between Kim Jong-un and his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in, Trump said he backed efforts to bring a formal end to the conflict that broke out 68 years ago. “They do have my blessing to discuss the end to the war,” he said. “People don’t realise the Korean war has not ended. It’s going on right now. And they are discussing an end to the war. So, subject to a deal, they would certainly have my blessing.” Abraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for East Asia, said on Twitter: “A peace treaty has been in the mix as part of a deal with North Korea for decades ... The North will likely seek a peace treaty in the early stages of a negotiation, arguing that they cannot denuclearize until the war has officially ended. However, US will likely want a peace treaty to be concluded toward the end of the process.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/16/readytogo-rift-timing-indyref2-scottish-independence-yes-movement","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T12:01:11Z","webTitle":"#Readytogo?

Rift over timing of indyref2 marks a turning point for yes movement","bodyText":"As the three candidates vying to replace Angus Robertson as Scottish National party deputy leader appear at crowded hustings events across the country, one question is dominating the debate: when should the party leader and first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, call another independence referendum? It’s a question made all the more acute after the Scottish parliament set itself on a constitutional collision course with Westminster on Tuesday afternoon, when it voted decisively to reject the UK government’s EU withdrawal bill. If Theresa May imposes the bill’s post-Brexit power-sharing plans on Scotland, overturning 20 years of precedent, then Sturgeon’s calls for a second independence referendum are unarguably bolstered. But polling consistently shows a majority across the country opposed both to independence and to holding another vote in the near future. While Scotland’s constitutional divide remains entrenched, a more recent breach has emerged among independence activists over the timing of a second referendum. In recent months, there have been public skirmishes about whether Sturgeon should deploy the mandate for a new referendum that she claims from the 2016 Holyrood elections before the parliamentary term ends in 2021, or delay until an unarguable economic case for independence has been built and public opinion is more favourable. With two out of three deputy leadership candidates calling for a vote before 2021, the ballot – the results of which will be announced at the SNP conference next month – is expected to provide a clear indication of where the party’s mass membership of more than 118,000 stands on this critical question, and how willing they will be to wait if the party leadership dismisses their growing sense of urgency. This was evident this month when more than 40,000 supporters of Scottish independence thronged the streets of Glasgow, brandishing saltires, “Still Yes” placards and the occasional unicorn, in the largest public demonstration in the city since the rally against the Iraq war in 2003. The organiser of the march, All Under One Banner, was calling for a second vote to be held before 2021, which marks the end of the Brexit transition period and the next Holyrood elections. Three years and eight months after Scotland’s momentous referendum, the appetite for energetic displays of solidarity like this one is undiminished among independence supporters. All three deputy leadership candidates attended and continue to answer questions about referendum timing at local hustings. Julie Hepburn, a favourite among activists, wants a second vote “at the earliest possible opportunity”; councillor Chris McEleny is hoping for another referendum within 18 months, while Keith Brown, cabinet secretary for the economy, jobs and fair work and the most senior contender, is more circumspect, stressing the importance of campaign readiness whenever another referendum called. But, in contrast to the marchers’ #readytogo hashtag, a number of senior SNP figures have cautioned against an early poll. When Pete Wishart, the SNP’s longest-serving MP, did so last month, his pragmatism was met with outrage in some quarters of the yes movement, who denounced him on social media as “an Etonian boot-licker”. “There’s no question that we are at a turning point in the yes movement,” says Robin McAlpine, the head of Scotland’s only grassroots-funded thinktank, Common Weal, and veteran independence campaigner. “The fractiousness was always coming. There’s no more dangerous move than marching your troops back down the hill again, because they are fizzing with adrenalin and have nowhere to put it.” Sturgeon’s call in March 2017 for a second independence referendum before the start of the Brexit transition resulted in an unexpectedly fierce backlash at the general election in June. With about one-third of SNP voters backing Brexit in 2016, even those in favour of independence questioned the wisdom of linking Scotland’s future so closely to the EU. “I know very few experienced political figures in Scotland who support ‘go now’ [for another referendum], and I suspect the ones who do are playing to the crowd,” says McAlpine. “Meanwhile, the membership are getting more restless. The assumption that the SNP have a secret plan that is so brilliant they don’t want to reveal it is in decline, and the sense that the leadership are actually a bit directionless is growing.” A more complex picture emerges from local yes groups, many of which continue to organise within their communities regardless of top-tier politicking. Among the grassroots activists that the Guardian has spoken to, the preference remains for Sturgeon to exercise her mandate in this parliamentary term. Yes Linton – based in the Westminster constituency of the Scottish secretary, David Mundell – is one of the newest groups, having formed in January. Its founding member, Ian Reid, says: “People have a real political and strategic intelligence. The next referendum is discussed, but it’s not the only show in town.” Julian Smith is convener of Yes Dunfermline, which has met almost monthly since September 2014. “There is a clamour [for an immediate vote] from the very vociferous minority,” he says, “but there is a much more pragmatic approach among most people I have dealings with. We don’t have people standing up at our meetings saying we must have independence tomorrow.” Mary McGlashan, of Yes Inverclyde, says: “The point is we are poised to go into action should the Brexit scenario determine the need for a second indyref, and we are making sure we have the skills to run a successful campaign.” Residents of Inverclyde opted to remain in the UK by 50.1% to 49.9% – the narrowest margin in Scotland. “There are those who like the marches and the demos but on the whole we believe we are still in a preparatory phase and it is hard work and intelligent planning that matter.” Activists are also united in their determination to educate themselves in the arguments necessary to win over no voters, accessing a vast network of sympathetic experts who are willing to give talks at local meetings, from pro-independence organisations that have continued post-referendum, such as Commonweal, Business for Scotland, or the Nordic expert Lesley Riddoch. Another Scotland-wide organisation that has reinvented itself as a broader campaign group is Women for Independence. With 55 affiliated groups, WFI has successfully opposed the building of a women’s super-prison, founded uniform banks for families struggling to clothe their children, and conducted groundbreaking research on period poverty. Margaret Young, the national convenor for WFI, says: “Because we’ve been involved in our local communities, mixing with people with different political perspectives who care about the same things, it gives us the chance to chat [about independence] with far more credibility.” Jonathan Shafi, co-founder of the left-aligned Radical Independence Campaign, expects there will be “a significant demoralisation” if there is no second referendum within the next few years. He also points out that much of the debate is based on the false assumption that it is entirely within Sturgeon’s gift to call a new vote. “They are missing out the reaction of the British state, and I think they will reject it, as May did before [in March 2017].” McAlpine believes the yes movement faces another threat with more long-lasting consequences than a public split over the timing of another referendum. “The bigger risk is drift: when it becomes clear that Sturgeon is not calling another referendum the small risk is a screaming fit, and then the media will eviscerate us for being split. But the bigger risk is that everyone will find new things to do. You can only heal wounds when the people are still in the room.” • This article was amended on 21 May 2018 because an earlier version referred to Nordic Horizons as a pro-independence organisation.

All were victims of the 1954-89 regime of Alfredo Stroessner, which jailed, raped, tortured and “disappeared” opponents under the auspices of a US-backed anti-communist crusade. For Goiburú, the mission is personal. His father, Agustín Goiburú, is still missing. “All human beings have the right to mourn, to know where their loved one is,” he said. “And I include myself.” But his search also carries new political resonance. On Sunday, Mario Abdo Benítez, 46 – the son of Stroessner’s private secretary – is on course to be elected president. After Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Chile, Paraguay is the latest country in the region to pivot rightwards. It has less far to go than some. The current president, Horacio Cartes – like Abdo Benítez a member of the Stroessner’s Colorado party – has placed former functionaries of the dictatorship in key ministries and called the general’s birthday “a happy date”. But the rise of “Marito” – championed by the church and a rural Colorado base disgruntled with Cartes’s liberal economics – is a painful reminder of how little Paraguay has reckoned with its past. Abdo Benítez has called for the enforcement of obligatory military service – another Stroessner legacy – and promised to fill all public positions with Colorado faithful. “Even though he was a kid at the time, he defends that era,” said Guillermina Kanonikoff, a former leftwing guerrilla whose husband, Mario Schaerer, was tortured to death by the regime. “He doesn’t have to carry the sin of his father,” she added. “But he never asked for forgiveness, or showed shame ... he’s creating the platform for a dictatorship.” According to Rosa Palau – custodian of the supreme court’s Museum of Justice – Paraguay’s lingering culture of fear has stopped people coming forward with information about dictatorship-era crimes. “While Stroessner left,” she added, “the authoritarianism continues.” Many older Paraguayans – particularly those with links to the military – remember the dictatorship as a time of prosperity. At a Colorado rally in Asunción two weeks before the election, Abdo Benítez defended the example of his father and the Colorado legacy. “It’s the party that has built this country,” he said. “He’s going to win by far. He’s a holy, clean, hardworking young man,” said a retiree who gave her name as María Luisa. “My husband worked for 15 years in the security services,” she added. “I’m a Stronista through and through.” Abdo Benítez will take a strongly conservative line on abortion (Paraguay forbids the termination of pregnancy in practically all cases), LGBT rights and gender equality, said Andrew Nickson, a Paraguay expert at the University of Birmingham. He added that Abdo Benítez’s father had never been personally linked to human rights abuses. “He was a crook and a sycophant but that’s about all,” Nickson said. Abdo Benítez’s advisors emphasise his commitment to Paraguay’s institutions and record as a senator of building consensus across party lines. “I think he’s demonstrated on many opportunities his democratic credentials,” said one. “He has always mentioned the shortcomings of the dictatorship,” the adviser added, suggesting that Paraguay’s young society – nearly 60% of the population was born after 1989 – now had the necessary “antibodies” to resist any democratic backsliding. The dwindling number of activists who remember authoritarian rule are also counting on a new generation. “There are many young people who aren’t afraid because they didn’t live through the repression of the dictatorship,” said Goiburú. He hopes that Abdo Benítez will honour a pledge to maintain funding for the search for desaparecidos. “I always say: I’m looking for Dad, but I’m looking for everyone,” he explained. “And while my strength lasts and blood runs through my veins I’ll do it.” Excavating human remains did not scare him, he added. “You have to be afraid of those who are alive, not the dead.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/apr/17/pound-brexit-high-uk-pay-wages-inflation-unemployment-rate-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T15:15:15Z","webTitle":"Britain's cost of living squeeze eases; IMF blasts Trump's trade tariffs - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/apr/17/pound-brexit-high-uk-pay-wages-inflation-unemployment-rate-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/apr/17/pound-brexit-high-uk-pay-wages-inflation-unemployment-rate-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Britain's cost of living squeeze eases; IMF blasts Trump's trade tariffs - as it happened","bodyText":"Time for a quick recap. Britain’s workers have received their first inflation-beating pay rise in a year. Wages rose by 2.8% per year in the three months to February, meaning they narrowly overtook inflation. In a solid set of data, the UK unemployment rate hit a new 42-year low of 4.2% and the employment rate climbed to a record high. But.... workers are still around £800 per year poorer than before the financial crisis, and real wage growth is likely to remain modest this year. Economists have also predicted that rising wages make a UK interest rate rise next month more likely. This helped to push the pound up to a new 22-month high this morning. Although it has dipped since, it is close to its highest point since June 2016 (before the EU referendum). The International Monetary Fund has sounded the alarm over rising protectionism in the global economy. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF also predicted that global growth will be solid this year and next, but it also sees a slowdown further ahead. World stock markets have gained ground today, thanks to strong financial results from Netflix and Goldman Sachs - and the absence of fresh geopolitical tensions. That’s probably all for today... The IMF’s warning about trade wars hasn’t spooked the financial markets. Over in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average has gained 209 points, or 0.85%, to 24,782. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq indices are also enjoying gains, as investors shrug off the Fund’s worries about looming problems in the global economy. Instead, Wall Street has been cheered by forecast-beating results from Netflix last night, and both Goldman Sachs and Johnson &amp; Johnson today. Why do the IMF’s long-term forecasts suggest Britain might outperform some EU members, despite Brexit? Maurice Obsfeld says the Fund is using a rather optimistic model for Brexit, in which no new tariffs are imposed between the UK and the European Union and there is broad equivalency between the two sides. This best-case scenario assumes that both sides aim for an agreement n their own interests. So, “if all goes well...things do not look so bad” for the UK economy, Obsfeld said. But, there will still be losses compared to staying in the EU, he adds. Chris Giles of the FT points out that the IMF’s World Economic Outlook is rather more positive than Maurice Obstfeld’s gloomy statement today. Is that because recent economic data, and spiralling trade tensions, mean the report is already out of date? Obstfeld agrees that some “high frequency data” that suggests slowing economic growth has been released in recent weeks, since the report was completed. That includes various Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) reports, which have fallen back from recent highs. The IMF is taking questions on its World Economic Outlook now. Our economics editor Larry Elliott asks the Fund what it wants creditor nations (such as Germany and China) to do to help tackle trade imbalances. Maurice Obstfeld replies that Germany has the ability to spend more on infrastructure, and also boost private investment - measures that would close its trade surplus. On the other side of the coin, America should be more concerned about the sustainability of its public finances (the annual budget deficit could hit a staggering $1 trillion in 2020). Some reaction to the IMF’s report: The IMF has upgraded its forecast for UK growth by 0.1% this year to 1.6%, from 1.5% last October. But growth in 2019 has been lowered by 0.1% to 1.5%. That would see Britain lag behind the eurozone, which is expected to grow by 2.4% this year and 2% in 2019. The IMF has also warned America against triggering a trade war with China. In an unusually forthright comment, Maurice Obstfeld said the recent tariffs pushed through by Donald Trump will push America deeper into the red: He says: “These initiatives will do little… to change the multilateral or overall US external current account deficit, which owes primarily to a level of aggregate US spending that continues to exceed total income. “Recent US fiscal measures will actually widen the US current account deficit. NEWSFLASH: The International Monetary Fund has warned that the world’s trade system is in peril, as the showdown between America and China over tariffs threatens to boil over. The warning comes in the IMF’s latest assessment of the global economy, which is being released in Washington now. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF’s economic counsellor, singled out the dangers of protectionism, saying: The first shots in a potential trade war have now been fired.” “The multilateral rules-based trade system that evolved after world war two and that nurtured unprecedented growth in the world economy needs strengthening. Instead, it is in danger of being torn apart.” Obstfeld also took aim at populism, saying: “The renewed popularity of nationalistic policies is another after-effect of the financial crisis and its prolonged aftermath.” But despite these concerns, the IMF expects the global economy to grow by 3.9% in 2018 and 2019 -- 0.2 percentage points higher than six months ago. Here’s our news story on today’s labour market figures: Confusingly, there’s some disagreement over whether Britain’s cost of living squeeze has actually ended. It all depends which inflation measure you choose -- the benchmark Consumer Price Index (CPI), or CPIH, which includes housing costs. Then there’s the choice between basic pay, and total pay (including bonuses). Fortunately, today’s figures both came in at +2.8% for February. Once you’ve cleared that hurdle, there’s the question of whether to take the most recent monthly inflation figure, or the average of the last three months. The Office for National Statistics favours CPIH, which was 2.7% in December and January and 2.5% in February - comfortably below February’s wage growth. Thus, the ONS says that real wages are rising. But the Treasury prefers to use the average of CPI over the last three months - which, at 2.9%, is still slightly above nominal earnings. That’s why we’ve not heard the government celebrating the end of the pay squeeze. The media, though, are generally taking February’s CPI reading (2.7%) and declaring that real wages are back (just!). Over in the eurozone, German investor confidence has tumbled into negative territory. The German economic sentiment index, calculated by research institute ZEW, has slumped to -8.2 this month, from +5.1 in March. That’s the lowest reading since November 2012, when the eurozone crisis was hurting confidence. ZEW blamed the decline on fears of a global trade war, and recent data showing that German exports and production output have both fallen sharply earlier this year. Carsten Brzeski of ING called today’s ZEW reading a “disastrous outcome”, which bolsters fears that Germany’s growth is slowing. He added: The German economy had a start to forget in the first two months of the year. In fact, while the weakening of soft data could still be labelled as a levelling off from record highs, hard data in Germany and the entire Eurozone have clearly disappointed. At least in Germany, it would require a strong rebound in March to prevent an unexpected weak first quarter. Nevertheless, there are good reasons to blame exceptional factors like the weather, the timing of vacation and the flu for weaker economic activity in the first two months. Sound fundamentals still bode well for growth in the coming months. Let’s also not forget that up to now, trade tensions are noise for the economic outlook and central banks, rather than hard reality. Here’s Margaret Greenwood MP, Labour’s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, on today’s jobs data: “After nearly eight years of austerity, average wages are still lower than they were before the financial crash a decade ago. It is shameful that over 4 million children are growing up in poverty. “While we welcome that there are more people in work, these figures mask serious inequalities in the labour market, including the employment gap faced by women, disabled people and BAME groups who have too often borne the brunt of austerity cuts. “A Labour government will make tackling poverty an immediate priority with a real Living Wage of £10 per hour by 2020, an end to the public sector pay cap and urgent reforms to the government’s deeply flawed Universal Credit programme.” With unemployment at a 42-year low, many firms are struggling to fill vacant positions. Today’s labour market report shows there were 815,000 job vacancies in the last quarter, which is 44,000 more than for a year ago. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg is hopeful that this gives workers the upper hand in wage negotiations (despite the IoD’s misgivings). He writes~: Accelerating wage growth, low and stabilising unemployment – the UK seems to be approaching full employment. Employment gains are slowing despite record high labour demand. Instead, wage growth is edging up nicely as the degree of mismatch between the skills of the remaining workers and the skills demanded by firms increases. With inflation expected to fall back towards 2% this year (from 2.7% in February) Pickering reckons real weekly earnings growth can rise towards 1.0% by the end of the 2018. The pound has slipped back from the 22-month high struck this morning, and is now down 0.2% against the US dollar at $1.4319. That’s a little surprising, given this morning’s pick-up in basic pay. It may reflect the fact that total pay (including bonuses) only rise by 2.8% -- weaker than the 3% expected. Anthony Gillham, Old Mutual Wealth’s head of multi-asset, points out that wage growth is still rather anaemic - leaving some households vulnerable to an interest rate rise: “Although symbolic, wage growth is still only marginally above the rate of inflation and the 2.8% increase has actually come in under expectations. This relatively sluggish wage growth is despite unemployment falling to its lowest level in over 40 years. It is somewhat disappointing that wage growth hasn’t come through more powerfully given that there is really very little room for unemployment to fall any further. “Although wage growth does strengthen the outlook for the UK fractionally, it does not change the fact that over the long-term consumers have still seen real pay suffer since the financial crisis. And it is worth bearing in mind that with increased minimum pension contribution rates coming into effect this month, disposable income may even come down. The Institute of Directors has poured a little cold water over today’s data, by warning that bosses will struggle to keep raising workers’ pay. The IoD’s senior economist, Tej Parikh, says the worst of the pay squeeze seems to be over - but questions whether the “forward momentum” on hiring and wage growth can be sustained. With skilled labour in short supply, productivity - long the bugbear of the UK economy - is crucial, Parikh explains: Many employers are already straining to fill vacancies due to chronic labour shortages, which have been compounded in a number of sectors, including social care and hospitality, by the notable drop in the number of migrants coming to the UK. “A further pick-up in salaries will also be restrained by the limited ability of SMEs – which employ 60 percent of the workforce – to compete for a shrinking pool of labour. As such, small business owners will need greater support in managing regulatory costs and raising their productivity if wage growth is to become a long-lasting facet of our economy.” Via Resolution Foundation, here’s confirmation that real pay (wage increases minus inflation) is rising fastest in the financial world but still shrinking in the public sector, and beyond.... The small boost from the pick-up in wages could be wiped out for many borrowers if the Bank of England raises interest rates. Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, says people should tackle their spending before the next rate hike lands: “Now isn’t the time to start splashing the cash, you should make hay while the sun shines and keep control of your spending. Create a budget and make sure you aren’t spending any more than you need too. Spend 30 minutes looking at where you could make savings, from switching where you do your weekly shop to changing your energy supplier. Half an hour of research and admin could save you hundreds, if not thousands a year.” This chart shows how wages have caught up with inflation, after around a year of falling real pay: And this one shows how the jobless rate is the lowest since Harold Wilson’s premiership: Britain’s unions have welcomed the news that workers’ pay has finally caught up with rising prices - but warned that earnings are still too weak: TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady says the government must do more: Unions have negotiated pay rises for workers across the UK, from the counters at McDonald’s to the factory floor at Ford. “But wage growth is still weak. Workers are £14 a week worse off than they were in 2007 – with pay packets not expected to return to their pre-crisis level until 2025. “This is why tens of thousands of people will march through London on Saturday 12 May as part of the TUC’s ‘A New Deal for Working People’ demonstration. “The government must get the economy working again for working people. Ministers need to increase the minimum wage to £10 an hour, fund a proper pay rise for all public servants, and give workers stronger rights to negotiate fair pay deals.” (That 0.2% figure is based on CPIH - a measure of inflation including housing costs. If you use the Consumer Prices Index, real wages are up by 0.1%). Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Esther McVey, has hailed the news that Britain’s employment rate has hit a new all-time high. She says: “Another milestone for employment has been reached under this Government as employment reaches a record high, up 3.2 million since 2010 - the 16th time the employment record has been broken in the same period. “That means on average, over 1,000 people have moved into work every day since 2010, and credit has to be given to the businesses who have created those jobs and the individuals who are taking those opportunities. This chart, from today’s labour market report, shows how the employment rate has climbed to 75.4%: Tara Sinclair of George Washington University tweets: All this talk of pay rises may have a hollow ring in Britain’s public sector, where the government’s austerity programme has kept wage growth pinned on the mat for several years. The Resolution Foundation points out that pay is not rising uniformly across the UK - instead, those in the City have been enjoying inflation-busting pay rises for a while: Real pay (adjusted for inflation) has been rising by almost 2.8 per cent for those in finance for the past year, and 1.5 per cent for those in construction, yet the squeeze continues in the public sector. Stephen Clarke, Senior Economic Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, adds: “Today’s figures confirm that Britain passed an important living standards milestone in early 2018 as its 12-month pay squeeze finally ended. Wages should continue to strengthen over the course of the year as inflation falls back. “It’s good to see pay finally back in positive territory, but Britain has a lot of ground to make up after an awful decade of pay squeezes, stagnation and all too fleeting recoveries. On average, people are still taking home less than they did before the crisis. My colleague Richard Partington points out that falling inflation, rather than bumper pay rises, is behind the pick-up in real wages: That’s because the slump in the pound since the EU referendum has now largely passed through the economic system, especially given sterling’s recent rally. Geraint Johnes, research director at the Work Foundation and Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, says the UK jobs market is “gradually returning to a healthy state”. He adds: These trends seem to confirm that the labour market is gradually returning to a more stable state following a period in which many workers took on gig employment as a stop-gap in the aftermath of the recession.” Borrowers beware! While the pick-up in wages is welcome, it could also prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75% next month. Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, explains: “For the first time in more than a year, British workers are not feeling progressively poorer month by month.... Wage growth has been the missing piece of the puzzle in Britain’s long, slow recovery from the financial crisis. With the final piece now in place the Bank of England now has the catalyst to be able to follow through on its plans to raise interest rates at the next MPC meeting in May and start the move back towards monetary normality. Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, says the real wage squeeze on the average UK worker is coming to an end (and not before time!). While most of this improvement has been due to a collapse in inflation – something that should be shown to have continued tomorrow – businesses are paying higher wages as the labour market in the UK tightens. Unemployment is currently at its lowest level since the mid-1970s and hopefully, that will propel higher wages for months to come. As we have noted before, real wage gains are the silver bullet for the UK economy. Real wage growth is significant because it relies on optimistic employers being happy with business conditions, it allows consumers to re-balance spending figures from credit uptake and it promotes growth in generalised output with a central bank more comfortable to normalise monetary policy.” In another boost, Britain’s unemployment rate has hit a new 42-year low of just 4.2%, as more people find jobs. Today’s labour market report shows that there are now 32.26 million people in work, 427,000 more than a year ago. The number of people classed as unemployed has dropped by 136,000 over the last year, and now stands at 1.42 million. And the employment rate has hit 75.4%, the highest since records began in 1971. Basic pay in the UK is now rising at its fastest rate since August 2015, as this chart from the ONS shows: Pay including bonuses also rose by 2.8% over the last quarter. That’s weaker than the 3% which economists expected, but is still just ahead of February’s inflation rate (we get March’s figures tomorrow). BREAKING: Pay increases in the UK have finally overtaken inflation, after a year-long wage squeeze. Basic earnings rose by 2.8% per year in the three months to February, new figures from the Office for National Statistic show. That means they rose a little faster than inflation, which dipped to 2.7% in February. This is the first time in around a year that wages have risen faster than the cost of living - and means real wages are now rising by 0.1%. That’s a small but important step towards ending the cost of living squeeze. The Office for National Statistics says: Latest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in real terms (that is, adjusted for price inflation) increased by 0.2% excluding bonuses, and by 0.1% including bonuses, compared with a year earlier. More to follow.... You can get up to speed on the UK labour market with these tweets from economist Rupert Seggins: Just over 15 minutes to go until the UK labour market report is released, and tension is growing in the City. Viraj Patel, FX strategist at ING, says: “It seems that we’re back to good old-fashioned U.K. data watching to determine the short-term direction for the currency. A 3% wage growth print in today’s U.K. jobs report should seal the deal for a May BOE hike.” The pound is continuing to strengthen, and just touched a new 22-month high of $1.4376 against the US dollar. Sterling had now risen for eight trading days in a row, as the City braces for UK interest rates to rise in May. It may also show that worries over a ‘hard Brexit’ are easing. Speaking of China....Beijing has hit back at America after Donald Trump accused it of currency manipulation. A China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman told reporters that information coming out of United States regarding the Chinese currency is “a bit chaotic”, following the president’s comments on Twitter. Here’s the tweet in question: This is part of Trump’s long-running claim that other countries are cheating America by keeping their currencies too low. But.... one could argue that Trump is actually guilty of currency manipulation, as his wilder moves can prompt traders to sell the dollar: As Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale puts it: What matters now is the nervousness induced by both President Trump’s late-cycle fiscal largesse and his twitter feed. Yesterday’s observation that Russian and China are playing the currency devaluation game was an eyebrow-raiser. Overnight, China reported that its economy grew by 6.8% in the first three months of this year. That broadly matched estimates, calming worries that the Chinese economy might be cooling. However, separate date showed that industrial output missed expectations and company investment has slowed. European stock markets have risen in early trading, taking their cue from Wall Street which rallied yesterday. Royal Bank of Canada are also eagerly awaiting today’s UK labour market report. They say: It is expected that the unemployment rate holds at 4.3% for what would be the seventh month in the last eight. Of most interest though is likely to be the news on average earnings growth. The including-bonus measure looks as though it could hit 2.9% 3m/y from 2.8% 3m/y, and if the ex-bonus measure reaches 2.8% 3m/y, as expected, then it will be the highest rate since August 2015 and help reinforce the case for a May Bank Rate hike Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group predicts that the today’s UK jobs report could drive the pound higher - if wages have indeed picked up in recent weeks: Traders are looking optimistically towards today’s UK jobs data, with expectations that it will support a Spring rate rise by the central bank [Bank of England]. Whilst UK unemployment is forecast to remain constant at 4.3%, average earnings are forecast to hit 3% in the three months to February. Given that inflation was 2.7% in February we could start to finally see the pressure of falling wages in real terms ease for the UK consumer. A strong reading could pile the pressure on the BoE to hike rates as good inflationary pressures pick up, potentially pushing GBP/USD to $1.45. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After a year of pain, Britain’s cost of living squeeze could finally be easing. New earnings figures released this morning are expected to show that pay has overtaken inflation, for the first time since last spring. Economists predicts that average basic pay grew by 2.8% per year in the three months to February. Chuck in bonuses too, and pay packets may have grown by up to 3%. That would overtake inflation, which dropped to 2.7% in February, meaning pay packets are no longer being totally eroded by the cost of living. This would be welcome news for hard-pressed households....and would also raise the chances that the Bank of England hikes interest rates next month. The pound has already reacted, by hitting a 22-month high this morning. At $1.4360, sterling is its strongest against the US dollar since the Brexit vote of June 2016. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: It has already been established that a significant number of Bank of England policymakers are expecting wages to start outstripping headline inflation in the coming months, and today’s average earnings number for the three months to February, could well be the first sign post on the way to that becoming a reality. The jobs data may also show that Britain’s unemployment rate has stuck at just 4.3%, a 42-year low. Also coming up today... The International Monetary Fund will release its latest assessment of the global economy, as its Spring Meeting gets underway in Washington. Investors will also be watching the situation in the Middle East closely, following last weekend’s strikes in Syria. Any signs that the situation is escalating could hit stocks: On the corporate front, Associated British Foods has reported a pick-up of sales at its Primark operation. It adds: Primark performed well with profit growth of 4% achieved against a backdrop of unseasonable weather in Europe and a margin decline following the adverse effect of currency on purchases. High street retailer JD Sports has also defied the high street gloom, by reporting a 24% increase in profits for the last year. Drinks retailer Majestic Wine has announced a new growth strategy. It is planning to invest up to £12m to win new customers - which will make a dent in its short-term profits: Here’s the agenda: 9.30am BST: UK labour market report 10am BST: The ZEW institute publishes its survey of German economic sentiment 2pm BST: IMF releases its World Economic Outlook"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
