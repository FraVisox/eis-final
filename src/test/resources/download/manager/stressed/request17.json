The body of a 12-metre, 20-tonne humpback whale that washed up on a Nobbys Beach on Sunday was buried there by local authorities as “an option of last resort” after strong winds and a retreating tide prevented them from towing it back out to sea. The whale had dragged a fishing trap more than 1,700 kilometres from Tasmania before it became beached. But the decision to bury the whale outraged residents in the town, who fear that leachate from the animal will find its way into the water and attract sharks. The belief that whale burials are linked to shark sightings is popular among surfers but has never been tested. Beaches in the town have been closed since the animal was buried and the New South Wales Department of Industry said there had been between one and four sharks detected at Port Macquarie since Sunday. On Wednesday night the owner of a local surf school, Corey Enfield, presented a petition to the local council signed by more than 3,000 people calling for the whale to be dug up. The shark was buried at a beach not traditionally used for swimming, which is about 500 metres from a popular surf beach where Enfield operates. A popular beach holiday destination, he said Port Macquarie residents had been “dumbfounded” by the decision. “I don’t want to use the word anger but I was very frustrated, I felt like my business was being threatened,” he said. But there may be a silver lining. After Wednesday’s meeting the council issued a statement confirming that it would investigate options to dig up the animal. “We know an operation to recover the 20-tonne whale carcass from a geographically inaccessible beach and dispose of it in another location is going to be a significant challenge but we recognise the need to address the community’s concerns,” said Craig Swift McNair, general manager of Port Macquarie-Hastings Council. There are still no details about what the council will do with the whale once it has been exhumed. Last year Prof Isaac Santos from Southern Cross University received funding from the NSW government to begin a three-year study figuring out whether sharks are attracted to whale burial sites. “We often have members of the community making claims that whales buried in the sand attract sharks to the surf but there is no scientific information to back that up,” Santos said. “We really have no idea whether the whales on the beach attract sharks and we’re trying to figure out what is happening there.” Santos and his team of researchers plan to begin measuring the decomposition plume from whale carcasses and using the size and make-up of the plume to determine the level of pollution associated with it. “We are looking at pollution from carcasses in the form of nutrients and changes in carbon chemistry – basically the oils coming out of the whale and how long they stay in the beach,” he said. He then plans to use lab experiments to measure how juvenile sharks respond to that same material. James Tucker, a researcher in Santos’ team, said there were about 10 large whale strandings each year in NSW. “They are relatively frequent and are increasing as whale the population is increasing,” he said. “It’s important to note that that is actually a really positive sign for whale populations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2017/sep/20/the-white-houses-private-jet-problem","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T21:43:12Z","webTitle":"The White House’s private jet problem | The minute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/sep/20/the-white-houses-private-jet-problem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2017/sep/20/the-white-houses-private-jet-problem","fields":{"headline":"The White House’s private jet problem","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Health secretary Tom Price’s travel itinerary last week included five charter jet flights that cost taxpayers an estimated $60,000, Politico reported – and apparently it wasn’t an unusual week.

Her heroin-addicted father could explode in violence, sometimes beating her and her seven younger sisters. Afterwards, he was always regretful – and Trinity would come home from school to find a refrigerator filled with cakes and pies. “From that point, I think, is when I equated food with comfort and food as a way of making things right,” she says. Not surprisingly, Wallace-Ellis, now 39 and a successful foster care system consultant in California, has long struggled with her weight. Her emotional and intellectual resilience has made her a much-sought-after speaker, but her childhood still takes a toll on her health. Today, she has high blood pressure and diabetes. At times, she has weighed more than 400lb. If policymakers want to fight obesity successfully, they’re going to have to reckon with stories like hers. Although some of her experiences are extreme, the underlying psychology and physiology are not. This suggests caution about enacting policies – like soda taxes – that view certain foods as addictive drugs. A recent review of the research in the area, which included data from six countries, including Mexico and India, found that soda taxes do indeed reduce soda consumption. However, they also prompt substitution – typically fruit juices or milk. While these do have more nutritional value, they do not have fewer calories so it is unlikely that they will have long-term effects on weight. The bottom line: without addressing why people overeat, obesity can’t be fought effectively. And, though it is not clear precisely what proportion of obesity is linked to trauma – or to the uncontrollable stresses associated with poverty – the correlations here are strong and parallel those seen in other addictions. In Wallace-Ellis’s case, trauma permeated her childhood. Her parents split up when she was six, her stepfather drowned her two-year-old sister in a bathtub when she was nine, and then her mother abandoned the surviving girls. Neglect and sexual abuse were common experiences at home and later in some foster homes, where she and her sisters were sent. “I learned early on that I was safer as the fat sister than one of the skinny ones,” she says. “They didn’t want the fat sister. It didn’t protect me in all instances but I think it protected me in a lot of instances.” Researchers have only recently begun to understand how early life stress affects adult health. Understanding how her childhood altered her stress system and led her to seek solace in food helped Wallace-Ellis begin to recover. She only became able to change her diet once she learned to stop blaming herself for physiological changes that are a common result of traumatic experience, she says. For researchers, an important piece of this puzzle began to fall into place with the publication of the Adverse Childhood Experiences studies, starting in the 1990s. The research began when the researcher Vincent Felitti started to notice a link between childhood trauma and obesity in his patients, and then went on to trace the histories of thousands of patients. An “adverse childhood experience” – or ACE, as it has come to be known – was defined as repeated emotional, physical or sexual abuse, or witnessing domestic violence and other traumas. Emotional and physical neglect were added later as additional categories. Wallace-Ellis experienced every single part of this taxonomy. Sadly, the research found that these experiences add up: the more types of trauma a child faces, the greater the effects on health. Further, living in poverty magnifies these risks in many ways: there’s a higher risk of parental incarceration, less access to treatment for addiction and other mental illness, and fewer resources to reduce adult stress and minimize the odds of abuse. Like Wallace-Ellis, many of the study participants described overeating as having benefits – like comfort and protection from sexual abuse. Seeing bingeing as irrational and driven merely by “addiction” had obscured these problems. Indeed, this is part of why our current narrative about sugar is too simple, whether it comes from Michelle Obama or from a billionaire like the former New York city mayor Michael Bloomberg. Sweets are among the few pleasures that almost anyone can afford; and research suggests that sugar may directly relieve stress, though there are certainly healthier methods. But the problematic physiology of childhood trauma isn’t just self-inflicted by self-medication with sugar or other salves. Physical changes in the brain caused by early life stress can themselves increase blood pressure and inflammation – and consequently, risk of cardiovascular disease. Unfortunately, those at risk are frequently unaware of this, and self-blame increases shame and drives binges. “You binge in secret because then it’s almost like the same cycle that any other addict goes through,” says Wallace-Ellis. “You say you’re going to do better. You’re not going to do it and then you get triggered and something happens and then you want to go and eat and then you feel shame and disappointment for not following through on what you said you were going to do, and then you think you’re disappointing someone so then you do it in private.” Meanwhile, policies like soda taxes, which focus overwhelmingly on cutting supply, don’t account for the fact that people seeking relief don’t stop needing it if you make it harder to get. Matthew Harding, associate professor of economics at the University of California Irvine, has studied how prices affect consumer behavior. In a study published earlier this year that examined data on 123m supermarket transactions, he and his colleagues simulated the effects of various types of taxes. He found that, not surprisingly, if the price of one type of food rises, people will often shift to a cheaper substitute. However, certain products are less responsive to price changes, he says: it takes a much bigger tax to make people reject cupcakes or chips than it does to make them decide against broccoli. Harding’s work suggests that taxing sugar across all products would prove more effective than taxing just soda, in terms of improving nutrition by reducing substitution across different sugary products. His analyses also found that fat taxes could work – again, because they minimize substitution within that group. A sugar tax, however, would have the greatest impact because it is often hidden in fatty foods, too, not just sweets. And because poor people are more responsive to price, these types of taxes will have both the greatest positive and negative effects on them. In other words, they will be more likely to eat fewer sweets and gain less weight – but also experience less comfort and stress relief. “There was nothing else that could soothe me; I didn’t know how to self-soothe,” says Wallace-Ellis of her early reliance on food. These days, she has a list of alternative behaviors, like walking, that help her manage stress. She works hard to have self-compassion, which is essential to keeping shame and bingeing at bay. Appropriately specified taxes could be one tool for reducing obesity – but unless they are carefully targeted and combined with measures to help those who use food to self-medicate, they will just be cruel to their targets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/20/mark-sampson-fa-england-buck-passing-daniel-taylor","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T20:24:21Z","webTitle":"Mark Sampson departs amid a flurry of FA buck-passing and confusion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/20/mark-sampson-fa-england-buck-passing-daniel-taylor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/20/mark-sampson-fa-england-buck-passing-daniel-taylor","fields":{"headline":"Mark Sampson departs amid a flurry of FA buck-passing and confusion","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"According to Martin Glenn, the Football Association chief executive who broke the news, Mark Sampson was “calm but angry” as he found out from a fourth‑floor office at Wembley that his luck had finally run out. The summons had come the night before. Sampson arrived around midday and the formalities did not last too long once he realised that a scandal had caught up with him – just not the scandal, perhaps, that most people might have envisaged. That does not make the other allegations swirling around the now-deposed England Women’s manager any less serious or change the fact that a second crisis is running concurrently – a story featuring racism allegations, hush money and yet more evidence of systematic failure – that needs a proper ending rather than any more of the FA’s attempted spin, deflection and pulling down of shutters. The Eni Aluko affair, a story this newspaper has been driving for several weeks, is already threatening to go to the top of the FA now that a third investigation is under way and the House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee is summoning the relevant people to explain the gaping holes in the previous two inquiries. If, that is, it can still be called the Eni Aluko affair when a second player, Drew Spence, will meet the barrister Katharine Newton on Friday for an interview that should have taken place the best part of a year ago. As if Sampson does not have enough on his plate, Spence intends to corroborate Aluko’s version of events by saying she, too, was the recipient of an allegedly racial remark. Ultimately, though, Sampson has gone for something entirely different, involving a safeguarding investigation that went on for the best part of a year, a breakdown in communications within the FA structure and, it appears, some particularly dubious behaviour from his time at Bristol Academy where there are first-hand reports that some of the club’s trips were more like a coming together of stag- and hen-dos. No doubt more will come out in time but it is not going to be pretty when it involves a football manager, a number of backroom staff, a women’s team and a culture where, according to reliable evidence, some of the more sensible players became increasingly alarmed about what was deemed acceptable. Stories about Bristol Academy have been floating around for some time and a lot of them now appear to be true. For the moment, we will probably have to join the dots. “No law was broken but we felt that, during his time at Bristol, Mark had overstepped the professional boundaries between player and coach,” Glenn said. There will be some, undoubtedly, who find this all a bit convenient. Here we have the FA, in the midst of what could be an appalling race controversy, suddenly finding an entirely separate reason to get rid of the alleged offender for something that happened in his previous employment. Glenn was at pains to absolve himself of any responsibility and also said the same about Greg Clarke, the chairman. Dan Ashworth, the technical director, was the person who appointed Sampson, championed him and brought him through the system. Surely he could have stopped this? “No,” Glenn again insisted. And it was staggering how it panned out – all of the FA’s top three executives were, apparently, not to blame one bit. The fault, according to Glenn, lay further down the organisation and with a number of other people who just happen not to work for the FA any more. “Mark joined the FA at the end of 2013. A couple of months into his employment, the FA received anonymous allegations about his conduct at Bristol Academy. The FA safeguarding system clicked into gear and those safeguarding officers spent quite a bit of time, almost a year, investigating a range of issues that had been raised. They presented that to a safeguarding review panel in early 2015 and in March 2015 the panel reached a decision that, if he had some training and mentoring, he wasn’t a safeguarding risk. “The incidents being investigated were – I’m not going to give any more detail than this – inappropriate behaviour and a crossing of the boundary between coach and players. There is no evidence that has come to our eyes about anything illegal and we don’t want idiots going round his house with torches. But he had clearly stepped over the line and admitted as much. “The reason we have parted company with him was that, while the safeguarding team did their job on their specific narrow front, nobody else within the FA was alerted that what he had done was not something you would be comfortable with for an FA employee. In his [Sampson’s] eyes, he felt he had been cleared of the issue. And he had been from a safeguarding perspective. Our problem was the grown-ups in the organisation hadn’t seen the report and the full detail to make the point about employability.” In other statements Glenn appeared to hold a previous regime responsible, a time when Greg Dyke, Adrian Bevington, Sir Trevor Brooking and Alex Horne were running the organisation. Yet the bottom line here is that the FA has been employing an England manager since 2013 and in the past two and half years the organisation had been sitting on a report that has now persuaded the people at the top of the organisation the relevant person has to go. Whatever checks and references Ashworth pulled together, they were not enough. And the worst thing is that the report has been gathering dust within the FA’s offices since March 2015 – and probably still would be had it not been for Aluko’s interview with the Guardian leading to an anonymous tip-off. Why, also, did the FA decide to wait until Sampson had taken charge of the team’s 6-0 win against Russia on Tuesday before letting him know his position was “untenable”? Glenn and all the other “grown-ups within the organisation” – the kind of phrase, unfortunately, that tells you a lot about the FA – had been given the relevant information last Wednesday. Yet they were not so shocked that they decided to do anything about it straight away. Whatever Sampson has done to warrant the sack, the men in power decided it could wait a few days. The sports minister, Tracey Crouch, was being kind when she described it as a “mess” but, if nothing else, perhaps it might be easier for the relevant players from the China Cup in 2015 to give evidence about the race allegations now Sampson has gone. Spence’s allegation, to recap, is that Sampson asked her, a mixed-race player on her first England call-up, how many times she had been arrested. Three other players – Jill Scott, Izzy Christiansen and Jo Potter – were in the room at the same time and at least two of them, according to the Guardian’s information, can supply crucial evidence. Rightly or wrongly, it should be an easier process now the players in question don’t have to go against their England manager. First, though, they have to be asked and that really is one of the more bewildering and depressing parts of this story. Even now, the FA is steadfastly refusing to answer a simple question of whether the new investigation will involve Scott, Christiansen and Potter. Indeed, the FA is not even admitting it is a new investigation, as if it means losing even more face when the Professional Footballers’ Association has already described inquiry No1 as “not a genuine search for the truth” and “a sham which was not designed to establish the truth but intended to protect Mark Sampson”. Inquiry No2 – Newton’s first attempt – was called a “farce” by Aluko and has led to calls from Kick it Out and the PFA for the process to start again, with a new barrister in place. Newton began her inquiry on 15 December last year and when she interviewed Sampson he denied all the allegations, and continues to do so. The inquiry finished on 2 March and Sampson was completely exonerated, in keeping with the FA’s internal review, even though Newton said she did not dispute “the player in question [Spence] was upset about something she thought had been said”. When this newspaper started asking questions about why Spence had never been interviewed, the most staggering part, perhaps, is that the FA tried to make a genuine case that it did not know her identity and that Aluko should take the blame for that one, having “refused” to pass on who she meant. Except, of course, that was another half-truth, at best. Aluko’s evidence had told them it was a mixed-raced player, raised in south London, who played for Chelsea and was on her first camp. More than that, Newton had watched a video of the meeting where the comment allegedly took place. Spence, for the thousandth time, was the only mixed-race player in the room. Aluko and Spence both deserve the opportunity for a proper investigation but, in the meantime, how do those players feel who ran to Sampson in a choreographed goal celebration for the first goal against Russia on Tuesday and did not appear to spare a second thought about how their former team-mates – not to mention Lianne Sanderson and Anita Asante – might feel in those moments? Aluko alleges Sampson told her to be careful her Nigerian relatives did not bring the Ebola virus to Wembley and her 11-year 102-cap England career was effectively ended – a coincidence, the FA says – within two weeks of voicing her initial concerns. Yet it turns out that Sampson was the one prone to “unlioness behaviour”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/20/leader-of-gang-suspected-of-murdering-british-kayaker-in-brazil-is-killed","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T21:25:36Z","webTitle":"Leader of gang suspected of murdering British kayaker in Brazil is killed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/20/leader-of-gang-suspected-of-murdering-british-kayaker-in-brazil-is-killed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/20/leader-of-gang-suspected-of-murdering-british-kayaker-in-brazil-is-killed","fields":{"headline":"Leader of gang suspected of murdering British kayaker in Brazil is killed","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One of the leaders of the gang of river pirates who robbed and murdered a British kayaker in the Amazon has been killed, police investigating the death of Emma Kelty have said. Another man accused of being a leader in the attack, Arthur Gomes da Silva, was arrested and confessed his role, they said. Evanilson Gomes da Costa, known as Baia, 24, was shot on Tuesday night and later died of his wounds in hospital, according to a statement by one of the suspects, who said the dead man had fired shots at former primary school headteacher Emma Kelty. Later on Wednesday, police said they had arrested Arthur Gomes da Silva, known as ‘Bera’, the gang’s other leader, and that he has admitted his involvement. Kelty, 43, was canoeing alone from the source of the Amazon to the Atlantic when she went missing in the Solimões area, as the upper stretches of the river are known. The area is notorious for its pirates and drug trade. She triggered a distress signal last Wednesday, but despite an extensive search by Brazilian police and navy, her body has not yet been found. Kelty knew she was heading into a dangerous area and even joked on her Facebook about the risks she faced. Kelty is believed to have pitched her tent on Boieiro island, facing the remote community of Lauro Sodré, before she set off her locator flare last Wednesday. A suspect arrested on Monday in Codajás said Kelty was approached by two people. Five others arrived and the group stole her belongings. She was shot twice with a sawn-off shotgun, attacked with a machete and dumped in the river before the gang stole her mobile phones, money, a drone, a tablet and GoPro camera and tried to sell them, according to the suspect. Police named him on Wednesday as Jardel Pinheiro Gomes, known as Kael, and corrected his age to 19, not 17 as he had previously claimed. An unnamed 17-year-old was also arrested as well as a third man, named as Erinei Ferreira da Silva, 28. Police were hunting four further suspects, including Gomes, but learned on Wednesday that he had been hit by gunfire inside his house in Coari, a city around two hours from Lauro Sodré where Kelty is believed to have been murdered. “According to investigations, people supposedly linked to the drug trade in the area were named as responsible for the execution of the offender, who was 24. He was rescued, taken to a hospital in the municipality, but succumbed to his injuries and died around 8.30am today,” police said in a statement. Gomes was one of the leaders of the ‘Water Pirates’ or ‘Water Rats’, a gang who stole merchandise, killed people and were connected to the drug trade, the police statement said. José Barradas Júnior, chief detective in Coari, told the Guardian he believed da Costa was killed by rival gangsters for the possessions his gang had taken from Kelty and before dying named the man who shot him. Later on Wednesday police found Arthur Gomes da Silva, 28, hiding in the forest near Lauro Sodré, after an anonymous tip off to the Brazilian navy, and he has since admitted his involvement, Barradas Júnior said. Barradas Júnior said one of the investigating officers had told him that locals reported seeing Kelty pass by in her kayak hours before she was killed. They had tried to warn her of the danger she could be in and offered their houses for her to sleep in for safety, but she did not understand. “Neither she nor they could communicate. They were trying to tell her the risk she was running,” he said. He said Gomes da Costa and his accomplice Arthur Gomes da Silva, known as Beira, were two of the leaders of the Water Rats. Two other suspects are said to still at large, named as Erimar and Nilson Ferreira da Silva, both brothers of Erinei. According to the testimony, Gomes da Costa and da Silva approached Kelty’s tent and da Costa shot her with a shotgun, wounding her. When she shouted in pain, they assumed she was Peruvian and possibly carrying drugs. Barradas Júnior said: “They are used to robbing Peruvians on the river, they have already done this with other foreigners who passed there, generally strangers who carry drugs.” Wounded, yet conscious Kelty was shot again dragged to the river and attacked with a machete, Barradas Júnior said. Then, he said, “they threw her in the middle of the river, which is the deepest part”. Barradas Júnior said the authorities should warn other Britons planning to visit the Amazon to travel in organised groups, and not alone – especially in the Solimões river area, which is a major trafficking route for drugs from Peru and Colombia that are heading to Europe. On Wednesday Kelty’s brothers Piers and Giles and her sister Tash posted a tribute on her Facebook. It said: “Emma was an active and determined sister who challenged herself, latterly through her adventures on the Pacific Coast Trail, as well as in the South Pole and Amazon River. “In a world that is today a much smaller place, the explorer in our sister found herself seeking ways to prove that challenges were achievable. We are extremely proud of our sister who was dearly loved by us all and her strength will be sorely missed. We wish to give our immense thanks to the Brazilian navy, police and Foreign Office for their action and support,” they wrote, adding links to three charities Kelty had been fundraising for: Cancer Research UK, Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Teach Africa."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/21/borg-vs-mcenroes-stellan-skarsgard-ive-been-changing-diapers-for-40-years","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T15:00:21Z","webTitle":"Borg vs McEnroe’s Stellan Skarsgård: ‘I’ve been changing diapers for 40 years’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/21/borg-vs-mcenroes-stellan-skarsgard-ive-been-changing-diapers-for-40-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/21/borg-vs-mcenroes-stellan-skarsgard-ive-been-changing-diapers-for-40-years","fields":{"headline":"Borg vs McEnroe’s Stellan Skarsgård: ‘I’ve been changing diapers for 40 years’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It must be difficult to get entirely swept up in the magic of the movies when you are the man who once changed Pennywise’s nappies. This is the strange position that actor Stellan Skarsgård finds himself in, as he promotes his new film, Borg vs McEnroe, while his 27-year-old son, Bill Skarsgård, is receiving rave reviews for playing the demonic clown in a new adaptation of Stephen King’s It while his eldest son, Alexander, is about to win an Emmy for his role in Big Little Lies. “I was happy when he was doing It because he had so much fun, and that’s where the joy was really,” says Skarsgård senior, frowning thoughtfully out of the hotel room window, as if searching for the right words amid the rooftop air vents. “It’s also kind of ridiculous, all of it, isn’t it? On Sunday, Alexander goes up for the Emmy … It’s kind of silly, isn’t it?” Silly, perhaps, but also endlessly interesting. The nature of success and how it impacts our relationships – specifically “the sort of loneliness in the midst of your being the most famous person in the world” – was what first attracted Skarsgård to Borg vs McEnroe; directed by Danish documentary-turned-feature director Janus Metz Pedersen, it tells the story of the rivalry between Skarsgård’s Swedish countryman Björn Borg (Sverrir Gudnason) and the US’s John McEnroe (Shia LaBeouf), and culminates in a nail-biting showdown at the 1980 Wimbledon final. Skarsgård, who says he has zero interest in sport of any kind, says even he can remember this particular match. “At that time in Sweden we had two television channels, there was no internet, everybody watched the same things, which meant it was a pretty bizarre, welfare, social-democratic monoculture. Borg was at the very centre of that for many years.” It wasn’t just in Sweden either. International interest in the rivalry was captured by the two players’ contrasting characters. McEnroe was the hotheaded young pretender, whose eagerness to unseat the champion resulted in mid-set tantrums. Borg was a cool-headed champion; the ice to McEnroe’s fire, the gentleman to his rebel. Skarsgård plays the man credited with creating this ruthless focus, Borg’s long-term coach Lennart Bergelin. The film, which, in the Nordic region, is simply titled Borg, could perhaps be accused of taking sides, but Skarsgård finds it harder to declare himself for either Team Rebel or Team Gentleman. “I like to see myself as both. I do not always accept the conventions or the rules of society, but I’m trying to be nice to everybody. I don’t want to hurt anybody.” A gentleman rebel, then? “Yes, sort of.” As a past-his-prime Bergelin, Skarsgård provides the film with a compelling emotional centre, but he insists the competitive father-son dynamic is in no way drawn from his own relationships with his acting offspring [four of his eight children are actors]. “No, because I don’t coach. I haven’t helped them at all, I haven’t introduced them to agents or opened any doors for them.” With typically mischievous modesty, he is also keen to give the prosthetics their fair share of the credit. “First thing, I put on a bald cap and a combover and then I was pretty pleased with myself. I thought: ‘Well that’s him’, so now I don’t have to deal with the externality any more. Now, I can concentrate on my job.” That job is the same one Skarsgård has been doing for half a century now, ever since, aged 16, he became a Swedish TV star playing a lovable rascal in a show called Bombi Bitt Och Jag. After several years on stage and screen in his home country, he made the move to Hollywood, with notable roles in The Hunt for Red October (1990), Good Will Hunting (1997), Mamma Mia (2008) and as the Thor-aiding astrophysicist Erik Selvig in the Marvel universe. The culture shock continues to this day, he says. “The first time I worked in America, in one month I got more praise from the director than I had in 10 years in Sweden. That was not because I was 10 times as good.” Perhaps because of such irresolvable differences, he has always kept one of his size 12 feet in the world of European cinema, making several films with his two favourite collaborator-playmates, Norwegian director Hans Petter Moland (In Order of Disappearance and the upcoming Out Stealing Horses) and infamous provocateur Lars von Trier, with whom he has worked six times. If Skarsgård does allow any fatherly feelings into his professional life, they are reserved for his directors, whom he regards with the amused benevolence of an indulgent parent. “Most good directors, I have this feeling, had something weird about their childhood,” he says with a kind smile. “They had very little social contact when they were small. They were all sitting in their room creating fantasy worlds, and they don’t want to abandon that control. They’re all control freaks, one way or another.” And when he isn’t indulging creative minds on set? “Well, I’ve been changing diapers for 40 years,” he says. Skarsgård’s children range in age from 41 to five, and include five sons and a daughter from his first marriage, plus two sons from his current one. He sees most of them every week, provided someone is not off shooting somewhere exotic. “I mean, even if I’ve worked a lot, for around eight months a year, I’ve been at home, taking care of kids and cooking and stuff,” he says. “I cook at lot. I really love that, and it’s a very good way to make sure that your kids come home. If you cook well, they’ll come back.” Though Skarsgård is proud to typify the gender-equal Swedish ideal of co-parenting, he is even less interested in flag-waving than he is in tennis, which helps explain why Borg vs McEnroe is only his second Swedish film in 20 years. “I really despise nationalism, it’s such stupidity; but I succumb. When Sweden plays football in the World Cup – if we ever get there – then, I succumb to that. I’ve been to some big matches and it is exciting and everybody’s screaming and everything, and I think: ‘Nuremberg rally’, y’know?” Yet, for all his antipathy to the very notion of national heroes, there is something about Borg he finds utterly fascinating. It was while shooting a scene with Leo Borg, the tennis player’s real-life 14-year-old son, who plays him as a child in the film, that Skarsgård worked out what that is. “He’s a very good tennis player, but he’s never been in front of a camera before and I was thinking: ‘What is it that makes him so good at acting?’ It’s because the focus that you have to have to be a good tennis player is the same focus you have to have to be a good actor. You see in his eyes that a lot of things are burning inside his head, even if he doesn’t express anything. Film acting is very much about that.” He has been even more impressed by the “beautiful” talent of Shia LaBeouf, with whom he also co-starred in Von Trier’s Nymphomaniac, despite never having shared a scene. He disagrees that LaBeouf’s bad boy rep makes him an obvious choice to play the young McEnroe. “I totally understand the choice, but I think it’s right not because of Shia’s personality, but because of his skills … I mean he has had problems when he gets drunk, probably he can’t handle it or whatever,” he shrugs. “And that has to do with his childhood and the things that he hasn’t solved in his life. It shouldn’t cast any shadow over him as an artist. There are some artists that are assholes but are straight all the time and I despise them.” Ultimately, it’s the joy of working with interesting non-assholes that has motivated Skarsgård’s long, varied career. “Those actors make me do something I could never have invented myself,” he says. It’s what has kept him invested on set and even now, still passionately rooting for a film about a subject in which he has no particular interest. That, and the sheer relief of removing your prosthetics at the end of a long shoot. “Just sitting on the stands there with a bald cap filling with sweat. It was disgusting … I was so happy on the last day.” Borg vs McEnroe is released on Friday"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/24/almost-heaven-chinese-documentary-review-funeral-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T07:00:38Z","webTitle":"Almost Heaven review – inside China’s industry of death","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/24/almost-heaven-chinese-documentary-review-funeral-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/24/almost-heaven-chinese-documentary-review-funeral-homes","fields":{"headline":"Almost Heaven review – inside China’s industry of death","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A 17-year-old girl learns the ropes in a massive Chinese funeral home, in this slight but sporadically amusing documentary.

You could start with the 1980s, when president Barry Richardson oversaw a club he later described as “a den of iniquity”. You could start with another president, Alan Bond, who mispronounced the name of the club’s best player at the AGM. You could track back 30 years to the 1987 national draft, when the Tigers snapped up a young man named Richard Lounder at No1. Lounder was nudging 19 stone, partial to a dart and managed just four games. Back then, current CEO Brendan Gale recalls, it was a “third world” football club. They couldn’t afford weights. They certainly couldn’t afford players. If not for the Save Our Skins campaign, the bank would have foreclosed. If your glass is half full, you could start with the good times, those periods when the beast would stir. 1995, in particular, was a rollicking year, culminating in a come-from-behind win over Essendon, their first finals win in 13 years. John Northey, the ultimate us-against-the-world coach, tumbled out of the coach’s box, waving his Richmond jacket like a crazy man. Gale swears the MCG shifted that day, such was the noise the Tiger Army generated. Within weeks, for reasons that were never really explained, Northey was gone. The ensuring years were characterised by sacked coaches, false dawns and supporter backlash. Richmond, it seemed, truly was a club that ate its own. Talking a good game The appointment of Terry Wallace is as good a place as any to begin. At the time, he was hot property. He was given five years to work his magic. In his first draft, he had five picks inside the top 20. He eschewed a raw, cocky, Indigenous kid called Lance Franklin in favour of Richard Tambling. In his defence, most club recruiters would have done the same. Terry certainly talked a good game. He’d preface his sentences with an upwardly inflicted ‘Yeah!’. Tanning salons were still legal in Victoria and some weeks he looked decidedly phosphorescent. He certainly started well. By winter 2005, Richmond were 7-2. Nathan Brown, who’d been in scintillating touch, snapped both his tibia and fibula, one of the most sickening injuries you’ll ever see on a footy field. A foot long rod was inserted in his leg. He was never the same player again. The Tigers won just three more games for the year. Wallace was the sort of coach who always had an angle, always had a trick up his sleeve. He scuppered an undefeated Adelaide side in 2006. He sent Matthew Richardson to the wing. He was the only coach willing to take a punt on Ben Cousins. But there was no real support around him. The recruiting budget was laughable. In 2005, Jarrod Oakley Nicholls was selected as their first draft pick on the strength of video footage. By 2009, the supporter base was fed up. Wallace started receiving death threats. The Herald Sun ran with the headline “Death Row”. He departed mid-season and retreated to his bolt hole, barricading himself in his home theatre. Later that year, with a locum coach and another season going up the spout, they met the lowly Melbourne. It was one of the more suspicious games of recent times. Richmond’s Jordan McMahon, the quintessential Wallace player, kicked the winning goal after the siren. It shored up a priority draft pick for Melbourne and prompted a three-year investigation into tanking. The Demons snapped up Tom Scully and Jack Trengove, while the Tigers opted for a kid from Castlemaine, Dustin Martin. ‘Young men of outstanding character’ At the time, an increasing number of draftees were coming through the private school system. They were “young men of outstanding character”. Martin was something else altogether. His dad was a bikie. Dustin had left school at the end of year 9. He refused to smile for photographers. He’d worked as a forklift driver and a storeman. “Are you dumb?” the Port Adelaide recruiters asked him. “I was born to play AFL,” he told one senior reporter. They had a new coach, too. Damien Hardwick was a typical Kevin Sheedy protégé. At Hawthorn, he was part of a crack team of coaches that masterminded an unlikely premiership in 2008. He’d got down to the final two in the interview process for four senior coaching roles. He missed the Essendon job after his computer malfunctioned during a PowerPoint presentation. At his opening press conference, a 90-year-old supporter stood up and addressed the media throng. “I hope all you mob just leave him alone,” she said. Crucially, it was senior management who left him alone, a rare luxury for Richmond coaches. He rebuilt the list, drafting solid citizens and reliable kicks. Gale stabilised the club and balanced the books. Within three or four years, they’d cultivated an attractive, freewheeling style of play. They’d regularly knock off the best teams of that era. But there was still a glassy fragility to them. Three successive finals campaigns were misbegotten disasters. In Adelaide in 2014, they ran through a banner that read “At Richmond, we don’t believe in fairy tales – we write them.” Twenty minutes later, they were seven goals down. The following day, at Mad Monday, Trent Cotchin apologised for the performance whilst dressed as Ace Frehley, the Kiss guitarist. Soon, Cotchin looked utterly fed up. He played the most blue-collar of games. But he looked and spoke like an articled clerk. He was therefore an easy target. The AFL website published an article titled “Why Trent Cotchin is not a great player”. Dermott Brereton said he was too nice and charming to be an effective leader. Brooke Cotchin eventually defended her husband in an impassioned Instagram post. Playing like kids again in 2017 By last year, the Tigers seemed bereft of flair, instinct and luck. Their star recruit was addicted to ice. Their average losing margin was seven goals. They were walloped by 20 goals in the final round. There were calls for Hardwick’s head and a shake-up of the board. The AFL drastically cut their Friday night games. In the off-season, Hardwick conceded that he’d been too rigid, too harsh, too old school Richmond. “Just play,” he told his team. “Play like you’re kids again.” Neil Balme was brought in to calm the place down. And the language coming out of the club changed. “I feel free,” Cotchin said. “This year is all about connection,” said Alex Rance, a devout Jehovah’s Witness and one of the best key defenders of all time. Even Martin began to embrace mindfulness and meditation. Sure, there were the usual calamities. They were torched by Adelaide. Fremantle’s David Mundy sunk them after the siren. Their away loss to GWS was a total cock up. And the unimpeachable Bachar Houli had to rely on a character reference from Waleed Aly, a former club mascot, to whittle down a striking charge. But there’d been a noticeable shift. Their return clash with GWS was particularly instructive. On a miserable Sunday afternoon, the Giants skipped away to an early lead. In years gone by, you suspect the Tigers would have capitulated. But they dug in and ground down an opponent whose appetite for the contest was less than voracious. And then there was Martin. From the opening 30 seconds of the season, there was a joyous brutality to his game. Leigh Matthews reckons he’s never seen a footballer have a better season. In the week of the biggest game of his life, he sacrificed $2m to stay at the club. The federal immigration minister, meanwhile, rushed through an amendment to the Migration Act, banning his father from entering the country. That Friday against Geelong, he played with not a scintilla of doubt. The Cats, who hadn’t lost to the Tigers at the MCG this century, were spooked by the sulphurous crowd. A weight had been lifted. The lid was off. Inner city Melbourne battened down the hatches. ‘It’s Tiger time’ Every morning, I walk the dog through the one-way streets of Richmond, once known as Struggletown. It’s a hodgepodge of a suburb, with it footy pubs, converted warehouses, social housing blocks, hipster bars, workers cottages, cashed-up tradies, Vietnamese restaurants and hot yoga studios. At times, it resembles a giant construction site. It’s also the epicentre of Melbourne’s heroin trade. Dozens of addicts died within a two street radius last year. Most mornings, we stop and chat with an old timer, one of those lifelong Richmond residents who’s sitting on a gold mine. He’s forever being harassed by besuited real estate agents. On his fence hang two signs. One, distributed by the Greens, calls for the trial of a safe injecting room. The other is the old Richmond catchcry - “Eat ‘Em Alive!” He pats the dog and we talk about the drugs and the Tigers. He tells me about the old champions who used to own the pubs and milk bars in the area. Martin, he reckons, is the best Richmond player he’s seen since Royce Hart. He points to the corner pub, opposite the housing commission flats and recently painted in yellow and black. “We’re back, I reckon,” he says. “It’s Tiger time.” For those of a younger vintage, the Richmond experience is pockmarked with pain. But they’ve never dropped off. They barrack as fiercely as modern manners permit. On Saturday, they may well constitute the most one-sided crowd in Australian sporting history. Their team, rather like the Bulldogs last year, seem to have caught the competition on the hop. They have few injuries. Their young players are untrammelled by past disasters. They have all the momentum. They have their swagger back. They have the smell of history about them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/21/victorians-overwhelmingly-support-voluntary-euthanasia-survey-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T03:47:15Z","webTitle":"Victorians overwhelmingly support voluntary euthanasia, survey finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/21/victorians-overwhelmingly-support-voluntary-euthanasia-survey-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/21/victorians-overwhelmingly-support-voluntary-euthanasia-survey-finds","fields":{"headline":"Victorians overwhelmingly support voluntary euthanasia, survey finds","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As the Victorian parliament ponders an historic vote to legalise assisted dying for the terminally ill, a new survey shows the public overwhelmingly back the reform, with most Victorians saying they would be more likely to vote for a candidate if they supported voluntary euthanasia. The survey of 500 Victorian adults, conducted in late July on behalf of assisted dying advocacy group Go Gentle Australia, also found that public approval for voluntary euthanasia laws was stronger than their support for other key social issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion rights. Overall, 72% of Victorians supported the right of adults “to choose to end their lives if they are suffering from a terminal illness”. Only 13% were opposed, with 15% having a neutral view. Support was higher among Labor voters (78%) than Coalition voters (55%). Almost 95% of Greens supporters backed change. When the question was framed to reflect the proposed laws in Victoria, 77% backed adults being able to choose to end their life “if they are suffering from an incurable disease that is advanced, progressive and will cause death, and which is causing suffering that cannot be relieved”. The online poll, conducted by research company Review Partners, is consistent with other surveys across Australia. Since the Northern Territory’s voluntary euthanasia laws were overturned by the federal parliament in 1997, no state parliament has passed similar legislation, despite many attempts and strong public backing for change. Supporters of assisted dying say the Victorian voluntary assisted dying bill, introduced to parliament this week, has a good chance of being passed, which would open the way for other states considering reform. The poll found majority support across all ages, genders and educational levels. It had strong approval whether people lived in cities or in the country. It found little risk of an electoral backlash for Victorian MPs who vote for assisted dying, with 56% of respondents saying they would be more likely to vote for a candidate if they supported the legislation. Only 9% said they would be less likely, with 35% saying it would make no difference. More women than men would favour candidates who voted for reform. Even for conservative MPs, the risk appears slight. On a two-party preferred basis, for those intending to vote for the Liberal National coalition, led by opposition leader Matthew Guy, 42% would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supported legalising assisted dying, while just 14% would be less likely. Guy opposes assisted dying laws, but all MPs will have a conscience vote when the bill is debated next month. Support was more emphatic for Labor supporters. For those intending to vote for the ALP, led by the premier, Daniel Andrews, 66% would be more likely to vote for a candidate who backed voluntary euthanasia, with just 6% less likely. Just over 70% of Greens voters would look favourably on a candidate who voted for change, as would 51% of One Nation voters. About a quarter of respondents agreed with three main arguments against assisted dying – that medicine should be only used to prolong life, not to end it, that it could become “out of control” and lead to unjustified killing, and that “life is given by God and only God has the right to take it away”. But for each statement, at least half the population disagreed. The poll indicated that Victorians would approve if the proposed law was more liberal. The bill limits assistance to terminally ill people likely to die within 12 months, whereas 63% of respondents would allow it for dementia or Alzheimer’s sufferers who had signed an advanced directive indicating their wish to end their life. The Victorian law will not allow assistance in these cases. With a bitter debate about same-sex marriage underway in Australia, the Go Gentle study indicated that support for assisted dying was stronger than support for allowing same-sex couples to marry. It measured support for nine current issues involving individual choice. It found 64% of people backed same-sex marriage, 63% the right to terminate a pregnancy, and 48% the right of people to choose whether to vote. At the other extreme, only 13% approve of a right for Australians to carry guns. The Victorian health minister Jill Hennessy told parliament on Thursday that the assisted dying bill was “uniquely Victorian”. It “balances a compassionate outcome for these people at the end of their lives who are suffering, and providing community protection through the establishment of robust safeguards and comprehensive oversight”. She said that the vast majority of Victorians would never use the law, but for a small number of people at their end of their lives, “palliative care cannot ease their pain and suffering”. The survey had a margin of error of 3%. It comes as New South Wales is also debating assisted dying with a cross-party bill introduced to the parliament on Thursday. Nationals MP Trevor Khan tabled the legislation in the state’s upper house. “The bill is restricted to the terminally ill whose deaths are imminent,” Khan told parliament. The proposed legislation would give people aged over 25 with less than 12 months to live the option of ending their life. Safeguards and sanctions designed to protect against coercion and elder abuse are outlined in the bill."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/21/former-weather-bureau-chief-says-agency-debilitated-by-climate-deniers-attacks","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T04:18:44Z","webTitle":"Former weather bureau chief says agency debilitated by climate deniers' attacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/21/former-weather-bureau-chief-says-agency-debilitated-by-climate-deniers-attacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/21/former-weather-bureau-chief-says-agency-debilitated-by-climate-deniers-attacks","fields":{"headline":"Former weather bureau chief says agency debilitated by climate deniers' attacks","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Misleading attacks on Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology by climate deniers in the Australian are “debilitating” to the agency and limiting its ability to predict risks and protect the community, the former head of the bureau has told the Guardian. Rob Vertessy, who retired as director of the BoM in April 2016, said climate deniers’ attempts to confuse the public about the science of climate change were dangerous, in an interview for the Guardian’s Planet Oz blog. “I was exposed to a lot of it and it took up a lot of my time that’s for sure,” Vertessy said. “I feel for my successor and the team at the bureau having to constantly devote energy to this. It’s really quite debilitating.” Vertessy was succeeded by Andrew Johnson, who has since had to deal with a barrage of criticism led by the rightwing thinktank the Institute for Public Affairs and expressed mostly in the pages of the Australian newspaper. Earlier this week, the former Abbott government adviser Maurice Newman accused the bureau of “fabricating temperature records” and said it represented a “smoking gun that threatens the integrity of global temperature records”. Vertessy said these sorts of attacks were dangerous. “From my perspective, people like this running interference on the national weather agency are unproductive and it’s actually dangerous,” he said. “Every minute a BoM executive spends on this nonsense is a minute lost to managing risk and protecting the community and it is a real problem. “As the costs of climate change accumulate in the years ahead, I can see that leaders of this climate change denial movement will really be seen as culpable.” He said the government had done a “pretty good job” of supporting the bureau and independent experts. But he said politicians’ jobs had been made difficult by the Australian. “It will just continue and it will limit the ability of the government to focus on more important matters – not just climate ones but all the works of government. It’s distracting for politicians to have to deal with this chatter.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/22/accc-chief-backs-inquiry-into-tech-giants-market-dominance","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T18:00:25Z","webTitle":"ACCC chief backs inquiry into tech giants' market dominance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/22/accc-chief-backs-inquiry-into-tech-giants-market-dominance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/22/accc-chief-backs-inquiry-into-tech-giants-market-dominance","fields":{"headline":"ACCC chief backs inquiry into tech giants' market dominance","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman, Rod Sims, says it is a good idea to examine the market dominance of the tech giants Google and Facebook, and consider the implications for funding traditional media organisations. Sims says his looming inquiry, which is a consequence of the media ownership reforms that cleared the parliament, will deploy the full investigative powers of his organisation to gather information from both the tech giants and Australian media companies to determine the scope of the domestic problem. In the US, Google and Facebook have dominated the growth in digital advertising spending, and the two companies already control the bulk of the digital advertising market. That market dominance has significant implications for traditional media organisations, which have traditionally funded journalism from advertising revenue. Social media platforms are also major distributors of mainstream media content. In an interview with the Australian Politics Live podcast, Sims said the dominance of the tech giants was a serious issue, and it “does have implications for the way journalism has been traditionally funded”. “I think it is perfectly appropriate to give it a lot of serious thought. I think this idea not to pay any attention to it is not so smart, I think this does need a good look – and we are looking forward to it.” The Turnbull government is yet to send the ACCC specific terms of reference, but the inquiry was triggered by the concerns of the Nick Xenophon Team that the tech giants were damaging the viability of Australian media companies. Xenophon demanded the ACCC investigation in return for media ownership changes, which are likely to increase concentration in the local media landscape, already one of the most concentrated media markets in the developed world. He wants the ACCC to examine the prices paid by Google and Facebook to distribute mainstream media content, and digital advertising practices. The wording of the NXT deal with the government says the treasurer, Scott Morrison, will direct the ACCC to conduct an inquiry into the impact of the new digital environment on media, with that inquiry to begin as soon as possible, and not later than 1 December 2017. Sims said the inquiry wasn’t connected with the ACCC’s enforcement powers, and wasn’t about whether the companies had breached competition and consumer law, but would instead be policy-focused. He said he hoped the government would give the organisation sufficient time and resources to get to the bottom of market behaviour, and then assess the policy implications. “The main tool we use in these inquiries is out information gathering powers, and then our investigative ability,” Sims said. “We really are an investigation organisation, we know how to investigate markets, that’s what we do, that’s why governments like us to do these things.” Asked whether an inquiry by a competition regulator in Australia could make any practical difference to what has become a global problem, impacting media organisations in many countries, Sims said he believed it would be valuable. “We will get the information because obviously we can get all the information from the media proprietors in Australia, but also Google and Facebook are clearly carrying on businesses in Australia – by any test, they are,” he said. “There are some issues, the fact that they are based overseas, but I think we’ll be able to find out what we need to to do a good study.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/20/manchester-united-burton-albion-carabao-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T22:26:00Z","webTitle":"Manchester United and Marcus Rashford allow Burton little consolation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/20/manchester-united-burton-albion-carabao-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/20/manchester-united-burton-albion-carabao-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United and Marcus Rashford allow Burton little consolation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"José Mourinho had no sooner watched Manchester United swat aside Burton Albion before he suggested he would not be averse to the League Cup being scrapped. Mourinho has claimed the trophy four times as a manager – including his first silverware with United last season – and is the only one of the current 92 league managers to win it. Yet of a competition that dates from the 1960-61 season, he said: “Could the English football survive or even be better without this competition? Maybe, maybe we would be fresher for European competition for example. But we have this competition, we have to respect the sponsors, we have to respect the opponents and a lot of us are trying to do our best. “If the competition is an official competition then it is important for Manchester United and for me as a manager.” United knocked out Burton in what is becoming familiar fashion this season. This fourth four-goal haul made it a total of 24 in eight outings in all competitions. Marcus Rashford scored twice and terrorised Burton to be the night’s best performer, while Mourinho also praised his other forwards. “[Anthony] Martial was good, [Jesse] Lingard was good, everybody in attacking areas gave dynamic in the team. We look happy playing this moment,” he said. Inside five minutes United took the lead with a simple goal for Rashford. Michael Carrick floated the ball over and found the No19 via Lingard inside Burton’s area to make it 1-0. It was precisely the start Mourinho would have wanted and Nigel Clough, the Burton manager, would have dreaded. United’s second came when Daley Blind pushed the ball down the left and Rashford gave Connor Ripley no chance with a fierce shot that beat the Burton goalkeeper off his right post. It was Rashford’s fifth goal in five United appearances and he was near-unplayable whenever a red shirt found him. Ander Herrera zipped a pass down the right, Rashford beat the offside trap and only a flailing boot from Ben Turner prevented him from taking aim again. United were slicker and more determined, Juan Mata spurning a chance and Martial being denied by Ripley’s legs. When the Brewers managed an attack, Joe Mason’s chip was saved by Sergio Romero. Next in a seemingly endless medley of chances, Mata hit Ripley’s left post, Matteo Darmian collected the loose ball and found Martial, but his volley ricocheted away. If this was largely United’s second string, Mourinho would be pleased with their pace and how keen the deputies were to impress. The third goal derived from some dazzling Martial skill as he produced a trick near Burton’s penalty area and tapped the ball to Lingard, whose shot took a heavy deflection, giving Ripley no chance. Of what might be viewed Mourinho’s strongest XI, only Mata and Rashford were included, the manager making nine changes from the side that beat Everton 4-0 here on Sunday. This was the same number as Clough made for Burton, as Turner and Jamie Allen survived from Saturday’s 2-1 win against Fulham. For the second half Luke Shaw was introduced for Mata, the left-back making a first appearance since 30 April because of an ankle ligament injury. Clough brought on Stephen Warnock and Luke Murphy for Allen and Turner. Shaw’s first notable action was to put the ball in the net, albeit from an offside position, and next he was sharp at the other end when recovering after losing the ball near Romero. He later linked with Lingard down the left as United kept possession with ease. As the hour approached Mourinho was moved to applause by a twinkle-toed dance through Burton’s defence by Martial that would have produced a fine goal if not for Ripley’s save. Moments later, however, he did beat the goalkeeper with a cool finish, then Rashford’s value to Mourinho was illustrated by his being taken off as the contest entered its final third. With virtually the final touch of the game, Lloyd Dyer scored a consolation for Burton, the first goal against United at Old Trafford this season. But they had cantered home and a professional display left Mourinho in relaxed form. “I learned nothing new, just what I know, they all want to play, are ready to play,” he said. “I think they enjoy the game because these League Cup matches, I think it’s essential.” United next travel to Swansea City in the fourth round."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/20/chelsea-nottingham-forest-carabao-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T22:10:00Z","webTitle":"Michy Batshuayi hits treble and Charly Musonda excels as Chelsea silence Forest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/20/chelsea-nottingham-forest-carabao-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/20/chelsea-nottingham-forest-carabao-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Batshuayi hits treble and Musonda excels as Chelsea silence Forest","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Charly Musonda Jr had waited five years for his opportunity and even on his compatriot Eden Hazard’s long-awaited return to the starting line-up, he was not to be upstaged. The baby-faced forward spent last season on loan at Real Betis but has been forced to sit by patiently for a Chelsea debut ever since arriving at the club as a 15-year-old in 2012. A brilliant performance capped by the third goal as Michy Batshuayi also scored a hat-trick in this thrashing of a poor visiting side ensured it was worth the wait. “I think Charly played very well,” the Chelsea manager, Antonio Conte, said. “He’s trying to work a lot to improve his physical impact with this league. Don’t forget this league is very strong in the physical aspect. We are working a lot with Charly in this aspect to be ready to play in this league. For sure, he’s a talented player, and he has to continue in this way. When there is the opportunity, the chance, to help us, he must do this.” On the 13th anniversary of Brian Clough’s death, the Chelsea pitch announcer had paid tribute to the man who led Forest to two successive European Cups before the match. But this powderpuff display in a competition Clough won four times was a reminder of how far they have fallen, having now failed to reach the fourth round since the year Old Big ’Ead passed away. Watched from the stands by their owner, Evangelos Marinakis, the Forest manager, Mark Warburton, made eight changes from the side that lost at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday to leave them 10th in the Championship. Conte went one better, as only Gary Cahill and Cesc Fàbregas retained their places after the stalemate against Arsenal at the weekend. Hazard formed an all-Belgian frontline alongside Batshuayi and the 20-year-old Musonda, one of four brothers to have passed through Chelsea’s academy and the son of a former Zambia midfielder, also called Charly. But it was one of Chelsea’s less vaunted prospects who opened the scoring in the 12th minute, as Kenedy – making his first appearance since being sent home from the pre-season tour to China – timed his run perfectly to meet Antonio Rüdiger’s deep cross at the back post to volley home. Batshuayi made it 2-0 six minutes later when Hazard’s clever through ball from the edge of the area found its way to his feet via a deflection. A curling free-kick from the impressive Everton loanee Kieran Dowell that cannoned off the bar was the best Forest could muster in response, before Musonda effectively ended the tie five minutes before half-time as he drilled home Fàbregas’s pass from a tight angle before celebrating his goal with a full swan dive in front of the West stand. Chelsea picked up where they had left off after the break, with Hazard setting up Batshuayi for his second of the evening after a glorious long pass from Fàbregas. The Spaniard then made way for the 17-year-old Ethan Ampadu, who joined from Exeter City in the summer having broken Cliff Bastin’s record as the youngest player in the club’s history, to make his debut. Another versatile teenager, Dujon Sterling, was also handed a late cameo at right wing-back for Chelsea as Forest attempted to salvage some pride, which eventually came via the last kick of the game from the substitute Tendayi Darikwa after Batshuayi had completed his hat-trick. But the night belonged to Musonda."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/28/worlds-from-the-worlds-end-by-joanna-walsh-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T11:00:36Z","webTitle":"Worlds from the Word’s End by Joanna Walsh review – existential games","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/28/worlds-from-the-worlds-end-by-joanna-walsh-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/28/worlds-from-the-worlds-end-by-joanna-walsh-review","fields":{"headline":"Worlds from the Word’s End by Joanna Walsh review – existential games","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"We have not yet resolved the “auto-fic dilemma”: when is a novel autobiographical and when is it not? Who decides – the reader or the author – and with reference to what? Are novels in which the narrator shares the author’s name (see Knausgaard and Apuleius, among others) inevitably autobiographical? Or are these authorial narrators a postmodern (or, in the case of Apuleius, premodern) joke? This returns us, once again, to Lawrence Durrell’s enjoyably devastating proposition that every novel is sui generis, so there is no such thing as The Novel – and no such thing as The Autobiographical Novel. Furthermore, we would need to be omniscient to enforce adamantine distinctions between autobiography and fiction or life and art. No one can win at this game – although the impossibility of winning a game needn’t preclude us from playing it, of course. These questions and paradoxes course through Joanna Walsh’s work. In an earlier book, Hotel (2015), a hotel reviewer drifts from one impersonal setting to another, musing on the collapse of her marriage and the theories of Freud. In Vertigo (2016), various narrators – or perhaps the same narrator in different guises – struggle with the overarching weirdness of ordinary life. Hotel is billed as memoir, Vertigo as fiction. The narrators of the stories in Worlds from the Word’s End are strikingly similar, to each other and to the narrators of Walsh’s previous works, but then one of them becomes a dog, which complicates matters a little. As in Hotel and Vertigo, they travel from one dreamlike place to another, residing in half-empty hotels, trying to write, or read, or focus on anything at all. In “Postcards from Two Hotels”, a narrator stays in a room where “there are notepads by the pillows; the chair is far too low for the desk”, then in a room in another hotel where “the notepads, also by the pillow, are smaller … The chair is also too low for the desk.” Nothing happens, except the narrator tries to write. She works better in one hotel than the other, she adds. The rooms are generic and interchangeable; there is almost nothing to say about them. In “Hauptbahnhof”, a narrator waits at Berlin’s main station, eagerly expecting someone who never comes: And there is no better place to wait than the Hauptbahnhof. It is large enough for me to change platforms regularly. It is clean. There are vastly fewer pigeons than in any other grand station in Europe. Once again, nothing happens, although the narrator waits. Reality is comically unreliable in Walsh’s stories. Berlin is “bigger than I expected” and the narrator’s city map implodes under its own weight. Communications are fraught; people fail to arrive or disappear without explanation. Her narrators are disturbed by a sense that there are rules and protocols they do not entirely understand or cannot follow in a convincing way. They are uncertain if this is their fault. One piece, “Exes”, is indeed about exes, but also about xxxxxs, those unnerving explosions of kisses that virtual strangers sometimes append to text messages and emails. Rows of xxxxxs also invoke words and concepts that are blanked out, censored on political or other grounds. The title piece takes place in a parallel reality in which people find it so hard to communicate that eventually they abandon language altogether. Nouns, adjectives and tenses become deeply unfashionable; people use gestures and grunts instead. “Words still visited sometimes: spork, ostrich, windjammer … We wondered where they had come from, what to do with them. Were they a curse or a blessing?” This ambivalence also defines the story “Bookselves”, in which another barely defined narrator sits in another barely defined place, surrounded by the “relics of a more intense age of reading”. Lacking the time to read these abandoned books, the narrator conjures an ideal self, who reads them all instead. Inevitably, the narrator finds this organised and driven self intensely annoying, until the two selves get drunk together and agree that they “do not really like books”. This is a dangerous form of malaise for a writer, but it is also heavily ironic and, at times, funny. Walsh brilliantly subverts and torments her solipsistic narrators. They are writers and readers who loathe books; they are ambitious travellers who get stuck in one vaguely unsettling place. They become obsessed by small details – pigeons, notepads, chairs – yet the wider background is out of focus and possibly not even there at all. Occasionally, as above, they are dogs, but even then they are forced to spend their time in nebulous hotels, waiting. Sometimes they get drunk with a fantasy friend, but this is conspicuously unusual and clearly not real anyway. Throughout, Walsh toys with notions of realism versus fantasy and autobiography versus fiction. She exposes, and revels in, the absurdity of these boundaries, their indistinctness. Her clever, self-parodying stories capture the existential disarrangement of the writer, but also the existential disarrangement of anyone who finds real life strange and, at times, quite unreal. • Joanna Kavenna’s A Field Guide to Reality is published by Riverrun.

As you get older, thick creams can get caught in your wrinkles and end up looking like soil, and that’s not a nice look for anyone. Mac’s Prep + Prime BB Beauty Balm (£25) looks very elegant in its black tube. It has a high SPF and a soft and silky texture that was very easy to apply, but it was slightly drying. Bobbi Brown’s BB cream (£29.50) was good. It was extremely light, non-sticky and really easy to blend into the skin. I think I would still wear it over a moisturiser, though. I like my skin to feel very hydrated. The Revlon Youth FX Fill + Blur Foundation (£11.99) was too thick for me: it even covered up all my freckles. It’s a good price, but I would worry it would highlight my wrinkles. And Rimmel’s BB Cream 9 in 1 (£6.99) also didn’t give a hugely satisfying result. It was very easy to blend, thanks to the liquid and light texture, and it kept its promise of an even skin tone, but I’m not sure it looked very natural – I felt a bit PhotoShopped. Mixed with a bit more moisturiser, the result was much better. Overall, Bobbi Brown was my favourite. I don’t think I’ll be using a BB cream every day, but I’d be grateful for its smoothing qualities on a special occasion. • Next week: All Ages model Marc Goldfinger on shaving balms This article contains affiliate links to products.

Top stories Donald Trump’s speech to the UN general assembly was “ignorant, absurd and hateful rhetoric” that was “unfit to be heard at the United Nations”, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, has said. Speaking at the UN a day after Trump’s bombastic speech in which he threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, Rouhani also said his country would respond “decisively and resolutely” if the US were to walk away from the nuclear deal agreed with other countries in 2015. “It would be a great pity if this agreement were to be destroyed by rogue newcomers to the world of politics,” Rouhani said. Hillary Clinton has said Trump’s speech was “dark, dangerous”. On Wednesday, Trump told journalists he had decided whether to withdraw certification of the 2015 nuclear deal by a congressional deadline of 15 October. The US president – a former TV reality show host who clearly enjoys building anticipation for his announcements – said “I have decided” and repeated it three times, but did not say what he had decided, telling reporters: “I’ll let you know.” If he does not certify the agreement, under which Iran radically reduced its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, Congress would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose US sanctions. If the legislature makes no decision, the onus passes back to the president. The other signatories of the agreement – the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China – have confirmed Iran is sticking to its obligations, and have urged Washington not to walk away from the deal. Trump was also criticised at the UN by a less expected source – British prime minister Theresa May urged leaders to maintain a “rules-based” international order, including support for the Paris climate change accord that Trump rejects. Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto has declared three days of national mourning after the country was hit by a 7.1-magnitude earthquake that has so far killed 225 people. The Twitter account of his office wrote: “Mexico shares your pain.” You can read the latest developments on our live blog here. Dozens of people have been pulled alive from the rubble of destroyed buildings, including a school in which 20 children died, and the rescue work continues with cutting tools and sniffer dogs. Australian consumer advocates have sounded a warning over the growth of the buy-now pay-later scheme Afterpay, saying the industry is unregulated and people are being allowed to overcommit because companies are not obliged to check whether consumers can actually afford to make repayments. Low-cost flight carrier Jetstar last week announced it had begun offering the option for airfares costing up to $1,000. It joins more than 7,000 retailers, including brands such as General Pants Co, The Iconic and Optus, who are offering the scheme. A Liberal MP, phoned by a robo-call claiming same-sex marriage would lead to “radical gay sex education”, has labelled it push polling designed to “mislead and deceive” the Australian public. The robo-poll from WPA Intelligence, a Republican-aligned research company in the US, first appeared on Tuesday last week and is now the subject of a complaint by the Equality Campaign because it does not say who authorised it. The call asks a series of neutral questions before re-testing support for same-sex marriage after the proposition it “may lead to negative consequences such as radical gay sex education being taught in school, threats to freedom of speech and freedom of religion”. Councillors should be banned from having any role in the handling of projects by developers who have donated to their campaign, Queensland’s parliamentary Speaker has said, after fresh controversy over developer donations erupted on the Gold Coast. The independent MP Peter Wellington said legislative reforms should not only stop councillors voting on donor-related developments, but also prevent them taking up those matters with council staff and others behind the scenes. It follows revelations the Gold Coast deputy mayor, Donna Gates, voted more than 30 times in favour of developments linked to donors who gave tens of thousands of dollars to her 2016 election campaign. A Four Corners report noting that Gates did so legally, despite declaring potential conflicts of interest, prompted the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, to acknowledge concerns about developer influence and flag possible legislative changes. Sport The Matildas have become role models for young girls finding their own love for the sport through their feats, but their skills, style of play and approachability have also appealed to young boys, made converts of sceptical men and made women all over proud, writes Ann Odong. See also our cartoonist David Squires on the Matildas, “Australia’s best national sports team”. The joy of winning an AFL preliminary final is always tempered with “we still have one more to go”, but a defeat is the worst sporting loss any team can suffer, writes diehard Adelaide fan Greg Jericho, who is awaiting for Friday’s clash with Geelong with trepidation. Thinking time Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland is the biggest production the Australian Ballet has ever undertaken and one of the most spectacular. Choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon for the Royal Ballet and designed by Bob Crowley, it involves puppetry, optical illusions, immersive projections and more. For this gallery of spectacular images, the Australian Ballet’s design co-ordinator, Sukie Kirk, and Kat Chan, the design associate for the production, talked Guardian Australia through the stories behind the designs – from a Cheshire cat operated by eight people to a dress that is also a working cupboard – and the challenges in bringing them to life. Brigid Delaney describes You Am I frontman Tim Rogers’ new memoir as “honest to the point of discomfort for the reader – as if one were trespassing through his hinterland.” She met up with him in Melbourne to talk about how he mined his past with such rawness: the drinking, the drugs, the self-harm and the broken relationships, as much as the moments of beauty and tenderness. “Any time I felt like I was trying to evoke sympathy I needed to cut that right out,” he told her, “because I felt like whoever the protagonist is in those [parts] is ready to take the blame.” What? Genocide? Really? How awful, is there a GoFundMe or a Facebook page? First Dog on the Moon records the Australian government’s response to the Rohingya crisis. Media roundup The Herald Sun headlines with “Footy vote brawl” after the AFL changed its logo to support same-sex marriage, a move that has apparently divided fans, clubs and some of the code’s big names. The Canberra Times splashes on Tony Abbott accusing the ACT education minister Yvette Berry of “ outrageous interference” after she reminded schools of their obligation to be inclusive of LGBTI students. And the ABC reports concerns that a Melbourne-to-Brisbane inland railway line will be built across a floodplain that was devastated in recent years.

Rose’s 2017 thus far is dominated by a near miss, that at the Masters in April, with the former US Open champion determined to make success rather than falling short his season’s story line. “Right now, everybody, including myself, would sum up my year as that I lost in a play-off at the Masters,” Rose said. “That would make most players’ year and that’s what they would be remembered for in 2017. But this would certainly rectify things on that front, for sure. “This is a bucket-lister. This would be another huge step for my career. It’s not a major but any time you win ‘a season’ on a tour, it’s a big deal, whether it be the Race To Dubai or FedEx Cup. Those are highlights on a small list of highlights on your CV.” From a current position of eighth, Rose’s FedEx destiny is relatively simple. If he wins the final event this weekend, the Tour Championship, he would be seriously unfortunate not to walk off with a second trophy and the largest one-off prize ever collected by an English golfer. “Oh, you do think about it, believe me,” Rose said of the cash at stake. “But I do think it is possible to play for $10m-$11m whatever it is, and not get too distracted by it, however daft that might sound. “We are all seasoned pros out here and when you face those biggest moments is when you trust your training as much as you can. That’s when you have to suck in that extra bit of air and then do what you do. It’s not easy but I think I’m pretty adept at that now. If you’d offered me this position at the start of these play-offs I would have ripped your arm off. “I’ve pretty much done as I could in the play-offs to get myself in this situation and now it’s all about making the most of it and trying to have an exciting and very memorable Sunday. I’ve finished second here before. I like it here. It’s a golf course where you have to put your ball in place off the tee; its very strategic, you can’t short-side yourself.

But this is Gucci, where the designer Alessandro Michele’s avant-garde approach to luxury has confounded the industry. The fashion house’s financial results, released this summer, showed a phenomenal 43.4% sales growth. Even more striking is that Gucci, whose catwalk set mapped the Roman site of Horace’s Villa and whose show notes touched on post-structuralism, is adored by a younger generation most fellow heritage brands struggle to connect with: half of all Gucci customers were born after 1980. Michele is the most successful fashion designer of this decade despite – or perhaps because of – not seeming particularly interested in clothes. In a 25-minute pre-show briefing for editors, held in the grandly modernist Milan palazzo Gucci built for its golden boy, Michele did not mention a single garment. “Sometimes I think, it would be easier if I could just make some beautiful shoes for the shop. But no, I want to change the aesthetic of this whole company and that way I can change what fashion is. I want to make things that create possibility, that make an opportunity for the world to change and to grow,” he said. Diversity and authenticity are recurrent themes. “I am trying to push the idea of fashion, and to destroy the old codes of fashion,” said Michele, who was wearing a heavily embroidered jacket that an hour later featured on the catwalk worn by a female model. “Fashion is trying to keep alive codes which are from the age of the New Look, of Mr Dior. The old way of thinking that goes, ‘the new season is blue’ or ‘the new ballerina look’, I am not interested in that. And when the casting people say to me about a model, ‘she is beautiful, she is a new face, she has beautiful legs’ – I don’t care about that at all. I care about the way the girl is romantic, the way she sees the world, not that she looks a certain way. I want to tell stories so I think in a cinematic way.” Michele’s Gucci, steeped in Medici symbolism and Renaissance silhouettes when it burst on to the catwalk at the beginning of 2015, last year shifted toward disco and from there toward hip-hop, with many an eye-catching red herring – such as a fur-lined loafer – along the way. This season the aesthetic took a turn toward glam rock, with clothes inspired by Elton John’s stage outfits. Tour jackets, high-waisted jumpsuits and power-shouldered blazers were worn by male models dripping in jewellery and female models whose crispy fringes resembled Renate Blauel, whom Elton John married on Valentine’s Day 1984. But for all its progressive talk, Gucci’s success is built on an identity that remains largely stable from season to season. Its fans will pay elevated prices because by rejecting the trend cycle, Michele sells pieces with a longer shelf life, remaining recognisably Gucci for more than one season. All the key elements of the Gucci aesthetic – slick 1970s sportswear, drugstore barrettes, shrunken trousersuits, rainbow stripes, geek-chic glasses, obtuse slogans, backless shoes, a certain old lady-ish silhouette of a fur coat over a long dress, Disney references, pearls – were in full effect. How Gucci turns this arthouse script into box office gold was hinted at with the invitation to the show. Each guest received an ornate pharmacy tin inscribed “GUCCY” containing candles, matches, scented paper and silk thread. “The show is a spell I cast on you,” explained the designer. “Like a wizard.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/22/king-krules-dum-surfer-sludgy-monster-mash-for-2017-fergie-nicki-minaj-charlotte-gainsbourg","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T13:00:48Z","webTitle":"King Krule’s Dum Surfer: a sludgy Monster Mash for 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/22/king-krules-dum-surfer-sludgy-monster-mash-for-2017-fergie-nicki-minaj-charlotte-gainsbourg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/22/king-krules-dum-surfer-sludgy-monster-mash-for-2017-fergie-nicki-minaj-charlotte-gainsbourg","fields":{"headline":"King Krule’s Dum Surfer: a sludgy Monster Mash for 2017","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"TRACK OF THE WEEK King Krule Dum Surfer As monarchs go, King Krule is a laissez-faire ruler, presiding over a dissolute musical kingdom where consonants have been abolished, jazzy chords congeal and indolent saxophonists come and go as they please.

Marilyn Manson We Know Where You Fucking Live In recent years, the erstwhile “God of Fuck” has cut something of a tragic figure, bloated and apologetic, reduced to poking fun at himself in YouTube skits. But scary times call for scary dudes, and Manson has answered the call with a trademark blast of seething unpleasantness. If the lyrics seem to say that the best way to fight oppression is via anonymous death threats, then that’s MM’s moral ambiguity in a nutshell.

The BBC can air a series as lacerating as W1A – set inside the actual BBC HQ, full of BBC middle-managers drowning in pointless BBC bureaucracy – and people read it as a sign of self-confidence. Same with NBC and 30 Rock. Now Netflix has released American Vandal, mercilessly lampooning one of its most identifiable genres – the long-form, true-crime documentary – in such a way that it forces you to begrudgingly respect the service’s commissioning editors. A small-town school has been besieged by penises. All in all, 27 have been spray-painted across buildings and cars, causing thousands of dollars’ worth of damage. The main suspect – the only suspect – is inveterate dick-painter Dylan Maxwell. When Maxwell is expelled, sophomore student Peter Maldonado launches an investigation. No stone is unturned in his quest for justice. Did Dylan really draw the junk, or is something more sinister at play? So, yes, American Vandal is basically a four-hour dick joke. Penises are its raison d’etre, and they’re referenced again and again and again until you become immune to the torrent of todgers flung in your face. Sometimes the subject changes focus – there is a side-plot about people who fart on children’s heads – but it always snaps back to dicks. Crude as it all is, my bet is that you’ll fall for American Vandal, thanks to its deep love for its source material. Like Making a Murderer, the series is rammed with cleverly paced twists and the stock characters that a true-crime doc requires. There is the (presumably) innocent suspect, the dogged investigator, the suspicious authority figure; all are so authentic, they have to come from a place of deep affection. It’s surprising how well it works. After one episode, you might write off American Vandal as a piece of one-joke, genital-obsessed fluff. But as Maldonado dives deeper, the mystery of the crime rises up above the toilet humour and takes over. By halfway, you’ll find yourself utterly invested in Maxwell’s plight. You’ll catch yourself wondering: “Could he really be the perpetrator if the graffiti has less ball hair than his own penises?” and “Why don’t I trust that beautiful girl who denies ever giving that nerd a handjob?” Clues are unlocked by deep dives into seemingly trivial details – car repair bills, the implied meaning behind a texted “Heyy!” – and every scrap of information thrusts the mystery into new light. In this sense, it’s a little like last year’s Search Party: a detective show first and a comedy second. Funny and knowing, unafraid to bite the hand that feeds it, American Vandal puts Netflix light years ahead of its competitors. Amazon hasn’t come close to producing something so winkingly self-referential; it’s such a faceless, corporate monolith, it probably couldn’t if it tried. Well played, Netflix. Where: Netflix. Length: Eight 30-minute episodes, available to stream now. Standout episode: Episode three, when Maldonado’s obsession begins to drive his friends away. If you liked American Vandal, watch: W1A (iPlayer, Netflix), People Just Do Nothing (iPlayer)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/20/nuclear-is-not-the-way-to-a-clean-energy-future","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T18:38:14Z","webTitle":"Nuclear is not the way to a clean energy future | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/20/nuclear-is-not-the-way-to-a-clean-energy-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/20/nuclear-is-not-the-way-to-a-clean-energy-future","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear is not the way to a clean energy future","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In Agneta Rising’s defence of nuclear generation (Letters, 19 September), she claims that nuclear plants have to occasionally stop for repair and maintenance. But jellyfish also get into seawater inlets, as at Torness in 2011, causing week-long shutdowns. Seaweed can block inlets shutting reactors, and operator incompetence shuts reactors and compromises radioactive cores. Torness was even narrowly missed by a crashing RAF Tornado jet. Most worrying are not such transient manageable events but risks of systematic flooding of nuclear sites. Nine UK plants are assessed by Defra as currently vulnerable to coastal flooding (Report, 7 March 2012), including all eight proposed new UK nuclear sites and numerous radioactive waste stores, operating reactors and defunct nuclear facilities. EDF claims on its website that “to protect the Hinkley Point C station from such events, the platform level of the site is set at 14 metres above sea level, behind a sea wall with a crest level of 13.5 metres”. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 produced a maximum storm surge of 8.5 metres. It is predicted that sea levels may rise by a metre by 2100. The UK government cannot actually have believed in climate change or surely they would not put future generations at such risk? I bet they believe in it now. The question is: do they care? Is it really too late to stop a retrograde, potentially catastrophic and already unaffordable UK nuclear future? Emeritus Professor Sue Roaf Oxford • I accept David Lowry’s critique that nuclear power generation is not uninterrupted or carbon-free (Letters, 18 September), and the need for back-up generating capacity. Gas cannot be the long-term, or even mid-term, solution, however. I am surprised that no mention is made of nuclear fusion as a long-term alternative to fission. A technology of profound challenges, nonetheless it is being actively researched around the world, with China allegedly investing billions in an attempt to lead the world in this. The UK has an admirable record of achievement in the field, culminating in the Joint European Torus (JET) project. However, costs are huge, hence the establishment of the European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) whereby EU nations and Switzerland can share costs, allow full participation and share benefits. Full-scale implementation of this technology is probably decades in development but offers a viable, non-carbon and sustainable support to the burgeoning solar and allied technologies. But will our muddled Brexit exclude the UK from such participation? David Bridgewater Pershore, Worcestershire • Professor Allen and colleagues’ predictions that global warming may be limited are qualified by the proviso that “other greenhouse gases such as methane are controlled” (Global warming goal of under 1.5C can be met, scientists say, 19 September). However, there is no room for complacency in the fight to reduce anthropogenic emissions and to keep warming to an absolute minimum, as recent and ongoing research suggest that any warming at all leads to disproportionately higher natural emissions of these other greenhouse gases (specifically methane and nitrous oxide). Dr Kevin Purdy Reader in microbial ecology, University of Warwick • Following the 2011 Fukushima disaster, Angela Merkel (Who’s the world’s leading eco-vandal? It’s Angela Merkel?, 20 September) closed eight nuclear power plants immediately and ruled that the remainder would close by 2022, instead of 2032. The premature closure of these plants means the construction of nine coal-fired power stations, burning dirty brown coal, with an expected life of more than 50 years. Dr John Doherty Vienna, Austria • In the letters you published about the place of nuclear power in our energy mix, there are no references to the disposal of nuclear waste. Have we forgotten so soon?

The landmark ruling by Mr Justice Peter Jackson in the court of protection marks a significant change in how end-of-life cases may be handled in future by hospitals and families in England and Wales. As long as doctors and relatives of the patient are in agreement and medical guidelines have been observed there is no need to bring a lengthy case to obtain judicial authorisation, Jackson declared. His judgment was immediately welcomed by Compassion in Dying as a helpful step towards better end-of-life care. The official solicitor, who intervened in the case, is, however, likely to appeal against the decision. The case centred on a woman, identified only as “M”, who had Huntington’s disease, a crippling genetic condition for which there is no cure. She was said to have been in a minimally conscious state in a Midlands hospital. Unusually, her mother, who supported the application to withdraw her feeding tube, was allowed to be her official “litigation friend” in the case. The request for life-sustaining treatment to be ended was heard in April. The judge gave permission in June. On 24 July, her clinically assisted nutrition and hydration (CANH) was stopped and she died, aged 50, on 4 August. She had had the disease for more than 25 years. The judge’s reasoning concerning the need for similar future cases is extremely significant. Jackson said: “On the facts of this case, I do not consider it to have been a legal requirement for the decision to withdraw CANH to have been taken by the court.” He added: “There was no statutory obligation to bring the case to court ... A mandatory litigation requirement may deflect clinicians and families from making true best-interests decisions and in some cases lead to inappropriate treatment continuing by default. “Indeed, the present case stands as an example, in that M received continued CANH that neither her doctors nor her family thought was in her best interests for almost a year until a court decision was eventually sought.” His ruling affects those deemed to be in persistent vegetative or minimally conscious states. Such cases where both doctors and all family members agree usually incur legal costs of about £30,000, Jackson said. The official solicitor, a government official appointed to act for such patients, has argued that every case should come before the courts. The first case was that of Anthony Bland, a Hillsborough victim who had been in a coma since 1989. Permission was eventually granted for doctors to end his life-prolonging treatment in 1993. Caroline Barrett, a human rights solicitor at the law firm Irwin Mitchell that represented M’s family, said: “Our client’s family witnessed a much-loved daughter, wife and mother deteriorate to the point where she no longer seemed to be aware of the world around her, or recognise her loved ones who regularly visited her in hospital and helped care for her. “Huntington’s disease is an extremely cruel disease and when her condition reached the point when she had no quality of life remaining, and appeared unaware of the world around her, her family felt that her feeding tube, which was keeping her alive, should be withdrawn. “This judgment has great legal significance in that if relatives and doctors are in agreement, and after following the medical guidelines issued by the Royal College of Physicians it is agreed that withdrawal of treatment is in the patient’s best interests, the court has confirmed that there is no legal requirement for a court order before the treatment can be withdrawn.” Sarah Wootton, the chief executive of Compassion in Dying, said: “[This] is a helpful step towards a clearer, more person-centred view of end-of-life care. When all parties – family, the hospital and treating doctors – are agreed on what someone would have wanted for their care, it seems absurd to require a costly court process to confirm this. “While the judgment is likely to be contested by the official solicitor, we believe Mr Justice Peter Jackson’s reasoning is sound. It should not be necessary to require court proceedings to respect a person’s wishes simply because they are in a persistent vegetative state or minimally conscious state.” She added that recording wishes in an advanced decision or advanced statement remained the best way for people to avoid costly and complicated court hearings over a patient’s wishes. This article was amended on 25 September 2017 to clarify that the ruling applies specifically to people on life support, not to all right-to-die cases."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/23/princess-margaret-misadventures-in-bohemia-craig-brown","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T11:00:14Z","webTitle":"‘Not amused’: Princess Margaret’s misadventures in bohemia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/23/princess-margaret-misadventures-in-bohemia-craig-brown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/23/princess-margaret-misadventures-in-bohemia-craig-brown","fields":{"headline":"‘Not amused’: Princess Margaret’s misadventures in bohemia","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"She was drawn to bohemians, just as they were drawn to her. She liked the louche hours they kept, their smoking and drinking, their refusal to do the right thing. They, in turn, enjoyed the cachet of having a real-life princess on display. It didn’t really matter that she could be difficult. After all, being difficult was her party piece. If she happened to round off an evening with a display of her famous hauteur, then it gave them something to write about. As for Princess Margaret, she never quite understood the stuff and nonsense to which she found herself drawn. Or perhaps she understood the stuff, but not the nonsense. “What is a bohemian? What does it mean?” she once asked a lady-in-waiting, in all innocence, shortly after her marriage to the fashionable photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones. “Well, Ma’am,” came the reply, “with Tony it means he won’t always turn up to lunch when he says he will.” Bohemians were, as she never quite appreciated, not entirely to be trusted: the moment you left the room they would start making their catty little remarks, and on returning home they would pen their waspish observations in their diaries, ready for publication a decade or two later. Aged 45, the princess found herself in the lions’ den, placed between Gore Vidal and Tennessee Williams at Vidal’s 50th birthday party in 1975 at Mark’s Club in Mayfair. Among her fellow guests were Kenneth Tynan, Tom Driberg, Ryan O’Neal, Jonathan Miller and Claire Bloom; Lady Antonia Fraser brought along her new boyfriend, Harold Pinter. When Tynan got up to make a speech, he addressed them all as “comrades”, as the occasion coincided with the last day of the Labour party conference in Blackpool. He wasn’t being humorous. Conversation between Williams and Princess Margaret got off to a sticky start. “I’m afraid we can’t talk to each other, Ma’am,” he said, “because we live in such different worlds”. “What world do you live in?” asked the princess. “Are you acquainted with the opera La Bohème, Ma’am? That’s my world.” As it happened, Williams’s suspicion was spot on: a few years before, the princess had confided to Cecil Beaton that she “loathed” plays such as A Streetcar Named Desire. “I hate squalor! Tennessee Williams makes me feel ill!” We know all this because Beaton jotted the conversation down in his diaries, and Williams jotted it down too, and so did Tynan, and so too did Tynan’s former wife Elaine Dundy and so did the birthday boy himself, Vidal. And, the moment her back was turned, one can imagine them imitating her squeaky, high-pitched voice. Someone who was an occasional guest at Tynan’s soirees told me that the assembled bohemians – actors, writers, artists, musicians – would kowtow to her royal highness while she was present and then make fun of her the moment she left, mimicking her general ignorance, her cackhanded opinions, her lofty put-downs, her absurd air of entitlement. The presence of the princess would endow a party with grandeur; her departure would be the signal for mimicry to commence.Beside these laughing sophisticates, the princess could sometimes appear an innocent. And yet she thirsted for their company. Throughout her adult life, she leaned towards the artistic, the camp and the modish, even going so far as to marry Armstrong-Jones, a man at the centre of that particular Venn diagram. This means that she shows up without warning, popping her head around the door of every other memoir, biography and diary written in the second half of the 20th century. It is almost as though everyone above a certain level of fame met her, at one time or another. She is there in the index of the Andy Warhol diaries, between Charles Manson and Imelda Marcos, and in the Kenneth Williams diaries, between Margate and Miriam Margolyes. One moment, she is attending a dinner party with George Melly, Edna O’Brien, Shirley Maclaine and a couple of Rolling Stones; the next, she is being feted in Hollywood, in pride of place on a table with Michael Caine, Steve McQueen, Neil Diamond, Gene Hackman, Jack Nicholson, Barbra Streisand, Clint Eastwood and Joni Mitchell. ❦ Where did it come from, her tendency towards the artistic? Margaret’s elder sister, their parents and grandparents regarded the arts as less to be enjoyed than endured. “Come over here, May, this’ll make you laugh,” George V called to his wife, Queen Mary, when he first set eyes on a Cézanne. Listening with her children to TS Eliot reading from The Waste Land at a wartime recital, the Queen Mother had to stifle her giggles. “Such a gloomy man ... we didn’t understand a word!” she explained some years later. But, as she grew up, Princess Margaret was drawn to the arts as a moth to a flame, or, if not to a flame, then at least to a cushion. Early in their lives, her elder sister had cornered the market in dutifulness, surrounding herself with the tweedy and the trusty. It was only natural, then, for the more flighty Margaret, throneless and fancy-free, to go in search of company less starchy and more glamorous. After the young princess’s thwarted affair with the divorced Peter Townsend, 16 years her senior, the bohemians sensed that she might be one of their own, the free-thinking victim of a stiff, cold-hearted establishment. At the end of October 1955, when she announced (“mindful of the Church’s teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble ...”) that she and the group captain were to part, the Daily Express carried an excitable “We, the undersigned” letter from a group of cutting-edge figures in the arts, among them Lindsay Anderson, Humphrey Lyttelton, Wolf Mankowitz, Ronald Searle and Tynan. They said they deplored the spectacle of “the Establishment in full cry”, going on to declare that these “encroachments on personal freedom” had “exposed the true extent of our national hypocrisy”. She could inspire less high-minded thoughts, too, in other members of the arts fraternity. Receiving a prize from the young Princess Margaret in 1958, the 52-year-old John Betjeman was so overwhelmed by her curvaceous presence that tears came into his eyes, a reaction duly noted by his waspish friend, Maurice Bowra, the chairman of the judges, who lampooned it in a parodic verse: “Green with lust and sick with shyness Let me lick your lacquered toes. Gosh, O gosh, your Royal Highness Put your finger up my nose ...” The dour novelist John Fowles, four years older than her, had long nursed a secret passion for her, noting in his diary in March 1951, when the princess was 20, that he found his girlfriend wanting, and “I have day-dreamed of seducing Princess Margaret”. A year later, he confessed that his first novel, The Collector, a creepy tale about a man who kidnaps and imprisons a beautiful young art student, was the fulfilment of a “lifelong fantasy of imprisoning a girl underground. I remember it used often to be famous people, Princess Margaret, various film stars. Of course, there was a main sexual motive ... a forcing of my personality as well as my penis on the girl concerned.” Over in France, the most celebrated artist in the world was also nursing a tendresse for the young princess. It was in the early 1950s that Pablo Picasso first began to have erotic dreams about her. Occasionally, he would throw her elder sister into the mix. “If they knew what I had done in my dreams with your royal ladies, they would take me to the Tower of London and chop off my head!” Picasso confided to his friend Roland Penrose. Having moved into a vast villa, La Californie, in 1955, Picasso had set his sights on the only young lady in the world he deemed worthy of it. There was, he said, just one possible bride for him: the 24-year-old Princess Margaret. Not only was she as royal as can be, but she was also his physical type: shorter than him (he was five foot four inches, so would tower over her) with beautiful skin and, he noted approvingly, good strong teeth. He made it clear to the British art dealer Douglas Cooper that this was more than a whimsy. In fact, he would not let the matter drop, growing more and more absorbed in plotting the right strategy. He would, he said, draw up a formal proposal on parchment, in French, Spanish or Latin, for Cooper to present to Her Majesty the Queen on a red velvet cushion. John Richardson, Picasso’s future biographer, was to stand by, dressed as a page or a herald, complete with trumpet. “If we didn’t have the right clothes, Picasso would make them for us: cardboard top hats – or would we prefer crowns?” recalled Richardson. “He called for stiff paper and hat elastic and proceeded to make a couple of prototypes.” Picasso’s fascination with Margaret stayed close to fever pitch for a decade or more. When Penrose escorted her round the Picasso exhibition at the Tate Gallery in 1960, he told the princess how sad the artist would be to have missed her. “She smiled enchantingly and I think I glimpsed a blush spreading beneath her tan,” Penrose reported back to Picasso. Despite the persistent efforts of Richardson, Cooper and Penrose, Picasso’s passion for Princess Margaret was never reciprocated, let alone consummated. In fact, quite the opposite. “Many years later, I told Princess Margaret the story of Picasso’s quest for her hand,” recalled Richardson. “Like her great-great grandmother Queen Victoria, she was not amused; she was outraged. She said she thought it the most disgusting thing she had ever heard.” In one way or another, the princess’s encounters with artists never quite went according to plan, perhaps because, when push came to shove, each side would refuse to kowtow to the other. They all follow the same arc: the princess arrives late, delaying dinner to catch up with her punishing schedule of drinking and smoking. Once at the table, she grows more and more relaxed. By midnight, it dawns on the rest of them that she is in it for the long haul, which means that they will be too, since protocol dictates that no one can leave before she does. Then, just as everyone else is growing more chatty and carefree, the princess abruptly remounts her high horse and upbraids a hapless guest for overfamiliarity. “When you say my sister, I imagine you are referring to her majesty the Queen?” ❦ At such moments, it is as though she was released by alcohol from the constrictions of informality. After a succession of drinks, she was at last able to enter a stiffer, grander, more subservient world, a world in which people still knew their place: the world as it used to be. And then her rudeness knew no bounds. It was almost as though, early in life, she had contracted a peculiarly royal strain of Tourette syndrome, causing the sufferer to be seized by the unstoppable urge to say the first thing that came into her head, just so long as it was sufficiently unpleasant. In 1970, the film producer Robert Evans flew to London to attend the Royal Command Performance of his film Love Story, in the presence of the Queen Mother. He was later to recall their brief encounter. “All of us stood in a receiving line as Lord Somebody introduced us, one by one, to Her Majesty and her younger daughter. It was a hell of a thrill, abruptly ending when the lovely princess shook my hand. “Tony saw Love Story in New York. Hated it.” “Fuck you too,” I said to myself, smiling back. The rebuke became her calling card, like Frank Ifield’s yodel or Tommy Cooper’s fez. An avid follower of the arts, she seemed to take delight in expressing a damning verdict after each show, often to those involved in it. Introduced to the TV producer Dennis Main Wilson, she asked him what he did. He told her he produced “a little show called Till Death Us Do Part”, to which she replied, “Isn’t that that frightfully dreary thing in the East End?” In 1990, Richard Eyre, the artistic director of the National Theatre, was obliged to stand in the foyer to await her arrival for a preview of Stephen Sondheim’s Sunday in the Park with George. “As she comes in she announces to me quite loudly that she can’t STAND Sondheim. She demonstrates this quite conspicuously throughout the evening.” Two years later, she attended a preview of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Carousel. After meeting the cast, she was escorted to the door by Eyre, who made a note of their brief conversation: ME: I’m glad you enjoyed the show. SHE: I didn’t. I can’t bear the piece. Even when given her own chance to perform, she did so very off-handedly. Playing herself at the Borsetshire Fashion Show on The Archers in 1984, she sounded curiously flat and uninvolved, almost as though she couldn’t get to grips with her own character. After the first run-through, the producer, William Smethurst said: “That’s very good, Ma’am, but do you think you could sound as if you were enjoying yourself a little more?” “Well, I wouldn’t be, would I?” replied the princess. ❦ Of course, the artists and writers had the last laugh: they always do. One or two stood up to her at the time. Francis Bacon stood at the back and heckled as she was singing a selection of cabaret songs. Finding himself at an adjacent table to where Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon were dining with Bryan Forbes, Nanette Newman and Peter Sellers, a drunken Dudley Moore staggered over to the princess, bowed low and, with a demonic gleam in his eye, slurred, “Good evening, your royal highness. I suppose a blow job is out of the question?” At a reception in the Dorchester Hotel after the royal premiere of A Hard Day’s Night, the 21-year-old George Harrison, feeling peckish, said the words that so many people, before and after, dreamed of saying: “Your highness, we really are hungry and we can’t eat until you two go.” “I see,” said the princess obediently. “Well, in that case, we’d better run.” But most waited until she was safely out of sight, or better still dead, before taking their revenge. The most spiteful were those who had once been most sycophantic. Cecil Beaton refers to her in his diaries as, successively “the poor midgety brute”, “like a wealthy seaside landlady” and “a little pocket monster”. Sir Roy Strong, whom she had welcomed to so many dinner parties over the course of three decades, calls her “tiresome, spoilt, idle and irritating” in his diaries. Leaving her service of remembrance at Westminster Abbey, he reflects that “she was such a capricious, arrogant and thoughtless woman”. Oddly enough, it was the most caustic of commentators, Gore Vidal, who remained most loyal, even though that loyalty was not always reciprocated. “The trouble with Gore,” she once observed, “is that he wants my sister’s job.” Four years after her death, Vidal declared that Princess Margaret had been “far too intelligent for her station in life”, adding that “she often had a bad press, the usual fate of wits in a literal society”. He claimed that she had once told him the reason for her unpopularity. “It was inevitable; when there are two sisters and one is the Queen who must be the source of honour and all that is good, the other must be the focus of the most creative malice, the evil sister.” The language sounds more like his, but the sentiment was undoubtedly hers. Margaret thought the world cruel for seeing her as the negative version of her sister, yet it was also how she came to define herself. In middle age, hurt by life, she retreated into camp, becoming a nightclub burlesque of her sister. But she was never camp in the same way that the Queen Mother was camp. Her camp was not arch or sentimental. It did not strive to be inclusive, or merry, or to render the world as a romp. She didn’t twinkle or sparkle. She would never say “Such fun” as though she meant it; she would take pains to inject the phrase with a dash of generalised irony. Nor was she camp in the service of something beyond herself. She had no wish to draw others in, and refused to offer them the illusion, however fleeting, of parity. Being thought “real” or “down to earth” is not what she wanted. She was of royalty, yet divorced from it; royalty set at an oblique angle, royalty through the looking glass, royalty as pastiche. At a fancy-dress party on Mustique, she wore a Valkyrie outfit, hired for her by Colin Tennant from a Los Angeles costumier, and in it she mimed an aria from the Ring Cycle. For her 50th birthday, the Tennants gave her a gold-embroidered dress from India. “I’ve always LONGED to have a dress like that,” she said. “It’s what a REAL princess would wear.” She was royalty as Hokey-Cokey, one-foot-in, one-foot-out; royalty as real yet unreal; royalty as real as you want it to be, as the mood takes you. She was cabaret camp, Ma’am Ca’amp: she was Noël Coward, cigarette holders, blusher, Jean Cocteau, winking, sighing, dark glasses, Bet Lynch, charades, Watteau, colourful cocktails at midday, ballet, silk, hoity-toity, dismissive overstatement,, arriving late, entering with a flourish, exiting with a flounce, pausing for effect, making a scene. Ma’am Ca’amp is having a drink in a cut-glass tumbler delivered to you in the swimming pool and then ordering your hostess to bring the tumbler into the pool, even though she is fully clothed. Ma’am Ca’amp has her hosts’ compliance in these antics. Ma’am Camp enjoys inverting expectations: to those expecting grace, it presents hauteur; to those wanting empathy, it delivers distance. To those in need of tradition, it offers modernity. To those in need of modernity, it offers tradition. It is languid, bored, world-weary, detached, bored, fidgety, demanding, entitled, disgruntled, bored. It carries the seeds of its own sadness and scatters them around like confetti. It is disappointment hiding behind the shield of hauteur, keeping pity at bay. It is pantomime as tragedy, and tragedy as pantomime. It is Cinderella in reverse. It is hope dashed, happiness mislaid, life mishandled. Nothing is as thrilling as they said it would be: no one is as amusing, as clever, as attractive or as interesting. The sun never shines as bright as it used to, and even the fiercest thunderstorm lacks any real sense of drama or pizzazz. When Cinderella dies, her little glass slipper is put up for auction, a memento of days of hope and innocence.

The film uses the device of a fictional film-maker grappling with a documentary portrait of his home city, a mercurial subject, as he struggles with more quotidian concerns such as the quest to find somewhere to live. Woven into the story are messages from friends – video missives from Berlin, Baghdad and Beirut – and documentary footage of the city. It’s a work of gentle, swelling sadness that mourns a spirit of artistic and creative freedom quashed and it has become something of a cause celebre, since it was effectively banned in Egypt after being unceremoniously pulled from the Cairo international film festival last year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/21/detectives-murder-on-street-famalam-bad-moves-tv-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T05:00:25Z","webTitle":"The Detectives: Murder on the Streets review – the detective documentary as Manc noir","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/21/detectives-murder-on-street-famalam-bad-moves-tv-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/21/detectives-murder-on-street-famalam-bad-moves-tv-review","fields":{"headline":"The Detectives: Murder on the Streets review – the detective documentary as Manc noir","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A city at night, artfully filmed from above, with a moody score. It might be Copenhagen – actually, it’s Manchester. Now we’re on the ground, a female detective drives across the city to where a badly burned body has been found. Again, it’s attentively filmed – through the windscreen, in the mirror, shadows and reflections. Manc noir, maybe. A gritty new police procedural? Actual police procedure in fact, documentary – The Detectives: Murder on the Streets (BBC2). Supt Emily Higham doesn’t have a complicated back story and private life, or a drink problem. She’s not a suspect herself, or up to her neck in police corruption. She isn’t a maverick, doesn’t operate erratically on whims and hunches, or alone. Well, there might be elements of these character traits, but what’s important is that she is part of a team of detectives, investigating the most serious crimes in the area. Led by Supt Jon Chadwick, they do things the right way, by the book. Sounds a bit dull? It’s so not dull. The level of contact the film-makers get is access all areas: HQ, inside the interview rooms, in the cars, at the crime scene, inside the blue and white cordon, in the helicopter even. And it’s access granted over time, so that the entire process is recorded, then turned into television in the edit suite (big shoutout to the people who did that). Sometimes it’s routine, at other moments it’s uncomfortable; but it’s always fascinating because it’s policing as policing is. The fact that it looks a bit like The Bridge doesn’t take anything away. Meteorology is even on side, as the Manchester rain turns to snow – it’s practically a monochrome murder investigation. Plus, there’s another, sadder story: a tale of two cities within one. Two Britains, even. Within sight of – but unnoticed from – smart downtown offices and yuppy flats, in a homeless camp under a railway arch, a man is murdered. An anonymous charred body, until he is identified from fingerprints from the one hand that remains unburned. Then he becomes someone, 23-year-old Daniel Smith, with friends and family who loved him and will miss him. “They are never going to get over it,” says Supt Chadwick, who now has a duty to make sure whoever killed Danny is brought to justice. And now to Famalam (BBC2). I don’t think there’s been an interesting new sketch show since Cardinal Burns. The genre itself is tired; so that if one is to work, to be original and fresh, it needs something more – sketch plus. CB brought surreality, a glorious bonkersness. What does this show have that most others unfortunately don’t? Black talent in its cast, that’s what, including Tom Moutchi and John Macmillan. And a lot of the subject matter of its sketches is about black Britishness too. It’s hit and miss – of course it is, it’s a sketch show. I haven’t seen enough Nollywood for pastiche Shola Settles the Score: Part 29 to mean a lot, even though I enjoyed it and it made me want to see more Nigerian cinema. Sometimes it hits a nerve, like a (laughable) attempt to improve the diversity of Midsomer Murders. And all the black characters getting killed off first in an alien movie. Sometimes it’s just hilarious, like Black British History, brought to you by Scribbler P, in a UK garage style. “And this started time ago / when brothers were still in black and white / and places like Jamaica hadn’t developed yet / like no Buju, no Sean Paul, no Vybz Kartel, Bounty Killer, no dancehall full stop … ” Oh, and I love the real Nigerian prince, who really does have $44m worth of gold bullion, which he really does need to transfer. And yet none of the people he emails believe him, oddly. Poor Nigeria, it gets a bit of a kicking. Bad Move (ITV) refers to Steve’s (Jack Dee) and Nicky’s (Kerry Godliman) move from the city to the country. But it might also mean the move of Dee and Pete Sinclair, who you’ll remember also co-wrote Lead Balloon, from BBC2 to ITV. Or perhaps even to them doing this at all. There’s nothing really wrong with it, it’s just a safe, predictable sitcom that could have gone out in 1987. Except that most of the gags in this opener are about not being able to get broadband, because they’re in a dip.

As fingers of blame are pointed in any number of directions, from Netflix to the political administration, the slump is more easily explained in a few individual cases; even the least discerning viewers couldn’t find much to love in films as obnoxiously misconceived as King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (Warner, 15) and Baywatch (Paramount, 15). The former sees Guy Ritchie trying out the same trick he pulled with Sherlock Holmes – meshing the lairy contemporary laddishness of his geezer crime flicks to an older-school English storytelling institution. The slick of glib confidence that got Holmes by, however, has all washed off in this incoherent scramble of booming battle choreography, comic-book history and scratchy “street” swagger – let us cast a permanent veil over David Beckham’s excruciating cameo – with poor Charlie Hunnam looking beautifully bemused at the centre of it all. Hard as it is to locate a principal problem here, it might be that Ritchie’s winking urban anachronisms in this tricked-out Arthurian universe are themselves out of date; Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels has never felt so long ago. It’s a toss-up as to whether this approach is more exhausting than the full-on, just-bants japery of Baywatch, a notional homage to the 1990s lifeguard soap that never matches its source for basic laughs or high-kitsch camp value. Director Seth Gordon aims for the same gonzo irreverence as Lord and Miller’s 21 Jump Street films, but misses the comic value in just how distantly they drifted from their TV namesake. Merely rehashing the original’s iconography in heavy air quotes doesn’t go very far and nothing could be more gleefully absurd than David Hasselhoff to begin with – so what’s the point, exactly? After that wearying double bill, the considerably quieter maritime pleasures of The Red Turtle (Studiocanal, PG) settle softly on the soul like aqueous cream. A serene marriage between the lyrical sensibilities of Studio Ghibli and Dutch animator Michaël Dudok de Wit, this wordless but feeling-soaked fable about the strange, shape-shifting bond between a marooned mariner and the giant sea turtle that keeps foiling his escape attempts begins as pictorial adventure before morphing into something sublimely romantic. Exquisitely hand-rendered in tones of coral and azure, it’s a one-off that offers rapture for adults and the smallest of patient children alike. For grown-ups who prefer their hearts squeezed in more conventional, real-world ways, French veteran Benoît Jacquot’s determinedly old-fashioned love triangle 3 Hearts (101 Films, 15), making its long-delayed UK DVD premiere, does the job plushly enough. When two dissimilar sisters (Charlotte Gainsbourg and Chiara Mastroianni) fall for the same man (Benoît Poelvoorde), the situation crumples in most of the expected ways; it’s pleasingly mellow melodrama, given a spritzer spike by Catherine Deneuve as the sisters’ mother. With Robert Redford and Jane Fonda renewing their screen partnership for Netflix – more on that next week – the rerelease of their first shared credit, Arthur Penn’s odd-angled 1966 prison-break drama The Chase (Powerhouse, 15) is cleverly timed. The film, principally a vehicle for Marlon Brando as a morally tortured sheriff tracking Redford’s honourable outlaw, remains something of a southern-fried curio: hot, bothered and overplotted, but fascinatingly preoccupied with its era’s economic politics, and feverish with star power. A rather more elegant parable of money and morality is Ermanno Olmi’s 1988 Venice Golden Lion winner The Legend of the Holy Drinker (Arrow, PG): a Joseph Roth adaptation starring Rutger Hauer as an alcoholic Parisian tramp endlessly frustrated in his quest to repay a stranger’s loan, it’s a grave, stirring gutter epic – and a welcome companion to Olmi’s recently revived beauty The Tree of the Wooden Clogs. Finally, a low-key Netflix debut for a film that stomps on to screen with far splashier intentions. Iranian-American film-maker Ana Lily Amirpour’s The Bad Batch is a vividly dyed curate’s egg. Its grisly dystopian tale of social misfits cast out of America into a fenced-off desert purgatory dips freely into assorted genres – spaghetti western, cannibal-holocaust exploitation, Mad Max fantasia – while delivering a blunt state-of-the-nation address on immigration, classism and feminism. Premiered before Trump’s election, it plays very much as a film for this moment, though it remains a cluttered, hollow-hearted muddle and a disappointment after Amirpour’s sinuous urban-vampire debut, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. Still, it has its ardent admirers – last year’s Venice jury among them – and deserved a chance for cinema audiences to pick their side."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2017/sep/25/can-you-solve-it-are-you-a-ninja-at-numbers","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T06:22:47Z","webTitle":"Can you solve it?

All you need to do is think of a number and write it in the box below. The winner is the person who submits the lowest number that no one else also submits. It costs nothing to enter and the prize is a £50 voucher to spend on books at the Guardian Bookshop. Go for it! The only rule is that the number you submit must be a positive whole number, in other words, 1 or any number greater. What’s your best strategy? If you enter the number 1, no one else can beat you by having a lower number, so this might be a good number to choose. Although if anyone else thinks along these lines and also enters 1, you both lose. So maybe entering 1 is a really bad strategy. On the other hand, if you think no one would be crazy enough to enter 1, maybe it is a good strategy. The key to this game is to outsmart everyone else who is taking part. Here is where you submit your number. (You have to enter your email so we know who the winner is but we promise we will not use the email for anything else.) In Japan this game is called the Nikoli Derby, since it was devised by a reader of Nikoli puzzle magazine. (I subsequently found out that the game is also played outside of Japan). Nikoli has for the last 35 years been the most consistently innovative puzzle magazine in the world, and has an interesting business model in that almost all of its puzzles are created by its readers. Once a year these readers get together for a party where the highlight is the Nikoli Derby. Sometimes the winning number is 1. Of course, the game today is a bit different. At the Nikoli party, guests can look around the room and estimate the number of other people taking part. I have no idea how many people will take part today. Sometimes 10,000 read this column, and sometimes 100,000 do. Who knows? I will stop the submission at 4pm today, and have the results at 5pm. Best of luck, number ninjas! My latest book Puzzle Ninja: Pit Your Wits Against The Japanese Puzzle Masters, is out it October. It contains more than 200 hand-crafted puzzles from Japan as well as profiles of prominent puzzle creators. If you pre-order Puzzle Ninja from the Guardian Bookshop it costs only £9.99 (rrp is £14.99) and you will get a free ninja pencil! I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. Send me your email if you want me to alert you each time I post a new one. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me.

The US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, emerged from the meeting conceding that Iran was abiding by the letter of the 2015 deal, but he still insisted Tehran was not fulfilling the “expectations” of the agreement. He confirmed that Donald Trump had made a decision on whether to continue to stick with the deal or walk away next month. The European Union foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, who was hosting the session of a multilateral joint commission on implementation, said there was no doubt the agreement was being kept and she warned that if any country broke it, it would be in violation of the UN Security Council resolution that enshrined the deal in international law. “All member states are considered to be bound by its implementation,” Mogherini said. “The international community cannot afford to dismantle an agreement that is working and delivering.” Referring to the worsening standoff on the Korean peninsula, she added: “We already have one potential nuclear crisis that means we do not need to go into a second one.” Mogherini said that European states would continue to stick to the agreement even if the Trump administration violated it. The other signatories to the deal - the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China – have all urged Trump not to torpedo it. Tillerson said Trump had rebuffed an inquiry from Theresa May on what he had decided to do about the agreement, when the two leaders met at the UN. “He has not shared that with anyone externally. Prime Minister May asked him if he would share it with her. He said no,” Tillerson said. Earlier on Wednesday, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said his country would respond “decisively and resolutely” if the US walked out on the deal. Rouhani told journalists Iran would feel it had a “free hand” if the US broke the agreement by re-imposing sanctions. He said one of the options would be an expansion of work on uranium enrichment, strictly limited under the agreement, but he insisted Iran would never seek to build nuclear warheads. The Iranian president said his country’s response would be heavily influenced by the manner in which European countries reacted to any US abrogation of the accord. At the meeting of the joint commission on the sidelines of the UN general assembly on Wednesday, Tillerson met his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, for the first time, the highest level encounter between the two nations, since the Trump administration took office. “It was a good opportunity to meet and shake hands,” the secretary of state said. “The tone was very matter of fact. There was no yelling. We didn’t throw shoes at one another. It was not an angry tone at all.” However, he said the US and Iran had very different interpretations of the 2015 agreement. The secretary of state said that Iran had not lived up to the expectations expressed in the document’s preface, which says the signatories “anticipate that full implementation of this JCPOA will positively contribute to regional and international peace and security.” Pointing to Iran’s role in the Syrian, Iraqi and Yemeni conflicts as well as its missile programme and cyber operations, Tillerson said: “It’s pretty difficult to say that the expectations of the parties that negotiated this agreement have been met.” None of the other signatories to the agreement agree with that interpretation. Mogherini said all such non-nuclear issues were “outside the scope of the agreement”. Donald Trump had used his speech to the general assembly on Tuesday to repeat his denunciations of the deal, agreed upon by his predecessor Barack Obama, as the “worst ever”, and encouraged Iranians to overthrow their government. The next day President Rouhani described Trump’s speech – in which he also threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea – as “ignorant, absurd and hateful rhetoric” that was “unfit to be heard at the United Nations”. He said Iran was waiting for Trump to apologize for the speech and what he described as an insult to the Iranian people. “It would be a great pity if this agreement were to be destroyed by rogue newcomers to the world of politics,” Rouhani said. “The world will have lost a great opportunity.” Rouhani said that the 2015 deal, signed by Iran and six world powers in Vienna, could become “a new model for international relations”. As a result of the agreement, Rouhani said Iran had “opened our doors to engagement and cooperation”, and he insisted Tehran would abide strictly to its terms. “Iran will not be the first country to violate the agreement,” Rouhani said. “But it will respond decisively and resolutely to its violation by any party.” “We never threaten anyone but we do not tolerate threats from anyone,” he added. “If the US breaks its commitments under the [nuclear agreement], then no other country be willing to enter into negotiations with the US.” He said Iranian officials had spent a lot of time thinking how to respond to the US walking out of the agreement, and were “considering various scenarios”. Rouhani suggested one response could be an increased level of uranium enrichment for Iranian reactors, but not an attempt to develop a nuclear warhead. On Wednesday, Trump told journalists he had made a decision on whether to withdraw certification of the 2015 nuclear deal by a congressional deadline of 15 October. The US president – a former TV reality show host who clearly enjoys building anticipation for his announcements – said “I have decided” and repeated it three times, but did not say what he had decided, telling reporters: “I’ll let you know.” If he does not certify the agreement, under which Iran radically reduced its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief, Congress would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose US sanctions. If the legislature makes no decision, the onus passes back to the president. Trump received support from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, for his stance on the nuclear agreement, and on Wednesday Saudi Arabia added its backing. The kingdom’s foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said his country did not believe Iran was abiding by the deal. “We expect the international community to do whatever it takes to ensure that Iran is in compliance,” Jubeir told reporters at the UN. It is unclear whether the agreement would survive if the US violated the deal by imposing new sanctions. Before Rouhani’s speech, Tehran had said it was willing to remain committed if the other five national signatories did the same. Speaking to journalists on Wednesday, Macron said he wanted to add new “pillars” to the international community’s relations with Iran; agree restrictions on its development of ballistic missiles; develop a follow-on deal that would apply after major elements of the existing agreement expire in 2025; and have an “open discussion with Iran about current situation in the region”. Germany’s chancellor was also frank in her criticism of Trump’s UN speech, addressing his comments on North Korea. “I am against threats of this kind,” Angela Merkel told the broadcaster Deutsche Welle, adding that her government considered any type of military solution “absolutely inappropriate”. “In my opinion, sanctions and enforcing these sanctions are the right answer. But anything else with regard to North Korea I think is wrong. And that is why we clearly disagree with the US president.” Merkel proposed that the Iran deal could work as a blueprint for a similar diplomatic effort with North Korea: “We took part in negotiating the Iran agreement, which I think is good, and better than having no agreement at all.” North Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations Ri Yong-ho dismissed Trump’s threat as “the sound of a dog barking.” Asked to comment on Trump’s mocking description of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as “Rocket Man”, he said: “I feel sorry for his aides.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2017/sep/25/reinventing-mental-health-care-putting-psychiatric-patients-in-charge-suicide-crisis-centre","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T09:35:56Z","webTitle":"I'm reinventing mental health care by putting patients in charge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2017/sep/25/reinventing-mental-health-care-putting-psychiatric-patients-in-charge-suicide-crisis-centre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2017/sep/25/reinventing-mental-health-care-putting-psychiatric-patients-in-charge-suicide-crisis-centre","fields":{"headline":"I'm reinventing mental health care by putting patients in charge","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A feeling of powerlessness dominated my experience of mental health services. And this feeling was at its worst when I was sectioned. Sectioning replicated aspects of the traumatic experience that initially caused my suicidal crisis. I felt trapped, captive and utterly out of control. I couldn’t escape. . The limited control I had over my interactions with mental health professionals also had a negative impact on me. In the psychiatrist-patient relationship, the power lies with the psychiatrist. And in the community, mental health teams decided how often I would be seen, what kind of care I would receive and when the care would end. Each of these things made me feel vulnerable. In the summer of 2012 I started to speak of my plans to set up Suicide Crisis, a centre to provide an alternative type of mental health care. However, many people were sceptical because I was a recently discharged psychiatric patient. The traumatic experience I went through was profoundly damaging and distressing. Remarkably, though, I think it changed me into the kind of person who was able to overcome the many barriers to setting up the crisis service. I developed a determination and a tenacity, which I didn’t have before. It’s entirely possible that someone can be both a psychiatric patient and a competent professional. But sometimes I’ve felt that people find this difficult to understand. In the four-and-a-half years we’ve been providing services, we’ve never had a suicide of a client under our care. Our work has received national attention in the last 18 months. We have given oral evidence about our crisis centre to the health select committee and presented to the National Suicide Prevention Strategy Advisory Group, which is run by Prof Louis Appleby, the government adviser on suicide. We are approached regularly by NHS professionals and commissioners, who refer to our centre as an example of best practice. Perhaps society can start to think of people with experience of mental illness as having valuable knowledge of what works and what doesn’t, which helps them succeed in this field. There are times when my lived experience is as important as my formal training. I have a deep understanding of what it is like to be in crisis. My experience has even helped when assessing clients’ suicide risks, as in the case of Aidan*, a patient at the centre. Aidan had been very depressed, then one day he came to his appointment with us and seemed very happy, almost euphoric. I recognised that sense of exhilaration, which a person may feel when they have made a decision to end their life, because I experienced that same euphoria myself in 2012. I recall it as a very intense experience, where all my senses were heightened. I was sure I would soon be leaving this world and could appreciate every aspect of it in what I thought were my remaining hours. Aidan’s risk was clearly high, and we provided intensive support to ensure his survival. I immediately contacted NHS services so they could assess whether he needed to be sectioned. He wasn’t sectioned, but the NHS crisis team kept in contact with him that night. After that, he asked us to support him and we saw him on a daily basis. We kept in regular contact with his mental health team and he continued to see them every week. My experience of feeling disempowered when using mental health services is the reason we ensure our clients have a greater degree of control. They decide how often they see us, what kind of care they receive and when they are ready to leave us. Our male clients say they find this particularly helpful. They can feel especially vulnerable when they seek help; putting them in control helps to counteract this. Early on we took the decision to employ an advising psychiatrist and other advising clinicians. They have expertise that we don’t. They advise us on individual client cases, which can be complex. And they helped us create links with the local mental health service. However, the ethos of the charity and the way our service is set up and run are all from a lived experience perspective. We are in regular contact with local mental health services because we are often helping the same people. Clients often feel able to tell us things they may not feel able to disclose to their mental health team. In such cases, we are keen to share that information, with the client’s permission. The power balance between patients and mental health professionals has effectively been reinvented in our organisation. “You’re my boss,” our advising psychiatrist tells me. However, I prefer to see it as a levelling of power, a greater equality. We all have huge respect for each other’s different strengths and abilities. We all learn from each other. *Identifying details have been changed Joy Hibbins is founder and chief executive of Suicide Crisis In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

The Premier League champions have said they comply with “all Fifa statutes and regulations when recruiting players” but the world governing body has been alerted to alleged impropriety and says it is looking into it. “We can confirm that an investigation is ongoing,” Fifa said in a statement. “We cannot provide any details concerning the matters under investigation.” Fifa rules prohibit the international transfer of players under the age of 18 unless their parents have emigrated for reasons not connected to football or both the player and club are based within 50km of a national border. The only other exception is for transfers within either the European Union or European Economic Area, where the minimum age is 16. In those cases, clubs must still ensure that the player continues his education and studies for an alternative career, as well as making sure he has a high living standard. Atlético Madrid are under a transfer ban for breaching Fifa rules over the signing of minors. They appealed against the decision but it was upheld by the court of arbitration for sport. Real Madrid were also punished last year but they had their ban reduced from two transfer windows to one. Chelsea have been investigated twice previously over their signing of minors. They were banned from signing players for two transfers windows in 2009, over their conduct in the deal that took the attacking midfielder Gaël Kakuta from Lens to Stamford Bridge in 2007, although the penalty was overturned on appeal. They were also investigated over the transfer of Bertrand Traoré, the Burkina Faso forward, after pictures emerged of him playing for the club when he was 16 before he had international clearance. Traoré signed for Chelsea after his 18th birthday. Manchester City and Liverpool have been punished by the Premier League this year for breaches of the rules regarding the signing of domestic academy players. Both of them were found to have tapped up young players. City were banned from signing academy players for two years and fined £300,000.

Hardinge is at the forefront of children’s fiction, with a rich, unusual taste for language, an eye for the striking and apt image and stories that reveal a staunch defence of the weak and the oppressed. What is more, she combines a subtle, intellectual approach with plots that swoop and soar. Her darkly splendid new book is a worthy follow-up to The Lie Tree, set just before the start of the English civil war. Hardinge has always been interested in splits and doubles; in how a character, apparently good, can be only a sliver away from being bad; in how perceptions and opinions shift according to perspective and situation. Her heroine in Cuckoo Song was a fairy changeling, unaware that she had been created and placed into the family that she thought hers; Faith in The Lie Tree must fight against the strictures placed on women in the 19th century, while unpicking a web of falsehoods around her scientist father. Makepeace, the protagonist of this new book, also faces a mystery around her birth, and is surrounded by a similar web of lies. All these girls are born into power structures that appear to constrict; all learn that things can be made more malleable. The central themes of A Skinful of Shadows are inheritance and power, and how these link to governance both literal and psychological. An aristocratic family, the Fellmottes, possess an unusual ability. They can catch ghosts and absorb them into their own minds. Makepeace, being a bastard daughter, is tracked down by the family, who wish to protect their property and bloodline at all costs. And yet, as Makepeace discovers, her mother fled from them, and, as her last wish, begs her to flee too. Hardinge is adept and vivid in creating a sense of terrifying, apparently permanent grandeur: the Fellmotte house, Grizehayes, is ancient, implacable and vast; Lady April, one of the family, treads over the outstretched palms of an underling rather than get her dress wet. It is not hard to see a critique of aristocracy: should some families, here quite literally in thrall to their ancestors through their ghosts, be any more suited to power than others? The damage done as a result is incalculable. Hardinge gives the opposing Puritans a similar kind of treatment, with their inconsistencies and excesses laid bare, and it is to her great credit that she delineates the attractions and horrors of both sides, symbolised in the characters of James, a bastard tempted by nobility, and Symond, the noble heir who seems to shift allegiance. Makepeace, travelling from one camp to the other, reads news sheets of the same battles from both sides, each proclaiming loudly that they, and only they, are right. The problem of echo chambers and fake news is an old one. The most appealing characters here are the in-between ones: the spies, roustabouts and uncoverers of nuggets of information, those who risk their lives not in the service of ideology, but in the service of life itself. Thanks to large amounts of gold, the Fellmotte family have managed to persuade Charles I not to expose their supernatural dealings. Makepeace must navigate these tricky territories, while staying true to her brother James and managing the increasing number of ghosts that pop into her head (including a wonderfully sniffy doctor, a reformed Puritan and another, more mysterious being). What gives the book its strength is the essential fairytale backbone of a girl going out into the world to achieve, and to reach a higher level of existence. Perhaps in response to the Puritan elements in the story, Hardinge’s language in this novel is less elaborate than it has been, resulting in a cleaner, sharper diction. There are many wonderful moments that have the unmistakable Hardinge tang. Makepeace accidentally absorbs the ghost of a bear, symbolising both the uncontrollable id that she must subdue and the violence threatening to tear apart the country in “surprising zigzags”. She develops a deep rapport with her beastly fellow traveller, but often it’s “like reasoning with a thundercloud”. The pull of the story is towards subversion, and Makepeace ends by reappropriating her inherited gifts, and using them not to provide a vessel for antiquated mores, but to succour the weak and the dispossessed. This is a wonderful, resonant narrative whose subtlety and insight will challenge, entertain and enchant.

Complying often requires great expense and real discomfort (stilettos, shaping underwear, trousers that no longer accommodate your girth, and so on). Forefront in the rulebook, though, is the commandment that a woman must not upstage the bride. And this weekend, it was contravened in spectacular style by six women who turned up to a wedding in Sydney all wearing the same £95 lace dress. A picture of the sextet, predictably, went viral at high velocity. The women were not bridesmaids, nor was it planned. “We all saw the funny side of it,” insisted one of the group, although despite the affected nonchalance, this was undeniably toe-curling for all involved (of course, men seem to be fine with wearing identical navy or grey suits, but that is a discussion for another day). In this spirit, here is a guide to styling out wedding fashion mishaps. Matchy matchy The Australian women did have the right idea: the first thing you must do is note this mishap publicly, probably with an Instagram post (#TwinningIsWinning). Skirting around your doppelganger all evening will make you look as ashamed as you really are about your pedestrian taste in clothing. Then, modify your outfit: borrow a floral centrepiece from the table, or fashion a crude badge from confetti. NB: as the evening progresses, ensure your drunk significant other does not accidentally grope the wrong person. Wear and tear If you rip something, make like Kate Moss: the supermodel’s quick customisation of a damaged champagne-coloured Dior dress at a 2007 party is the stuff of lore. If you’re bold, and carry a pair of scissors (who doesn’t?), you could try some slashing, otherwise, do some tucking and tying to conceal the hole. Life is pain You swore you would not wear shoes that left your feet lacerated, but have, obviously, done so. To have any fun, you must do that bobbing dancing that puts great pressure on the knees, but limits the movement of the feet and toes you can no longer feel. When forced to go anywhere, walk at the glacial pace of a visiting, elderly dignitary. Thrills and spills Less than a minute in to the reception and you have sluiced a glass of red wine all down your front, or smeared soap on your trousers. You look grubby, and must act, lest someone adds a picture of you to Facebook with a mean-spirited caption. Obviously, attempt stain removal in the bathrooms – you might look like you’ve soiled yourself for 15 minutes, but dance vigorously and you will quickly dry. Otherwise, hold the order of service in front of the stain for the rest of the reception.

Following meetings with all the major players in the EU’s negotiating team, Keir Starmer said “high expectations” in Brussels over the prime minister’s speech in Florence on Friday were tempered by concerns over her weakness. Starmer said that those he had met during high level meetings in Brussels on Wednesday, including the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, his deputy Sabine Weyand, and Martin Selmayr, the all-powerful chief of staff to EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, were deeply sceptical of May’s ability to “follow through” on any of her promises. “They want to see real progress, and they want follow through,” Starmer said. “Not a speech and nothing else.” With reference to the speech at last year’s Conservative party conference, where May played to the Tory crowd, including a criticism of “citizens of the world” as being “citizens of nowhere”, Starmer said Brussels were fearful of a rerun at this year’s conference in Manchester. Starmer said: “They were very struck by what she said at conference last year and they are very conscious that she is making a speech on Friday and she is making another speech in two weeks [at Conservative party conference]. They will take some convincing that Friday is enough if there is not consistency. If it is a position it has got to be a real position.” Starmer said that the EU expected to hear May “talking about the money”. On Wednesday it was reported by the Financial Times that Germany had been informed by the British government to expect Theresa May this week to offer to fill a post-Brexit EU budget gap of at least €20bn. In an attempt to break the stalemate, UK officials are said to have indicated that no member state will have to pay more into the EU budget or receive less money from it until 2020. Starmer said he was not aware that such figures had been discussed with the commission. With regard to the comments from the foreign secretary last week, in which Johnson said there would be no payments for access to the single market, Starmer added of the EU negotiating team’s position: “I’m not sure what Boris said is taken that seriously. “They want progress, and they are concerned about methodology [on the financial settlement] ... There is clearly cause for concern about the rate of progress in Brussels just as there is in the UK. And the ball is very much in the prime minister’s court.” Starmer went on to say that suggestions from some in the Conservative party that there was the possibility of a bespoke deal for the transition period, rather than a continuation of the status quo, as proposed by Labour and the chancellor, Phillip Hammond, were also damned to fail. “There is a general recognition [in Brussels] that the Labour party has got itself in the right position and sensible position on transitional arrangements,” he said. “No-one is talking in terms of bespoke deals.” Starmer said that it was clear that the prime minister would need to overcome the misgivings of her foreign secretary about a transition period in which the UK continued to enjoy the benefits of the status quo and paying into the budget as a price for access. “She is going to have to face down Boris Johnson and his fantasy version of Brexit, particularly in relation to financial liabilities,” Starmer said. “And she needs to abandon some of her inflexible red lines. The worst outcome is that she says nothing, inflames the situation, making progress less likely.” Starmer said the government had promised that the issue of citizens’ rights would have a “quick and easy resolution” but a settlement “will only happen if the prime minister gives up on her ideological red line that the only court that would have jurisdiction arising would be the supreme court in London – that is not an international resolution body.” Starmer said Labour was not putting a figure on the sum the UK should pay Brussels to settle the accounts, but he insisted that the British government should provide the EU with clear guidance on its opening analysis of what it was willing to pay. He said: “We have always said the UK should honour its international obligations. I think the government is right not to put a figure on it, I don’t think the government or the EU should put a figure on it, and I have never challenged David Davis on that. But it is important that the framework is agreed. At the moment there is no clarity on the approach the UK is going to take. A methodology is needed and it is needed essentially by next week.” The promise of a €20bn cheque from the UK would inject new momentum into next week’s Brexit talks, but there are signs that it would still fall short of the EU’s demands. “The offer may allow us to start talking in greater detail on the financial settlement. However, we think that we are still far from the landing zone,” one EU official told the Guardian."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/20/two-britain-first-leaders-golding-fransen-charged-with-religiously-aggravated-harassment","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T14:02:52Z","webTitle":"Two Britain First leaders charged with religiously aggravated harassment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/20/two-britain-first-leaders-golding-fransen-charged-with-religiously-aggravated-harassment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/20/two-britain-first-leaders-golding-fransen-charged-with-religiously-aggravated-harassment","fields":{"headline":"Two Britain First leaders charged with religiously aggravated harassment","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Two leading members of the far-right group Britain First have been charged with causing religiously aggravated harassment, police have said.

Publisher Orion has gathered 46 contributors for its collection Goodbye, Europe, out on 16 November. A mix of letters, fiction, illustrations and reminiscences, it is described by the publisher as an examination of “the political, emotional, historical, gastronomic and cultural influence of Europe on the United Kingdom”. Shriver has contributed a short story about a relationship ending in the wake of the referendum, Jessie Burton has written about her first visit to the continent, Perry of her love affair with Prague, and Robert MacFarlane about the flight paths of the migrant bird species that the UK shares with Europe. How to Stop Time novelist Matt Haig writes in the anthology of how he “would never understand why anyone would want to shrink their identity rather than broaden it”, while writer and Orange prize founder Kate Mosse describes Brexit as “an act of unparalleled national self harm, brought about by arrogance, incompetence, dishonesty [which] has, in the space of 14 months, unleashed an alarming level of xenophobia and ugliness”. While most of the contributors are pro-Europe, Rees-Mogg emphatically is not. The Conservative MP, who was recently chosen as the best candidate to be the next party leader in a survey of Tory supporters, writes in the anthology that: “Leaving the European Union is a great liberation for the United Kingdom, as worthy for celebration as victory at Waterloo or the Glorious Revolution.” “It fits the democratic spirit of the British and was a vote for freedom,” he says, adding that “it was bold of the electorate to ignore the experts”. Rees-Mogg’s views sit uncomfortably alongside those of Goodbye, Europe’s other writers. Cathy Rentzenbrink, the author of the bestselling memoir The Last Act of Love, said on Wednesday that she decided to contribute to the collection because she “wanted to write about how, as a grateful immigrant’s daughter, I’d always rather liked this country – flawed but not bad – and how angry I feel about Brexit, how it feels like a coup, and what it feels like to have my Dutch husband who has lived here since 2000 be rebranded as an EU National”. “A few days before I was asked to contribute, my seven-year-old son came home from school and said: ‘Mummy, if you die, will Daddy and I have to go and live in Holland?’ I wanted to write about the rage I feel at what has happened, how embarrassed I am every time one of our stupid, venal politicians crosses the channel and how powerless I feel to do anything about it,” she said. Haig, who in his essay recalls the French pen pals he wrote to as a child and the happy times he spent in France as a teenager, said that: “There has never been a more poignant and appropriate time to remind ourselves of our European identity.” “We often see Europe in the abstract, so it is good to take a fresh and personal look at all the cultural and emotional benefits of being part of this endlessly fascinating continent. To me and many others Europe isn’t about politicians. It’s about pen friends, and good wine, pizza and tapas, football and flirting and music, Flaubert and Lorca and Da Vinci and a shared history going back millennia. I hope this book will be a little piece of group therapy for the potentially choppy waters ahead,” he said. Alongside Rees-Mogg, the pro-Brexit contributors include Shriver, Ben Collins (the former “Stig” from Top Gear), who considers “the Napoleonic origins of driving on the left-hand side of the road”, and the historian Andrew Roberts. “The idea for the collection came about from feeling that we’ve got plenty of current affairs coverage, and that what I really needed was to hear from some of the best writers working today on the personal, rather than political, side of the debate,” said Orion editor Emad Akhtar. “It’s as much about what will never change, about things that politics can’t touch or transform.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/21/police-missed-multiple-chances-help-james-herbert-died-cell-ipcc","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T05:00:25Z","webTitle":"IPCC: police had series of chances to help man who died after arrest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/21/police-missed-multiple-chances-help-james-herbert-died-cell-ipcc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/21/police-missed-multiple-chances-help-james-herbert-died-cell-ipcc","fields":{"headline":"IPCC: police had series of chances to help man who died after arrest","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Police missed a string of opportunities to help a young man with mental health problems who died after he was restrained by officers, locked up in a van on a hot night and then left naked in a cell, a watchdog has said. Avon and Somerset police knew James Herbert, 25, was ill, but rather than treat it as a medical emergency when he was seen acting strangely, they secured him with handcuffs and leg restraints, and drove him to a custody suite 45 minutes away. He suffered a cardiac arrest and died. In its report, called six missed chances, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said the outcome for Herbert, a data recovery engineer, could have been “very different” if the officers involved had taken alternative actions. As well as flagging up concerns about how Herbert was dealt with by officers when he was detained, the report criticised the force for the way in which it acted when he fell critically ill. While he was receiving emergency treatment in the cell, police contacted his mother, Barbara Montgomery, to glean further information from her, but she was not told about his collapse, or later that he had been taken to hospital. The next time police contacted Herbert’s parents, it was about 1.30am, roughly five hours later, to notify them that he had died. By this time, Avon and Somerset police had informed its press and media department of his death, and had cordoned off the part of Bath Road in Wells where Herbert had been restrained, around the corner from his mother’s house. The IPCC deputy chair Rachel Cerfontyne said an important factor was that Herbert’s mental health condition had been known to police for more than a year. “On the day of his death, James’s disturbed mental state was apparent to the police from several earlier incidents,” she said. “Yet this vital knowledge did not inform how he was dealt with during his final contact.” In his “agitated and vulnerable state”, Cerfontyne said, Herbert must have been terrified when he was detained. “There were, at this point, a number of vital warning signs and risk factors, but these were either missed by the police or not taken into consideration,” she said. “It was a hot June day and James was wearing a heavy winter coat, which restricted his ability to move and must have led to him becoming very overheated, especially in his distressed and agitated state. “Once restrained, James’s physical condition deteriorated rapidly: he was out of breath, clammy with sweat and red faced, but he was not recognised as a medical emergency. The police were given information which indicated he may have taken drugs [new psychoactive substances]. “He needed to go to hospital, but instead, he was carried to a police van and put into a cramped, caged area. He then endured a lengthy journey of about 45 minutes, with speeds of up to 50 or 60mph at certain points during the journey, while in limb restraints, alone and unsecured in the back of the van.” Cerfontyne said that at Yeovil police station, a “reception committee” of officers was waiting, ready to help those transporting James get him into a cell. “They were not expecting or prepared for the arrival of a seriously ill young man, and they did not treat him as such. James was carried face down on a blanket to a police cell, where he was left naked on a bare cement floor,” she said. “He was unresponsive and remained so, but rather than call for urgent medical assistance, officers withdrew, leaving him alone.” The report makes a series of recommendations about how police should act in such a situation. Cerfontyne said she was reassured that Avon and Somerset police had made “significant changes” since Herbert’s death in 2010, but said other forces had not followed suit. “While it is not possible to say what would have happened if the missed opportunities had been taken, it is clear the outcome could have been very different,” she said. Nikki Watson, an assistant chief constable with Avon and Somerset police, said fundamental changes had been made. “All too often, the police service has been the service of last resort for people in mental health crisis when all else fails, and the events leading up to James’s tragic death [are] a clear example of this,” she said. “This is why we have to work together with our partner agencies to improve the multi-agency response, so that people in mental health crisis are given the support they need and deserve.” James’s father, Tony Herbert, backed the report. “James’s family believe it to be potentially groundbreaking and important. That will be the case if police forces use it as a case study to inform training and policy. If so, James’s avoidable and tragic death may save future lives,” he said. “When somebody dies in state custody, the investigation process needs to bring accountability and learning to be truly effective. In terms of accountability, no institution or person responsible for the actions that caused James to die has been brought to account. “Seven years of denial, truth manipulation and defensiveness have left us hurt and angry. James deserved better and of course, lessons that could have been learned seven years ago and could have saved lives have been lost in the fog.” Deborah Coles, the director of the charity Inquest, which has been supporting his family, said: “James was detained by the police for his safety. He should have been treated as a patient in need of medical care. Instead, he suffered a traumatic but entirely preventable death involving prolonged and brutal restraint.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/24/why-lack-of-sleep-health-worst-enemy-matthew-walker-why-we-sleep","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T07:00:39Z","webTitle":"'Sleep should be prescribed': what those late nights out could be costing you","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/24/why-lack-of-sleep-health-worst-enemy-matthew-walker-why-we-sleep","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/24/why-lack-of-sleep-health-worst-enemy-matthew-walker-why-we-sleep","fields":{"headline":"'Sleep should be prescribed': what those late nights out could be costing you","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Matthew Walker has learned to dread the question “What do you do?” At parties, it signals the end of his evening; thereafter, his new acquaintance will inevitably cling to him like ivy. On an aeroplane, it usually means that while everyone else watches movies or reads a thriller, he will find himself running an hours-long salon for the benefit of passengers and crew alike. “I’ve begun to lie,” he says. “Seriously. I just tell people I’m a dolphin trainer. It’s better for everyone.” Walker is a sleep scientist. To be specific, he is the director of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley, a research institute whose goal – possibly unachievable – is to understand everything about sleep’s impact on us, from birth to death, in sickness and health. No wonder, then, that people long for his counsel. As the line between work and leisure grows ever more blurred, rare is the person who doesn’t worry about their sleep. But even as we contemplate the shadows beneath our eyes, most of us don’t know the half of it – and perhaps this is the real reason he has stopped telling strangers how he makes his living. When Walker talks about sleep he can’t, in all conscience, limit himself to whispering comforting nothings about camomile tea and warm baths. It’s his conviction that we are in the midst of a “catastrophic sleep-loss epidemic”, the consequences of which are far graver than any of us could imagine. This situation, he believes, is only likely to change if government gets involved. Walker has spent the last four and a half years writing Why We Sleep, a complex but urgent book that examines the effects of this epidemic close up, the idea being that once people know of the powerful links between sleep loss and, among other things, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity and poor mental health, they will try harder to get the recommended eight hours a night (sleep deprivation, amazing as this may sound to Donald Trump types, constitutes anything less than seven hours). But, in the end, the individual can achieve only so much. Walker wants major institutions and law-makers to take up his ideas, too. “No aspect of our biology is left unscathed by sleep deprivation,” he says. “It sinks down into every possible nook and cranny. And yet no one is doing anything about it. Things have to change: in the workplace and our communities, our homes and families. But when did you ever see an NHS poster urging sleep on people? When did a doctor prescribe, not sleeping pills, but sleep itself? It needs to be prioritised, even incentivised. Sleep loss costs the UK economy over £30bn a year in lost revenue, or 2% of GDP. I could double the NHS budget if only they would institute policies to mandate or powerfully encourage sleep.” Why, exactly, are we so sleep-deprived? What has happened over the course of the last 75 years? In 1942, less than 8% of the population was trying to survive on six hours or less sleep a night; in 2017, almost one in two people is. The reasons are seemingly obvious. “First, we electrified the night,” Walker says. “Light is a profound degrader of our sleep. Second, there is the issue of work: not only the porous borders between when you start and finish, but longer commuter times, too. No one wants to give up time with their family or entertainment, so they give up sleep instead. And anxiety plays a part. We’re a lonelier, more depressed society. Alcohol and caffeine are more widely available. All these are the enemies of sleep.” But Walker believes, too, that in the developed world sleep is strongly associated with weakness, even shame. “We have stigmatised sleep with the label of laziness. We want to seem busy, and one way we express that is by proclaiming how little sleep we’re getting. It’s a badge of honour. When I give lectures, people will wait behind until there is no one around and then tell me quietly: ‘I seem to be one of those people who need eight or nine hours’ sleep.’ It’s embarrassing to say it in public. They would rather wait 45 minutes for the confessional. They’re convinced that they’re abnormal, and why wouldn’t they be? We chastise people for sleeping what are, after all, only sufficient amounts. We think of them as slothful. No one would look at an infant baby asleep, and say ‘What a lazy baby!’ We know sleeping is non-negotiable for a baby. But that notion is quickly abandoned [as we grow up]. Humans are the only species that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent reason.” In case you’re wondering, the number of people who can survive on five hours of sleep or less without any impairment, expressed as a percent of the population and rounded to a whole number, is zero. The world of sleep science is still relatively small. But it is growing exponentially, thanks both to demand (the multifarious and growing pressures caused by the epidemic) and to new technology (such as electrical and magnetic brain stimulators), which enables researchers to have what Walker describes as “VIP access” to the sleeping brain. Walker, who is 44 and was born in Liverpool, has been in the field for more than 20 years, having published his first research paper at the age of just 21. “I would love to tell you that I was fascinated by conscious states from childhood,” he says. “But in truth, it was accidental.” He started out studying for a medical degree in Nottingham. But having discovered that doctoring wasn’t for him – he was more enthralled by questions than by answers – he switched to neuroscience, and after graduation, began a PhD in neurophysiology supported by the Medical Research Council. It was while working on this that he stumbled into the realm of sleep. “I was looking at the brainwave patterns of people with different forms of dementia, but I was failing miserably at finding any difference between them,” he recalls now. One night, however, he read a scientific paper that changed everything. It described which parts of the brain were being attacked by these different types of dementia: “Some were attacking parts of the brain that had to do with controlled sleep, while other types left those sleep centres unaffected. I realised my mistake. I had been measuring the brainwave activity of my patients while they were awake, when I should have been doing so while they were asleep.” Over the next six months, Walker taught himself how to set up a sleep laboratory and, sure enough, the recordings he made in it subsequently spoke loudly of a clear difference between patients. Sleep, it seemed, could be a new early diagnostic litmus test for different subtypes of dementia. After this, sleep became his obsession. “Only then did I ask: what is this thing called sleep, and what does it do? I was always curious, annoyingly so, but when I started to read about sleep, I would look up and hours would have gone by. No one could answer the simple question: why do we sleep? That seemed to me to be the greatest scientific mystery. I was going to attack it, and I was going to do that in two years. But I was naive. I didn’t realise that some of the greatest scientific minds had been trying to do the same thing for their entire careers. That was two decades ago, and I’m still cracking away.” After gaining his doctorate, he moved to the US. Formerly a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, he is now professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California. Does his obsession extend to the bedroom? Does he take his own advice when it comes to sleep? “Yes. I give myself a non-negotiable eight-hour sleep opportunity every night, and I keep very regular hours: if there is one thing I tell people, it’s to go to bed and to wake up at the same time every day, no matter what. I take my sleep incredibly seriously because I have seen the evidence. Once you know that after just one night of only four or five hours’ sleep, your natural killer cells – the ones that attack the cancer cells that appear in your body every day – drop by 70%, or that a lack of sleep is linked to cancer of the bowel, prostate and breast, or even just that the World Health Organisation has classed any form of night-time shift work as a probable carcinogen, how could you do anything else?” There is, however, a sting in the tale. Should his eyelids fail to close, Walker admits that he can be a touch “Woody Allen-neurotic”. When, for instance, he came to London over the summer, he found himself jet-lagged and wide awake in his hotel room at two o’clock in the morning. His problem then, as always in these situations, was that he knew too much. His brain began to race. “I thought: my orexin isn’t being turned off, the sensory gate of my thalamus is wedged open, my dorsolateral prefrontal cortex won’t shut down, and my melatonin surge won’t happen for another seven hours.” What did he do? In the end, it seems, even world experts in sleep act just like the rest of us when struck by the curse of insomnia. He turned on a light and read for a while. Will Why We Sleep have the impact its author hopes? I’m not sure: the science bits, it must be said, require some concentration. But what I can tell you is that it had a powerful effect on me. After reading it, I was absolutely determined to go to bed earlier – a regime to which I am sticking determinedly. In a way, I was prepared for this. I first encountered Walker some months ago, when he spoke at an event at Somerset House in London, and he struck me then as both passionate and convincing (our later interview takes place via Skype from the basement of his “sleep centre”, a spot which, with its bedrooms off a long corridor, apparently resembles the ward of a private hospital). But in another way, it was unexpected. I am mostly immune to health advice. Inside my head, there is always a voice that says “just enjoy life while it lasts”. The evidence Walker presents, however, is enough to send anyone early to bed. It’s no kind of choice at all. Without sleep, there is low energy and disease. With sleep, there is vitality and health. More than 20 large scale epidemiological studies all report the same clear relationship: the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life. To take just one example, adults aged 45 years or older who sleep less than six hours a night are 200% more likely to have a heart attack or stroke in their lifetime, as compared with those sleeping seven or eight hours a night (part of the reason for this has to do with blood pressure: even just one night of modest sleep reduction will speed the rate of a person’s heart, hour upon hour, and significantly increase their blood pressure). A lack of sleep also appears to hijack the body’s effective control of blood sugar, the cells of the sleep-deprived appearing, in experiments, to become less responsive to insulin, and thus to cause a prediabetic state of hyperglycaemia. When your sleep becomes short, moreover, you are susceptible to weight gain. Among the reasons for this are the fact that inadequate sleep decreases levels of the satiety-signalling hormone, leptin, and increases levels of the hunger-signalling hormone, ghrelin. “I’m not going to say that the obesity crisis is caused by the sleep-loss epidemic alone,” says Walker. “It’s not. However, processed food and sedentary lifestyles do not adequately explain its rise. Something is missing. It’s now clear that sleep is that third ingredient.” Tiredness, of course, also affects motivation. Sleep has a powerful effect on the immune system, which is why, when we have flu, our first instinct is to go to bed: our body is trying to sleep itself well. Reduce sleep even for a single night, and your resilience is drastically reduced. If you are tired, you are more likely to catch a cold. The well-rested also respond better to the flu vaccine. As Walker has already said, more gravely, studies show that short sleep can affect our cancer-fighting immune cells. A number of epidemiological studies have reported that night-time shift work and the disruption to circadian sleep and rhythms that it causes increase the odds of developing cancers including breast, prostate, endometrium and colon. Getting too little sleep across the adult lifespan will significantly raise your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The reasons for this are difficult to summarise, but in essence it has to do with the amyloid deposits (a toxin protein) that accumulate in the brains of those suffering from the disease, killing the surrounding cells. During deep sleep, such deposits are effectively cleaned from the brain. What occurs in an Alzheimer’s patient is a kind of vicious circle. Without sufficient sleep, these plaques build up, especially in the brain’s deep-sleep-generating regions, attacking and degrading them. The loss of deep sleep caused by this assault therefore lessens our ability to remove them from the brain at night. More amyloid, less deep sleep; less deep sleep, more amyloid, and so on. (In his book, Walker notes “unscientifically” that he has always found it curious that Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, both of whom were vocal about how little sleep they needed, both went on to develop the disease; it is, moreover, a myth that older adults need less sleep.) Away from dementia, sleep aids our ability to make new memories, and restores our capacity for learning. And then there is sleep’s effect on mental health. When your mother told you that everything would look better in the morning, she was wise. Walker’s book includes a long section on dreams (which, says Walker, contrary to Dr Freud, cannot be analysed). Here he details the various ways in which the dream state connects to creativity. He also suggests that dreaming is a soothing balm. If we sleep to remember (see above), then we also sleep to forget. Deep sleep – the part when we begin to dream – is a therapeutic state during which we cast off the emotional charge of our experiences, making them easier to bear. Sleep, or a lack of it, also affects our mood more generally. Brain scans carried out by Walker revealed a 60% amplification in the reactivity of the amygdala – a key spot for triggering anger and rage – in those who were sleep-deprived. In children, sleeplessness has been linked to aggression and bullying; in adolescents, to suicidal thoughts. Insufficient sleep is also associated with relapse in addiction disorders. A prevailing view in psychiatry is that mental disorders cause sleep disruption. But Walker believes it is, in fact, a two-way street. Regulated sleep can improve the health of, for instance, those with bipolar disorder. I’ve mentioned deep sleep in this (too brief) summary several times. What is it, exactly? We sleep in 90-minute cycles, and it’s only towards the end of each one of these that we go into deep sleep. Each cycle comprises two kinds of sleep. First, there is NREM sleep (non-rapid eye movement sleep); this is then followed by REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. When Walker talks about these cycles, which still have their mysteries, his voice changes. He sounds bewitched, almost dazed. “During NREM sleep, your brain goes into this incredible synchronised pattern of rhythmic chanting,” he says. “There’s a remarkable unity across the surface of the brain, like a deep, slow mantra. Researchers were once fooled that this state was similar to a coma. But nothing could be further from the truth. Vast amounts of memory processing is going on. To produce these brainwaves, hundreds of thousands of cells all sing together, and then go silent, and on and on. Meanwhile, your body settles into this lovely low state of energy, the best blood-pressure medicine you could ever hope for. REM sleep, on the other hand, is sometimes known as paradoxical sleep, because the brain patterns are identical to when you’re awake. It’s an incredibly active brain state. Your heart and nervous system go through spurts of activity: we’re still not exactly sure why.” Does the 90-minute cycle mean that so-called power naps are worthless? “They can take the edge off basic sleepiness. But you need 90 minutes to get to deep sleep, and one cycle isn’t enough to do all the work. You need four or five cycles to get all the benefit.” Is it possible to have too much sleep? This is unclear. “There is no good evidence at the moment. But I do think 14 hours is too much. Too much water can kill you, and too much food, and I think ultimately the same will prove to be true for sleep.” How is it possible to tell if a person is sleep-deprived? Walker thinks we should trust our instincts. Those who would sleep on if their alarm clock was turned off are simply not getting enough. Ditto those who need caffeine in the afternoon to stay awake. “I see it all the time,” he says. “I get on a flight at 10am when people should be at peak alert, and I look around, and half of the plane has immediately fallen asleep.” So what can the individual do? First, they should avoid pulling “all-nighters”, at their desks or on the dancefloor. After being awake for 19 hours, you’re as cognitively impaired as someone who is drunk. Second, they should start thinking about sleep as a kind of work, like going to the gym (with the key difference that it is both free and, if you’re me, enjoyable). “People use alarms to wake up,” Walker says. “So why don’t we have a bedtime alarm to tell us we’ve got half an hour, that we should start cycling down?” We should start thinking of midnight more in terms of its original meaning: as the middle of the night. Schools should consider later starts for students; such delays correlate with improved IQs. Companies should think about rewarding sleep. Productivity will rise, and motivation, creativity and even levels of honesty will be improved. Sleep can be measured using tracking devices, and some far-sighted companies in the US already give employees time off if they clock enough of it. Sleeping pills, by the way, are to be avoided. Among other things, they can have a deleterious effect on memory. Those who are focused on so-called “clean” sleep are determined to outlaw mobiles and computers from the bedroom – and quite right, too, given the effect of LED-emitting devices on melatonin, the sleep-inducing hormone. Ultimately, though, Walker believes that technology will be sleep’s saviour. “There is going to be a revolution in the quantified self in industrial nations,” he says. “We will know everything about our bodies from one day to the next in high fidelity. That will be a seismic shift, and we will then start to develop methods by which we can amplify different components of human sleep, and do that from the bedside. Sleep will come to be seen as a preventive medicine.” What questions does Walker still most want to answer? For a while, he is quiet. “It’s so difficult,” he says, with a sigh. “There are so many. I would still like to know where we go, psychologically and physiologically, when we dream. Dreaming is the second state of human consciousness, and we have only scratched the surface so far. But I would also like to find out when sleep emerged. I like to posit a ridiculous theory, which is: perhaps sleep did not evolve. Perhaps it was the thing from which wakefulness emerged.” He laughs. “If I could have some kind of medical Tardis and go back in time to look at that, well, I would sleep better at night.” • Why We Sleep: The New Science of Sleep and Dreams by Matthew Walker is published by Allen Lane (£20).

The quarterback who won his first of two improbable Super Bowl titles thanks in no small part to a helmet catch, is now leading an offense that would need a huge dose of luck just to score 20 points in a game. New York’s latest prime-time debacle on Monday night at home against the Lions, a game in which all-universe receiver Odell Beckham returned from injury, saw the Giants put up just 10 points – meaning the Giants have just 13 points on the season and have now failed to crack 20 points in eight consecutive games dating back to late November of 2016. A team with Beckham and a two-time Super Bowl winning quarterback, a team that acquired Brandon Marshall in the offseason and drafted a tight end in the first round, simply can’t produce any points. Since Week 13 last year, the Giants have the lowest-scoring offense in the entire NFL. Yes, even lower than the football punch line they share a stadium with: the New York Jets, a team all but officially tanking for draft picks. Barring some sort of miraculous turnaround, one that would require New York’s offensive line suddenly learning how to block and Marshall figuring out how to reverse the hands of time, the 2017 Giants look like a bad team facing a long rebuild. And that fact raises the question: if the Giants aren’t a team that can win now, what do they need with a 36-year-old quarterback who is clearly on the downside of his abilities? Manning is not the biggest problem with the New York offense, that is the offensive line and specifically left tackle Ereck Flowers, who was abused on Monday night to the tune of three sacks. But Manning has not been helping his cause either. With the Giants down 17-7 late in the fourth quarter and facing a 4th-and-goal from the two, Manning lost track of the game clock and was hit with a delay of game penalty, forcing the Giants to kick a field goal. After the game, head coach Ben McAdoo laid the blame at the feet of his 14-year veteran quarterback: “Sloppy quarterback play. The quarterback and center need be on the same page there. We’ve got to get the ball snapped,” McAdoo said. “We have a veteran quarterback who’s played a lot of football. I expect us to get the ball snapped.” If only that was Manning’s worst play of the night. Manning also sacked Eli Manning in the game, crumpling to the ground before Ziggy Ansah even laid a hand on him. As bad as that play looks, Manning has long been an easy sack, a self-preservation strategy that has enabled him to play in all 16 games for 12 seasons in a row. But it’s hard to watch him fall to the ground and not think about what a younger, more mobile quarterback would have done in the same situation. DeShaun Watson could have picked up 20 yards or more running. Even fellow veteran Alex Smith could have gone for 10. Eli’s pocket passing and pocket-passing-only style is not designed for an offensive line that needs almost a complete redesign. And how old will Manning be by the time that unit is fixed? Is he really going to want to lose and get beat up for another year or two so he can make one last run at contention at 39 or 40? Manning is already three years older than Kurt Warner was when the Giants jettisoned him to hand the franchise over to young Eli in 2005. The only problem is, the Giants of today have no heir apparent on the roster. Former Jets washout Geno Smith is the No2 and the third-string QB is Davis Webb, a 2017 third-rounder who most scouts believe has an upside of NFL back-up. While the Giants hoped to contend this year, they may soon find themselves in the mix with the Jets among teams eyeing the quarterback-rich 2018 draft class. At 0-2 already, the schedule doesn’t get much easier. New York plays at Philadelphia this week, where they’re a six-point underdog. Then it’s at Tampa Bay, at home against a Chargers team that can score points, then on to Denver – where Eli and friends scoring at all will be a major upset – and then home against the Seahawks before the Giants get a Week 8 bye/mercy. It’s hard to realistically see this Giants team getting through that stretch better than 3-4 and it’s a real possibility they could be sitting at 1-6 or even 0-7. That’s a mark that would cause every Giants fan to make an Eli face. As ugly as their record will be, it would give the Giants a shot at Sam Darnold, the USC quarterback expected to go No1 in next year’s draft. And if the Jets beat them at losing, college QBs like Josh Allen of Wyoming, Josh Rosen of UCLA and Lamar Jackson of Louisville would be available in the Top 10, as well. Taking a stud offensive lineman would be an option, too, if the Giants believe it’s enough to make one last run with a quarterback pushing 40. Spoiler alert: it would not be enough. These Giants are a lot more than one linemen away from contention. But there is a third option would give their Giants the quarterback of the future and a top lineman in the draft. How would they do that? Trade Eli Manning. Yes. Trade him. If Peyton Manning could move on from the Colts, Eli can play elsewhere, too. To be clear: there are zero rumors of this happening, at least as of now; the Giants are still reeling over their current woefulness and haven’t moved onto the “Well, what now?” stage just yet. But maybe it’s worth a call to the Jacksonville Jaguars, a team which employs former Giants head coach Tom Coughlin as the executive vice president of football operations. The Jaguars are a talented team in a winnable division, but a team that could desperately use an upgrade at quarterback. Maybe it’s a trade that works for both sides and the Giants get a good draft pick in return. Is it unlikely? Probably. But not as unlikely as the Giants ever winning a Super Bowl again while Eli Manning is still around."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/musicblog/2017/sep/28/readers-recommend-share-your-songs-about-spinning","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T19:00:04Z","webTitle":"Readers recommend: share your songs about spinning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2017/sep/28/readers-recommend-share-your-songs-about-spinning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/musicblog/2017/sep/28/readers-recommend-share-your-songs-about-spinning","fields":{"headline":"Readers recommend: share your songs about spinning","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We’re spinning around for your song suggestions this week.

The finding by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) reverses previous internal Met police disciplinary inquiries and has prompted accusations that the force is “incapable” of investigating itself. The four serving Met employees are criticised by the IPCC not for making the inappropriate comments but for failing to challenge them when they were posted on a Facebook group called “I’ve met the Met”, which is used primarily by serving and retired Met officers. Among the posts, according to the Traveller Movement charity, were: “I fucking hate Pikeys” and “You know when they are lying … their lips move.” It is not known who posted the comments. Some of the comments were made during a discussion in March 2015 about the BBC Trust’s decision to clear Jeremy Clarkson and other Top Gear presenters of wrongdoing for their use of the word “pikey”. The Facebook group was marked secret and membership was by invitation only. The original conversation has now been deleted. None of the material was so serious that it constituted a crime, the IPCC said. The watchdog said the four had potentially breached standards of professional behaviour in relation to authority, respect and courtesy, equality and diversity, and failing to challenge inappropriate behaviour. A police misconduct meeting deals with less serious issues. It cannot result in staff being sacked. The original complaint was made by the Traveller Movement. Its chief executive, Yvonne MacNamara, welcomed the IPCC decision: “The lack of confidence the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities have in the police can come as no surprise if this is how the police treat discriminatory comments against them. “It is high time we saw a root and branch review of the way the police treats Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities, who deserve the same quality of service and policing as any other member of our society.” Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said: “Any racist comments directed towards the Gypsy and Traveller community or anyone else are clearly unacceptable … we support the IPCC’s recommendation that the officers at hand should be subject to misconduct meetings and we urge the Met to take this seriously.” Herman Ouseley, former chair of the Commission for Racial Equality, said: “This case shows that the police are incapable of investigating complaints about themselves and dealing with discrimination allegations in a fair manner.” Janette McCormick, acting chief constable of Cheshire constabulary and the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for Gypsy, Roma and Traveller issues, said: “Social networking sites have many benefits but they also carry risks of compromising operational effectiveness and causing reputational damage if used inappropriately by police officers and staff. “Everyone has a right to privacy and to share opinions and experiences with friends and associates, but people should also be aware of the risks they are subject to when they identify themselves as being a member of the police service.” A spokesman for the IPCC said: “The complainant has twice appealed against decisions reached by the Metropolitan police investigation, and these appeals have been upheld by the IPCC. “Following the latest appeal, the IPCC has recommended the Met police hold misconduct meetings … for potentially breaching standards of professional behaviour in relation to authority, respect and courtesy, equality and diversity, and challenging inappropriate behaviour.” The Met said: “The IPCC recommended … that three officers and one member of police staff should undergo misconduct meetings. The Met is considering this recommendation. “The original investigation arose from a complaint made by a member of the public on 29 June 2015 to the MPS [Metropolitan Police Service] regarding ex and serving personnel’s comments about members of the Traveller community that had been made on a community Facebook page – this was not a corporate MPS site nor one supported for use by the MPS. “The directorate of professional standards concluded a reinvestigation on Monday 27 March into inappropriate comments made on a social media site and found that no serving MPS personnel had committed any criminal offences or breaches of professional standards.” As an outcome of this investigation, the Met said, six officers had already received “management action”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/20/kenyan-election-rerun-not-transparent-supreme-court","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T15:31:31Z","webTitle":"Kenyan election annulled after result called before votes counted, says court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/20/kenyan-election-rerun-not-transparent-supreme-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/20/kenyan-election-rerun-not-transparent-supreme-court","fields":{"headline":"Kenyan election annulled after result called before votes counted, says court","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Kenya’s supreme court has said it annulled presidential elections held in August because the polls were “neither transparent nor verifiable” and blamed the country’s electoral commission for the shortcomings. Uhuru Kenyatta, the incumbent president of the east African state, won a second term by a margin of 9%, defeating his long-term rival, Raila Odinga, in the election last month. The country now faces new elections in October, and possible lengthy political instability. The court’s majority decision to annul the poll – the result of which was announced three weeks ago – surprised many observers and embarrassed local, African and western observers who said they had found no major problems with the election. On Wednesday, the court offered a detailed explanation of why it annulled the 8 August election – the first decision of its kind in Africa. Reading out portions of the judgment, Philomena Mwilu, the deputy chief justice, said the court had upheld the opposition claim that the election result was declared before all results from Kenya’s more than 40,000 polling stations had been received. The poll had therefore not been “conducted in accordance with the constitution”, leaving “no choice but to nullify it”. The court’s decision has sharpened the political divide in Kenya, one of Africa’s biggest economies, and risks a constitutional crisis. Odinga, who lost by 1.4m votes, has said he will not take part in the new elections scheduled for 17 October unless some staff at the electoral commission are fired, among other demands. Electoral officials may struggle to meet the deadline as the French company responsible for the technological systems used for elections has said it cannot be ready in time. The constitution specifies that a rerun must occur before November. The court also raised deep concerns about the failure of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to open its computer servers to the court, and irregularities in the transmission of results, though the judges made clear they had not seen evidence that there was any systematic or deliberate rigging. In the aftermath of the annulled poll, opposition officials repeatedly described the election results as a fraud and claimed that Odinga, who leads the National Super Alliance (NASA), was the “legitimate” winner. Dozens died in scattered protests in opposition strongholds but the widespread violence predicted by some did not occur. Odinga’s claims of rigging after defeat in 2007 elections prompted rioting and retaliation by security forces, which tipped the country into its worst crisis for decades. About 1,200 people were killed in the campaign of ethnic violence that followed. The election was Odinga’s fourth failed shot at the presidency. In 2013 he said the election was rigged and took his case to the supreme court, but lost. Kenyatta has accepted the court’s decision and aides say he is confident of winning again. The political atmosphere is acrimonious, however. On Tuesday evening, the deputy president, William Ruto, accused the court of favouring the opposition while ruling party officials said Odinga would face impeachment proceedings if he was victorious in the rerun. David Maraga, the chief justice, said threats against judicial staff had risen since the supreme court ruling. He cited the demonstrations outside the court and threatening messages sent on social media to individual judges and their staff. “Senior political leaders have also threatened the judiciary, promising to cut it down to size and teach us a lesson,” Maraga said, adding that judges would not be intimidated by anyone and were ready to pay the “ultimate price” to protect the constitution and rule of law. George Kinoti, the national police spokesman, said they were waiting for details of the chief justice’s criticism before responding. Reported instances of hate speech have risen sharply since the surprise court ruling on 1 September. The heads of western diplomatic missions in Kenya, including those of the EU, US and Britain, urged Kenyan leaders to avoid comments that could incite hatred and violence. “Now is the time to focus on preparing for the new poll, which, in line with the court’s order and the constitution, must be run by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and be held by the end of October,” they said in a joint statement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/sep/24/virgin-active-membership-cancelled-taking-money","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T06:00:37Z","webTitle":"I cancelled Virgin Active membership but it kept on taking my money","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/24/virgin-active-membership-cancelled-taking-money","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/sep/24/virgin-active-membership-cancelled-taking-money","fields":{"headline":"I cancelled Virgin Active membership but it kept on taking my money","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I took out gym membership with Virgin Active in April 2016. Through my health insurer, Vitality, I was eligible for a plan discounted to £100 a month, which could be cancelled at any time. However, the rep persuaded me to set it up as a normal account, costing £134 a month and requiring 12 months’ notice to cancel, which they would convert into a £100 Vitality account. This would make the first partial month free. In August I changed job location so instructed Virgin Active to cancel my membership. But recently I noticed it never stopped taking £134 a month (instead of £100) from me, even though its records show I have not attended a gym since August 2016. It transpires that this is because the rep never converted my account into a Vitality one, so the cancellation team incorrectly believed I required 12 months’ notice. Virgin Active has finally stopped taking my money but has only offered compensation worth £390, though it owes me £1,744. It is refusing to accept responsibility for the behaviour of its sales rep, which was at best mis-selling and at worst fraud.

In recent years, Ed Sheeran, Mark Ronson and Miguel have all taken to interpolating previously released music – whether recreating the rhythm of a chorus, a melody, or even word-for-word re-singing of a hook. While sampling has been commonplace in music for decades, the popularity of interpolations, or replays as they’re also known, has grown significantly. Why? “In order to clear a sample, you technically have to clear both the master use and the composition,” says Barry Simons, a San Francisco-based entertainment lawyer. “So there’s two clearances.” Or to quote bellowing chanteuse Jessie J, it’s all about the money, money, money. Simons says that an artist is able to bypass paying a music publisher for the underlying composition by recreating the sound recording; the only payment is to the record label for the masters, therefore avoiding copyright infringement. In a post-Blurred Lines world (Robin Thicke was successfully sued by Marvin Gaye’s estate for the song’s similarities to Got to Give It Up), some artists have had to backdate their “tribute”. Ed Sheeran came under fire for his pre-chorus to Shape of You having an uncredited similarity to TLC’s pre-chorus of No Scrubs (Sheeran later added No Scrubs’s songwriters to the credits); Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars later credited the Gap Band’s five songwriters of I Believe You Want to Get Up and Dance (Oops Upside Your Head) on Uptown Funk, while Miguel added Smashing Pumpkins’ Billy Corgan to the credits for Leaves owing to its similarity to 1979. The nostalgia from musically “homaging” a bygone era is far from new, though Swift’s fascination with the 90s as a creative muse is perhaps just the latest reference point. As awkward 90s fashion and reboots of 90s films and TV series have seemingly become en vogue, it’s no shock why present-day artists would take to diving back to the future of this same era for their throwback inspiration. The caveat to any interpolation is that the original artist can always say no. “And once they say no, you’ve painted yourself into a corner where you kind of can’t do it,” says Simons. In most cases, however, an interpolation is manna from heaven. A jubilant Right Said Fred have publicly thanked Taylor Swift for her cheeky borrow, especially since it temporarily thrust them back into the spotlight.

He discovered the cooling law for white dwarf stars, showed how magnetic fields in forming stars allowed them to dispose of excess spin, and how a star such as the sun slows down its rotation through an interaction between the star’s magnetic field and the wind of hot gas blowing from its surface. He was associated with the universities of Cambridge, Manchester and especially Sussex, and played a major role in helping to develop the Astronomy Centre at Sussex. Leon was born in Melbourne, Australia, and the family migrated to Forest Gate in the East End of London when he was three. His father, Solomon Mestel, was a rabbi; his mother, Rachel (nee Brodetsky), was a schoolteacher. Leon wrote in 2012: “The overwhelming influences in my childhood were on the one hand the Judaic tradition, and on the other a complementary commitment to secular studies.” He wrote of his interaction with his parents as a student: “I met the perpetual questioning ‘How are you going to make a living from the study of mathematics?’ with ‘I can always become a statistician or an actuary’. It is both easy and entertaining to picture my parents’ bewildered reaction if I had replied that I would spend my life worrying about the insides of stars.” Leon was educated at West Ham secondary school and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he gained a first-class degree in mathematics in 1947. He then studied for a PhD with Fred Hoyle, working on white dwarf stars, which are the end point of evolution of stars such as the sun. He found that these dead stars, whose white colour indicates a temperature of more than 100,000 degrees centigrade, cooled over a timescale of billions of years, a prediction that has been amply confirmed. After Cambridge, Leon worked with Tom Cowling at Leeds, at first continuing his interest in the structure of stars but gradually becoming fascinated by the role of magnetic fields on the structure and evolution of stars. Usually it is assumed that a star’s magnetic field is rigidly “frozen” into the material of the star but Leon and Lyman Spitzer showed in 1956 that this could be relaxed by a process now known as “ambipolar diffusion”. In a classic 1965 paper (Problems of Star Formation, published in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of London) he showed that the magnetic field allows a forming star to reduce its spin by a factor of a million. The forming star transfers its spin to the parent cloud from which it is forming via the magnetic field. In 1968 Mestel showed how the magnetic field of a star such as the sun slows down its rotation over time through interaction with the stellar wind of gas that such stars blow off their surface. He was able to show that magnetic fields are important in almost all aspects of stellar and galactic astrophysics. Speakers at seminars and conferences would dread the question from Leon: “What about the role of the magnetic field?” His researches were summarised in his great monograph Stellar Magnetism (1999). On concluding his postdoctoral work at Leeds, Leon spent a year at Princeton and then returned to Cambridge as a lecturer in mathematics in 1955. From 1967 he spent six years as professor of applied mathematics at Manchester University and then moved to the University of Sussex as professor of astronomy, a position he held for 19 years until he retired in 1992. He made a major contribution to the development and success of the Astronomy Centre at Sussex, and after his retirement remained a regular presence there until he moved back to Cambridge in 2008. His last scientific paper, On the Evolution of Stable Magnetic Fields in Stars, was published in 2010. During retirement he also wrote obituaries of a number of colleagues and friends, including Tom Cowling, Martin Schwarzschild, Bill McCrea, and Roger Tayler. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society in 1977 and awarded the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 2002, a society he strongly supported and whose meetings he regularly attended. Earlier, in 1993, he had received the Royal Astronomical Society’s Eddington medal for his fundamental work on stellar magnetism. Leon had a highly developed sense of humour and was always ready with an excellent joke. His many distinguished research students included Donald Lynden-Bell, Ian Roxburgh, Ken Freeman and Peter Strittmatter. He was a good friend and mentor to many younger researchers, including those like myself who did not work in his field. He married Louise Cole in 1951 and they had two sons and two daughters. Louise died in 2014. Leon is survived by their children, Leonora, Jonathan, Rosie and Ben, and by four grandchildren. • Leon Mestel, mathematician and astrophysicist, born 5 August 1927; died 15 September 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/20/are-the-two-mexican-earthquakes-connected-and-are-more-on-the-way","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T07:57:40Z","webTitle":"Are the two Mexican earthquakes connected – and are more on the way?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/20/are-the-two-mexican-earthquakes-connected-and-are-more-on-the-way","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/20/are-the-two-mexican-earthquakes-connected-and-are-more-on-the-way","fields":{"headline":"Are the two Mexican earthquakes connected – and are more on the way?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mexico has been hit by its second deadly earthquake in less than two weeks. Are the two seismic events in Mexico related, and could they indicate more tremors are on the way? Two days after the second earthquake in Mexico, large quakes struck the Pacific island of Vanuatu and off the north-east coast of Japan. Both Mexican quakes occurred on the Cocos tectonic plate, which runs along the western coast of Mexico, and is sliding beneath the neighbouring North American tectonic plate to the north-east at a rate of about three inches per year. The 7.1 magnitude quake, which struck shortly after 1pm local time on Tuesday, occurred 120km south-east of Mexico City. This came just 11 days after a magnitude 8.1 quake off the coast of southern Mexico. In each case, the tremors originated from within the Cocos plate, deep beneath the surface, rather than being caused by friction at the interface. Tuesday’s quake occurred at 50km depth and the earlier quake was even deeper, at 70km. As the Cocos plate is forced downwards, it deforms – causing the structure to kink and crumple. But this process is not smooth and incremental. Instead, stress builds up inside the plate over months or years until a threshold is reached and it is suddenly released in a giant tremor. “What happened yesterday was most likely a tearing motion in the subducting Cocos plate,” says Prof David Rothery of the Open University. A similar mechanism is thought to be responsible for the earlier recent quake, but seismologists do not think that one led to the other. Stephen Hicks, of the University of Southampton, said: “It’s quite a long way for them to be directly linked. It might have slightly increased the stress, but if it did it’s a tiny amount and the fault must have been close to rupturing anyway.” Experts have dismissed the possibility of any causal relationship between the Mexico quakes and those in other locations along the seismically active Pacific “ring of fire”. A 6.4 magnitude quake struck Vanuatu’s Erromango island early on Thursday local time, but caused no damage, according to the US Geological Survey and local authorities. Hours earlier, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake was recorded 283 kilometres off the coast of north-east Japan, the same region that was devastated by a tsunami following a 9.0 magnitude quake in March 2011. The disaster killed more than 18,500 people and triggered a triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. But Hongfeng Yang, an assistant professor in the Earth System Sciences Programme at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the fact that this week’s three big quakes had all occurred within such a short timeframe was a coincidence. “They are really far away from each other so that physical mechanisms to link them together are weak,” Yang told the Guardian. “There is a chance, however, to trigger distant earthquakes by seismic waves generated by prior earthquakes located far away. But the likelihood of that triggering earthquakes larger than magnitude 5 is nearly zero.” Mexico City is particularly vulnerable because it sits on an ancient lake bed that is filled with deep layers of sediment, which can magnify the shaking. “Once the seismic wave enters that bowl, it reverberates around,” said Hicks. “It behaves like a bowl of jelly.” Unlike some natural disasters, scientists have yet to devise a reliable way to predict when earthquakes will occur. However, planning for the worst can hugely reduce the devastation caused and death toll of future quakes. The most recent quakes in Mexico will, once again, raise questions about whether the appropriate building codes were adhered to. “The Enrique Rébsamen elementary school where many children died looks like a modern building, and ought to have had inbuilt earthquake resilience,” said Rothery. “Had it been properly constructed it should not have collapsed, and I expect questions will be asked”. • This article was amended on 21 September 2017. An earlier version said the 7.1 magnitude quake hit shortly after 6pm local time. This has been corrected to 1pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/oct/06/laptop-firms-accused-of-labour-abuses-against-chinese-students-sony-hp-acer","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T14:24:10Z","webTitle":"Chinese factory supplying major laptop brands accused of student labour abuses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/06/laptop-firms-accused-of-labour-abuses-against-chinese-students-sony-hp-acer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/oct/06/laptop-firms-accused-of-labour-abuses-against-chinese-students-sony-hp-acer","fields":{"headline":"Chinese factory supplying major laptop brands accused of student labour abuses","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The world’s biggest laptop brands rely on Chinese student labourers as young as 16 to work 12-hour days on factory production lines, with their funding and graduation at risk if they fail to comply, a labour watchdog has claimed. Students on vocational courses are recruited in their thousands to produce keyboards, assemble parts and fit screws during internships at Quanta Computer, a Taiwan-owned Fortune 500 company whose factories in China supply Apple, Acer, Hewlett-Packard and Sony, among many others. If students refuse, they are told their funding will be cut or they will not receive their diploma, claims a report by Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour (Sacom), a Hong Kong-based non-profit. Interns are believed to comprise about half of the workforce at Quanta’s Chongqing factory, where students’ three-month internships supply a steady flow of “cheap and disposable labour”, the report alleges. Quanta operates three manufacturing plants in mainland China, in Shanghai, Changshu and Chongqing, from which it claims to supply each of the top 10 PC companies and produce one-third of all PC laptops in the world. “We were forced to come,” said one 18-year-old intern at Quanta Chongqing, where students were assembling parts for Acer, HP and Sony laptops and tablets, according to Sacom. “Every semester, our school recruits new students but our campus is small. When they don’t have enough space in the classrooms or dormitories, they force students out to do internships and then let the new students stay in our dorms.” Another 16-year-old intern said: “If we refused, we would not be able to get our graduation certificates. Also, our dining and accommodation subsidies would be cancelled.” Undercover research and interviews at Quanta’s Chongqing factory, which took place in late 2016 and mid-2017, alleged that interns were working 12-hour days for months at a time without a day off. Students had also been hired illegally through recruitment agencies and paid illegal deposits to the recruitment agencies or their own universities to “secure” the internship, said Sacom. Despite labour laws stipulating that interns should make up just 10% of a facility’s workforce, a manager at Quanta Chongqing told undercover researchers that he estimated “more than 60%” of the workers were interns. “Quanta is cooperating with local vocational schools to arrange student interns to work in the factory,” the manager said. “Student interns are good because they are flexible. It only takes a few weeks to order the students from the schools.” In an email to the Guardian, Quanta Computer denied the report’s allegations and said: “After internal verification, we believe that the allegations … are untrue and unfair to the company. There are serious mistakes in the information … from the ‘undercover investigators’.” Quanta Computer did not specify what those mistakes may be, and did not respond to further requests for comment. Acer and Sony did not respond to requests for comment. HP told the Guardian: “HP is committed to the highest standards of business conduct and maintains robust compliance programs to ensure our suppliers adhere to HP’s standards everywhere in the world. HP regularly monitors the performance of its partners to review their compliance. Failure to comply will result in appropriate action, including termination.” Apple told the Guardian that “it does not have any operations at the Quanta Chongqing facility”. The phenomenon of hiring students first came to media attention in 2012, when ot was alleged that students on forced internships at Foxconn were assembling iPhones. Despite improved Chinese labour laws intended to stem the practice, interns are still hired to provide a cheap, quick fix to labour shortages, and to benefit the needs of Chinese universities, said Sacom’s project officer Michael Ma. “Student internships are difficult to terminate, because their brief contracts fit volatile labour needs in the electronic industry. And vocational schools can escape their responsibilities of arranging classes and providing dormitories by sending students to factories,” said Ma. “Even though Sacom has been addressing these issues since 2012, the situation is getting worse because of [profit and labour] competition between multinationals and the lack of trade unions in China, which prevents workers from taking action against such practices.” Chinese law requires internships to be directly related to students’ course of study. Of nine students interviewed by Sacom, only four were studying electronics. The others had majors ranging from accounting to early education, hotel management, costume design, and automobile repair. Even electrical engineering students said work on the production lines was unrelated to their studies. “Yes, I do study electronics, but what can I learn from merely inserting screws all day for three months?” one intern said. “I learned nothing here,” said an intern studying costume design. “After leaving Quanta we’ll be sent to a factory for repairing automobiles.” A year after the 2012 claims about students on forced internships at Foxconn, it was alleged that students were being forced to assemble Sony’s Playstation 4, or risk failing their course. Further allegations came in 2015, an investigation linked Dell and HP to forced internships at Wistron, a Chinese electronics manufacturer. Jenny Chan, assistant professor at Hong Kong Polytechnical University and researcher of student labour in China, describes students as “overworked and unguided” during their “widespread, ‘sheep-like’ internships”. Chongqing, a sprawling 30m megacity, is known as the “land of laptops”. One-third of the entire city’s exports is now in notebook computers, and over half of the world’s top 500 companies operate out of the city. But researchers say weaker law enforcement and labour monitoring by civil society in inland China – compared to coastal China, from where many electronics companies have relocated – means that labour abuses are able to go largely unchecked. Inland wages are also lower and local government tax allowances to attract businesses bigger, according to Sacom."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/22/workplace-chef-michelin-stars-sebastien-bras","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T11:13:50Z","webTitle":"Meet your new workplace role model: the chef giving up his Michelin stars | Stefan Stern","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/22/workplace-chef-michelin-stars-sebastien-bras","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/22/workplace-chef-michelin-stars-sebastien-bras","fields":{"headline":"Meet your new workplace role model: the chef giving up his Michelin stars","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Maybe life is too short to stuff a mushroom after all. That is one conclusion to draw from the news that Sébastien Bras, a three-star Michelin chef, has decided to renounce the usually longed-for accolade and choose a simpler existence in the kitchen instead. “I want to give a new meaning to my life … and redefine what is essential,” he said earlier this week in a Facebook video message. He still wants to cook, it seems, just not quite so much of the fancy stuff and not under the pressure of constant scrutiny. How should you react to achieving a lifetime’s ambition? The restless and the neurotic will press on, set new goals, imagining new threats or rivals to dispatch. Alexander the Great was said to have wept when he saw there were no new lands to conquer. But Bras has decided that, having reached the top, it is time to do something else, to choose a different, calmer life. There is a risk, of course, that once you have reached a peak it is hard to avoid a sense of slipping downhill. But keeping up a three-star level of culinary performance does not seem to Bras to be worth the candle, or the linen, or the silverware. Indeed, that elusive third star sometimes seems to have as much to do with staffing levels and degrees of luxury as it does with the cooking. It costs a lot of money to run a place like that. If each customer isn’t spending an average of £100 a head, a three-star establishment is probably going to struggle break even. The real significance of Bras’ decision is what it tells us about motivation and meaningful achievement at work. What he likes is cooking, not the theatre and outward frippery of the three-star venue. Nor does he want to be measured by the anonymous and unsmiling Michelin inspectors who might descend at any moment. He wants to do work that he feels good about, which matters to him. He wants to satisfy customers, not hit arbitrary targets or conform to other people’s ideas of quality. His motivation comes from within. He cannot be motivated or “incentivised” by other people. It is all down to him. Managers should pay attention to chef Sébastien. They might try to impose performance measures on their employees. They might dangle carrots in the hope of encouraging higher output. But people are not donkeys. They are wise to these crude tactics. Sensible employers have been rethinking their approach to managing performance, with firms such as Microsoft, Accenture, IBM, General Electric and PricewaterhouseCoopers all abandoning the traditional annual appraisal. Carrots and sticks – or plain old intimidation – will not work, not in the long run. What the psychologist Frederick Herzberg called “kick in the ass” management can produce movement, but not motivation. As he explained in a famous Harvard Business Review article almost 50 years ago: “If I kick my dog (from the front or the back), he will move. And when I want him to move again what must I do? I must kick him again. Similarly, I can change a person’s battery, and then recharge it, and recharge it again. But it is only when one has a generator of one’s own that we can talk about motivation. One then needs no outside stimulation. One wants to do it.” Whether you are an overworked chef or an overworked pilot, the intrinsic motivation and satisfaction in doing a job well will be shattered if you feel disrespected, menaced or simply taken for granted. The curse of bad management practice can be found at every level, in the professions too. It is not just Uber drivers, Deliveroo riders, couriers and retail sector workers on zero-hours contracts who have to worry about poor treatment, bad conditions and overwork. Our newly liberated chef is thus an important role model. He is taking back control. He is rejecting the drudgery of the career ladder and the self-imposed pressure of conforming to other people’s expectations and standards. He is going to cook what he likes when he likes, and satisfy his own personal ambitions. Let others worry about Michelin stars. Bras will concentrate on pleasing his customer and, in the process, himself. Bravo, Sébastien. I’ll have a nice plate of egg and chips please, when you’re ready. • Stefan Stern is the author of Myths of Management, and a visiting professor at Cass Business School"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/25/anonymous-honesty-websites-parents-vigilant-sarahah-cyberbullying","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T13:35:59Z","webTitle":"Anonymous 'honesty' websites: safety experts tell parents to be vigilant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/25/anonymous-honesty-websites-parents-vigilant-sarahah-cyberbullying","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/25/anonymous-honesty-websites-parents-vigilant-sarahah-cyberbullying","fields":{"headline":"Anonymous 'honesty' websites: safety experts tell parents to be vigilant","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Online safety experts have warned parents to be vigilant about teenagers’ use of anonymous feedback apps that allow users to leave unnamed comments about others, amid new concerns over cyberbullying. As policymakers analyse the roots of teenage depression, in response to research published last week indicating that 24% of 14-year-old girls and 9% of boys are depressed, the role of social media has come under scrutiny, particularly the soaring popularity of “honesty” sites. “This is an area of concern for us. Kids are telling us these sites can facilitate bullying,” said Sonja Jutte, from the NSPCC’s child safety online team. “We can’t say increased social media use is causing higher depression or mental health issues in teenage girls, but it is contributing to the pressures that young people are facing.” A recent Netaware study found that the opportunity to be anonymous on some platforms was facilitating bullying behaviour. Will Gardner, the chief executive of the children’s charity Childnet, which works to make the internet safer for younger users, said parents needed to discuss these sites with their children to help equip them to deal with potential bullying. “People are generally nastier on anonymised sites,” he said. While anonymous comment boards have been popular for years, honest feedback sites are a relatively new manifestation, and are increasingly the subject of calls to the UK Safer Internet Centre helpline from teachers and other professionals working with children. One of the newest and most popular apps is Sarahah, which launched this year, inviting users to “improve your friendship by discovering your strengths and areas for improvement; let your friends be honest with you”. Created by the computer scientist Zainalabdin Tawfiq, based in Saudi Arabia, as a tool to allow employees to give anonymous feedback to bosses and colleagues, it has rapidly become popular with teenagers around the world. The site already has 90 million registered users, according to Tawfiq, and was one of the most downloaded iPhone apps in the UK and the US in August. The parenting website Commonsense Media notes in an online video that the site makes it “super easy for kids to cyberbully without repercussions”, and concludes: “Clearly there’s not much to love here so we don’t recommend that teens use Sararah.” While teenagers sign up to apps such as Sarahah in the hope of hearing positive feedback, many discover that the tone can quickly become critical, with comments more along the lines of “no one likes you”, “why are you so vain?”. This month a girls’ school in Dublin wrote to parents requesting that they make sure their daughters delete the app from their smartphones “for the wellbeing of all the students”. Similar sites have had bursts of popularity in the past. Ask.fm, which also allows anonymous posting, was associated with online bullying. Sayat.me, another “anonymous feedback tool”, briefly went viral in the UK this year before being linked to the death of George Hessay, a 15-year-old from Goole in east Yorkshire who killed himself. It was subsequently taken offline. Tawfiq said he wanted to avoid problems experienced by other sites by trying to create a positive environment. “Whenever you try to send a user a message, you see a fixed text that says: ‘Leave a constructive message :)’ – that’s a preventative measure,” he said. Developers had created blocking and filtering techniques to remove abuse, he said, as well as reporting mechanisms. He would not reveal how many moderators the company employed or where they were based. Tawfiq had not anticipated the site would become so popular with teenagers. The app is classified as 17-plus, and users must be over that age to download it from Apple. However, this requirement is easy to circumvent and the site has no age verification mechanism. “We are concerned about any misuse of the site. We can disable accounts. We update the filters regularly. We are eagerly working on this,” he said. “Unfortunately this is an issue that all social networks face. Even before social networks people tended to do similar things – you can always create an anonymous email. We are trying to make the filters much more intelligent to detect any violations. “We have to prevent bullying as much as possible. It is at the top of our list; it is something of concern to us. We would not be happy to hear that a user got affected,” Tawfiq said. Because apps become popular so rapidly, developers often struggle to employ enough moderators to keep up with the soaring number of users, said Laura Higgins, the manager of the UK Safer Internet Centre site. She said that while developers needed to include safety features in app designs, young people also had a responsibility not to hide behind anonymity to be abusive towards each other. “So many of these sites are cropping up so quickly that it is hard to say one is more risky than another,” she said. Gardner said there was a parallel positive function for anonymous zones online, allowing people to seek advice on sensitive or embarrassing subjects. But he said there was a particular brutality associated with the use of apps that encourage people to be honest anonymously. “Parents should know these sites exist, and have conversations about them with their children,” said Gardner. “They should ask questions about their online life, just as they would about their offline life; be interested and get them to show the apps.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/25/reverse-diabetes-type-2","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T05:59:06Z","webTitle":"Is it possible to reverse Type 2 diabetes?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/25/reverse-diabetes-type-2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/25/reverse-diabetes-type-2","fields":{"headline":"Is it possible to reverse Type 2 diabetes?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition that can lead to heart disease, nerve damage, kidney disease and blindness. However, it is possible to beat it into remission. The pancreas can begin again making insulin, the hormone that regulates levels of glucose in the blood. The liver can reassert itself as the body’s reservoir for glucose and stop pumping out unwanted sugar. And many people who have been taking tablets to control their type 2 diabetes can potentially throw them away. This is good for the NHS, because 5% to 10% of people have type 2 diabetes. However, to beat it, you would need to lose about 10% of your body weight – and keep it off. The solution In an analysis paper in the BMJ, Mike Lean, professor of nutrition at Glasgow University, argues that giving tablets to reduce blood sugar (the main treatment for type 2 diabetes) only addresses the symptom. “Virtually everyone with type 2 diabetes is two or three stone [12-19kg] above their ideal weight,” says Lean. “One of the great tragedies is that we’ve known this for about a hundred years and all the treatments have ever done is reduce the blood sugar – this is the consequence, but what drives it is the weight.” Lean says the easiest indicator of someone at risk of type 2 diabetes is a fat tummy. A man with a waist over 91cm (36in) or a woman with a waist over 81cm (32in) could both be on the path to the condition. Another paper in Frontiers in Endocrinology describes a programme of high-intensity exercise as a way of preventing type 2 diabetes developing in people with risk factors. But: “You can’t run off diabetes,” says Lean. He says evidence suggests most people need to lose more than 12kg. But studies show woeful remission rates (0.14% of 120,000 US patients who were followed up for seven years). Lean is more optimistic, as his team is involved in a programme called Counterweight Plus, which a pilot study showed led to a third of people losing more than 12kg. The programme involves drinking formula shakes with a total of 820 calories for six to eight weeks, before reintroducing food that includes a lot less fat, and ideally no alcohol. The programme is being further evaluated and Lean says he is not pushing his own Counterweight Plus solution – people should ask their GPs for any evidence-based weight-loss programme. The rewards of weight loss are high. Not having type 2 diabetes any more (as long as you don’t regain weight) means not only no tablets for diabetes and no complications, but often the reversal of any high blood pressure, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/sep/22/county-cricket-surrey-v-somerset-yorkshire-v-warwickshire-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T18:07:58Z","webTitle":"County cricket: Essex stun Hampshire and Sangakkara signs off for Surrey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/sep/22/county-cricket-surrey-v-somerset-yorkshire-v-warwickshire-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/sep/22/county-cricket-surrey-v-somerset-yorkshire-v-warwickshire-live","fields":{"headline":"County cricket: Essex stun Hampshire and Sangakkara signs off for Surrey","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Champion County, Essex, secured their ninth and most remarkable win of their special summer and, in doing so, thrust their victims Hampshire – who were bowled out for 76 to lose by 108 runs – into a relegation scrap. Sam Cook, the 20-year-old swing bowler, took his maiden five-wicket haul to inflict on Hampshire their lowest total since 1984. Hampshire therefore need 12 points against Warwickshire to secure their survival ahead of seventh-placed Somerset, who lost to Surrey in Kumar Sangakkara’s final match at The Oval. Yorkshire thrillingly beat Warwickshire by two wickets, and are 18 points ahead of Somerset. Essex themselves had been bowled out for 76 in the first innings and invited to follow on 178 behind – Hampshire have lost in such fashion just three times before – and were only 94 in front when they lost their eighth second innings wicket. But Neil Wagner and James Foster put on 82 to guide them to 362 (Dan Lawrence had earlier scored a century) and set Hampshire 185 to win. Cook and his new-ball partner Jamie Porter swiftly reduced Hampshire to 29 for six, before Simon Harmer dismissed Liam Dawson with his first ball and Wagner picked up two wickets. Cook returned to dismiss Fidel Edwards, and finished with five for 18 to secure a win that was similar to one achieved by Essex over Hampshire the last time they won the title at Bournemouth in 1992, when they were also asked to follow on. Sangakkara, a day after being given honorary life membership of Surrey, made 35 in his final innings at the Oval as they chased 143 four down to beat Somerset. He has eight centuries so far this summer and, fittingly, it took a brilliant piece of fielding – the sharpest of caught and bowled chances by Dom Bess – to dismiss him. Led by Marcus Trescothick, every Somerset fielder rushed to shake his hand as he received a standing ovation from the crowd. That Surrey were chasing as much was down to some fine batting from Steve Davies, Peter Trego, and Bess after they began the day four down and 51 behind. Rikki Clarke had Tom Abell caught at slip early on, then Davies and Trego, who later left the field injured when bowling, shared 66. Davies was caught at slip off Gareth Batty, then Craig Overton and Trego – who had been bowled off a Stuart Meaker no-ball when in single figures – were dismissed in successive overs after lunch. Bess, last man out for 35, helped Somerset to 306. Mark Stoneman got Surrey off to a flyer, but he and Rory Burns fell in the space of three balls, then Ryan Patel was bowled by Bess. Sangakkara steadily put on 55 with Ben Foakes before Bess’s brilliant catch. Asked about his golden summer, which has so far brought eight centuries and 1,442 runs in 14 innings, Sangakkara said: “I was hoping to just pull my weight in the dressing room, I don’t know what’s changed and I’m not going to dissect it too much – I’m just going to enjoy the ride! “For sides to evolve and grow, you need new ideas and new players coming through, and Surrey has a great opportunity next year to look for someone who can make them grow stronger. I think I’m not that guy, no matter how many runs I make. There’s enough homegrown English talent to be a real force. “I can’t ask for anything more than to leave here with a win, that was outstanding. This is an incredible place. I’ve been made to feel so welcome. I’m happy that I could repay people here with some performances. First-class cricket here has a very different feel to it. The county professional is a special breed of person, and I have found a completely new respect for county cricket, and the game as a whole. The players and the fans, that suddenly hit me, and it only hit me when I retired.” The loss leaves Somerset 13 points from safety and after Middlesex beat Lancashire on Thursday, Yorkshire’s was a vital win over Warwickshire that eases their very real relegation fears. Chasing 174, they fell to 96 for seven (with Jeetan Patel taking five wickets), but No9 Steve Patterson and Matthew Fisher put on 78 for the final wicket, drawing the scores level. Patel, who made a first innings century too, then dismissed Fisher, but Patterson struck the winning runs. They move to 145 points, two more than Middlesex. There was a seismic result in Division Two too, where Rory Kleinveldt finished with 13 wickets as Northamptonshire beat Nottinghamshire by 124 runs to move 13 points behind second-placed Notts with a game to go. Sussex bowled Durham out for 131, to win by 132 runs at the Riverside. Time for me to sign off. Roundup to follow, as ever. Here’s the scores: Division One: Surrey beat Somerset by 6 wickets Yorkshire beat Warwickshire by 2 wickets Essex beat Hampshire by 108 runs Middlesex beat Lancashire by 36 runs Division Two: Northamptonshire beat Nottinghamshire by 124 runs Glamorgan drew with Gloucestershire Kent drew with Derbyshire Sussex beat Durham by 132 runs See you next week! Once more with feeling... Pope smashes a pair of fours to long-on and that is that! Surrey go second, Somerset are 13 points adrift. Lovely scenes. Surrey’s target is down into single figures. Foakes has 42 and has batted very nicely indeed. A genuinely magnificent catch. Sanga is out! He made 35, and has been dismissed by a brilliant one-handed reaction caught and bowled from Bess. A moment of slightly stunned silence followed, before every fielder shakes Sanga’s hand and the crowd give him a standing ovation. What a guy. Cheers Sanga. Huge six down the ground from Foakes, then Sanga hoicks to cow. Hundred up for Surrey as Foakes drives Leach beautifully through cover for four. Foakes was a bit jittery at first but has settled, and Surrey need 50 to win. As Jon Ryan points out on Twitter, Sanga’s reaction is hilarious. Wicket! Leach gets Patel, bowled sweeping for 17. Bess the bowler. Here’s a very, very good question. Surrey are halfway there... Sussex beat Durham by 132 runs! Onions the last man to go. Probably his last game for Durham at the Riverside. Surrey not in a mad rush, and they needn’t be; they need 75 more and have around 25 overs to do it. Ah, cricket! Middlesex have just announced that Toby Roland-Jones has a stress fracture in his lower back.... Peter Trego is going off injured mid-over. Leach to replace him. Surrey need 85 more. (Should say, it’s Sangakkara’s final innings here. He just played a lovely cover drive.) And the great man is off the mark... Standing ovation as Sangakkara walks out to bat for the final time. What a guy. Ryan Patel, not Sangakkara, is in at No3. But now Stoneman has been caught behind off Groenewald! Here comes Sanga. 39 for two, needing 104 more. Can Somerset do this? Wicket! Burns goes, and Surrey are 38 for one, needing 105 more. He hooked Overton and was caught at deep backward square. Having been bowled out for 76 in their first innings, Essex have delivered a repeat dose to Hampshire and pulled off the most remarkable win! That’s their ninth of the season. Sam Cook gets the last, and completes his maiden Championship five-wicket haul! Holland’s raging against the dying light. Hants 72 for nine, needing 113 more. Essex are one wicket away from their most special win of the season. Extraordinary. Stoneman wants this done sharpish. He has 16 off eight and Surrey are 21 for none. Abbott goes to Wagner and Essex are nine down! 56 on the board... Stoneman has just hit an outrageous shot for four over the head of the man at deep-midwicket. Picked up off the pads, and gone. Surrey are 1 for 0 in their chase of 143. Hoping Sanga gets a bat. Hampshire are eight down! Turn. And Hampshire left out Mason Crane. Ah, good idea. Looks like we are taking tea here. Dawson gone, Hampshire seven down! Grievous Bodily Harmer strikes with his first ball! Clarke gets Bess with a strangle, and Surrey need 143 to win. Decent effort from Somerset today, they have battled hard. Still 40-odd overs in the game. Wicket! Batty returns and gets one to turn on Leach, who is caught at slip! Lead is 126 as the last man Groenewald comes out. The stand with Bess was worth 48. Six different batting career bests in the game at Cardiff! My word... Hampshire are 29 for six! Vince goes to Sam Cook! Surrey will need at least 100 to win. Leach and Bess have put on 21 and the lead is 99. Hampshire are 25 for five! Essex are halfway there. Vince and his old mucker Dawson come together... Well played that man. Great celly from Brooks too. Lots of relieved Yorkshire fans... Oh wow! It’s absolutely hammering it down at Durham, where Sussex are a wicket from victory. Or an alternative way of looking at things is that Durham need 133 to win. The hoop on this! Surrey have the new ball. Somerset 88 in front with two wickets in hand. Going into the final week, Yorkshire are going to have a nice cushion from the relegation spots. Patterson gets them home! He hits Wright for four and Yorkshire win! They take 22 very important points and move third! Hampshire are 12 for four! If they can pull this off, it might just be the most extraordinary of Essex’s nine wins... Hearing there’s rain in the air at Headingley... Hampshire are 12 for three! Cook gets Adams... Scores are level at Headingley ... but Fisher is out! Patel’s sixth. A hat-trick seals a tie. He stuck on 78 with Patterson. Scores level at Headingley! Hampshire are 12 for two! That man Porter again ... 185 looking a long way off. Six to win for Yorkshire! Whittingham takes two in three balls and Sussex are a wicket away from victory. Onions, most likely playing his penultimate game for Durham, is the last man in. Durham had a big eighth wicket stand but it’s been broken! Whittingham bowls Weighell and they are 111 for eight. Wicket! Trego has played all around Patel – trying to stick him into the Peter May Stand – and been bowled! 242 for eight, with a lead of 78... Yorkshire’s target is below 20 now... Three wickets in hand. Little Chef! Wicket! Very full ball and Meaker has Coverton leg before. Seven down, lead of 70. Hampshire are one down! Weatherley gone to Cook... Can Essex win having been bowled out for 76? Steve Rackett asks how many overs Hampshire have to chase 186 to beat Essex. They are 1 for 0 and there are a minimum of 66 left. Yorkshire edging closer: 25 required... And Trego has 50! So we are back underway at the Oval, with Batty and Meaker bowling. And Essex are all out for 362, so hampshire need 185 to win! At lunch, Yorkshire require 34 to win... Lunch at the Oval, where Somerset are 220 for six, leading by 56. Notts Lose two quick ones and Northants have done it!! They take 20 points, and the race for promotion runs on... Wagner gone! Caught in the deep off Dawson. He put on 82 with foster and Essex’s lead is 176 with one wicket left. Yorkshire are down to 43 to win, three wickets in hand... Dropped! Sanga has shelled Trego on 36 at first slip! Sussex have Durham seven down! Samit gone! Notts 175 for eight... Wicket! And how Batty loves it. After a fine stand of 66, Davies is gone, caught at slip! The lead is 34... Indeed - Wagner has now put on 50 with Foster and Essex are setting up a tricky target... 50 for Davies... Somerset lead by 27. A draw would be very handy indeed. Yorkshire have lost Hodd now, and 96 for seven. 79 to win... Northants have Notts seven down... when can we start believing? Davies is batting beautifully against his old side. What a treat. Somerset lead! Hearing that Bresnan was caught at deep midwicket slogging... And Yorkshire are 86 for six as Jeetan gets Bresnan for a duck! That's his fifth. Still require 89... Meaker just bowled Trego... but it's a no ball! Somerset still trail by nine, five down. Yorkshire are five down!!! Big Rory has got Libby – his 13th of the match – and Notts are five down, still needing 181! Harmer goes and Essex are eight down, leading by 94. The weather in south London today is absolutely stunning. Wicket at Durham: Latham gone to Whittingham Durham need 244 more to win. Wicket! Abell flashes at Clarke and is caught at second slip... Five down, still 32 behind. Pujara gone! Notts 123 for four – Big Rory with the wicket... Ballance is out! Yorkshire four down, needing 100 more... Everyone has been put out of their misery at Chesterfield. What a farce. Morning Stuie! Steve Davies is batting here, which is lovely. Good morning, and welcome to Friday on county cricket - live! We really are very nearly there. I’m Will Macpherson and for the last time this summer I’m at the Oval watching Kumar Sangakkara play cricket. How exciting! Big day at Headingley too. Yorkshire can’t muck that chase up.

The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office (JCIO) has confirmed it is looking into a complaint from a Traveller organisation about remarks made by Timothy Spencer QC. Addressing members of the Rooney family from Lincolnshire as he sentenced them this month, Spencer said: “You claimed that what went on at Drinsey [in Linconshire] was no different from what was going on at any Travellers’ camp around this country, that all Travellers had workers operating under similar conditions. “Sadly, I very much fear that you may be correct about that. But that does not make any of it right.” The judge’s apparent acknowledgment that such exploitation is commonplace in the Traveller community upset the National Alliance of Gypsy Traveller and Roma Women, which lodged a formal complaint with the JCIO. In a letter to the judicial organisation, Shay Clipson, chair of the organisation wrote: “This is a very damaging statement and the judge has made it with no proof at all that this practise is carried on at any other Travellers site. “It was the task of Judge Spencer to deliver sentence on those individuals who had been convicted of offences, and not to speculate in regard to what others of the same ethnicity might do. “We find this statement by Judge Spencer to not only be discriminatory against Gypsies and Travellers, but to also have very tangible potential to expose Gypsies and Travellers to hostility due to his discriminatory statement. This could impact on the ability of families to earn a living, find somewhere to live or for children to enjoy education without fear from bullying.” A spokesman for the JCIO said: “I can confirm the JCIO is investigating HHJ Spencer in connection with a case which concluded at Nottingham crown court on 12 September.” The high-profile case ended this month when the 11 were jailed for up to 15 years for exploiting at least 18 victims for up to 26 years. Many of the victims were homeless and some had learning disabilities. They were kept in caravans without running water or toilet facilities and made to work for the family’s resurfacing business. Their captors wore Rolex watches, drove expensive cars and lived in homes that were “palatial in comparison” with their workers’ conditions, Spencer noted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/22/home-office-errors-already-leading-to-people-being-denied-bank-accounts","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T13:08:31Z","webTitle":"Home Office wrongly denying people bank accounts in 10% of cases","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/22/home-office-errors-already-leading-to-people-being-denied-bank-accounts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/22/home-office-errors-already-leading-to-people-being-denied-bank-accounts","fields":{"headline":"Home Office wrongly denying people bank accounts in 10% of cases","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As many as one in 10 people refused a new account because they failed an immigration status check were wrongly denied access to Britain’s banking system because of mistakes in Home Office records, according to an official watchdog. An examination of Theresa May’s existing “hostile environment” measures against illegal immigrants by the chief inspector of borders also found that hundreds of driving licences had been wrongly revoked after Home Office mistakes in identifying people as remaining in Britain unlawfully. David Bolt, the chief inspector of borders and immigration, said – after uncovering the 10% error rate in refusing new bank accounts in his 2016 report – that the Home Office “failed to appreciate the potential impact of such wrong decisions on those affected”. His first report on the impact of the government’s hostile environment measures said the Home Office did not know how many people had been refused new bank accounts since the measure was introduced in 2014, as there was no requirement on the banks or building societies to keep a tally. But in a sample of 169 cases in which people had been refused accounts because of a match with the Home Office database, the inspectors say they found 17 who should never have been on the list of disqualified people because they had the legal right to live in Britain. Inspectors also found 250 people whose driving licences had been wrongly revoked. Philip Augar, a former TSB board member, warned on Friday that mistakes would be made when banks and building societies began quarterly immigration status checks on 70m current account holders in January 2018. He told the BBC: “This is in the hands of the Home Office and the banks, neither of which are exactly known for flawless execution. What happens when something goes wrong, if a bank account is frozen and the owner is entirely legal or if they’ve simply got the wrong name? “Resolving those situations will be, in some cases smoothly done, but I can imagine it being an absolutely nightmare for some poor individuals.” Banks and building societies are being required every three months to carry out immigration status checks on every current account in Britain against a Home Office-supplied database of people who face removal or deportation or have absconded from immigration detention. They will be required to close the accounts of those whose names are identified as disqualified persons on the database run by Cifas, an anti-fraud organisation, using Home Office data. The banks and building societies have been advised that their default position in the face of a customer complaining about a mistake should be to refer them to the Home Office, regardless of what documentary evidence of their legal right to stay in Britain they may provide. Responding to the Guardian disclosure that the banking checks are to start in January, Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: “This is yet another sign that the Conservatives are hauling up the drawbridge and demonising immigrants. We should be very clear that immigrants have contributed much more to Britain’s economy and society than they have taken from it. The Conservatives are already winning their war on immigration by crashing the economy – as a result key workers such as nurses are leaving in droves.” A Home Office spokesperson defended the introduction of the checks: “We are developing an immigration system which is fair to people who are here legally, but firm with those who break the rules. Everyone in society can play their part in tackling illegal migration. “As approved by parliament in December 2016, from January banks and building societies will be required to carry out regular checks on the immigration status of all current account holders against the details of known illegal migrants to establish whether their customers are known to be in the UK unlawfully. This is part of our ongoing work to tackle illegal migration. People who are here legally will be unaffected.” • This article was amended on 25 September 2017 to correct the spelling of Philip Augar’s last name, from Auger as an earlier version had it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/23/coriolanus-dido-queen-of-carthage-review-rsc-stratford","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T10:26:52Z","webTitle":"Coriolanus/Dido, Queen of Carthage review – Shakespeare and Marlowe do battle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/23/coriolanus-dido-queen-of-carthage-review-rsc-stratford","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/23/coriolanus-dido-queen-of-carthage-review-rsc-stratford","fields":{"headline":"Coriolanus/Dido, Queen of Carthage review – Shakespeare and Marlowe do battle","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is not often that Shakespeare and Marlowe go head to head: you have to go back 50 years to find an imaginative Stratford pairing of The Merchant of Venice and The Jew of Malta. But, as part of its Rome season, the RSC brings us Coriolanus (1608) and Dido, Queen of Carthage (1586) on the same day. If Shakespeare’s is the greater play, it is the Marlowe production that for me generated greater excitement. Angus Jackson kicked off Stratford’s staging of Shakespeare’s Roman plays with an excellent Julius Caesar unfashionably staged in togas. He now concludes it with a decent, if unsurprising, Coriolanus played in modern dress. It starts brightly with a fork-lift truck placing stacks of grain behind an iron grille: a reminder that the play shows famished citizens seeking redress for their grievances. Shakespeare’s play also raises timeless questions about the danger posed to any state by an out-of-touch ruling class and a discontented populace. But Jackson’s production has little of the urgency of the brilliant Ralph Fiennes movie (2012), shot in Serbia and reeking of events in the former Yugoslavia. Jackson’s strength lies in exploring nuanced relationships. Sope Dirisu, who memorably played Cassius Clay in the Donmar’s One Night in Miami, brings to Coriolanus a strong presence and martial vigour but his verse-speaking lacks suppleness and irony. If he is never quite the mythical “lonely dragon” of Shakespeare’s text, he is most revealing in his contact with other people. His dependence on Volumnia is positively Oedipal and Haydn Gwynne, in the best performance of the evening, beautifully shows her transition from a silky Roman matriarch into a gaunt, hollow-eyed figure pleading with her son to abandon his attack on his native city. The homoeroticism of the relationship between Coriolanus and Aufidius is also graphically shown, with James Corrigan as the Volscian leader leaping into his old opponent’s arms and grieving over his dead body like a stricken lover. Paul Jesson as Menenius conveys the old patrician’s quasi-paternal worship of the boy-hero and, even if the casting of the popular tribunes as women seems like a token gesture to gender equality, the staging is clear and well ordered. But, while Jackson’s production is psychologically probing, it seems politically neutral. Having started by showing the legitimate anger of the people, it leaves the question of where ultimate power should lie hanging in the air. If Coriolanus is regularly revived, one of the joys of Dido, Queen of Carthage lies in discovering a virtually unknown play. Shakespeare’s Globe staged a dreadful production in 2003 which treated it as a playground romp. In fact, it is an extraordinary mix of sombre tragedy and ironic comedy in which Marlowe dramatises a classical legend familiar from Virgil: the Carthaginian queen offers a home to the Trojan refugee Aeneas, falls in love with him, and is then abandoned as he pursues his divinely appointed mission to found Rome. Kimberley Sykes directs it with a fluidity that perfectly balances the pictorial and the verbal. Her production, in Ti Green’s design, is full of strong images: the first glimpse of a stranded Aeneas seen dangling upside down; the closing sight of Dido writhing in suicidal despair. While Shakespeare may have parodied inflated Marlovian rhetoric in the Player King’s speech in Hamlet, the text is also full of unforgettable lines. Aeneas, describing Troy’s fall, talks of “Young infants swimming in their parents’ blood” and says: “We saw Cassandra sprawling in the streets.” Meanwhile Dido, foreshadowing Dr Faustus, says of Aeneas: “He’ll make me immortal with a kiss.” Edith Hall makes a fine point in the programme when she notes that Marlowe does not call his play Dido and Aeneas but gives the queen the title. Chipo Chung plays her with a volatility and sense of contradiction that anticipates Shakespeare’s Cleopatra. Chung brings out all of Dido’s rhapsodic fervour for Aeneas but is at her best in the great speech where she is torn between sabotaging his ships to prevent his departure and expressing her undying love. Sandy Grierson similarly catches the conflict in Aeneas between settling in seductive Carthage and fulfilling his imperial destiny. This may be early Marlowe that faithfully follows its source, but Sykes’s production shows there is wit in the storytelling: Ben Goffe’s mischievous Cupid, instructed to ensnare Dido, pursues her with a hypodermic needle like a madcap doctor, and Nicholas Day’s Jupiter eyes the boyish Ganymede with the indecent enthusiasm of an Olympian lech. In any juxtaposition of Shakespeare and Marlowe, the former will always be the winner, but this production makes a strong case for the youthful classicist from Canterbury. Coriolanus is at the Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 14 October. It will be broadcast live in cinemas on 11 October. Dido, Queen of Carthage is at the Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 28 October.

But he hated that “everyone performs it like it was a Christmas card”. He would have no such complaints about Sarah Frankcom’s austere yet tender revival, which uses the British actors’ natural accents – except for the American-inflected narrator-cum-stage manager (Youssef Kerkour) who moves the drama along and comments on the action. Frankcom’s production keeps the lights on in the auditorium for most of the duration and dispenses with the normal demarcations of space between actors and audience. For a long time you can’t quite work out who is a performer and who isn’t. But that’s only right and proper, because the fictional Grover’s Corners is clearly our town too. Wilder’s pageant of hatches, matches and dispatches heartily embraces Shakespeare’s line that “all the world’s a stage” – and, in this case, the men and women are mostly bit-part players. We glimpse, in turn, the milkman going about his daily round, the doomed paper boy whose life will be snuffed out in the war, the town drunk, mothers making breakfast and one father with his daughter and another berating his son. We never really get to know anybody apart from would-be farmer George (a fine debut from Patrick Elue) and the smart, vivacious Emily, played with luminous intensity by Norah Lopez Holden, who was such a memorable Desdemona at Bristol’s Tobacco Factory earlier this year. It’s schoolmates turned lovers Emily and George who are the linchpins as the play turns darker and settles down for a final act in the town graveyard, where the dead converse with each other. The drama’s bleak honesty about our inability to appreciate our lives as we live them, combined with its formal inventiveness, makes you wonder why it has become so associated with sentiment and folksiness. The show features a community choir, but Frankcom makes it sing in more ways than one. In paring it back to the bone, she ensures universality and emotional punch: a late coup de théâtre feels entirely earned. In the wake of the Manchester bombing, a play that celebrates the extraordinary in ordinary lives has undoubted resonance. Frankcom and her company don’t just reclaim Our Town from the accumulated dust of its performance history, they claim it for this city. At the Royal Exchange, Manchester, until 14 October.

Her Florence proposals are clearly intended to decontaminate the polluted air round the Brexit talks. She hopes for concord with EU negotiators on a compromise first step towards British departure, on a reasonable timetable. There has to be a deal on this. There has to be a move back from the “cliff-edge” option. But can she deliver? The first move was always going to be about money. Before anything else the EU is a bureaucracy, and Brexit will mean a loss of around 15% of its budget. From the very start, it was going to fight this with every weapon at its disposal. Britain’s refusal to agree a transitional payment was a total block to progress. May has sensibly removed it. Britain is clearly accepting reality, to the tune of some £18bn through to the end of the budget cycle in 2021. There are also possible legal obligations on pensions and capital projects after that. The same must apply to the deal on EU residents, which Britain had proposed to handle with typical Home Office administrative hell. “Take back control” should not mean xenophobia and economic self-harm. The prime minister now offers, in effect, a stay of execution on both issues for a further two years, so that tempers can cool and talks on trade can advance. But she has to clear her political deck of Brexit backwoodsmen. This minority of her MPs, egged on by Boris Johnson, have so far appeared to stymie every movement towards a deal. She has to indicate to them and the country that she is in charge and hard Brexit is just not responsible government. Yes, there has to be withdrawal, but yes there has to be open trade in goods, services and people with the rest of Europe. That should become a technical rather than political matter. At the heart of May’s problem is her ploy of appointing three Brexiters within her cabinet tent, as her Brexit negotiating “leads”. This has not worked. Two of them, Johnson and David Davis, are angling for her job, which means angling against her and each other. The chief negotiator, Davis, is constantly looking over his shoulder at “cliff-edge” backwoodsmen in his own party, who clearly do not represent polled public opinion, leavers and remainers alike. If progress is not swift, May has to shift both Davis and Johnson out of the front line and bring the negotiations into Downing Street under her direct control. Such a move has already been indicated by the move of the top Brexit official, Oliver Robbins, into the Cabinet Office. If necessary, make him lead negotiator. Brexit has to be married to reality. It cannot be interred in a Tory party leadership contest. May says she is in charge. Now she must prove it. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/22/england-rugby-union-squad-eddie-jones","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T09:53:00Z","webTitle":"Teenager Marcus Smith in England squad but no room for Joseph or Haskell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/22/england-rugby-union-squad-eddie-jones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/22/england-rugby-union-squad-eddie-jones","fields":{"headline":"Teenager Marcus Smith in England squad but no room for Joseph or Haskell","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The British &amp; Irish Lions Jonathan Joseph, James Haskell and Kyle Sinckler are among the high-profile absentees from England’s 33-man training squad with Eddie Jones also omitting Denny Solomona from the get-together in Oxford. Jones has named the Harlequins teenage fly-half Marcus Smith as well as 11 of England’s 15 Lions but Haskell, who received a yellow card for a spat with Joe Marler in his first appearance of the season last weekend, and George Kruis are absent. Kruis suffered an ankle injury in Saracens’ first match of the season but Haskell’s omission is notable with Sam Underhill getting the nod. Jones had previously hinted he would rest some of his Lions for the autumn internationals but has called up more than two-thirds of those available for the three-day camp which begins on Sunday. Solomona has scored three tries in three matches for Sale this season, having won his first two caps over the summer in Argentina, but he was sent home in disgrace from England’s pre-season camp in Teddington last month following a drunken night out with Manu Tuilagi. “This camp in Oxford is a really positive opportunity for the group to come back together and sharpen our focus and preparation ahead of our first match against Argentina [on 11 November],” said Jones. “This is our most important game this year and we want the players to come away from camp having trained well with a clear plan of how we want to play and win against the Pumas.” Harlequins’ 18-year-old Smith is part of the squad, who will continue preparations for England’s November fixtures against the Pumas, Samoa and Australia. The omission of his club-mate Sinckler is a surprise considering he was selected in all three Lions Tests in front of his England team-mate Dan Cole while Joseph’s omission is also eye-catching after a bright start to the season with Bath. Jones did leave the door ajar for the omitted Lions to force their way back into contention for the autumn series. “You have to remember this is a training squad for Oxford, we’ll make selection calls for the autumn further down the line,” he said. “They’re not in the squad for this camp, if things change there’s a possibility they could be in the squad for the Argentina game. “This is the training squad and these are the players I want to look at. I wouldn’t jump at shadows just yet. Some guys need to work on their games and we’ve had those discussions with them. We don’t think those coming back from injury will benefit from being with England.” The Bath duo of Underhill and Charlie Ewels, Saracens’ Nick Isiekwe, Sale’s Tom Curry and Harry Williams of Exeter are all selected, having made an impression when winning their first caps during the summer tour of Argentina. Marland Yarde is also in the squad, ahead of Solomona while again there is no place for Bath’s in-form winger Semesa Rokoduguni. Ben Youngs and Billy Vunipola are included after both withdrew from the Lions tour because of family reasons and injury respectively while Dylan Hartley and Jamie George are joined by the Bath hooker Tom Dunn, who along with Smith is the only uncapped member of the squad, in the front row.

Not a single personal insult was uttered by any member of the crew during the whole of the “mission”, which ended on 17 September, claimed the astrobiologist Sam Payler, 28, a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. Being without the internet created more difficulty than social conflict, since it meant problems took days instead of minutes to solve. The Hi-Seas (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) mission was the fifth in a series of similar experiments funded by Nasa. The missions have studied the food that explorers would eat away from Earth, the social interaction of crew members in a claustrophobic environment, and the psychological and biological impact. Speaking from Hawaii, where the four men and two women had lived in a 1,200 sq ft dome situated on a barren active volcano, Payler told the Press Association: “I was very lucky to have a great crew. No isolated group can be immune to any arguments, but everyone did an amazing job of working through any issues we had. “We spent a lot of time talking about how to avoid conflict. Incredibly, not once did anyone use a personal insult. “The group was very carefully selected to try to get a group that would work well together and get along, and we seem to have achieved that.” Browsing the internet was impossible because of a 20-minute communication delay intended to mimic the time it takes for radio signals to travel between Earth and Mars. This departure from modern life on Earth proved to be one of the crew’s greatest challenges, said Payler. “The lack of internet and long delay meant problem solving was often very difficult, with issues that might normally take five minutes to solve taking two to three days,” he said. “We also couldn’t use social media or speak live to anyone back on Earth, and so communicated only through pre-recorded messages and emails. The crew were the only people we saw and spoke to for eight months.” Reports from the University of Hawaii on the project have been positive – at least those carried on the university’s news service. However, previous research has shown that problems among crew are as likely to arise on the journey to Mars as during the time the explorers spend there. In one previous simulation of the 17-month round trip, via a windowless pretend spaceship at a Moscow industrial estate, the activity levels of the all-male multinational crew plummeted as time wore on. Scientists judged that only two of the six men adapted to the mission, with the others developing sleep disorders. Various other studies of the impact of Mars missions are planned around the world. China has unveiled plans to build a 400m yuan (£47m) replica of Mars on a spectacular, sandswept corner of the Tibetan plateau – the latest leg of its multibillion-dollar race for space. The “simulated Mars station” – a 95,000 sq km tribute to the solar system’s second-smallest planet – will be built in Qinghai province’s Haixi Mongolian and Tibetan autonomous prefecture, not far from the westernmost tip of the Great Wall. Hawaii’s Hi-Seas missions take place on an 8,200ft high rocky plain below the summit of Mauna Loa, where the crew members lived and worked as if they were on Mars, carrying out maintenance, conducting scientific studies and exercising. They relied on “shelf-stable” food and were denied all fresh fruit, meat or vegetables. Space suits had to be worn on excursions outside the dome, which were carried out in teams. “Our days were packed with the types of task work which helped us not go stir crazy,” Payler said. “Keeping focused and busy is key to keeping physiological health up. We also worked out a lot (six times a week for me) to keep spirits high and help us deal with the physical EVA work (going out on the volcano in space suits). “The habitat never felt small to me, partly because I got on so well with my crewmates. We always found fun things to do such as watch movies together or play board games. Had we not got along so well, I’m sure it would have felt a lot more claustrophobic.” Payler said he especially missed fresh fruit, juice, ice-cream, steak, fresh seafood and beer. “The morning we ‘landed’ we were brought fresh fruit, doughnuts and a few items a few people had requested from McDonalds (Sausage and Egg McMuffins),” he said. “Later, the mission support folks barbecued us some steak and prawns which was amazing. We also went to a bar for some local Hawaiian beer and cocktails.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/22/talking-horses-friday-22-september-best-bets-newbury-newcastle-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T09:02:34Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Friday’s best bets as Ayr Gold Cup meeting abandoned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/22/talking-horses-friday-22-september-best-bets-newbury-newcastle-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/22/talking-horses-friday-22-september-best-bets-newbury-newcastle-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Friday’s best bets as Ayr Gold Cup meeting abandoned","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If you missed the news earlier, Saturday’s Ayr Gold Cup card has been abandoned. The decision means no racing will take place at this important three-day fixture, the Thursday and Friday meetings having already been lost to waterlogging. There are plenty of questions officials at the track will face after what could be politely described as a shambles. When Friday’s meeting was called off at 7pm on Thursday night after racecourse public relations head Iain Ferguson had sounded increasingly confident that the fixture would get the go ahead newspapers were forced to make major changes. No publication would have been more affected than the Racing Post. An hour later a tweet depicting a number of clowns was posted by the paper’s editor, Bruce Millington. Conditions at Newbury, where the going is on the firm side, could not be more different than at Ayr. The consistent Second Thought (4.00), who has never been out of the first two in six races, is the one that catches the eye in the Listed Dubai Duty Free Cup. The William Haggas-trained runner should be suited by the step back up to seven furlongs and his second to Harry Angel at Haydock in May when last seen reads very well now. Friday’s running of the Haynes, Hanson &amp; Clark Stakes usually attracts useful two-year-olds and this year’s renewal could be booked for White Mocha (3.30), who ran another race of promise following his Haydock debut victory when second under a penalty to Al Jellaby at Salisbury earlier this month.

Non-UK residents made 4m visits to Britain in July, an increase of 6% on last year and spent £2.7bn, up 3% on July 2016, according to the Office for National Statistics. The increase in foreign visitors during the peak summer months failed to match the rise around the Easter period, when their numbers and the amount they spent increased by about 20% on the year before. The surge in tourist numbers during the spring has kept the annual rate of growth at 8%, but analysts believe there will be no repeat of the double digit increases seen earlier in the year because of terror attacks in Manchester and London and the recent weakness of the dollar, which has deterred some American tourists from travelling to London. Guy Ellison, an analyst at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, which monitors leisure firms such as London Eye and Madame Tussaud’s owner Merlin, said: “The pick up in inbound tourism is welcome, with London likely to have been the prime beneficiary. “It was always anticipated that inbound tourism would see a material pick up in 2017 thanks to the sharp devaluation of sterling, though the terrorist attacks in London undoubtedly deterred some visitors,” he said. A surge in numbers throughout the year has buoyed Britain’s tourism and services industries, at a time when uncertainty created by the EU referendum has damaged the confidence of UK consumers and businesses. Brexit triggered a 20% slump in the value of the pound last year against most major currencies that has since waned, especially against the dollar where there is only a 13% drop since last year. The pound’s fall made most holiday and business trips to the UK more attractive, with European visitors coming in the largest numbers, up 240,000 to 2.5 million. The growth in tourists from June to July was helped by a surge in numbers from the rest of the world, which passenger flight records show came mostly from China and east Asia. Between June and July the number of non-European and US tourists increased from 570,000 to 840,000. However, the overall figures was pulled back by the number of American tourists, which stalled at 650,000. Tourism agency VisitBritain said last year that it expected overseas visitors would spend £24.1bn in 2017, up 8% on 2016. But while earnings growth was 18% in March and April, it has since declined to between 2% and 4%. In the last year, holiday visits to the UK were up 12% to 1.78m. Business visits were down by 1.7% at 710,000. Staycations were also a feature of the summer months after a fall in the pound hit the number UK residents making visits abroad. Britons travelling to Europe and beyond fell to 6.9m, a 2% decrease when compared with July 2016. Spending by UK residents on foreign holidays also declined by 2% to £4.5bn on the same month a year before. In some airports during July, British holidaymakers heading to Europe were offered record low foreign exchange rates. In one airport customers could only get 88 euro cents for every pound. Vistors from the eurozone have seen the pound fall from above €1.40 in 2015 to €1.12 this week. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club said the combination of people staying at home for holidays and the influx of foreign tourists helped to bolster the economy. “It is notable that there have been reports that retail sales were boosted in August by more people taking holidays at home as well as spending by tourists,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/22/cressida-pollock-quits-as-head-of-english-national-opera","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T10:03:19Z","webTitle":"Cressida Pollock to step down as head of English National Opera","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/22/cressida-pollock-quits-as-head-of-english-national-opera","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/22/cressida-pollock-quits-as-head-of-english-national-opera","fields":{"headline":"Cressida Pollock to step down as head of English National Opera","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Cressida Pollock, the former McKinsey management consultant who steered English National Opera through some of its most turbulent times, is to leave her job next summer. Pollock said she was “greatly saddened to leave this incredible institution”, but did not give a reason for leaving. She had been the company’s interim chief executive and was given the job full time in 2015, a month after the resignation of artistic director John Berry. Berry’s resignation came as the company lurched from one crisis to the next, struggling to cope with a £5m a year cut in Arts Council England funding. Before Berry quit, ENO had also lost its chairman, its executive director and its place in the ACE national portfolio. Pollock’s mission was, in effect, to save ENO – to find a sustainable business plan. That meant cutting the number of productions the company staged at its vast, difficult-to-fill home, the 2,350-seat Coliseum. That strategy prompted the departure of music director Mark Wigglesworth and the threat of a strike by its chorus. ENO is on a far more stable footing today. Pollock said: “When I arrived, the ENO was in crisis and the company’s survival was in real doubt. I am delighted that we have brought stability and secured ENO’s future. My successor will be able to focus on ensuring that the ENO continues to produce award-winning work at the heart of the UK opera scene.” Harry Brunjes, the company’s chairman, said Pollock had “turned around our fortunes to deliver financial security, while keeping us on a solid creative footing. “Cressida has led the ENO back into the Arts Council England’s national portfolio and brought together a leadership team who the board are confident can continue to help ENO thrive and develop. On behalf of the board it has been a pleasure to observe her courage and positivity in the face of ENO’s immense challenges. We will be sorry to lose her energy and determination to achieve success when she steps down next June.” The leadership team recruited by Pollock includes the American stage director Daniel Kramer as artistic director and Martyn Brabbins as music director. Both are still too new to make any real assessment. In an interview with the Guardian, Kramer praised Pollock “for leading with a torch, with a thousand guns aimed at her”. The ENO had been Pollock’s first experience of running an organisation. Only 32 when she was made interim chief executive, she was young enough to have housemates – revealing them, in the Financial Times, to be the fashion journalist Henry Conway and Lottie Fenby, a milliner. Before joining ENO Pollock, a Cambridge law and classics graduate who told one interviewer her favourite saying was “life is only linear in retrospect”, worked at McKinsey &amp; Company and was one of the founding employees of Somerset Capital Management, an emerging markets investment fund. ENO said it would begin the process of appointing a new chief executive later this month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/22/elton-john-support-same-sex-marriage-australia-vote","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T08:24:39Z","webTitle":"Elton John voices support for same-sex marriage in Australia amid national vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/22/elton-john-support-same-sex-marriage-australia-vote","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/22/elton-john-support-same-sex-marriage-australia-vote","fields":{"headline":"Elton John voices support for same-sex marriage in Australia amid national vote","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Elton John has called for gay marriage to be legalised in Australia, as the country votes in a postal survey to ascertain the level of support for a change in the law. In a heartfelt post on Instagram, John wrote that for him and his husband David Furnish, who he married in 2014, “being able to openly love and commit to one another, and for that to be recognised and celebrated is what makes life truly worth living”. He said that recognition “makes us want to be as kind, responsible and productive members of society, as well as the best parents, that we can be. I love Australia. I love its spirit, its lack of pretence, its passion. I hope it can embrace the honesty and courage that seeks gay marriage as an expression not of desire but of love”. He made mention of his first marriage in 1984, to German recording engineer Renate Bluel, which took place in St Mark’s church in Sydney. “I wanted more than anything to be a good husband, but I denied who I really was, which caused my wife sadness, and caused me huge guilt and regret,” he said. “To be worthy of someone’s love, you have to be brave enough and clear eyed enough to be honest with yourself and your partner.” John joins other public figures who have called for Australians to show their support for gay marriage, including TV host Ellen DeGeneres and Apple boss Tim Cook. Margot Robbie wrote “love is love” on Instagram this week, while her fellow Australian actor Liam Hemsworth wrote: “I believe it’s a human right to be able to marry the person you love regardless of gender.” A Guardian Essential poll this week found that 55% of people surveyed were in favour of gay marriage, though support had dropped 4% in a fortnight as opposition rose. The “no” campaign have spent five times more than their opponents on TV advertising. Australians have until 7 November to show their support or resistance to the legalisation of gay marriage via the voluntary survey. If a majority show support, Australian parliament will debate and vote on the issue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/22/st-louis-missouri-ferguson-protests-black-lives-matter","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T14:42:12Z","webTitle":"St Louis protests: three years since Ferguson, why hasn't anything changed?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/22/st-louis-missouri-ferguson-protests-black-lives-matter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/22/st-louis-missouri-ferguson-protests-black-lives-matter","fields":{"headline":"St Louis protests: three years since Ferguson, why hasn't anything changed?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s become a familiar scene in the the city’s metropolitan area, equal parts deja vu and cliche. Again, protesters marched up and down a stretch of Missouri highway with signs that read “black lives matter” and “say their names”. Again they beat drums, cheered chants and locked arms. Above, helicopters buzzed while police in riot gear cordoned off sections of road. In rolled the armored bearcat, garrisoned with Swat officers. As if on cue, an hour or so in, the protest was declared unlawful – no reason was immediately given. Threats of arrest and chemical munitions rang over police PA. For demonstrators and reform advocates in the greater St Louis area, the exhaustion, the wearying sense of repetition was palpable – but so was the resolve. “When folks stop making a mockery of the justice system, that’s when this stops,” said protester Jay Weaver as riot police slowly but steadily advanced their phalanx towards the crowd. “Until that mock trial mess going on in the courtroom stops, this can’t stop. They’re the ones making things worse, not the people out on the street protesting.” Three years and some change since the police shooting of Mike Brown and the ensuing unrest burned the name Ferguson into the nation’s consciousness, the visuals persisted a few miles down the road at the St Louis Galleria in Clayton, Missouri. So did the catalyst. This was sixth day of protest since the acquittal of former St Louis officer Jason Stockley, who is white, over the 2011 death of Anthony Lamar Smith, a black man. Stockley shot and killed Smith after a car chase; he said he thought Smith was reaching for a gun. The defense presented evidence, which the judge in the case ignored, that the gun recovered may have been planted. Stockley, who wasn’t arrested until four and a half years after the 2011 incident, had precedent on his side. No St Louis police officer had ever been convicted for the death of a suspect. On 15 September, Stockley saw that streak extended, and the ensuing protests raised the question: where was all the change that Ferguson seemed bound to deliver? All the wrong lessons, all the wrong conclusions Among the answers is that legally, there was little that was required to change, despite substantial involvement by the Obama-era Department of Justice. One of the most important revelations of the post-Ferguson reckoning was the fractured nature of of law enforcement in the metropolitan area. St Louis County and city bounded by the Missouri and Mississippi rivers has a population of a little over 1 million people, yet it contains 59 separate law enforcement agencies, each in charge of its own staffing, training and policies. Even though the tiny department of Ferguson, with its 40-50 officers was legally bound to make a wholesale changes in the wake of a bombshell DoJ report that uncovered blatant racial bias in the department, that mandate affected a minuscule portion of the region’s law enforcement. “That’s one jurisdiction and it has no impact on what’s happening to the St Louis police,” said Christy Lopez, a professor of law at Georgetown University and the leader of the DoJ team that produced the Ferguson report. “What you hope with these sorts of agreements is that, as people start to see them work they become more and more imaginable to other departments.” And there is evidence that in Ferguson, the consent decree – essentially a court order for the department to make certain reforms and adjustments – is working. At a hearing on Tuesday, a federal judge said the city has made “good progress” on its reform efforts and done so in “good faith”. Ferguson’s police chief, Delrish Moss, told HuffPost that “the police department’s outlook and view is vastly different than it used to be. We’re working with the community. We are enjoying that relationship.” But there is little evidence that this attitude will be contagious to the dozens of other agencies, least of all the St Louis Metropolitan police department, which is 25 times the size of Ferguson. First, the Trump DoJ under the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has indicated repeatedly that it has no interest in pursuing the type of “patterns and practice” investigations or community-policing oriented initiatives that were launched in places like Ferguson, Baltimore and Cleveland during the previous administration. A collaborative reform effort once under discussion between St Louis county and the DoJ is functionally dead under the new administration. Secondly, as Lopez puts it, “you can’t legislate goodwill”, something that she was reminded of when she saw St Louis officers mocking protesters on Sunday night by co-opting their chant “whose streets, our streets” as they conducted mass arrests, drawing dismay from some law enforcement organisations and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The interim police chief, Lawrence O’Toole, compounded the brash demeanor by announcing the following day: “The police owned tonight … We’re in control.” It was a display that many who live in the city had a hard time imagining O’Toole’s predecessor, Sam Dotson, who was in command during Ferguson, making. The police were also criticized for “kettling tactics” – blocking protesters into a confined area to make mass arrests rather than letting them leave – and deploying teargas and violent takedowns on compliant citizens as 123 people were taken to jail on Sunday. There is recent context: in many of the most confrontational scenes from the 2014 Ferguson protests, when militarized cops with tactical vehicles pointed assault weapons at protesters, those officers were almost entirely St Louis city and county cops, not from Ferguson. “It is worse than if they hadn’t learned anything. It’s more as if they’ve learned all the wrong lessons and drawn all the wrong conclusions,” Lopez said of the officers who engaged in the chant. Rather than providing a sober moment of reflection, the legacy of Ferguson has instead been to make many law enforcement officers in the region feel aggrieved, like their backs are against the wall. That was certainly the energy at the St Louis fraternal order of police lodge this week, where the words “we won’t be defeated” were taped up on paper signs outside. The building resembled a storm shelter on Wednesday, with windows boarded up and mountains of bottled water and packaged food stacked all around, donations from community members seeking to offer tangible support to the police in quelling the unrest. The boards were part necessity, part proactivity. Police said their front two windows were broken by vandals on Monday night who then spray painted “KS” on a wall, which business manager Jeff Roorda believed stood for “kill Stockley”. He said they figured they might as well board the rest of them up until the demonstrations blew over. “We think it was in retaliation for the fact that we were trying to feed and water our officers which is a real shame. Those guys are doing a hard job,” Roorda said. He had no regrets about the tactics police used on Sunday night, despite all the criticism, calling the arrests a “completely appropriate reaction”. “Those folks had been asked to disperse for an hour and a half. So it was time for them to go to jail.” As for the provocative chants from uniformed officers, Roorda demurred. “I’m not saying that I condone those statements but they were made after 12 hours of dealing with very harrowing protests, and, I don’t see the harm.” They came for nothing but my son’s body Meanwhile, across town at city hall, a small group of demonstrators had gathered to celebrate what should have been the 22nd birthday of Isaiah Hammett, who was shot and killed by police in June. Authorities said Hammett “fired numerous shots at police officers” with a high-powered rifle from his home before being gunned down by Swat officers in a “no-knock” raid. His family countered that a private forensic analyst found no sign of gunfire coming from inside the house. The rifle which police said Hammett fired, his family said was legally owned and non-functional, in the box waiting to be returned. In their version, Hammett pulled his elderly grandfather to the floor when they heard someone breaking into the home, and when Hammett got up, he was shot in cold blood, targeted by police who had been after him for years. It was the same type of grudge that activists believe motivated Stockley to kill Smith in 2011. “They came for nothing but my son’s body,” said Isaiah’s mother Gina Torres. “They’ve harassed my son since before he turned 17.” Police said they found more than a dozen guns and “a quantity” of marijuana in the home, but the family countered that all the weapons were owned legally, and that marijuana is decriminalized in the city of St Louis under 35g – police have not yet disclosed how much “a quantity” was, and the investigation is ongoing. And while demonstrators handed out literature outside, inside city hall, Torres was one of dozens there backing demands for the city to adopt a body camera program for police. St Louis is one of the few major city departments in the US to not have already begun at least trialling a body camera program in the aftermath of Ferguson. When the measure passed, opening the way for a one-year trial of body cameras for every officer, Torres’s celebration was short – she will only believe it when it happens. “Missouri is the ‘show me’ state, you can talk, but you’ve got to show me,” she told the Guardian. More than that, neither she, nor most of the area’s activists, really see body cameras as an answer. Nationwide, they have not led to a single police conviction since they started being rapidly adopted. What Torres really wants is an independent investigator for police killings. “How can you have an investigation by the same police that murdered your kid? We need other people for investigations, because they’re going to write what they want. They’re going to sit there and say that they were innocent. We need people to investigate these killings who are not police officers.” That’s unlikely. If anything, the state is bending towards more protections for law enforcement from the general public, not the other way around. Shortly after Republican governor Eric Greitens came into office, replacing Democrat Jay Nixon, he signed a so-called “blue lives matter” bill , essentially making police and their families a protected class in the state, making penalties for crimes against them longer and harsher – even though they were already more severe than for crimes against civilians. Last year, the state legislature passed a law limiting public access to body camera footage, meaning that even if the city adopts them, people like Torres will face daunting legal hurdles if they are trying to make sense of what happened to their loved ones in a fatal police incident. Asked if she believes meaningful reforms are really possible in St Louis, or whether she’ll ever feel safe there again, Torres said, her voice breaking: “All I can do is hope, pray.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/22/we-all-need-to-think-more-like-cassowaries-here-are-some-rules-to-live-by","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T05:26:09Z","webTitle":"We all need to think more like cassowaries.

As part of an annual fundraiser, Craigburn primary school asked students and teachers to wear a dress or casual clothes on Friday, and donate a dollar or two. The school originally aimed to raise $900. But then Cory Bernardi, an outspoken and deeply conservative senator from South Australia, took to Twitter about it, posting a link and commenting: “One school in SA now has ‘wear a dress day’. This gender morphing is really getting absurd.” His tweet was quickly picked up and criticised, notably by Australian comedian Josh Thomas, who accused Bernardi of “purposefully misrepresenting the intent” of the students and their charity drive. Thomas donated $2,000 of his own money to the school and urged others to do the same. By Saturday afternoon the school had received $246,000, making it the largest single day for donations in the charity’s six-year history. Many of the listed donations were dedicated to Bernardi. “On behalf of our good friend, Cory Bernadi!” said one. “A classic own goal. So good to hear there are now many other schools also signing up. Go for it, kids!” said another. One commenter, Rose Hill, congratulated the students on their successful fundraiser. “I would never have known about your marvellous initiative without the free national publicity from Mr Bernardi,” she wrote. “Have a fun day dressing up for the cause.” Australia is in the midst of a divisive and hostile debate over allowing same sex marriage, and Bernardi is a strident voice for the no campaign. He frequently speaks out against same-sex marriage, an anti-bullying program for schools to assist LGBT students, and other pushes for LGBT rights. The senator, who now leads his own Australian Conservatives party, was formerly in the governing Coalition but quit in February. In 2012 he was resigned from his role as shadow parliamentary secretary to then opposition leader Tony Abbott after linking homosexuality to bestiality, a comparison he drew again in 2013. On Friday he Tweeted a photo of himself with the caption “after a successful week of fundraising and politics, it’s time for a cold beer on a beautiful day”. It was unclear whether he was referring to the incident, but many Twitter users intrepreted it as a reference to the incident. “Craigburn Primary School can not thank you enough for your help. Well done big fella,” said one user. On Friday, Morgan Koegel, the chief executive of the One Girl charity which runs the Do it in a dress campaign, said the incident “started as a negative but honestly I am feeling really positive about it.” “Over the last 24 hours we’ve seen such an outpouring of support that it’s impossible not to have a smile on your face,” Koegel said. “$900 would have educated three girls for a year … [$200,000] will now send hundreds and hundreds of girls to school with everything that they need.” The One Girl website saw a 5,000% increase in traffic on Thursday, and crashed about half a dozen times. The campaign has run annually for six years, with a growing number of schools taking part. It has nothing to do with the marriage equality debate or gender identity, and is based on the school dress being a symbol of empowerment in developing countries. Last year Do it in a dress raised $800,000. Participants can style and hold their own events, which might involve a mufti day, like Craigburn school, or taking on physical challenges while wearing a dress. “The idea behind Do it in a dress is simple,” said Koegel. “In these countries a school dress is quite rare, only one in five have the opportunity to go to high school. So a girl is more likely to be sexually assaulted than go to school, or more likely be a child bride than go to school. So in these countries a girl’s uniform is a symbol of opportunity and empowerment.” Koegel said the charity drive had “accidentally” been caught up in the marriage equality debate. After media attention on Craigburn school’s fundraising, News Corp national newspaper the Australian reported it as being “hijacked by same-sex marriage activists on both sides of the debate”. “It’s more a case of lack of research than a hijacking,” said Koegel. “This campaign has been running for many years. Our single mission is to educate one million girls across Africa. We have nothing to do with Australian politics.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/22/testing-of-illicit-drugs-to-be-done-at-australian-event-for-first-time","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T05:34:16Z","webTitle":"Testing of illicit drugs to be done at Australian event for first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/22/testing-of-illicit-drugs-to-be-done-at-australian-event-for-first-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/22/testing-of-illicit-drugs-to-be-done-at-australian-event-for-first-time","fields":{"headline":"Testing of illicit drugs to be done at Australian event for first time","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The ACT government has agreed to allow pill testing at a coming music festival, in an effort to reduce deaths and harm to young people taking illicit drugs. It’s the first time the long called for process has been allowed to operate at an Australian event, and harm minimisation advocates have labelled it a win. Safety Testing and Advisory Service at Festivals and Events (STA-Safe) would conduct the drug-testing service at the the Spilt Milk festival on 25 November, the ACT health minister, Meegan Fitzharris, said on Friday. Those attending the festival will be able to take their drugs to the testing site – run by trained professionals and not monitored by police – to find out more about the ingredients, but they will be advised that the testing process has limitations and cannot identify every substance in a sample. They will then have the choice of dumping the drugs in amnesty bins, which will be destroyed on site, or holding on to them. Every participant will be warned by trained counsellors about the health risks of taking illicit drugs. Fitzharris said the danger and legal implications of taking illicit drugs had not changed, but evidence showed pill testing would help keep young people safe. “In 2015, several people aged between 19 and 26 tragically lost their lives in Australia,” Fitzharris said. “Pill testing means young people who are considering taking drugs can be informed about what’s really in the their pills and how potent they are. And it creates an opportunity to remind them of the risks before they make the final decision to take a drug.” The announcement follows more than a year of negotiations between the ACT government, law enforcement bodies, event promoters and the STA-Safe consortium – led by Harm Reduction Australia, Australian Drug Observatory, Noffs Foundation, DanceWize and Students for Sensible Drug Policy. It was hoped testing – which involves scraping a small sample of the substance for analysis – would go ahead at last year’s event, and at the Groovin’ The Moo festival, but agreements were not reached in time. Matt Noffs, chief executive of the Noffs Foundation, praised the ACT government’s “political courage”, and hoped other governments would follow suit. “We needed to have a way to reduce the harm associated with drug-taking at music festivals,” he said. “This is not only a historic but a critical step for Australia to take.” Noffs said drug-harm minimisation in Australia had not achieved such a positive move since the introduction of needle-exchange programs and safe-injecting rooms. “It reminds me of the courage [former NSW premier] Bob Carr displayed in the 90s and early 2000s when he did allow a medically supervised injection room, which has since saved countless lives,” he said. “I really hope that other governments can see the sense in this and that as we go to pick the next state for this to happen, we can work with a government that is as courageous as the ACT.” Pill testing at festivals has been used successfully for more than a decade in New Zealand, the UK and Europe. About 20% of substances tested at New Zealand music festivals last year were a different drug to what the buyers believed them to be, and 11% had other ingredients as well. In January, three people died and 30 overdosed on MDMA after taking pills from a “bad batch” of Ecstasy in Melbourne, prompting advocates to step up calls for testing. One month later, 31 people were treated after overdosing on GHB at the Electric Parade music festival. Polling conducted last year found 57% of people supported pill testing, and only 13% opposed it. Support was highest among those aged over 55."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/22/carcass-of-12-metre-whale-to-be-dug-up-from-beach-after-outcry","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T06:41:11Z","webTitle":"Carcass of 12-metre whale to be dug up from beach after outcry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/22/carcass-of-12-metre-whale-to-be-dug-up-from-beach-after-outcry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/22/carcass-of-12-metre-whale-to-be-dug-up-from-beach-after-outcry","fields":{"headline":"Carcass of 12-metre whale to be dug up from beach after outcry","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Authorities in the Australian coastal town of Port Macquarie will dig up the carcass of a 12-metre, 20-tonne humpback whale from a local beach and dump it in landfill because of fears the animal is attracting sharks. On Friday, officials at the Port Macquarie Hastings Council announced that the body of the whale, which was buried as an “option of last resort” after it washed up on Nobbys Beach in the beach town in New South Wales on Sunday, would be removed following an outcry from local residents. In a statement, the council said the whale would be dug up, cut into pieces using chainsaws and then placed in skip bins. Once full, the bins will be lifted off the beach using a 220-tonne crane and then taken to a waste facility 25 kilometres away. The council’s general manager, Craig Swift-McNair, said it would be “a hard and smelly job”. “This is going to be a challenging job but council recognises it is a high priority for many in our community,” he said. Work will begin on Monday, but Swift-McNair conceded there were “a number of unknowns that will affect the timing of the operation” and that it would probably take more than a day to complete. The whale was buried on the beach after strong winds and a retreating tide prevented Marine Rescue Port Stephens and the National Parks and Wildlife Service from towing it out to sea. But the decision outraged the town’s residents, who feared the leachate from the animal would find its way into the water and attract sharks. The council agreed to exhume the whale after the owner of a local surf school, Corey Enfield, presented a petition signed by more than 3,000 people. The belief that whale burials are linked to shark sightings is popular among surfers but has never been tested. Beaches in the town have been closed since the animal was buried and the New South Wales Department of Industry said there had been between one and four shark detections at Port Macquarie each day since Sunday. Citing “safety reasons”, the council said it would prevent members of the public or the media from watching the whale being exhumed, including the use of drones."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/23/new-zealand-election-voting-begins-jacinda-ardern-bill-english","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T20:50:05Z","webTitle":"New Zealand election: voting begins as Ardern and English fight closest battle in years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/23/new-zealand-election-voting-begins-jacinda-ardern-bill-english","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/23/new-zealand-election-voting-begins-jacinda-ardern-bill-english","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand election: voting begins as Ardern and English fight closest battle in years","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Voting has opened in New Zealand’s most exciting general election in years, with New Zealanders asked to decide between the status quo of National or taking a punt on new Labour leader Jacinda Ardern. Polling booths opened in libraries, schools and town halls around the country at 9am (9pm Friday GMT) and will close at 7pm, after which results begin to roll in immediately. A record number of voters have already cast their vote since booths opened in selected areas on 11 September. More than 1.2 million people cast an early vote this year, compared with 717, 579 in 2014.. On Friday long lines were reported at polling booths around the country in what the electoral commission has just confirmed was the biggest day of advance voting on record with 253, 473 casting their vote. The commission estimates 3,569,830 New Zealanders are eligible to vote this year. Archaic legislation bans campaigning in any form on voting day itself, including banners, T-shirts and roadside advertising. New Zealand media is banned from publishing any politics-related articles other than how and where to vote. Even members of the public are unable to discuss their voting choices on social media until the polls close, in case they influence those who have yet to cast their ballot. New Zealanders are being asked to choose between prime minister Bill English’s National party, which has had nine years at the tiller; Jacinda Ardern, just seven weeks into her leadership of a revitalised Labour party; the Greens, or one of the plethora of smaller parties, which include New Zealand First, the Opportunities party, the Maori party, Act and the New Zealand Outdoors party. With the 120 seats in parliament elected via constituency and party lists, coalitions – formal or otherwise – are the norm and English or Ardern could be forced to court a kingmaker. According to opinion polls, that could be Winston Peters, leader of the populist, anti-immigration New Zealand First. Two months ago the crawl towards the general election was looking pre-determined. National, led by ex-finance minister English, was polling well and looked set to be returned comfortably to a fourth term in government. Labour’s Andrew Little had failed to connect with voters, and on 1 August he stepped down as leader, nominating his 37-year-old deputy Jacinda Ardern to take his place – although she had previously said she had no interest in the job. But within days Ardern’s campaign of “relentless positivity” set fire to the political landscape. Labour soared in the polls, climbing 20 points in a matter of weeks to overtake National as the preferred party, with Ardern ahead of English as preferred prime minister. “The Jacinda effect, also known as Jacindamania, has been looming for a long time because she is a politician who has been a rising star and someone with a strong X-factor and charismatic personality for a few years now,” said Bryce Edwards, a political commentator. “At this point the Labour party seems to have gone from a grey old party with a lot of doom and gloom about them, to a party of Corbyn-esque excitement and similar support.” The UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn recently sent Ardern a video message of support, urging her to win “for all of us”. However, in the last 10 days of campaigning, Labour’s momentum has began to falter and it has dropped seven to 10 points in the last three major polls. The opposition’s campaign suffered significant damage when Ardern announced a tax working group would be set up to explore how best to tackle the country’s housing crisis, refusing to rule out the introduction of new taxes. A later clarification that no new taxes would be introduced before the next election in 2020 was not enough to stop National from seizing the chance to launch an assault on the party’s economic credibility, claiming there was a NZ$11.7bn (AU$10.7bn/£6.3bn) hole in Labour’s fiscal plan. It was a claim not backed by a single economist, but one English rolled on with. National, which has promised NZ$2bn of tax-cuts for middle-income earners, also claimed Labour would raise income tax – a charge Ardern labelled “scaremongering” and “lies”. In the final week the Labour leader pleaded with young New Zealanders – who, alongside women, are her most loyal supporters – to get out and vote. “We have called and knocked on thousands of doors and now we’re at the critical moment,” she said. “If you’ve seen any of the polls you know this is an election that is going to come down to turnout … please, please make sure you vote.” For many New Zealanders the twists and turns of the 2017 election campaign have been unsettling, rather than exciting. Many are reluctant to upset the status quo, which has seen New Zealand’s economy survive the global financial crisis and two major earthquakes. Tamati McLean, 38, a meat-worker from Bulls in the north island, told the Guardian he plans to vote for English because he does not trust Labour to deliver on its promises, which include eradicating child poverty, building 100,000 affordable homes in 10 years, and introducing a water tax. “Jacinda has been saying all these things but until I see it with my own eyes I am sticking with National,” he said. “I need to see it with my own eyes to become real, and with National, I have seen it – so I believe it.” Follow the results as they come in on our live blog."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/25/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite-review","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"Marvel vs Capcom Infinite review: too much power, no responsibility","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/25/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/25/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite-review","fields":{"headline":"Marvel vs Capcom Infinite review: too much power, no responsibility","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Over the course of two decades, the Marvel vs Capcom franchise has mutated into a sprawling crazy quilt of exuberant brawling. Look for a unifying theme and it seems to be loopy excess, with overflowing character rosters, screen-filling hyper combos and a fondness for mob-handed tag-team battles. “Gonna take you for a ride!” declared Marvel vs Capcom 2’s jazzy selection screen ear-worm, and if the shield-chucking, hellfire-hosing action could occasionally be chaotic to the point of confusion, it was certainly never dull. Six years on from Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom (a buffed-up version of the third instalment that boosted its warrior headcount to an impressive 48) and here comes a new challenger. In Marvel Vs Capcom Infinite, the conflict implied in the title has become inextricable. A diabolical team-up by Marvel’s tetchy AI zealot Ultron and Mega Man’s lantern-jawed nemesis Sigma has forcibly fused the two corporate universes together, creating an uncanny hybrid dimension. In the Saturday morning cartoon-worthy story mode, the combined villain Ultron Sigma has also unleashed a cyborg virus to assimilate all organic life, forcing Captain America, Mega Man X, Chun-Li and a dolly mixture of other pugilistic heroes to fight a desperate rearguard action. The third game’s inky art style of thick black outlines has been replaced with more of a Toys R Us aesthetic. The pool of 30 playable characters from which you select your two-person team resembles a rubbery, wipe-clean action figure line. The revised Marvel roster mirrors the priorities of its cinematic universe, so the Infinite incarnation of Iron Man is now blatantly modelled on Robert Downey Jr’s smart-alecky show-off. Pair him with Spider-Man and he tags his partner in with a cute callback to Captain America: Civil War (“Underoos!”) Rising stars the Guardians of the Galaxy are emphatically in – Gamora is a lithe, lethal multi-weapon specialist while Rocket Raccoon can request thumping help from Groot – while X-Men and Fantastic Four-related characters, their IP currently licensed by rival studios, are demonstrably out. Previous Marvel vs Capcom games featured an easy input mode so beginners could leapfrog ahead to spectacular special moves and finishers without having to memorise every quarter-turn and double-button press. Infinite folds this training-wheels approach into the game proper. Batter the light-punch button and you automatically unleash an eight-hit combo, while one straightforward button-press triggers a hyper combo across the entire roster. Mastering this simple repertoire means new players can select any character confident they can at least pull off the basics. While this pivot toward accessibility does not automatically mean a lack of depth, it does inevitably flatten out Ultimate’s personality. The new infinity stone mechanic – with six selectable cosmic gems adding additional special moves – means any character can be specced with a dash, a fireball or a paralysing throw. If Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom rejoiced in the eccentricities and mismatches of its sprawling roster, Infinite seems to want to turn everyone into an all-rounder. More seriously, after creating such an inviting on-ramp for knockabout play, Infinite whiffs its advanced schooling. After the basic tutorial, character-specific training missions jump straight from simple special move workouts to intimidatingly long input strings. For players not already fluent in the genre’s lingua franca of cross-ups and cancels, there is nothing to explain how to read or react your opponent. While this feels like a missed opportunity, what is actually unforgivable is that Infinite’s move lists are locked to characters facing right. This is irritating if you happen to jump over your opponent and want to quickly pause-check a mighty finisher. It is actively excruciating if you are locally playing as left-facing player two. The wacky story mode is a welcome short-term diversion but Infinite really comes to life in the wild. For those rightly intimidated by online play, there is a dedicated and so far seemingly robust Beginners League to help players begin their ascent from 15th to 1st rank. But even in this nominal shallow end, ingenious beatdown specialists are already combining disparate characters and their signature movies into elaborate punishments. Jedah, the regal vampire from Darkstalkers with a diabolical arsenal of jaggy projectile attacks, is clearly an early favourite, while the option to tag in Ryu for a jumbo-sized vertical fireball seems to be a popular grace note on which to end extended combos. These dedicated players who have already pushed past Infinite’s muddled orientation will likely elevate the game to new heights, while the emphasis on pick-up-and-play means it is also possible for dabblers to extract a lot of fun from the giddy free-for-all. But it does feel like something has been lost along the way in the push for slimmed-down accessibility. Smashing two dimensions together should be the stuff of ambitious prog-rock albums, but Infinite seems determined to steer towards the middle of the road.

Asked if he expects the tech giants to bid in the next round of Premier League rights sales, which is expected to open before the end of this year, Woodward said: “Absolutely, I think they will enter the mix; anecdotally, there was incredibly strong interest in the last cycle. We are hearing that around the Premier League table and we are also hearing that from a European perspective in terms of interest in the Champions League and Europa rights. I do think we are going to see an increasing engagement from these and we would welcome the interest.” Woodward announced another year of record income made by United in the last financial year. The 2016-17 accounts for Manchester United plc, which is registered in the Cayman Islands tax haven and floated on the NYSE, showed total income of £581m. That was a £66m increase on 2015-16, even though United did not compete in the Champions League last season, having failed to qualify under Louis van Gaal. United’s earning power from its global popularity, broadcasting, sponsorships and 76,000 capacity stadium far exceeds that of any other Premier League club; their income of £515m in 2015-16 was £123m more than that of the next highest-earning club, the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City. United’s pre-tax profit last year was £57m, while the cost of financing their debts was £25m. The club’s borrowings, still dating from the debt-loading takeover by the US‑based Glazer family 12 years ago, remain £498m. Facebook did not comment on whether it will bid for Premier League rights but confirmed it does plan generally to secure live sport on video and their platform Facebook Watch. Amazon had not responded to requests for comment on Woodward’s remarks at the time of going to press."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/24/oslo-lyttelton-review-high-drama-back-channels","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T07:00:39Z","webTitle":"Oslo review – high drama in the back channels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/24/oslo-lyttelton-review-high-drama-back-channels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/24/oslo-lyttelton-review-high-drama-back-channels","fields":{"headline":"Oslo review – high drama in the back channels","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"I went into Oslo expecting to be informed, and fairly confident of being interested. I did not expect to find myself following the plot as eagerly as if it were a whodunnit to which I didn’t know the ending, or often to be laughing – or to find myself once on the brink of tears. JT Rogers’s play, first seen last year at the Lincoln Center, is the story of a peace process; it is almost wall to wall men in suits. But the events it elucidates are riveting. Improbably, the secret talks that led to the 1993 Oslo accords, the first agreement ever struck between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the state of Israel, were organised not through official channels but by a Norwegian academic and his diplomat wife. The negotiators were served waffles. The US was not told of the encounters. Yet later that year Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin were shaking hands on the lawn of the White House. There were sobs of joyful surprise from witnesses as agreement was reached. The sobs provoked by watching this now are bitter: by the end of the decade the accord was in tatters. Rogers’s play is not verbatim theatre but a reimagining. With fierce individual confrontations and high-powered comic eruptions. Philip Arditti is a chameleon Israeli negotiator who swivels from seductor to boa constrictor with a shimmy of his snake hips. He does provocative take-offs, not only of Henry Kissinger but also (jacket backwards over the head) Arafat. From the PLO, Peter Polycarpou is explosive and expansive. Both of them have daughters called Maya. Bartlett Sher’s incisive production makes debate look like action. Which is part of Rogers’s point: talking is a deed – and may replace an act of war. Against the odds, the evening is truly theatrical – because it is essentially a backstage story. It makes most “news” look like mere window dressing. As the Norwegian prime mover, Toby Stephens is a magnetic mixture of inspired enterprise and self-promotion. He moves like a spin doctor. With perhaps a touch too much flounce. He begins to look as if he is on the brink of doing an imitation of himself: has he inherited this from his mother, Maggie Smith? Lydia Leonard draws all eyes by her extraordinary composure. Limpid but sceptical, she is one of the most interesting actors currently on stage. The production moves to the West End next month. • At the Harold Pinter theatre, London SW1, from 2 October until 30 December"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/21/educating-the-young-about-trade-unions","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T18:38:42Z","webTitle":"Educating the young about trade unions | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/21/educating-the-young-about-trade-unions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/21/educating-the-young-about-trade-unions","fields":{"headline":"Educating the young about trade unions","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Michael Heaton (Letters, 17 July) called for the “basics of workers’ rights and the law” to be “explained to everyone before they start working”.

We demystify trade unions, explain workers’ rights, the power of collective action and the truth behind zero-hours contracts. We consider it young peoples’ entitlement to be prepared for the increasingly casualised world of work. Initially, very few students know what trade unions are or how to protect themselves at work. We place all our discussions in students’ own experience and look at ways they can use social media to campaign for justice and equality. We tell them that they are the next generation who will be running the unions and the campaigns. Unions need wider representation: more young members, more women, more BAME and LGBT activists. By the end of every session the students’ lightbulbs come on – they realise unions are fundamental to protection, that collective action for it is the most natural response in the world. By the end of a good session, the students are telling us what they would want from their trade union, and showing us how to campaign creatively using social media.

Pochettino has referred to Dembélé as his “genius” and, ordinarily, the Belgian would be the first name on the Spurs team sheet. Virtually every Tottenham player would say Dembélé is the best player at the club but Pochettino has surprised some onlookers by naming the 30-year-old as a substitute in the Premier League for the past two weekends against Everton and Swansea City. Dembélé was not used against Swansea. The midfielder started the club’s past two midweek fixtures against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League and Barnsley in the Carabao Cup and it is unclear whether he will be restored to the starting lineup in the league team for the derby at West Ham on Saturday lunchtime. Tottenham play at Apoel Nicosia in the Champions League next Tuesday. Dembélé started in only one of Tottenham’s final five matches last season, as the pain in his left foot became too much to bear, and he resorted to the operation because he “couldn’t go on like that”. He has sometimes managed the injury with anti-inflammatories and he admitted in July – after the surgery – he would never be 100% again. “It is so important to manage him properly,” Pochettino said. “We have very good communication with the doctor, physio, sports science and coaching staff to try to help him because to help him is to help the team. “He is a player who I have told you many times is, for me, one of the geniuses that I have met in football. It is key to keep him fit and try to provide all the quality that he has to the team. He shares the decisions. That relationship is important in order to help him.” Pochettino had been prickly when asked about Dembélé’s omission from the Swansea game last Saturday and he chose his words carefully on Thursday. The subject feels like a sensitive one. “I cannot say anything [about Dembélé playing at less than 100%] because that is a private matter and it is more the doctor who can explain better,” Pochettino said. “But I think after I’m here at the club for three seasons, you trust in what I say and our fans trust in our decisions. “It’s a private matter, a medical matter, and it’s so difficult to speak about – first of all, because I don’t have the vocabulary in English to explain everything properly and then, to make a mistake, is so easy. It’s better to be cautious about what I say.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/21/met-to-review-risk-assessment-form-696-stifling-grime-garage-scenes","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T20:20:05Z","webTitle":"Met to review risk assessment form 'stifling' grime and garage scenes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/21/met-to-review-risk-assessment-form-696-stifling-grime-garage-scenes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/21/met-to-review-risk-assessment-form-696-stifling-grime-garage-scenes","fields":{"headline":"Met to review risk assessment form 'stifling' grime and garage scenes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Metropolitan police are to review their 696 form, which critics have said is used to unfairly target grime, garage and basement venues. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has asked for the form to be re-examined after meeting several DJs, artists and venue owners, who all raised concerns about how it is being used. The form, which was first introduced in 2005 as a risk assessment for live music to prevent violence, has long been used to target a disproportionate number of music events by black and Asian artists, particularly garage, grime and bashment. Khan said that the form “shouldn’t compromise the capital’s vibrant grassroots music industry or unfairly target one community or music genre”. The 696 form has meant artists such as the rapper Giggs have been almost unable to play shows in London, because the police have decided he presents too much of a risk due to his background. “They need to work with us. If they think there’s a threat then help us – put some police out there and work with us rather than just shutting us down,” Giggs said last year. Alan Miller, chair of the Night Time Industries Association, said that it was time the form was scrapped and new measures brought in. “This form has been a big problem for venue and promoters and it’s stifling certain types of nightlife,” he said. “Obviously we want events to be policed and to be safe but it is being used by police to target nights by black artists because they see those nights as being more aggressive and harder to control and more associated with gang crime. “And if there is an incident at an event where it’s a bunch of white lads, it’s treated as an isolated incident, but if it’s mainly black kids involved then it becomes associated with an entire event or genre of music, so that’s how it’s decided that grime or garage nights as a whole are too dangerous to put on. The 696 form means that keeps happening.” Police have denied accusations that the form racially discriminates against certain acts or audiences, though a recent BBC report found that some police forces outside London which have also started using the form still ask for the ethnic makeup of the audience attending. Last year, the police used the 696 form to enforce a so-called “bashment ban” at a bar in Croydon, after the Jamaican music was deemed “unacceptable” by the borough, a move which was seen to directly discriminate against the black and Asian community. In the comment by the Met on the form review, Supt Roy Smith said that “so far in 2017 no events have been cancelled at the request of the police following the submission of a Form 696”. However, the Guardian has been informed that several gigs by black artists have been cancelled by the police at short notice this year, using the form, after concerns were raised by police. J Hus, who was nominated for the Mercury prize this year, had to do a nationwide tour without a London date because the 696 form makes it almost impossible for venues in the capital to book him without police objection. Similarly, east London rapper Kojo Funs had his show at the Borderline in March cancelled two days before he was due to play, after the Met got in touch with the venue over concerns about his “online beef” with J Hus. Khan’s review has the backing of the culture minister, Matt Hancock, who said the current form was an “injustice”. “London’s live music scene needs support. We want to see an end to the use of form 696 which is too often a barrier to live music and particularly targets acts from ethnic minority backgrounds,” Hancock said. It is not the first time the form has been reviewed. In 2009, an open letter was sent to the government’s equalities watchdog. It stated: “We are deeply concerned that Form 696 has the potential to be misused by the police to discriminate against ethnic minorities … There is now a danger that police across the country will adopt this measure and further entrench this illiberal and potentially racist practice.” The letter led to a question asking about the specific type of music that would be played being taken off the form, though at the time the move was described by Feargal Sharkey, former lead singer of the Undertones, as an “exercise in semantics”. Journalist Dan Hancox, who is writing about about the emergence of the London grime scene, said: “They changed the form in 2009 to supposedly stop racial profiling but if anything, they are targeting more black music nights now using 696 than they did then.” “I don’t think people understand how this really disproportionately affects smaller promoters, smaller acts, smaller venues, whose livelihoods are really under threat,” said Hancox. “The use and abuse of form 696 threatens to choke up-and-coming artists and promoters. These are the Skeptas and Wileys of the next generation who are having their ability to perform live stifled, and being prevented from coming through.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/21/william-g-stewart-host-of-15-to-1-dies-aged-84","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T17:55:32Z","webTitle":"William G Stewart, host of 15 to 1, dies aged 84","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/21/william-g-stewart-host-of-15-to-1-dies-aged-84","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/21/william-g-stewart-host-of-15-to-1-dies-aged-84","fields":{"headline":"William G Stewart, host of 15 to 1, dies aged 84","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"William G Stewart, the longtime host of the popular TV quiz show 15 to 1, has died aged 84. Stewart, a producer and director of TV sitcoms and gameshows who began his television career behind the camera, presented the Channel 4 show from 1988 to 2003. It had the reputation for being one of the toughest quizzes on TV. “Sadly, William G Stewart passed away peacefully this morning surrounded by his family after a brief illness,” his agent, Julia Wyatt, said. In the 1960s Stewart worked as private secretary to the Labour MP Tom Driberg about whom he subsequently made a documentary. In his long television career he produced and directed many programmes including the TV sitcoms Father, Dear Father, Bless This House, and Love Thy Neighbour. He then began working on gameshows including Family Fortunes and The Price is Right. He stepped in front of the camera to present the pilot of the elimination show which saw 15 contestants trying to stay in by either answering questions correctly or passing the question on to other contestants to answer. Channel 4 told him they would like him to continue presenting. The idea for the show came from a former BT sales manager who wrote to Stewart after it had already been rejected by nine other producers. Stewart offered him £200 if he gave him a 12-month option to develop the idea. “Well, that £200 was the best money I’ve ever spent in my life,” Stewart later wrote. He said the show’s success was down to the questions being “properly tough”. Writing a decade after his final show was broadcast, he said the calibre of questions was of such a high standard “the only quiz shows I watch regularly now are Mastermind and University Challenge”. A stickler for rules, he successfully sued the show’s 1997 champion because he had appeared on the programme before, which was not allowed. The show returned to Channel 4 as Fifteen to One in 2014, hosted by Sandi Toksvig, following an 11-year break. In 2010, Stewart alleged he had been approached about being a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing but was vetoed because he was “too old”. A father of five, in 1997 Stewart married his third wife, Laura Calland, a voiceover artist for 15 to 1. Channel 4 said it was saddened to hear of Stewart’s death and described him as a “broadcasting legend”. A statement shared by the broadcaster and the team behind the programme read: “We are saddened to hear the news about William G Stewart, whose inimitable style set 15 to 1 apart from all other quiz shows. He was a broadcasting legend and our thoughts are with his friends and family.” Toksvig, who presents Great British Bake Off on Channel 4, said of Stewart: “A lovely man, a consummate TV professional and, of course, host of 15 to 1 long before I stepped up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/21/fostering-often-leads-to-very-good-outcomes","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T18:38:53Z","webTitle":"Fostering often leads to very good outcomes | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/21/fostering-often-leads-to-very-good-outcomes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/21/fostering-often-leads-to-very-good-outcomes","fields":{"headline":"Fostering often leads to very good outcomes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Dawn Foster is, sadly, right when she writes that fostering tends to appear in the news for negative reasons (It’s hard enough as a foster child without being demonised, Opinion, 21 September). When a troubled young person falls into the justice system, the implication is sometimes made that fostering could be part of the cause. What is forgotten is that these young people have often already suffered trauma or been at risk of harm – which is precisely why they need fostering. Foster children are vulnerable, and can be challenging, but with the right support they can have fulfilling and positive futures. However, there are 81,000 children in care in the UK, and not enough foster carers to look after them. Without enough loving homes these children risk being moved around. Barnardo’s recruits foster carers for teenagers, disabled children, siblings and children from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. But we urgently need more to come forward. We view our relationship with our carers as a partnership, offering continued support, training and advice for as long as it is needed. Our foster carers are amazing people.

There is robust evidence from studies that where young people are provided with stability and opportunities for attachment, helped to overcome educational deficits, leave care at a similar age as young people leave home in the general population, and are provided with personal and practical assistance into adulthood, they make good progress from very poor starting points. When local authorities fail to respond to these challenges they let both foster carers and the young people they care for down.

Employ more autistic people","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Five minutes from London’s Liverpool Street station is an office that looks like any other office in the tech industry: the decor is 21st century, pristine; takeaway coffee cups are omnipresent; most people under 30 are in casualwear. Just about everyone seems to be either staring at a smartphone, tapping at a laptop, or sprinting to their next appointment. The company I’ve come to visit is called Auticon, an award-winning IT business. As well as the staff in the office, it employs 15 IT consultants who spend most of their time working elsewhere for companies such as pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, the credit rating agency Experian, and Allianz Insurance. But there is a fascinating twist: all of the 15 are autistic, and have been given their jobs after long spells of unemployment – not out of charity or sympathy, but a deep appreciation of the attributes they bring to their work. Auticon was founded in Germany six years ago by Dirk Müller-Remus, a former software developer who had a son diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. He was appalled by the often dismal opportunities available to autistic people, but also well aware that some people with the condition have an array of traits – the capacity to concentrate on a single task for long periods, an appreciation of systems and patterns, an amazing facility with IT – that sets them apart from the so-called “neurotypical” majority. In 2016, Auticon opened offices in London and Paris; in the UK, it now has plans to employ 100 consultants, and expand beyond London. Ray Coyle, CEO of Auticon’s British offshoot, is a former lawyer and IT specialist who has long appreciated the benefits of employing autistic people. “Some of the most loyal, capable and dedicated employees I’ve had have been on the autism spectrum,” he says. As well as innumerable mentions of “neurotypical” – in other words, non-autistic – people, he regularly uses the term “neurodiversity”, which embodies the recognition that human brains are wired in no end of different ways. We talk about the stereotypical modern working environment, its mess of ambiguity and fuzzy logic, and how autistic people often find it impossible to navigate. And he enthusiastically makes the case for companies – particularly those in IT – employing autistic people as a matter of policy. “We’ve got to be really careful with the language we use: we don’t want to give people the impression that all autistic people are IT geniuses, or that there are not neurotypical people who can do all of these things,” he says. “But in the right role, and with the right support, an autistic person will significantly outperform a neurotypical person doing the same job. We have lots of evidence to back that up.” As for neurodiversity, “If you’ve got a team of people on a project, and they’re all neurotypical, and your project encounters a problem, the chances are that those 20 people will all come up with the same kind of answer. Bring in someone with a totally different cognitive process and a completely different perspective, and they’ll come up with something different. And that’s invaluable.” For all that the people at Auticon talk with infectious enthusiasm about how some autistic people can bring their employers undreamed-of benefits, the statistics about autism and work make for grim reading. Current estimates suggest that in the UK, just over 1 in 100 people are on the autistic spectrum, which translates into a total figure of more than 700,000; in the US, the total number is put at 3.5 million. The increasing understanding of autism’s complexities means those figure may eventually go up. But according to research by the National Autistic Society (NAS), only 16% of autistic adults in the UK are in full-time work, a figure that has remained static since 2007. Four in 10 autistic people say they have never worked at all. Around half of those who had found at least some paid employment reported workplace bullying or harassment; over a third said the support or adjustments made by their current or most recent employer were “poor” or “very poor”. But things may be changing, albeit slowly. Thanks to everything from Steve Silberman’s bestselling book NeuroTribes to the BBC1 series The A Word, autism now has a cultural profile that would have been unheard of 20 years ago. Programmes such as BBC2’s Employable Me have explicitly dealt with the tangle of issues around autism and work. Meanwhile, 30 or so years after the concept was first grasped by psychologists and psychiatrists, the fact that autism is a spectrum condition – in other words, it manifests itself in countless different ways, and is experienced by millions of people – is starting to make its way into the public consciousness. Though there is still an assumption that autism is an essentially male condition, awareness of how it often has gender-related manifestations is also increasing: crudely put, many women and girls seem better at coping, but that does not mean their experience of the condition is any less real. And the idea that autism can sometimes entail strengths and talents as much as difficulties is slowly gaining ground. There are still limits to all this: stories of breakthroughs and improvements tend to be concentrated on so-called “high-functioning” autistic people rather than those with deeper issues with communication, social interaction and sensory processing – let alone so-called “non-verbal” people. But still, with the usual caveat that autism awareness still needs to develop into genuine understanding, compared with the world of 10 years ago, the sense of progress is obvious. James Neely is 33. With the help of one of Auticon’s job coaches, he has been working as one of the company’s IT consultants since April this year. He has a degree in physics and astrophysics from Leeds University, and a career history that speaks volumes about the often awkward fit between autism and work. He received a formal autism diagnosis earlier this year: like many autistic people, he has a range of sensory issues to do with noise and light, and works best in a quiet, often solitary environment. He tends to work wearing headphones, to assist concentration. “I listen to rock, indie sort of stuff: Muse, Garbage, Ash, Oasis, AC/DC,” he tells me. “Stuff that can be a bit loud, to drown things out. I don’t necessarily want to be listening to it all day, but the alternative is that I go mad.” For eight years, he worked as a data analyst for a company he prefers not to name, but found his ability to function severely compromised. “The office where I first started had quite a lot of space,” he says, “but they kept moving us, and we were getting more and more crammed in; just, like, batteries of tables, without any real dividers. And about 100 people on a floor.” The resulting stress eventually led to depression and anxiety, and meetings with an occupational therapist who suspected he was autistic. “He said, ‘How do you feel about that?’ I said, ‘Actually, it would be almost reassuring, cos it explains a lot of stuff.’” He now looks back on his past experience and recognises enduring themes. Every annual feedback meeting included “people saying, ‘I wish James would pick up the phone more.’ I liked having things in an email because I like specifics. Talking on the phone, you might not be sure what’s required of you, but if it’s written down, you’ve got a record, and you can see things correctly.” What about the social rituals around work: drinks on a Friday, Christmas parties? He laughs, drily. “I used to avoid those as much as possible. When I first started, I tried to go because I thought it was expected … I didn’t really know I had these problems as much then. But even when I was at uni, I always preferred going out with a couple of mates to a quiet pub. You get a bit of an anti-social label with stuff like that, but I couldn’t really cope with it.” His first employer insisted he return full-time to the same environment but he found it too hard to cope and was let go. He then endured the limited help offered by his local jobcentre, before eventually finding out about Auticon. Alongside two other Auticon consultants, he is now a contractor for GlaxoSmithKline. He says he can’t go into too much detail, but describes his work as “looking at lots of code, trying to map up different variables, putting stuff into visualisation software. Playing with data, just to see what we can do with it.” Auticon – whose investors include Richard Branson – is on the leading edge of employing autistic people, but there are also big British companies who are starting to develop their own programmes. With help from the NAS, firms that have introduced work-experience schemes and internships for autistic people include BT, and the software giant SAS. The government intelligence and security centre GCHQ has a neurodiversity programme which recruits people with conditions such as autism, dyslexia and dyspraxia, and is built on the idea that – to quote its former director, Robert Hannigan – “we need all talents, and we need people who dare to think differently and be different.” There is also an elite unit in the Israeli army called Unit 9900 – where, according to US magazine The Atlantic, autistic people “act as eyes on the ground for highly sensitive operations, analyzing complex images delivered in real time from military satellites around the world”. In the rather more workaday surroundings of a Procter &amp; Gamble research centre in Reading, Olivia is in the middle of a paid internship. As well as insisting I don’t use her surname, she requests an email interview rather than a conversation on the phone, but her eloquent answers to my questions highlight both the strengths autistic people can bring to their work – “I’m able to problem-solve in ways that are different to other people by taking alternative routes to get to an answer, and I have a very systematic way of working,” she says – and the high walls that still stand in their way. She was diagnosed with autism when she was 18. Then came the challenge of trying to find work. “Often, there are online assessments to be completed before being offered an interview. I find these online tests confusing as the questions are not always clearly worded and they have multiple meanings, so I don’t know what I’m being asked ... I often need verbal questions or instructions written down ... otherwise I go blank and forget what I want to say. “While in work, I often struggle with the big social expectations,” she goes on. “For me, socialising ... can be very draining, even if I’m enjoying it. Being in an environment where you are always expected to socialise while working – like waitressing or being a shop assistant – is difficult for me, as I have a very clear line that separates my work life and my social life.” Cath Leggett is a 45-year-old single mum who lives in Cardiff. She has a degree in mechanical engineering, and ended up working in flood protection, “manipulating 3D mathematical models to predict flooding”. Her work tended to involve a small team: “Five or six guys, some of who were probably undiagnosed autistic people. We all had our headphones on all day, and everyone had all the same interests as me – Doctor Who, tech, gadgets. I fitted in really well.” But a change of job meant she suddenly had to adjust to life in a huge, open-plan office: “A very social environment, more about the organisational stuff and customer service.” At that point, she says she started to experience big problems, with “horrible overhead lights, smells like perfumes and deodorants” – and the endless complexities of office etiquette. After her daughter received an autism diagnosis, she began to realise that she too was on the spectrum – but, like many autistic women, had got used to what she calls “masking and mimicking”. “I make eye contact, I smile, I can do small talk,” she says. “I know what’s expected. But at Christmas, for example, things would come to a head: I would be asked to get involved in secret Santas, and decorating the place. I was refusing flat-out, saying, ‘This is ridiculous – I’ve got work to do, leave me alone.’ I was offending people; being very direct and clear about things.” She was formally diagnosed two and a half years ago, and now works for the NAS as an employment consultant, often helping people who, like her, have been diagnosed later in life. “Seven or eight times out of 10,” she says, “things will have gone past breaking point. Typically, we’re called in when a lot of complaints have been put in by the employee, and there have been severe impacts on their mental health. They might be being treated for anxiety or depression, and be unable to work.” In some cases, she says, the people she helps might have only realised they are autistic after a long spell of professional hell. She has now started hosting courses specifically for women on the autistic spectrum, as well as making the case for employing autistic people to employers – something she talks about with a real sense of optimism. “I do a lot of conference speaking,” she says. “And I now get employers asking me, where do we find autistic people?” She says the answer often goes back to the culture around recruitment, and the importance of being clear and specific about what a job entails, as well as the understanding that the crude criteria often used to decide who gets which job will mean that some of the best people are cast aside. Inevitably, for all Leggett’s positivity, our conversation ends with a lingering sense that there is a mountain of work still to be done. Apart from anything else, the popular understanding of autism still seems to miss out the fact that it defines the lives of adults as well as children. The consequences are not just a great deal of personal torment, but an ocean of potential that remains untapped. Back at Auticon, Ray Coyle well knows how far there is to go. At the moment, he tells me, only one of Auticon’s 15 British IT consultants is a woman. “That’s a big area of focus and concern for us,” he says. “I think we can do better than that. “The other thing is this. Quite a number of the consultants we have were diagnosed as adults. Diagnosis in children is getting much, much better, but the problem is, people don’t vanish when they leave school. An awful lot more needs to be done around the workplace. If you’re talking about over 1% of the population, that’s way too many people just to ignore.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/21/hinkley-point-c-fresh-strike-threat-over-pay-dispute-delays","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T18:26:08Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C: fresh strike threat over pay dispute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/21/hinkley-point-c-fresh-strike-threat-over-pay-dispute-delays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/21/hinkley-point-c-fresh-strike-threat-over-pay-dispute-delays","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C: fresh strike threat over pay dispute","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The UK’s first new nuclear power plant for 20 years could be delayed again, after trade unions for construction staff working on the £20bn Hinkley Point C project announced a ballot for strike action in a dispute over pay. More than 95% of members balloted by GMB and Unite rejected a pay increase offered by the French energy company EDF and its contractor Bylor after months of discussions. Any extension of the labour dispute risks further time and cost overruns for Europe’s largest construction project, which is already behind schedule and over budget. Separately, staff at outsourcing group Capita are to go on strike for six days from 5 October over changes to the company’s pension scheme that will result in a “massive cut” to their retirement income, according to Unite. This year, EDF revealed the cost of Hinkley had risen from £18bn to £20.3bn and that construction of the plant would also be delayed by 15 months, meaning it might not start producing electricity until 2027. Strike action was called off in June after an interim deal over bonus payments was reached in the hope a permanent agreement avoiding any further delays at the Somerset site could be reached. Talks have since broken down and GMB and Unite will ballot members over strike action concerning the employment terms of more than 1,000 civil engineers. The unions’ chief complaint is that the civil engineering contracts are “significantly below” the rates of workers on mechanical and engineering (M&amp;E) deals. “Members have made their views clear; the unions warned the amount of money being offered was not sufficient and this has proved to be the case,” Jerry Swain, Unite’s national officer for construction, said. “The unions are fully prepared to return to the negotiating table if an improved offer is put forward.” EDF Energy said it was “disappointed” and that it had offered increased pay, bonuses and benefits as part of a package that was “fair and reasonable”. “The terms and conditions of employment at Hinkley Point C are superior to anything you will find in the UK construction industry,” it added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/sep/21/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T20:00:27Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/sep/21/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/sep/21/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• The image used in early editions to accompany an article about Yoko Ono taking action to halt the sale of a lemonade was not that of the brand involved.

Four of his 11 medals were awarded for simply being alive while his mother was on the throne. There is a long military tradition of handing out decorations to people who have not fought at all. In this light, the proposal by the Ministry of Defence to strike a medal for the campaign against Islamic State, which would be given to drone operators among other recipients, makes a kind of sense. But it is still morally disturbing. A similar proposal, in the US in 2013, was withdrawn after outrage from fighting soldiers. Their obvious objection is that a drone operator runs no personal risk at all. The same could be said of many specialists on whom a modern army depends, from technicians to staff officers, but most of them are at least in the theatre of war, even if behind the lines. That’s why they earn campaign medals even though medals for bravery are reserved for the fighting troops. The drone pilots sit thousands of miles from the action, killing people with the press of a button. Rewarding them tends to reinforce the terrible delusion that modern war, as fought by our armed forces, is a hygienic business in which only consenting adults are killed. No drone pilot anywhere seems to have been punished for killing civilians; the British Ministry of Defence argues that none of our 4,000 strikes ever have. But then the only evidence for the effects of most strikes are gathered by the self-same drones. This is part of the wider moral ambiguity that has always attended killing people from the air. The drone controller 2,000 miles from his victim is different in degree, but not in kind, from the jet pilot who fires a cruise missile from friendly airspace over the horizon at his target. Nor is danger a guarantee of moral purity. The allied airmen who carried out the bombing of German cities in the second world war were undoubtedly heroic. They faced very high odds of death over long tours of duty, but they often set out deliberately to kill as many civilians as possible. Perhaps we should admire more those who were less brave – and less lethal with it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/sep/22/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T07:17:26Z","webTitle":"Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/22/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/sep/22/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend","fields":{"headline":"Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1) September: the cruellest month? Liverpool fans could be forgiven for thinking January would be a shoo-in for their most miserable month of 2017. September, however, has the potential to be equally bleak. Jürgen Klopp’s side have yet to win this month, and opportunities to change that sorry state of affairs are thin on the ground, with only away games at Leicester City and Spartak Moscow remaining. A second defeat in four days at the King Power is far from unthinkable – the Foxes have been a bogey team since the 1960s, while Klopp may be forced to pair Ragnar Klavan and Joe Gomez at the back – and could send their season into a negative spiral, with a tricky run of games to come in October, nearly all away from Anfield. On the flip side, it wouldn’t take much for Mo Salah, Roberto Firmino and Philippe Coutinho to click sweetly again as they did in pre-season, in which case Klopp’s side could regain their momentum in some style. It’ll be fascinating to see which Liverpool turns up; good luck calling it. SM Klopp ‘really sick’ after Leicester punish poor defending Manager trusts in Oxlade-Chamberlain to improve 2) Agüero and Jesus recall Manchester City’s canniest transfers The key lesson from his stints at Liverpool and England is that Roy Hodgson forgets what he is good at when he tries too hard to please (and then blames others). But that should not be a problem at Crystal Palace because Hodgson has taken over at the perfect time, with expectations low thanks to the Frank de Boer misadventure and the gruelling series of fixtures starting with Saturday’s trip to Manchester City. So all Hodgson has to do is concentrate on embedding a defensive shape, which he can do well. But City are so fearsome in attack that Sergio Agüero could still set a new scoring record for the club on Saturday. A hat-trick would take him past Eric Brook, who struck 177 goals for City before his career was halted by the second world war. Brook and his team-mate Fred Tilson were signed from Barnsley in 1928 for a combined fee of £6,000 and together fired City to promotion and then the top-flight title, totalling 310 goals between them in 726 matches. It has taken City nearly 90 years and many millions of pounds, but with Agüero and Gabriel Jesus, they have a duo worthy of Brook and Tilson. PD Pape Souaré: ‘I didn’t know when the pain would stop’ Sako kickstarts Hodgon’s reign with winner against Huddersfield City justify Guardiola’s spending on full-backs 3) Is Trippier set for another season playing second fiddle? An excellent defensive performance by Swansea City left the Tottenham Hotspur attackers Harry Kane, Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen frustrated last weekend, but they looked considerably more chipper upon the introduction of Serge Aurier in the right wing-back position, with Kieran Trippier swapping to the left. With his speed and impressive crossing from deep, the Ivorian made an immediate impact following an impressive debut against Borussia Dortmund a few days previously and ought to have had a penalty when he was tripped by Jordan Ayew on one marauding run into the penalty area. Signed on deadline day, Aurier seems to have quickly settled into life with Spurs and earlier this week, ahead of the trip to West Ham, Trippier praised the power, pace and good delivery of a player he described as a good character to have in the dressing room. He may have done so through gritted teeth – having spent most of last season playing second fiddle to the now departed Kyle Walker, Trippier must have thought his opportunity to make the Spurs right-back position his own had come. The manner in which Aurier has hit the ground in England running, literally and metaphorically, suggests that opportunity may have already passed by a talented English defender who would walk into most Premier League sides. BG Tottenham thankful for Alli winner against Barnsley Dembélé’s playing time must be managed says Pochettino Arnautovic helps West Ham to easy Carabao Cup victory 4) Striking options for Koeman Last season, Everton battered Bournemouth 6-3 at Goodison, a result that should put them in a good humour going into this weekend’s repeat fixture. The only problem is, four of their goals that day were scored by Romelu Lukaku, a player since sold and not adequately replaced. Ronald Koeman – outrageously joint-favourite to be the next Premier League manager for the sack – has a decision to make. Everton’s only league goals this season have been scored by Wayne Rooney, but he has been part of an attack that has failed to find the net in four games. By contrast, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Ademola Lookman and the much-maligned Oumar Niasse all impressed in the 3-0 League Cup win over Sunderland. Time for a shake-up, to prove there is life post-Lukaku? Even if it comes at the cost of a couple of bigger names? SM Calvert-Lewin hits double in win over Sunderland Defoe gets Bournemouth off the mark with winner 5) A big test for Diouf and Zouma-less Stoke If Antonio Conte is a genius for successfully converting Victor Moses into an excellent wing-back, then Mark Hughes must be some kind of god for doing something similar with Mame Biram Diouf. All right, that might be a touch over the top, because though the Senegalese has done well in the role, he has not quite mastered it – a fact that Marcos Alonso and some of Conte’s other players could expose on Saturday. Beyond that, Chelsea could also exploit a stipulation that should not exist: Stoke will be deprived of Kurt Zouma under the terms of his loan move from the London club. Zouma has been superb for Stoke so far this season and they will be allowed to use him against every other club, meaning Chelsea stand to gain an advantage from buying more players than they can use. That is is not right. Loanees should always be allowed to play against their parent clubs: rather than suffer a conflict of interest, their motivation to excel would surely grow. PD Hughes demands better after cup exit at Bristol City Dominic Fifield: Chelsea saw the best of Diego Costa Abraham denies switching allegiance from England to Nigeria 6) Saints hope for a 90s throwback Saints used to make a habit of turning Manchester United over at home. Think of those famous victories in the mid-1990s: the grey-strip fiasco, the 6-3 rout, the Kevin Davies inspired win that gave Arsenal hope in the 1997-98 title race. But the 90s are a long time ago, and Saints haven’t beaten United on their own patch since a late James Beattie goal stunned a side containing Roy Keane, Ryan Giggs, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Cristiano Ronaldo in August 2003. On the face of it, United’s wonderful early-season form – 24 goals in eight matches – doesn’t suggest that 14-year sequence will come to an end this weekend. But Saints will take heart from a solid performance at Crystal Palace last week, the industry and upcoming talent of the midfielder Mario Lemina, and the expected return to serious action of Virgil van Dijk, who scored a header for the reserves midweek. United can expect a tough test, if not a 90s-style working over. SM Davis spoils Hodgson’s big day with winner for Southampton United and Rashford allow Burton little consolation 7) Will Hughton be Krul to be kind to Brighton fans? Having previously been ineligible under the terms of his loan agreement, Tim Krul is suddenly available for selection against his former club Newcastle United after Brighton offered him a permanent one-year deal earlier this week. While there is no guarantee the Dutchman will get the nod against his former club ahead of Mat Ryan, the timing of the deal does seem a little bit convenient. Krul made his debut for Brighton in Tuesday night’s Carabao Cup defeat at the hands of Bournemouth, while Ryan seems to have settled after an erratic start to his career at the Amex Stadium. “It’s not always easy to see the situation from my perspective when people are watching from the stands or on TV,” said Ryan in a chat with the local Argus earlier this week. Whether it is he or Krul who will be watching from the sidelines on Sunday remains to be seen. BG Leroy Rosenior: it’s a fine line between pleasure and pain Lascelles heads Newcastle to victory over Stoke 8) Sanches to step it up? Swansea City’s defensive display against Tottenham last weekend wasn’t perfect: Harry Kane hit the bar while Serge Aurier was saucily bundled over in the penalty area. But the Swans got away with it on both occasions, and you make your own luck: they were otherwise magnificently resilient, having been expected to roll over meekly. The preposterously maligned Renato Sanches – he’s just turned 20, for goodness sake – was impressive in both a destructive and creative sense at Wembley before he ran out of steam a little and was hooked. Having subsequently put in a fine 90 minutes in the League Cup at Reading, he appears to be winding himself up to make a few Premier League statements. Watford, confidence doubtless jiggered by that six-goal pasting by Manchester City, should be wary. SM Swansea to face holders in Carabao Cup last 16 Nick Ames: Sanches suffers difficult Swansea debut Watford routed by rampant Manchester City 9) Huddersfield need midfielders such as Ince to start scoring When Laurent Depoitre did last week what Steve Mounié had done on the opening day of the season – scoring on his first start for Huddersfield Town – it confirmed that the newly-promoted side recruited two useful centre-forwards during the summer, assets that they lacked last year. But converting pressure into penetration remains a problem because midfielders are not contributing enough goals (although Elias Kachunga might have had a winner to his name if his strike against Leicester City last week had not been wrongly disallowed for offside). Tom Ince, in particular, has the ability to finish neatly but, although he has generally played well, he has yet to find the scoring form in the Premier League that he showed at Derby County (where he scored 37 goals from 96 starts). If he, or another midfielder, shows more sharpness in front of goal on Saturday, then Huddersfield could become the second Yorkshire club in a week to win at Turf Moor even if Chris Wood scores again. PD Huddersfield pegged back by Vardy equaliser for Leicester Ladbrokes apologise to Burnley after sponsor taunts players 10) Krychowiak’s chance to impose himself on Arsenal midfield It’s honours even between Arsenal and West Brom in the Premier League over the past two seasons, with each side having won two of their four encounters. Assuming he lines up in midfield, Gareth Barry will become the Premier League’s all-time record appearance maker with 633, a notable personal milestone, but it is his midfield partner Grzegorz Krychowiak who is likely to face his sternest top flight test to date on only his third. Acquiring the Polish midfielder on loan from Paris Saint-Germain was considered something of a coup for Tony Pulis and the 27-year-old has faced Arsenal on two previous occasions in the French club’s colours. He also featured on Arsène Wenger’s shopping list when he was still playing with Sevilla, but opted to move to PSG instead. Against a high-profile midfield not renowned for its surplus of backbone, a fully fit Krychowiak will have few better platforms platform on which to show exactly what it was that prompted the Sevilla director Ramón Rodríguez Monchi to buy him when the club’s then manager, Unai Emery, ordered “a beast” and “a physical prodigy with a decent passing accuracy”. He may have struggled for first team opportunities under Emery at PSG, but can leave a memorable Premier League calling card here.

I enjoy it when it makes radio shows with a podcast feel, such as Grace Dent’s The Untold, and Short Cuts, hosted by Josie Long. Both are excellent. What do I mean by a podcast feel? Well, both programmes are producer-driven (though this is not really acknowledged in The Untold), unafraid of adding atmospheric background sounds and based around the telling of offbeat but true stories; ordinary people in the midst of an extraordinary time. Short Cuts is on at the moment and I recommend this week’s episode, partly because I know one of the subjects. Joe Benjamin is a well-known figure in Brixton (where I live). He brought a conch shell with him when he came to the UK from Bermuda, and Short Cuts lets him recall the time he blew it in Brixton market for a very particular reason. I like the BBC’s chatty podcasts rather less – with the honourable exception of Mayo and Kermode – and the Beeb is yet to find the right tone with its forays into other podcast genres, such as true crime. It’s hard for BBC-trained journalists to find the right mixture of intimacy and journalistic rigour. They have an awful tendency to sound like a robot trying to be your friend. (Dent and Long, you note, come from outside the BBC.) Anyway. Here is another “new” BBC podcast: the World Service’s In the Studio. The strange thing about In the Studio is that it’s actually a radio series that has been running for quite some time. You can catch up on lots of episodes on the World Service website. But now it’s been rebranded as an All! New! Cultural! podcast which aims to take the listener into “the minds of the world’s most creative people”. It has upped its status by getting Tim Marlow to top and tail the show. Marlow, an excellent arts journalist for many years, is now the artistic director of the Royal Academy. He knows his stuff and brings prestige. And the In the Studio subjects are now more high status too, with playwright Kwame Kwei-Armah and TV writer David Simon talking two weeks ago, and Man Booker prize-winner Marlon James the subject of last week’s episode. Interviewed by the just-slightly-too-BBC Andrea Kidd, James, who’s just started writing a trilogy called the Dark Star, was very interesting on the difference between various countries’ attitudes to midnight and the dark. In many non-western societies, he explained, “bright star means nothing. Bright star just means you’re supernova-ing and you’ll be obsolete. Dark star is brimming with depth and potential.” An engaging, inspiring conversation and just right for a podcast. Back to straightforward radio reporting. Michael Goldfarb’s No Place of Greater Safety on Radio 4 took us to Syria, Afghanistan, South Sudan, where bombing civilian hospitals is now considered a “tactic” of war. Once, years ago, wars mostly took place in empty fields, with armies advancing or retreating. In the first world war, said one expert, the ratio of soldiers killed to civilians was about 10 to one. Now, it’s the other way around: for every soldier that dies in conflict, 10 civilians are killed. Civilians are the main victims of today’s wars. Plus, of course, if you attack hospitals, you are likely to kill doctors. Health – or rather your access to healthcare – has become “another weapon, another way to wage wars”. The experts interviewed sounded resigned but determined and, as ever, Goldfarb’s reporting and presentation were exemplary. He has his own history podcast, FRDH, which I recommend. It’s been going a year now, beginning – imagine! – in a pre-Trump era. At first, Goldfarb tried to cover US history in a broad manner (he still does: the latest episode is about Berkeley in 1969) but he has found that the president and matters arising from the White House are what his listeners want to hear about.

The devices will be released at the Made by Google event scheduled to take place in San Francisco and will lead the company’s renewed hardware efforts as it attempts to take on Apple and Samsung in the premium smartphone and accessory market. Two variants of the Pixel smartphone will be released mirroring last year’s devices, several well-placed sources told to the Guardian. The smaller Pixel 2, which is expected to have a screen about 5 inches in size, will be made by smartphone manufacturer HTC – part of which was acquired by Google on Thursday – according to two sources. It will come in blue, black or white and have a metal and glass back, similar to last year’s Pixel. The larger Pixel 2 XL will be made by LG and resembles an LG G6 on the front with an almost bezel-free screen, according to two sources, who added the phone will come in black or white with a black top and a glass panel at the top. Four separate sources said the images of the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL published by technology site Droid Life were accurate. Both Pixel 2 smartphones will have Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 processor, according to two sources, as well as 4GB of memory and either 64 or 128GB of storage. Both smartphones will also have pressure-sensitive sides, according to two sources. HTC introduced the feature with its U11; Google is likely to use it to launch its virtual assistant. Google’s 2016 Pixel smartphones won awards for their cameras, using Google’s HDR+ mode. The 2017 Google Pixel 2 smartphones will both have an improved single 12-megapixel camera on the back using similar computational photography techniques, two sources have confirmed. Neither smartphone will have a headphone socket, instead relying on the USB-C port for audio out, but both phones will be water resistant – a new feature for this year that brings them into line with rivals – according to one source. Three sources say the cost of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL is still to be confirmed, but they are expected to be priced similarly to last year’s Pixel and Pixel XL, which cost £600 and £719 respectively. Alongside the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, Google will also unveil a smaller Google Home smart speaker. The Google Home Mini will be a direct Amazon Echo Dot competitor, taking the voice assistant functions of the Google Home and shrinking them down into a smaller fabric puck shape, two sources said. Similar to the differences between Amazon’s full-sized Echo and the Echo Dot, the Google Home Mini will not have the same speaker quality as the larger Google Home, but will perform most of the same functions through Google Assistant. It is expected to cost about £40-50, according to one source. Google is also rumoured to be unveiling a new high-end Chromebook called the Pixelbook, which supports an optional stylus, but the Guardian has not yet confirmed its existence.

The offering also brings the chequered flag down on former F1 chief executive Bernie Ecclestone’s time as a shareholder. The billionaire business magnate is offloading his remaining stake for $20m. Ecclestone first took over the wheel of F1 40 years ago and transformed it from being an amateur hobby into a race series which had revenue of $1.8bn last year. Together, Ecclestone and his Bambino family trust have made an estimated $4.9bn from dividends and the sale of their shares. For the past decade, F1 has been controlled by the private equity firm CVC but in January it sold up to Colorado-based Liberty Media Corp for $4.6bn. Liberty paid $3bn in cash and offered $1.2bn of shares in its Nasdaq tracking stock which has the ticker FWONK. The remaining $351m came in the form of a loan that can be converted into stock.

The shares have risen 80% in value since Liberty handed them over and closed at $38.27 on Wednesday. The share sale is expected to close Friday and is being led by Goldman Sachs. The biggest beneficiary is CVC which has made a total of $6.4bn from F1. It has yielded a 563% return on investment as CVC put in just $965.6m when it acquired F1 in a leveraged buyout in 2006. A number of American investors later joined its consortium including fund manager Waddell &amp; Reed which has made a total of $1.7bn from the $1.6bn it invested in 2012 for a 20.9% stake. Lehman, which has been involved with F1 since 2002 when it gave a $300m loan to German media firm Kirch to finance its purchase of shares in the sport. The loan was secured on the shares so when Kirch went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the same year it left Lehman with a 14.2% stake in F1. Four years later, Lehman sold its stake to CVC for $209.3m which was less than the loan it provided to Kirch. However, this was only a loss on paper as Lehman made the smart decision to reinvest the money in F1 giving it a 15.1% stake. In 2008, Lehman itself went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and moved its F1 stake from its bankrupt arm, Lehman Commercial Paper, into LBI Group, a newly formed holding company containing the valuable assets in its portfolio. LBI’s purpose is to generate cash from its assets which is then used to pay Lehman’s creditors. This is an ongoing process and dissolving it completely depends on settling all the claims from creditors. F1 first contributed to its returns in May 2012 when it paid out an $850m dividend with $130.1m going to Lehman. Five months later, Lehman cashed in again when it sold a 3% stake in F1 to the Teachers’ Retirement System of Texas (TRS) for an estimated $200m. Rounding off a bumper year, in December 2012, F1 paid another dividend, which this time came to $1.2bn and was fuelled with income from a recent debt refinancing. Lehman’s share of this was $147.6m and it received a further $121.1m in dividends over the next three years. It brought Lehman’s payout to $808.1m by the time that Liberty bought F1. In line with its 12.1% F1 stake, Lehman got $363.6m of the $3bn cash offered by Liberty and it is also due $42.5m from the loan, which can be converted into stock. The sale of Lehman’s FWONK shares has netted $325m which gives it a total return of $1.5bn. Liberty’s management too have taken advantage of the accelerating stock price. Its chief financial officer, Mark Carleton, has sold all of his FWONK shares and has made $2.5m from this since the acquisition. However, the road ahead may not be so smooth. In July, the organizers of F1’s flagship race, the British Grand Prix, cancelled their contract seven years early due to soaring hosting fees. Likewise, the organizers of next weekend’s Malaysian Grand Prix have also put the brakes on their race early as this year’s will be their last – even though their contract runs until the end of 2018. In the medium term, there is also the threat of an investigation by Britain’s Serious Fraud Office. In May, it announced that it had begun a pre-investigation into whether there is evidence of corruption in F1’s governance contract the Concorde Agreement, a claim which has been denied by F1, CVC and the sport’s governing body the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (Fia). Further down, the line comes the hurdle that all of Liberty’s contracts with F1’s teams expire at the end of 2020 so, as things stand, it only has three and a half years of guaranteed income. Perhaps ominously the teams have steadfastly resisted opportunities to buy FWONK shares which would give them a long-term interest in F1."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"housing-network/2017/sep/25/universal-credit-policy-disaster-social-housing","type":"article","sectionId":"housing-network","sectionName":"Housing Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T06:23:06Z","webTitle":"Universal credit is a social policy disaster in the making |  Priya Thethi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2017/sep/25/universal-credit-policy-disaster-social-housing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/housing-network/2017/sep/25/universal-credit-policy-disaster-social-housing","fields":{"headline":"Universal credit is a social policy disaster in the making","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Universal credit is the biggest change to our welfare system in 40 years. By the time it has been fully rolled out in 2022 it will potentially affect 8 million people across the UK. The rollout so far has been controversial, and fraught with difficulties. Social housing organisations, in which only around 2.6% of tenants (pdf) are currently claiming universal credit, have been hit particularly hard by the speed and scale of the change. In August 2017 the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) released a guide for landlords, in a bid to to explain what the changes will mean and how they can support their tenants. Unfortunately, it made little to no mention of how to deal with the slew of administrative issues, faults and delays, which have already caused hardship for so many claimants. We conducted in-depth interviews with 10 landlords, most of whom have experienced the full implementation of universal credit. What’s becoming clear is that, while the overall experience of working with the DWP has been good, there is a disconnect between the experience of the people who are implementing universal credit, and the perception of the guidelines, as agreed by its decision makers. For example, advance payments, which are a way of shielding people from the worst hardship, are seen as a welcome and necessary interim measure. These loans are 50% of the full award and can be made to people experiencing delays in their universal credit claim. They are then paid back over time. Whether people are told about this option is still all too dependent on who they speak to. When the relevant information does get through, claimants are regularly expected to repay the debt over just six months, which pushes them into poverty. If you received £540 a month in universal credit, including housing costs, that would mean losing £45, every month for the first six months. It’s a significant sum when you consider the majority of the award goes on the cost of housing. Plus some social landlords have told us tenants are consistently asked to repay over as little as two or three months – another indicator that a lack of understanding by DWP representatives is a serious issue. Another misjudged decision is the implementation of a six-week wait between making a universal credit claim and receiving the first payment. The government wants to discourage people from abusing the welfare system by making short-term claims, and has, perhaps understandably introduced a waiting period as a disincentive. However, social landlords tell us that only a fifth of their tenants who claim universal credit have wages to fall back on during this time. That’s leading them to resort to borrowing, risking eviction and homelessness, and relying on foodbanks to feed themselves. The DWP estimates that 80% of first payments are made within the intended five to six-week period. But when 570,000 people are currently claiming universal credit – a number expected to climb into the millions – that remaining 20% isn’t just a margin of error – it isn’t good enough. At some housing associations, members tell us 40% of their tenants claiming universal credit already need intensive support, mostly to deal with delays and mistakes. So far, five to six Jobcentre areas have been implementing universal credit per month, but from late 2017, the number of new cases will increase at seven times the current rate. The time to make the necessary changes is now. We are supportive of universal credit’s aims. It is right that people are rewarded for finding work, and it is right that the benefits system is simplified. But the rollout must now be slowed down so that the DWP can apply its “test and learn” approach to resolve the operational glitches that are causing such hardship. Crucially, it must provide a consistent, transparent service to claimants and their landlords who currently spend so much time, energy and money dealing with a system that’s supposed to be simpler than that which it’s replaced. These problems need to be resolved, and soon. Otherwise we will see more people being pushed into poverty and put at risk of homelessness.

Brent council raided the property on Winchester Avenue, Queensbury, after complaints from neighbours. Mattresses were found wall to wall in all of the rooms except the bathrooms. The owner of the property, Sunil Hathi, who is a doctor, told the Guardian he was shocked by the discovery and has pledged to evict the men as soon as possible. “I have no idea how many people are living at this address, it was originally rented out to three people. This is the first time I have come here in the month they have been living here. We were not aware they were staying here and we are going to evict them.” Hathi said he was aggrieved at the council’s statement on Wednesday that put the blame on him. “Brent council put out a statement to the press saying that it was a ‘rogue landlord’ and I resent these comments. They’re highly defamatory and I am speaking with my lawyers. “I’m not running away from anything, why would I? This house is worth a lot of money. They could have found me in minutes on the land registry.” He says he is renting the property, which was sold for £450,000 as a buy-to-let in July 2014 to three Romanians who did DIY work for him up to seven years ago. They pay £2,500 a month for the semi-detached house, which is not registered for multiple occupancy. According to a neighbour, there has been a van outside the house for over a month. The neighbour speculated that this was to obscure constant night-time comings and goings. On Thursday a gazebo in the back garden was found to contain more mattresses. A Romanian man at the property said he did not speak English and that his friends were at work. While Hathi acknowledged that it is a landlord’s responsibility to inspect properties, he said it was impossible to do that every day and that he rented the property out only recently. When asked whether he owned other properties, he said it was “irrelevant”. He also claimed he was not aware of overcrowding being a problem in the area. Neighbours and locals claim there may be up to three other “doss houses” on the same road. “There’s no way that anyone should be made to live in such horrendous conditions,” said Josephine Yardborough, whose mother lives on the same road. “There’s an awful lot of it going on in this area. The council should be monitoring it and the landlords must be at fault if they know what’s going on.” These comments were echoed by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. “It is outrageous and shameful that we continue to see extreme examples like this, in which renters are being exploited and treated so abysmally. In 21st century London this is entirely unacceptable and must stop now,” said Khan. “Most landlords treat their tenants fairly – but those rogue landlords who exploit tenants must have no place in our city.” The finding comes as the mayor’s office prepares to launch London’s first publicly accessible ”name and shame” rogue landlord database that will provide information on landlords who have been prosecuted. By the end of the year, it will go live with landlords from six London boroughs before being rolled out more widely. Brent council says it has successfully prosecuted more than 100 landlords since July and a council spokesman stressed its zero tolerance policy towards rogue landlords. “The unlicensed HMO in Winchester Avenue came to the council’s attention via complaints made to the police about overcrowding,” said a spokesman. “We want to protect vulnerable tenants from exploitive landlords. A rogue can be prosecuted for unlawful evictions against tenants. We would advise tenants in Brent to approach reputable letting agencies in the borough for accommodation in the private rented sector.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/24/labour-corbyn-progressive-alliance-pluralism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T10:50:30Z","webTitle":"A four-step plan to keep Labour’s revolution rolling | Neal Lawson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/24/labour-corbyn-progressive-alliance-pluralism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/24/labour-corbyn-progressive-alliance-pluralism","fields":{"headline":"A four-step plan to keep Labour’s revolution rolling","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"No one saw the Labour revolution coming. Not even Jeremy Corbyn. From nowhere new life was breathed into an old party. But with the Tories digging in for a long haul to the next election, next week in Brighton Labour has a choice: to stick or twist. What makes Corbyn special is that he has stuck with everything he ever believed in. But his strengths are also his weaknesses. We have to remember why social democracy lost its power. Yes, the idea of free markets chimed with a more individualistic age, but a lack of responsiveness and heavy doses of paternalism made state socialism unpopular. Labour now needs to make four big changes if it is to own a very different political future. The first is cultural. The party and its supporters can and must fight many things. What it can’t fight is the spirit of our age. That spirit is networked and collaborative. Unlike the top-down social democratic settlement of the last century, 21st-century socialism will be participatory. The grassroots Momentum movement has demonstrated what is possible. If it’s to own this emerging future, then Labour must become democratic and pluralistic. This means tolerance of others inside the party and renouncing the first past the post electoral system once and for all. The complexity of the modern world demands an equally complex governance response. The idea that Labour alone can deal with the coming of the machine age, global finance and climate change makes no sense. And while “one more heave” might just get you into office, it leaves you as far from real power as ever. Pluralism is the only way to create the progressive alliances needed to overcome the regressive alliances that will inevitably and forcefully do everything to stifle Labour’s radical agenda. Whether the party will make the shift to support proportional representation is the litmus test, for this would show it trusts the people, treats them all equally and is willing to forgo a closed tribalism for the greater good. Next, Labour must fully embrace environmentalism. Climate change, as we now see daily, hits the poorest first and hardest, while a culture of turbo-consumption stretches the bonds of social solidarity to breaking point. If Labour’s goal is 77-inch televisions for the many, not the few, it will lack the vision for a good society and help destroy the planet. Instead, Labour should promote a shorter working week and a universal basic income. Finally, Labour must become part of a global movement for change. Yes, Corbyn is often brilliant on international solidarity with the poor and the persecuted – but we need a global network of ideas, parties, movements and eventually institutions that can regulate financial flows, deal with climate change and reverse global inequalities. Building global relationships, institutions and regulations will be tough, but is feasible in a networked society. In this digital culture things move fast and nowhere is this truer than in politics. Look at the surges of recent years to the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, the SNP, to Brexit and now to Labour. It’s a swarm-like culture, which can look on the surface like the deep solidarities and affinities of the past. Don’t be fooled. The swarm can and will keep shifting. Corbyn is hugely popular, but in the 21st century it’s all about the wave, not the surfer. The rally audience is the main event, not the speaker. Nietzsche remarked that “the error of most people is that they make one brave move and then don’t make another”. If the Corbyn revolution is not to be the supernova of an old politics, but a bright new lodestar for a new one, then the revolution must be continued. • Neal Lawson is chair of the pressure group Compass and spokesperson for the Progressive Alliance, and author of All Consuming"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/22/activity-pubs-promise-hope-for-ailing-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T16:42:54Z","webTitle":"Activity pubs promise hope for ailing industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/22/activity-pubs-promise-hope-for-ailing-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/22/activity-pubs-promise-hope-for-ailing-industry","fields":{"headline":"Activity pubs promise hope for ailing industry","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s Thursday night and London office workers are letting off steam down the pub knowing the weekend is in sight. But instead of chatting over a drink they are smashing ping pong balls over a net. The venue is Bounce, a ping pong bar on the fringes of the financial district, and the number of stray balls in the air gives the impression that somewhere in the room a lottery draw machine is misfiring. The bar even employs runners to dash among the rows of tables scooping up balls with oversized fishing nets. “I love the atmosphere. You can smash the ball around and nobody cares,” says Dan Wright, an accountant on a work night out. “If you get hit in the face it doesn’t matter. It’s all part of the fun.” It used to be the most exercise drinkers got was the trip to the bar for another round, but Bounce is among a new breed of bars and nightclubs changing the way Britons socialise by combining drinks with activities like table tennis, crazy golf and even axe-throwing. These new bars are seen as a positive trend for the UK’s beleaguered pub and nightclub scene which has suffered as Britons avoid expensive rounds – the average price of a pint of beer in Britain is now £3.60 – by buying discounted beer and wine alongside their weekly supermarket shop. Since the early 1970s nearly 30,000 pubs have called last orders for good with the 2007 smoking ban and the 2008 recession also blamed for the sector’s declining popularity. The total is now down to fewer than 47,000, according to the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), with 21 typically closing every week. As well as filling a gap in the UK pub market, Bounce is targeting global expansion with plans for 20 sites. The company was founded by leisure entrepreneur Adam Breeden, who was also behind bowling venture All Star Lanes. Other brands are also springing up. “Ping pong is quite active and competitive. I associate darts and pool with fat guys drinking pints,” says Mikey Televantou, head of marketing at Sink Pong, a table tennis venue in London’s trendy East End. “Sometimes people turn up in their shorts and T-shirts at lunchtime, but it’s mostly people in their work clothes.” Beer and table tennis sounds like a dangerous combination for the uncoordinated but Televantou says accidents happen very occasionally: “It’s gentler than competitive ping pong but sometimes people do slip or overstretch.” These alternative nights out are part of the “experience economy” – a phrase used to describe a shift in consumer behaviour from buying things to doing things. Official data shows that households spend less on clothes and food but more on holidays, cars, entertainment and eating out. “From a consumer standpoint they want more from their entertainment budget,” says Thomas Rose, who heads up the leisure and restaurant team at property firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield. “There hasn’t been a great deal of innovation in the leisure sector for the last 10-15 years and now we are seeing a wave of new concepts.” Pubs that have tailored their beer offer with quality cask ales and trendy craft brands have been been able to cash in on the craft beer revolution. Rose points to other bars such as Flight Club, a fledgling London chain that claims to have reinvented darts with dart-tracking technology, as putting a fresh twist on pub culture. “When you think of darts you tend too think of old men but when I went, 50% of the crowd were 18-35-year-old women,” says Rose. “It’s not slow and boring because you don’t have to do the adding up – the tech does it for you.” There is also a burgeoning crazy-golf scene with outfits such as Junkyard Golf Club and Swingers proving a big hit with millennials keen on Instagram worthy nights out. “The days when people were content to go to the pub and just have a chat have gone,” said Chris Legh, one of the co-founders of Junkyard Golf Club, which is opening a third venue in Oxford next month. “People want to be engrossed in an activity rather than sitting across a pub table ignoring their friends and looking at their mobiles.” Rose says his property firm is being contacted all the time by entrepreneurs with “crazy” bar themes up their sleeves. “But if you had said to me 10 years ago people would be opening table tennis bars I would have thought you were mad,” he adds. “Pubs are having to adapt to changing tastes.” But if you would prefer the kind of pub where there is no risk of a ping pong or golf ball plopping into your glass, you are not alone. “It feels quite American in here with the loud music and modern furniture, says Tarik Miri, a Belgian fintech worker also on a night out at Bounce. “I love traditional British pubs. They are friendly and I like the mindset – the wooden tables and old school feeling.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/22/golden-age-slutty-cinema-daphne-women-sex","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"Yes, yes, yes!

Welcome to the golden age of slutty cinema","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is a radical act, which every film generation thinks they are the first to discover: to create characters who are not good people. When you drill into it, this always means creating men who are not good men, since the grey areas around women on screen – do they have any lines that aren’t variations on “help”? Do they have motivation independent of the hero’s? – mean that, even in a putatively intelligent film, it is often quite hard to ascribe a moral arc to them, as it would be to a horse, or a robot. So let’s leave aside “good” – it is vanishingly rare, and pretty bracing, to see a woman on screen who isn’t the villain, and yet is not likable. The eponymous Daphne, a millennial chef trying to weather a choppy, hostile London, in a low-fi indie debut from Peter Mackie Burns, is not at all winsome – haughty and self-absorbed, cranky and ungenerous, she is arresting like the first spoon of a cold soup that you expected to be hot. Her sheer obstreperousness gets in the way of what would otherwise be her headline trait, promiscuity. She’s more often to be found nearly getting laid, then storming off for reasons that may or may not be valid (Daphne is quite a good fourth-date film, or any time you want to have an argument about men and women), than actually pursuing a sexual destiny, distinct from a romantic one. Nevertheless, she has agency enough to upend all the on-screen conventions about women and sex. In theory, if not in practice, she sleeps with whoever she wants to. There has never been a golden age for the sexually liberated cinematic heroine, the woman who reclaims the word “slut”. TV is different: less conservative, better at tracking the ambient sexual mores of the culture. On the big screen, we look to the 1930s and 40s – rightly – for an object lesson in how to make a female character with depth, verve, wit and intelligence, but to expect those women to shag around would be unreasonable, anachronistic. There’s a tradition of the available woman – the exquisite creature who only has to look at James Bond and, wham, she’s naked – but the logical flipside, that if she will sleep with an espionaging blow-in for no better reason than she likes the cut of his tuxedo, maybe she has irresistible appetites of her own, was never explored. Indeed, that was always the point: whatever era you are looking at, Bond girls were never “slags”, they were regular women whose feminine defences were overcome by whatever strange magnetism (its source, particularly in the Roger Moore days, beyond mysterious) that Bond exerted; a conceit that only worked if they were the opposite of promiscuous, anti-sluts. There was a period of intense cultural anxiety around sex – culminating in the magnificently hammy Fatal Attraction – which, at the time, it was fashionable to put down to HIV; the sudden shock of the metaphorical elision between sex and death turning into a literal reality. However, the real inquiry of that film was: “What would happen if a woman had an appetite like a man’s? How dangerous would she be?” The answer came back: “Really, really dangerous.” Cinema had gone straight from woman-as-receptacle-of-men’s-desire to woman-denatured-by-her-own-desire, without any interim period of coming to terms with female desire in its own right. But the truly ludicrous period, where romantic comedy came completely unstuck from the world around it, was the first decade of this century: off-screen, we were in the last throes of liberated sex-positivity; chastity wasn’t a virtue, slut wasn’t an insult, experimentation was modernity. The whole spectre of sex as a zero-sum game, in which the woman had always, if she thought about it hard enough, been victimised, and needed the payoff of an eternal pair bond to make it worthwhile, was yet to become mainstream, alive only in the maundering of the rotary club and the proto alt-right chatroom. On screen, much more ancient, Shakespearean codes prevailed; sex had to have meaning, had to herald marriage or at least ersatz-marriage. Romcoms and straight romances tied themselves in the most extraordinary plot knots to prevent the two leads, plainly compatible and perfectly attractive, from having sex until the end. Whole careers were forged finding reasons for Meg Ryan to say “no”. In Return to Me, in 2000, Minnie Driver and David Duchovny would have sex, except for the troublesome fact that she was the organ-recipient of his dead wife’s heart. I mean, guys, really? Would it not have been easier to go full-Bible, and admit that her hymen was her chief material asset? The gear shift was Bridesmaids, in 2011, which I, like any other sane woman, walked into with dread, expecting more of the same, women preserving themselves for marriage and expressing themselves through shopping. There was marriage and there were shops, but there was also Kristen Wiig’s sexual voracity – along with so much else that was previously unmentionable in mainstream comedy: a woman with a sense of humour; an experience of failure; money worries; a character who wasn’t thin or attractive but was still a human being. Humour and sexual appetite have a symbiosis in film that they don’t have in life – in so far as a regular woman might be incredibly horny and not necessarily funny, but a film that cannot conceive of a woman making a joke, or having any native wit, will be unable to imagine her having a sexual destiny of her own. Fact. A lot of tropes remained unchallenged by Bridesmaids – it’s still a quest for intimacy, for true love, in which sex for pleasure is implicitly self-destructive and only intermittently pleasurable, but it was something. The magnificent Girl’s Trip outstripped it with women who did all those things – made jokes, had sex – as well as (I still boggle to think of it) actually fighting. But the real test of how far things have come is a straight plot comparison between Bridget Jones, the first (2001) and Bridget Jones, the third (2016) – tact prevents the mention of the middle film, a stain on the brand. The first had a classic, Richard-Curtis-esque reading of female sexuality; the heroine fancies someone other than the hero, but this is because she has made a mistake; indeed, her appetite is part of the “distress” element of damsel-in-distress, and the hero will save her from this, along with other mistakes. Kudos to the film for having a joke about anal sex, but it did little to advance the notion of woman as independent agent. Fast forward 15 years, and Bridget Jones, now a woman of mature appetite, ruefully catching up with the full-on lasciviousness of her younger colleagues, will have sex with someone, not because she is desperate, or lonely, or because it’s a cry for help – no, seriously, wait for this – but because she thinks he is handsome. There is no call for the congress to be validated with a date, or a follow-up shag, nor does it present any impediment to her sleeping with her ex shortly afterwards. Never mind, she’s not punished for it – doesn’t end up alone or with a disease. The reward is magnificent – she gets pregnant, at 43. In the world of the romcom, we have become so used to the wish-fulfilment being light years away from anyone’s actual wishes, the shock of seeing a wish that a lot of people probably have come true for reasons that were probably, realistically, the only way that would happen … I sort of wanted to do a Mexican wave. Daphne isn’t the most sexually fulfilled character to light a film – far from it – but she joins a modestly sized army of women whom the screen has never previously been able to accommodate: the ones with their own sex drive (hang on, honourable mention for Thelma &amp; Louise, The Last Seduction and The Long Kiss Goodnight; not because she’s voracious, just because she’s good at killing) who are neither the victims of, nor inertly, Sleeping-Beauty-wise, waiting to be enlivened by, male desire. This is the golden age, in other words. This is the slut’s time.

Internal company emails disclosed in a US court case, in which a 51-year-old woman was awarded a record $57m in damages this month, also show that senior executives even briefly considered suppressing unfavourable data that “could compromise the future” of the device. J&amp;J’s Ethicon unit was found by a US court to be liable for the serious injuries Ella Ebaugh suffered after receiving a mesh implant to treat urinary incontinence. The mother of five said she was left with a mangled urethra, bladder spasms and continual pelvic pain after an unsuccessful procedure that led to three revision surgeries to remove mesh that had cut into her urethra and migrated to her bladder. But documents submitted to the court show J&amp;J staff had raised concerns about the “spinning of data” in emails and male executives are seen bantering about a suggestion that sex with an earlier patient with mesh complications must be “like screwing a wire brush”. When it emerged from initial data that the success rates for a new device looked to be “way below” those seen for previous products, Ethicon’s director of sales, Xavier Buchon, suggested in an email “stop[ping] for a while such publications that could compromise the future”. The J&amp;J implant, used to treat urinary incontinence, was launched in 2006. Despite the early indications of a high failure rate, it was only withdrawn in 2012 after being used in thousands of operations in the US, the UK and Australia. The documents raise uncomfortable questions for the manufacturers of vaginal mesh products, which are the subject of growing controversy. The implants, which reinforce tissue around the urethra, are widely used to treat incontinence, and for the majority of women the procedure is quick and successful. However, some women have suffered debilitating complications, including severe pelvic pain, the mesh eroding through the vaginal wall or perforating organs. Class action law suits are underway in Australia and the US, where lawyers claim that patients have been exposed to unacceptable risks; in England, NHS data suggests as many as one in fifteen women later requires full or partial removal of the implant. Ebaugh, whose case was heard in Philadelphia, said that her complications have left her with constant pelvic pain, meaning for example, that although she attended her daughter’s recent wedding, she was unable to enjoy it. “I feel like I’m on fire down there,” she said in an interview with CBS. The tranche of documents, revealed during the trial, places a spotlight on tensions between Ethicon’s commercial and clinical divisions at the time it launched its “miniature” mesh product, called the TVT-Secur, in 2006. The company hoped that the new device, which was smaller and required fewer incisions, would reduce complications seen with its earlier devices. But getting to market ahead competitors, who had similar offerings in the pipeline, was described as “priceless” in company documents. It was approved for use without a trial under US and European equivalence rules, which allow this when a new device is similar to existing ones. Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence-based medicine at the University of Oxford who has called for a public inquiry into the use of mesh, condemned the decision to launch a device before a trial, saying this had “led to direct patient harms”. “It has made it impossible to provide informed choice to women, and points to a regulatory system that is failing patients,” he added. Prof Bernard Jacquetin, an eminent French gynaecologist whose early study on TVT-Secur had led to misgivings among J&amp;J management, told the Guardian the company had acted “irresponsibly” by launching the device without adaquate evidence. Ahead of the device’s original launch, Jacquetin was invited to the US to give advice on the new design, but was taken aback when he was presented with a boxed-up product ready for release. Jacquetin and colleagues later carried out a study in 40 patients, which found success rates of 77% two months after surgery, compared to the roughly 85-90% success rate commonly reported for Ethicon’s original TVT mesh device. On learning that Jacquetin’s results did not look promising (though not referring to the eventual 77% figure), marketing manager, Fabrice Degeneve emailed his superiors to ask: “How should we handle this without compromising the use of this new technique?” Ethicon’s director of sales, Xavier Buchon, replied: “This is for sure a big concern,” before suggesting withholding results while the company reviewed the patients to be included in the analysis. “No way to hide the truth but to make sure it has been done correctly in terms of procedure and inclusion,” he added. In the event, the findings were presented at a major international conference and Jacquetin said he never felt pressure to bury unfavourable results. But he adds: “I was really disappointed. I told many people at Ethicon it was not [a good device].” In 2012, TVT-Secur was withdrawn from the market, along with three other mesh products. J&amp;J declined to provide exact figures on how many women had received the implants. In other emails, J&amp;J staff complain of colleagues “constantly spinning data” and of a dangerous blurring of the “lines between commercial and research” divisions. “I am continually amazed and surprised at our need to push back,” wrote Judi Gauld, Ethicon’s former clinical director in Scotland. Other emails show a blasé attitude to distressing complications. In one, dated from 2003, a surgeon sought advice on treating a patient with a 2cm stretch of mesh poking through her vaginal wall. “Sex is like screwing a wire brush according to her spouse,” the doctor wrote. Martin Weisberg, Ethicon’s medical director, replied: “I’ve never tried the wire brush thing so I won’t comment.” Following the trial, Ebaugh’s lawyer, Kila Baldwin, said in a statement: “I am pleased the jury recognised the recklessness of J&amp;J and I hope the company takes notice of the verdict and adjusts its practices accordingly.” Johnson &amp; Johnson said they plan to appeal the verdict. In a statement, the company said: “We believe the evidence in the Ebaugh trial showed Ethicon’s TVT and TVT-Secur devices were properly designed, Ethicon acted appropriately and responsibly in the research, development and marketing of the products, and the products were not the cause of the plaintiff’s continuing medical problems. “Over two and a half million documents have been provided to plaintiff attorneys by Ethicon as part of the pelvic mesh litigation in the United States, and selective disclosure of certain sentences or documents without proper context can be extremely misleading.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/21/tony-abbott-assaulted-on-street-in-hobart","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T10:42:45Z","webTitle":"'He headbutted me': Tony Abbott says he was assaulted by yes campaigner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/21/tony-abbott-assaulted-on-street-in-hobart","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/21/tony-abbott-assaulted-on-street-in-hobart","fields":{"headline":"'He headbutted me': Tony Abbott says he was assaulted by yes campaigner","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The former Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, has been assaulted in Hobart. He says he was headbutted by a yes campaigner as he was walking towards his hotel, leaving him with a slightly swollen lip. He was in Tasmania on Thursday lunching with campaigners who are opposed to same-sex marriage, including his Liberal party colleague Eric Abetz. Abbott told the story to Steve Price and Sky News host Andrew Bolt on Melbourne’s 3AW radio on Thursday. “I was walking from the Mercury office across that docks area, that beautiful docks area in Hobart, towards my hotel,” Abbott said. “A fellow sung out at me ‘Hey Tony!’ I turned around, there was a chap wearing a Vote Yes badge. He says ‘I wanna shake your hand’. I went over to shake his hand and then he headbutted me. “Now he wasn’t very good at it I’ve gotta say, but he did make contact. The only damage was a very, very slightly swollen lip. “I was with a member of my staff [who] briefly grappled with this guy, and he then ran off swearing his head off basically. “It was just a reminder of how ugly this debate is getting,” he said. His spokesman said the incident occurred while he was walking in the street and he sustained minor injuries. “He didn’t have a blood nose or break his nose or anything like that,” the spokesman said, before refusing to elaborate on the incident or injuries. Malcolm Turnbull called Abbott as soon as he heard about the incident and left a voicemail, according to a spokesman. He also called Andrew Colvin, the commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. Price said Abbott was lucky to have a witness to the assault because some yes campaigners would accuse him of making the story up if he didn’t. “Oh without a doubt,” Bolt said. Alex Greenwich MP, the co-chair of The Equality Campaign, has condemned the attack. “There is absolutely no place for violence in the marriage equality debate. This is about treating people fairly and with respect &amp; dignity,” he said on Twitter. “Marriage equality is about respect and dignity for every Australian ... our campaign has always and will continue to call for respect and everyone involved in this debate to act in a respectful and dignified way,” he said in a separate statement. Bolt later talked about the incident on his Thursday evening Sky News program, utterly condemning the attack.

The relationship has proved to be a very public car crash for the team and the engine manufacturer over the last three years and Alonso has been absolutely clear that he held Honda responsible. His optimism stems from the switch to Renault power units but the task that lies ahead for McLaren remains immense. The most successful British racing team, with eight constructors’ and 12 driver’s titles, have not won a race since Jenson Button’s victory at Brazil in 2012. They have not claimed a constructors’ title since 1998. The switch to Renault is not going to reverse this trend overnight but it may be enough to lay the foundations for the future. The partnership with Honda, engineered by Ron Dennis, had at its heart the belief that the team could not challenge for the title with a customer engine and needed a works partnership. A sound theory, but in recent years Toyota, BMW and Honda themselves have discovered that being a works outfit guarantees nothing in F1. McLaren’s hopes for a return to the glory days of their partnership in the late 1980s and early 90s turned to bitter ashes. Their engine has been underpowered and unreliable throughout. On Wednesday the team’s racing director, Éric Boullier, was blunt about the failed partnership. “When you look at the last three years it’s been a proper disaster for us in terms of credibility and getting new sponsors,” he said. Boullier, however, shared Alonso’s optimism. “You have to take the long-term view,” he added. “In the next five years I am absolutely sure that we will go back to where McLaren belongs. And with this bouncing back we get our credibility back and it will rebuild our sponsor portfolio. It might take two to three years.” He, at least, has put a reasonable timescale on it, as opposed to Honda, who said in Singapore they expected their new partnership with Toro Rosso would put them into the top three, a singularly spectacular failure in managing expectations. McLaren’s executive director, Zak Brown, who took over at the end of last year, told me early in the season he should be judged by the team’s results. By ditching Honda he has made the first step to improving them but the difficult job lies ahead. The team will take a huge hit commercially from dropping Honda – understood to be around $100m (£74m) a year, a blow exacerbated by a lack of sponsors and poor finishes resulting in a drop in prize money. But nonetheless financially they do not have to worry in the short-term. Brown has been explicit that the team’s Bahraini owners are unafraid of backing them and have the financial muscle to do so. Equally at the factory in Woking they have the resources, numbers and experience to put that backing to good use. This would, it is hoped, kickstart the cycle of recovery. Better results mean more prize money and more sponsors. “We are ninth in the championship,” said Boullier. “With a top engine I think we would be fourth right now and just on the FOM [prize] money we could cover the engine side, so it will not be a big risk on the monetary side. Thanks to the shareholders who have been brave enough to take a sporting choice and not hurt McLaren.” The Renault engine is the third best on the grid this season – they are bringing a new concept to the 2018 iteration but it will have to go some to challenge Mercedes and Ferrari. The power unit switch alone will not put McLaren on the front of the grid. In their favour, however, their chassis does appear strong and with some decent horses they can at least target challenging Red Bull, subject to having to alter their car to the architecture of the Renault engine. All of which does promise improvement; even if the race wins Alonso desires may be some way off, Boullier’s five-year prediction is instructive. The switch to Renault was desperately needed by the team but it is not necessarily the solution. Brown has spoken about looking forward to the new engine regulations of 2021, for which Porsche, Aston Martin, Cosworth and indeed McLaren themselves are considering manufacturing power units. Rebuilding for now and coming back to the top when the playing field has been levelled with a less engine-dependent formula, is an entirely realistic proposition and one to be welcomed. F1 needs a strong McLaren, at the heart of which is Alonso, who will visit the factory this week where it is expected he will finalise a new deal with the team. Alonso is the final key to McLaren’s rejuvenation. The double world champion is one of the few drivers able to extract more from his machinery than it promises on paper – he can bring the forward momentum they so badly need. With the driver market opening up at the end of 2018, Alonso may want only a one-year contract but McLaren need to show him they are a proposition worth sticking with. Now they have a proven engine there is nowhere to hide. If they are to return to the top, next season must prove to be the start of a new era for the team."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/21/tell-us-about-the-bad-habits-youve-broken-and-how-its-changed-you","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T14:38:37Z","webTitle":"Tell us about the bad habits you've broken and how it's changed you","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/21/tell-us-about-the-bad-habits-youve-broken-and-how-its-changed-you","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/21/tell-us-about-the-bad-habits-youve-broken-and-how-its-changed-you","fields":{"headline":"Tell us about the bad habits you've broken and how it's changed you","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"October starts next week and for some it’s Stoptober, the month to try and give up smoking.

May must tread a delicate line between offering enough to the 27 EU member states to restart the stalled negotiations (but not so much as to throw away all future leverage) and keeping Brexit hardliners in her cabinet and parliament on board. Here are the key points to watch out for. The money The EU27 are adamant that talks cannot move on to discuss the UK’s future trading relationship with the bloc until agreement is reached on the financial settlement, the Irish border and citizens’ rights. The biggest stumbling block is the divorce bill. The two sides have radically opposing views on how this should be calculated; the UK has even presented legal arguments to show it is not obliged to pay anything at all. It is thought May will offer to pay enough into the EU to ensure no member state need make extra contributions during the current budget round, which ends in 2020 – a year after the UK leaves. This would amount to about €20bn (£18bn), although she may not mention a figure. But numbers circulating in Brussels for the final sum the EU27 expect range from €50bn to €100bn. The bloc will want to see a clear signal that Britain will meet its unpaid liabilities for EU projects, and other continuing items such as loan guarantees and EU pensions, extending several years beyond Brexit. The border and citizens’ rights The EU has made it clear it it expects Britain to come up with a viable solution for the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, dismissing London’s plans for a high-tech invisible border and customs waivers as “magical thinking”. Brussels and EU capitals will want substance here. May must offer more concrete and, above all, more workable proposals and acknowledge that Britain cannot simply wish the problem away. After a series of alarming Home Office blunders, strong assurances on citizens’ rights would also help. Progress here – notably on the key role of the European court of justice – will be vital in winning over the veto-holding European parliament. The transition Beyond the items on the article 50 agenda, May should shed light on the government’s view of the transition period it seems now to agree will be necessary to bridge the gap between exiting the EU in March 2019 and beginning a new trading relationship. Brexit hardliners, including the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, want this to be as short as possible. The signs are May will propose a “standstill” transition of up to two years to minimise the shock to business, as promoted by the chancellor, Philip Hammond. The EU27 will entertain this as long as it is short and maintains the status quo: the UK will have to abide by EU law and the rulings of the ECJ, and by the rules of the single market, including free movement. They will expect the prime minister to state clearly that this is what Britain wants and is prepared to do. The tone and the future relationship There are hints that May is preparing to go over the head of the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to appeal to individual EU27 heads of state. She has said, for example, that “the decision will be taken by leaders”. But member states have given Barnier a clear legal mandate to lead the negotiations, and have neither the time nor the inclination to revisit it. What they would welcome above all from May’s speech would be some realism. Meaningless calls for “deep and special” relationships and “bespoke deals” will not be well received because that the EU27 are increasingly sure that Britain’s end objective remains a “have-your-cake-and-eat-it” Brexit. In Barnier’s words, all the UK has said so far points to a “nostalgic and unrealistic” wish to “continue to enjoy the benefits of the single market and EU membership, without actually being part of it”. As he also bluntly said last month: “This is impossible.” So perhaps the most important signal May could send in Florence is that the UK understands it cannot cherry pick, realises there are rules that cannot be rewritten – and agrees that if it wants more than the benefits of a Canada-style free trade deal, it will have to accept obligations – and a model such as Norway’s or Iceland’s. It may be time to acknowledge what “Brexit means Brexit” actually means."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2017/sep/21/dollar-rallies-fed-ends-qe-markets-uk-public-finances-ryanair-agm-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T16:48:00Z","webTitle":"UK public finances beat forecasts, as Ryanair boss apologises over cancellations –as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/sep/21/dollar-rallies-fed-ends-qe-markets-uk-public-finances-ryanair-agm-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/sep/21/dollar-rallies-fed-ends-qe-markets-uk-public-finances-ryanair-agm-live","fields":{"headline":"UK public finances beat forecasts, as Ryanair boss apologises over cancellations –as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"After their record breaking runs, US markets paused for breath following the Federal Reserve’s announcement it would begin winding down the stimulus programme which has been supporting the economy since the financial crisis. The reaction in Europe was fairly subdued, with most markets heading higher. But continuing strength in the pound - now up 0.6% at $1.3573 - saw the UK’s leading index slip back slightly. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 slipped by 8.05 points or 0.11% to 7263.90 Germany’s Dax rose 0.25% to 12,600.03 France’s Cac closed up 0.49% at 5267.29 Italy’s FTSE MIB was 0.61% better at 22,491.73 Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.05% at 10,297.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.06% to 765.99 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 38 points or 0.17%. On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. Riskier markets have shrugged off the US Federal Reserve’s suggestion of another rate rise this year, but could fall sharply in time if the US economy shows signs of flagging, says Capital Economics. The consultancy’s markets economist Oliver Jones said: Risky asset markets took the Fed’s unexpectedly-hawkish tone on Wednesday in their stride. We think that they will remain resilient over the next year and a half or so, even though we forecast that the Fed will hike rates once a quarter between now and the early 2019. The US dollar and Treasury yields rose after the conclusion of the FOMC’s meeting on Wednesday in response to the committee’s signal that it is likely to raise the federal funds rate in December, despite the weakness of core inflation and the effects of the recent hurricanes. (The Fed also announced the start of balance sheet “normalisation”, but this was widely expected.) In the event, there was little reaction in risky asset markets. The S&amp;P 500 was almost unchanged on the day, and movements in emerging market equities were small. This might be partly due to the fact that the Fed’s tone was not a huge surprise. But a couple of other factors have probably helped risky assets to be resilient too – not just on Wednesday but throughout the Fed’s tightening cycle so far. We think that these factors will continue to provide support this year and next, even if the Fed hikes rates as we expect. First, there has been little to suggest that higher rates are dragging on economic growth, and we expect this to remain the case in 2017 and 2018. The US economy has expanded at a healthy pace since the Fed started hiking and we forecast it will continue to do so this year and next... Second, the likelihood that interest rates will ultimately remain quite low, even if they rise in the coming quarters, has probably supported the valuations of risky assets. Despite their hawkish near-term signal on Wednesday, FOMC participants’ median forecast for the level of the federal funds rate in the “longer term” fell by 25bp, to 2.75%, the lowest since these projections were first published in 2012... Taking this all into account, we think that risky asset prices will continue to hold up well as the Fed applies the brakes in the next eighteen months or so. However, we suspect that the lagged effects of higher rates will eventually begin to take their toll on the US economy as the Fed reaches the end of its tightening cycle in 2019. If the US economy did falter, risky asset prices globally would probably fall quite sharply. Bank shares have been boosted by the prospect of higher interest rates, in the wake of the US Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The prospect of higher rates in the key US market, and indeed even the possibility of a modest rate rise in the UK, has prompted investors to buy up financial services stocks in hope of better margins and improved profits and dividends. Europe has been bolstered by a weaker euro, as Janet Yellen manages to do what Mario Draghi could not or would not, with last night’s arguably more hawkish statement putting some fight back into the US dollar. Today’s speech from Draghi stayed off the topic of monetary policy, thus providing little for euro bulls to go on. The eurozone consumer confidence figures were at their highest level for about 16 years, says ING Bank. Its senior eurozone economist Bert Colijn said: The current economic environment in the Eurozone continues to be very favourable to the consumer, as job growth accelerates, wage growth has begun to improve, and inflation remains below the ECB’s target. This helps the Eurozone economy as more confident consumers continue to boost household demand. While the breakdown of individual questions from the September survey has not been released yet, recent data shows expectations of major purchases in the coming year have jumped to levels last seen before the crisis, which is in line with an increasingly positive assessment of personal finances. Expectations of households’ future financial situation have been improving too and there are few doubts related to the historically low expectations of unemployment in the coming 12 months. While expectations of economic growth in the coming years are modest, as the Eurozone is expected to revert to a weaker growth trend, buoyant consumers are helping GDP growth to remain above trend for a while. For the ECB, the euphoric consumer is another sign that cautious increases in upward price pressures are likely to continue. But consumer expectations of price trends have been falling since January, indicating that consumers are not expecting the Goldilocks economy to end anytime soon. In the eurozone, consumer confidence rose by more than expected in September. The European Commission’s initial estimate showed confidence among consumers rise from -1.5 in August to -1.2, better than the unchanged reading that analysts had been forecasting. In the wider European Union consumer sentiment rose by 0.8 points to -1.5. After their recent record breaking runs, US markets have lost some ground in the wake of Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting. News that the Fed was still considering another interest rate rise this year and would begin cutting its $4.5bn worth of bond holdings has seen investors take a more cautious tone. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 0.14% to 22,380 while the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.18% and the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 0.38%. Monetary policy cannot tackle local financial imbalances in the eurozone area, and individual governments need to rely on their own tools to solve these issues, says European Central Bank president Mario Draghi. In a speech in Frankfurt at the second annual conference of the European Systemic Risk Board, he said: Financial and business cycles can potentially become de-synchronised, meaning that financial imbalances can grow in an environment characterised by relatively muted inflation. In such an environment, the use of monetary policy is not the right instrument to address financial imbalances, and may lead to substantial deviations of aggregate output and inflation from their desirable levels. This is particularly so in a currency union where monetary policy affects the entire region, but financial imbalances may be local in nature. Macroprudential policies, targeted at particular markets or countries, can play a key role in addressing such imbalances. Draghi said European banks still had too many non-performing loans on their books: Despite recent progress, the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) on European banks’ balance sheets remains high. At the end of 2016, the stock of gross NPLs in the EU banking sector was around €1 trillion. This number, however, does not take into account the fact that that collateralised lending plays an important role in Europe. For example, including collateral and provisioning, the coverage of NPLs is, on average, 82% in the euro area. Banks’ profitability, however, is affected by the lower returns provided by the NPLs, given the weight of gross exposures in total assets: gross NPLs represent 4% of the total assets of euro area banks, against only 0.8% for US banks. Draghi concluded: Much has been achieved since the global financial crisis. In particular, banks in Europe are more resilient and the banking union has advanced. Moreover, authorities have the mandates and tools to tackle risks in the banking sector and are using them. These improvements have created a financial system that poses fewer risks to the real economy. At the same time, work remains to be done. Authorities need to watch out for blind spots, where risks can build up unnoticed, and use the tools at their disposal. And legislators need to be mindful that authorities require a broad range of tools to be able to tackle risks beyond the banking sector. Trouble is brewing at UK outsourcing group Capita, as staff vote to hold a six-day strike in a dispute over pensions. Members of the Unite union will walk out from October 5 after voting heavily in favour of industrial action. Unite are protesting against plans to close the current defined benefit pension scheme and transfer staff to a defined contribution scheme. Dominic Hook, Unite national officer, said Capita’s plans were “disgraceful”, adding: “Capita’s pension proposals will have far-reaching consequences for the retirement of many Unite members. Some staff will lose a shocking 70% of their retirement income. Capita has once again put the interests of shareholders before those of its staff. The move comes as Capita reported that profits fell by 26% in the first half of 2017. That sent its shares slumping by 12% today, making it the worst-performing major share in London. Capita has its fingers in a lot of pies, from collecting TV licence money to assessing whether disabled people are entitled to personal independence payments. But the last few months have been tough; it fell out of the FTSE 100 after a grim profits warning, and it hasn’t managed to replace its CEO..... The FT’s Arthur Beesley has written about this morning’s Ryanair AGM. Here’s a flavour: At the AGM, a number of shareholders challenged Mr O’Leary, who took personal responsibility for the cancellations. “We do have the sackcloth on. I have apologised personally to all of those passengers and to the ones we didn’t disrupt,” he said. “We are not going to back to gung-ho management.” Shareholder Brian Graham, a retired mechanic, who questioned Mr O’Leary during the meeting said it was clear that there was “no goodwill” between the chief executive and pilots. “If it happened anywhere else he’d be asking for heads to roll,” Mr Graham said. But Mr O’Leary said there will be no dismissals as a result of the affair, saying the board was holding him to account by requiring him to resolve the matter.

Around 259,000 Americans filed an “initial jobless” claim last week, much better than the 302,000 which Wall Street expected. That’s down from 282,000 the previous week, when people sought assistance after hurricane Harvey caused devastation in Texas and beyond.

In other news, Standard &amp; Poor’s has fired a warning shot at China by downgrading its credit rating. S&amp;P warned that China’s build-up of debt is a growing concern, as it cuts its rating by one notch, to A+ from AA-. S&amp;P claimed that: “China’s prolonged period of strong credit growth has increased its economic and financial risks. Although this credit growth had contributed to strong real gross domestic product growth and higher asset prices, we believe it has also diminished financial stability to some extent.” Beijing may not appreciate the timing, just weeks before the Communist party holds its key five-yearly congress. But is S&amp;P right? It’s true that Chinese companies have been borrowing at a worrying rate, and that its shadow banking sector conceals some dubious debts. This chart, from Bloomberg, shows how corporate debt has swelled -- and that bill could easily land back on the government. But this isn’t new. And the Chinese government has been taking steps to avoid a financial crisis, without slowing growth too much, Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital, argues that China is actually safer than before... Ryanair’s share price has recovered some of its early losses, and is now down just 0.7% today. The news that the airline plans to hire 125 new pilots ASAP could be reassuring traders. But this still means the airline has lost almost 10% of its value this week. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, says: The flight cancellations and fraught negotiations with pilots have overshadowed what would otherwise be a run-of-the-mill AGM for Ryanair. Ryanair shares dipped as Chief Executive Michael O’Leary apologised to shareholders for the management failure. Here’s my colleague Rob Davies’s take on the Ryanair annual general meeting: Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary has escalated the airline’s dispute with pilots, saying they do not have a “difficult job” and claiming he can force them to give up a week of leave. O’Leary is scrambling to prevent more disruption to the no-frills airline’s schedule after last week cancelling up to 50 flights a day due to a rota “mess-up” that left it short of pilots. Speaking at Ryanair’s AGM in Dublin on Thursday, the famously outspoken airline chief admitted that further cancellations could follow but refused to back down in a dispute with pilots. A group of pilots on Wednesday turned down an offer of up to £12,000 to keep flying during their scheduled leave, many of them putting their names to a letter demanding improved employment terms instead.... More here: Michael O’Leary appears to be taking a carrot and stick approach with his pilots, warning that if they “misbehave there will be no goodies.” He also downplayed the news that some pilots are planning to work to rule, saying: If you want and need to ask your staff to give up holidays no work to rule can alter that. I don’t even know how there would be industrial action in Ryanair. There isn’t a union.” O’Leary has acknowledged that criticism of Ryanair’s pay structure has merit, saying “maybe we have got it a bit on the low side”. But he also denies that staff are up in arms, claiming there’s been “huge co-operation and support from pilots”. And asked about the causes of the crisis that forced up to 50 flights to be cancelled each week, O’Leary said: “We make mistakes. This time we made a major boo boo. “A very big block of annual leave (for pilots) was over-allocated for September, October and November,” (thanks to PA and Reuters for the quotes) Reuters have more details on Ryanair’s pay offer to pilots: Ryanair will hand pilots at some of its largest bases a 10,000 euro annual pay rise on top of a 12,000 euro bonus offered this week to those who help the airline alleviate a pilot shortage, Chief Executive Michael O’Leary said on Thursday. Pilots were offered the bonus in exchange for working an additional 10 days to plug a shortage that last week forced Ryanair to cancel more than 2,000 flights in September and October. Pilots at London Stansted, Dublin, Frankfurt and Berlin have now been offered an additional 10,000 euros per year, O’Leary told a news conference. Similar offers may be made at other airports, but that will depend on whether those bases have a surplus of pilots, he said Back in London, the Treasury has welcomed the drop in UK borrowing in August to £5.7bn, from almost £7bn. A spokesperson says: ‘We have made substantial progress in reducing the deficit, whilst taking a balanced approach that allows us to invest in our infrastructure and public services. This approach is working but the national debt is still too high, so we must continue to live within our means and start reducing our debt.” Sky News’s Darren McCaffrey has just tweeted a video clip of Michael O’Leary denying that his pilots are overworked, or doing a “difficult job”. The Ryanair boss says: If there are fatigue issues among pilots....on short-haul flying it is never as a result of flying. Here’s the Press Association’s take on Ryanair’s AGM: Ryanair is planning to take back one week of its pilots’ holidays to prevent any further flight cancellations, the airline’s chief executive has said. Michael O’Leary said pilots due to take a four-week block of holidays in the next few months because a change in annual leave rotas will be told to reduce that to three weeks. He said they will get the other week back in January. At a meeting with shareholders at the airline’s AGM in Dublin, Mr O’Leary said the airline does not need the agreement of pilots to take back a week of their leave. He told shareholders six weeks of cancellations, which he previously admitted was a ‘mess’, has cost the airline about €25m (£22m). Mr O’Leary again apologised for the disruption, which he said was down to mismanagement of the pilots’ rostering system. He refused to discuss media reports that many pilots had turned down offers of a €12,000 (£10,600) bonus and instead demanded improved contracts. Michael O’Leary has revealed that Dublin-based pilots are getting a pay rise, and it will be offered to staff at some other bases too. But....the president of the Irish Airline Pilots’ Association has said Ryanair needs a “fundamental change” to the way it deals with pilots. Evan Cullen, who heads the pilots group, outlined the extraordinary employment structure which leaves them at an arms length relationship. Instead of being employed as staff, they are grouped into mini-companies which provide service to a UK company which in turn provides Ryanair with its pilots, said Cullen in a BBC interview. “One of the main pillars in the grievance, is that many of the Ryanair pilots do not have a fixed permanent contract,” he told Newsnight. The full interview starts here at around 27 minutes: “This means that pilots are grouped into companies, into Irish companies which have between five and eight pilot directors, those companies then subcontract into a UK labour provider of pilots and then that UK provider provides the pilot labour into Ryanair. This gives an extraordinary arms length distance between Ryanair and the pilot,” Cullen explained. He added: “There has to be a fundamental change in how Ryanair deals with its pilots. Unfortunately the latest offers from Ryanair means it is a sticking plaster approach” “That’s where the point of anger is with the pilots, that Ryanair don’t seem to be taking seriously the fundamental grievance about the precarious nature of the employment.” He predicted that some newly qualified Ryanair pilots were merely waiting for their start dates in order to quit. “Ryanair is not competing in the market place, there are many pilots that have left Ryanair such as the 140 to Norwegian Airlines but also many airlines throughout Europe have a holding pool of pilots and that holding pool is where the pilots have successfully competed the application process but awaiting a start date. “We know that many of the pilots in these holding pools are actually Ryanair pilots waiting for a start date and when they get that start date they will then issue Ryanair with their notice.” Guardian Business has launched a daily email.

For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Back in Dublin, Michael O’Leary is continuing to answer questions over Ryanair’s flight cancellations. He’s told the AGM that Ryanair doesn’t have enough pilots to cover September, October and November, which is why it may force pilots to delay some holidays. The budget airline boss also announced plans to hire an extra 125 pilots, soon, to handle the shortages which forced flights to be cut. O’Leary also told investors that the situation is now ‘under control’, but warns that further cancellations can’t be ruled out Chris Choi of ITV News is also at the AGM, and reports that some shareholders aren’t happy: John Hawksworth, PwC chief economist, says Philip Hammond will welcome the drop in public borrowing in August. With the deficit below forecasts, Hawksworth believes chancellor Hammond could have some extra flexibility to boost spending in the budget. Back in March, the OBR forecast that the budget deficit would rise to around £58 billion this year, but the latest data suggest that it may be similar to the £46 billion outturn for 2016/17. This would imply a budget deficit of just over 2% of GDP this year, which is already close to the Chancellor’s medium term target for the deficit in 2020. “All of this suggests that the Chancellor should have room for some easing of austerity in his Budget in November. This could involve extra money for priorities such as the NHS, social care, housing and infrastructure investment as well as some further relaxation of the public sector pay cap.” Here’s Howard Archer of EY Item Club on today’s UK public finances: Labour’s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell MP, points out that the government has still failed to eliminate the UK deficit: “These figures are yet another reminder of the last seven years of failed Tory economic policy, following on from the OECD just yesterday predicting growth in our economy to continue to slow next year. “After one year in the job Philip Hammond has continued the record of failure of his predecessor. The deficit has still not been eliminated, the national debt continues to rise, yet the Chancellor is carrying on with austerity cuts that are weakening our economy further, and hitting the incomes of working families. The big picture of today’s public finances is that Britain now owes almost £1.8 trillion, or 88% of annual economic output. August’s public finances also suggest that Britain might borrow less than expected this financial year. The annual deficit had been forecast to rise to £58.3bn, from £51.7bn – but borrowing since April is actually below expectations. Newsflash: Britain’s public finances were stronger than expected in August. Britain borrowed just £5.56bn to balance the books last month, the ONS reports. That’s the smallest deficit for any August since the financial crisis struck a decade ago. That’s down from £6.9bn a year ago, and below City forecasts. The public finances were boosted by higher-than-expected tax receipts, in another boost for chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of November’s budget. This means that Britain’s public borrowing this financial year is £200m lower than a year ago, at £28.3bn. Crumbs! Michael O’Leary is telling shareholders that he’s considering “taking back” a week’s holiday from pilots, to fix the rota shortages that forced flight cancellations. If that happens, pilots would receive extra pay for that week, he promises. Newsflash: Ryanair’s boss Michael O’Leary has apologised to shareholders at today’s AGM over the airline’s flight cancellations. It also claims that it will have dealt with 95% of customers affected, by the end of the week. In a statement to the City, Ryanair says: Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary apologised to shareholders, and again to customers, for the cancellation of 2,100 of its over 103,000 flights over a 6 week period in September and October, due to a failure within its pilot rostering function. Ryanair expects by the end of this week to have re-accommodated (or authorised refund requests to) over 95% of the 315,000 customers affected by these cancellations. There’s also a small revolt against the pay received by Ryanair’s top brass, with only 88% of shareholders backing its renumeration report. But O’Leary himself has been reelected with 99.3% of votes. Chairman David Bonderman also survived efforts to unseat him, with 89.1% of shareholders voting for his re-election. Ryanair’s AGM is up and running: Shares in Ryanair have fallen by 1.5% in early trading, extending their recent losses. Our story revealing that pilot are now planning to ‘work to rule’ is fuelling concerns that Ryanair could be forced to cancel even more flights, hitting its profitability. ETX Capital’s Neil Wilson explains: Shares in Ryanair have slipped 10% since it announced plans to cancel flights. The selloff this morning is all about mounting concern over rising cost pressures which are likely to hit margins and profits. Pilots’ rejection of a one-off bonus to work extra hours – a move that management would have liked to pull off in order to lessen the damage being done – has investors worried that not only may more flights be cancelled, but also that Ryanair is walking into a protracted battle with pilots at the very worst moment. At the very least, getting pilots to work more hours might have resulted in the airline not having to cancel any more flights. At present there is a risk that Ryanair will be forced to cancel more flights over the coming weeks. Ryanair shareholders are gathering in Dublin for the budget airline’s AGM, and it could be a very bumpy ride. Investors were already planning to revolt against executive pay at the airline, and vote against and the re-election of chairman David Bonderman. That was before this week’s debacle over staff holidays, which means thousands of passengers are suffering flight cancellations. The FT’s Matthew Vincent jokes: Ryanair could sell tickets for its AGM later today – if it weren’t for the fact that it would probably have to cancel a whole load of them at very short notice owing to a mess-up with its boardroom holiday rota. Sky New’s Darren McCaffrey has landed outside the meeting, but is having trouble getting through security..... Disappointingly, Janet Yellen didn’t give us any new clues yesterday on whether she’ll seek a second term when her current stint as Fed chair ends in February. Donald Trump’s criticism of the Fed’s actions has put Yellen’s future in doubt. Potential replacements include veteran investment banker Gary Cohn (currently director of the National Economic Council), or former Fed governor Kevin Warsh. UBS’s Paul Donovan has a more outlandish suggestion, though.... The Financial Times says the Fed’s decision to start unwinding QE is “historic”: The Times say it’s the “end of an era”. The strength of the US dollar has pulled sterling back down to $1.348, away from last week’s one-year high over $1.36. The euro has also taken a hit, down over one cent to below $1.19. Alex Lydall, Head of Dealing at Foenix Partners, says Janet Yellen’s optimistic tone has helped to drive the dollar up. The greenback rallied overnight as Fed chair Yellen signalled the official end to QE and crucially kept the door ajar for rate hikes this year despite split opinions on inflation trajectory among members. Considering the catastrophes of late in the form of hurricanes, a sanguine approach from the Fed left markets aware a hike in December is still very much on the cards. Acknowledgment, not worry, was the general tone and optimism on the global outlook positions the Fed nicely coming into year-end with the process of balance sheet normalization set to kick-off in October. If you missed last night’s Fed announcement, here’s the latest Dot Plot (in yellow) showing how policymakers expect US interest rates to rise over the next few years. As you can see, they’re a little more dovish about 2018 (as the yellow dots are a little lower than June’s grey ones), and rather divided about where rates will be by 2020. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The US dollar is rallying this morning after the Federal Reserve took the historic step to start unwinding its quantitative easing stimulus package. Investors around the globe are digesting the Fed’s decision, which came alongside a commitment to keep raising interest rates if the US economy continues to strengthen. As we live-blogged last night, Fed chair Janet Yellen fired the starting pistol to unwind QE. From October, the central bank will slowly trim its holdings of US government debt, and mortgage-backed bonds. The decision to start normalising the Fed’s $4.5 trillion balance sheet is another milestone in the recovery from the worst financial crisis in generations. Our US business editor Dominic Rushe explains: The move, announced after a two-day meeting by Fed officials, will start the gradual reduction of the central bank’s $4.5tn portfolio of bonds and other securities, bought to keep interest rates close to zero in an attempt to kickstart the economy. “The basic message here is that US economic performance has been good,” Fed chair Janet Yellen said at a press conference. The Fed’s decision had been made because “we feel the US economy is performing well” but she added the Fed could reverse course if conditions changed. Yellen also said it was a “mystery” why inflation hasn’t reached target, but the Fed remains confident that it will get there in the end. Markets have reacted by driving the US dollar up against other currencies. The greenback has hit a two-month high against the Japanese yen, at ¥112.645. It has also driven to a 10 week high against the Indian rupee. The stronger dollar has also sent gold down to a three-week low. Traders now reckon there is a 64% chance that the US Federal Reserve presses on and raises interest rates in December; potentially hurting American borrowers, and pulling capital out of emerging markets and back into US assets. Stock markets, though, seem to be taking the move in their stride... Also coming up today.... 9am: European Central Bank publishes its monthly bulletin. This may contain clues about how the ECB will slow its own stimulus programme 9.30am BST: The latest UK public finances, which will show how much Britain had to borrow to balance the books in August. Economists expect that borrowing hit £7bn, up from a small surplus in July. 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless figures. Has the recent hurricane season hurt the labor market? We’ll also be watching Ryanair, which faces a bruising encounter with shareholders at its AGM in Dublin this morning. The budget airline faces a deepening crisis over its decision to axe up to 50 flights per day, to allow staff to clear a backlog of holiday. We have learned that Ryanair customers face the threat of a fresh wave of flight cancellations as the airline’s pilots prepare to reject an offer of a cash bonus if they give up days off. The Guardian has obtained a draft letter signed by Ryanair pilots from across Europe, rejecting the offer and warning they will now “work to rule” - refusing to work beyond their basic contractual obligations. Ryanair had told pilots earlier this week that if they declined the £12,000 payment more flights might have to be scrapped. Here’s the full story:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/21/mexico-earthquake-rescuers-work-in-silence-to-pull-children-from-collapsed-school","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T07:26:22Z","webTitle":"Volunteers and soldiers search in silence for children at collapsed Mexico school","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/21/mexico-earthquake-rescuers-work-in-silence-to-pull-children-from-collapsed-school","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/21/mexico-earthquake-rescuers-work-in-silence-to-pull-children-from-collapsed-school","fields":{"headline":"Volunteers and soldiers search in silence for children at collapsed Mexico school","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A hushed silence has kept falling over the volunteers, soldiers and neighbours congregating outside a collapsed school in southern Mexico City, where rescue workers tried to extract students trapped under the rubble. A stern-looking officer in jeans and black vest from Mexico’s federal police would raise his fist high above his head signalling silence on Wednesday to enable rescuers with sensitive microphones to listen for cries from the rubble. But bystanders and rescuers alike burst into applause at around 4.30pm – with one worker on top of a dump truck full of rubble pumping his fist – as the word spread rescuers had removed two girls from the school. The applause was premature, however. Rescuers worked into the night to reach a girl called Frida Sofía, 12, who told them she was in contact five friends on the third floor of the school. They would later discover at 11pm she was not on the floor they had thought. The plight of Frida Sofía captivated Mexicans, who were glued to their TVs as the country’s big broadcasters beamed video live from the school. It came to represent hope and heartache for Mexicans: the hope of pulling a child from the rubble, but also the heartache of rescuers encountering so many close calls. The tragedy at the Enrique Rébsamen school, meanwhile bore witness to the scale of the destruction unleashed by the quake. Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the school on Tuesday night, but there was bad news: 21 children were dead, along with four adults. Another 30 people were missing. At least 237 have been confirmed dead across the country. On Wednesday morning, rumours spread that a teacher and two students had sent text messages from within the rubble, and local television reported that rescuers had spotted a young girl trapped in the building who had moved her hand when they called out to her. Amid the uncertainty, parents clung to hope that their children had survived. “They keep pulling kids out, but we know nothing of my daughter,” Adriana D’Fargo told Reuters. She had been waiting for hours for news of her seven-year- old. But some rescuers were doubtful that any more survivors could emerge from the rubble. “People are saying these children are alive, but that’s unlikely,” said one Mexican government employee working on the rescue. “It’s dangerous in there. We’re advancing little by little, rock by rock.” The Mexico City earthquake struck on 19 September – the same day a huge tremor wrecked the national capital in 1985, claiming an estimated 10,000 lives. “Another lethal 19-S,” noted the newspaper Milenio. “Another cursed S-19,” read the headline on El Economista. Others were more optimistic, with Reforma running the headline: “Solidarity emerges.” After the 1985 quake, Mexican authorities were widely criticised for responding slowly to a national disaster; this time again, many in Mexico City felt that they had been left to fend for themselves. At the noisy police barricade several blocks from the school, a steady stream of volunteers arrived in work clothes and hard hats, carrying picks and shovels and pushing wheelbarrows. Neighbours came carting jugs of water, trays of tortas (thick sandwiches) and boxes of bananas to refresh the rescuers. Physicians showed up, too. All were sent to another collapsed building in the area. Several hundred soldiers and civil protection crew members were already picking through the rubble of the school, along with panicked parents and good Samaritans. “Classes were cancelled so we came to help,” said David Macillas, a student at the Autonomous University of Mexico, who arrived with a full toolkit. The night before, he and a pair of classmates had ventured out to aid in the relief effort – along with thousands of others. “There were already too many people everywhere we went,” Macillas said. The earthquake inflicted a surprising amount of damage in affluent areas, where buildings are usually sturdier. The Enrique Rébsamen school stood in a solidly middle-class area, with tidy streets, boulevards and American chain stores. Buildings in many parts of Mexico City – founded by the Aztecs on a lake in the central part of the country, then plundered by the Spanish in 1521 and subsequently drained – swayed violently during earthquakes. “Mexico City is like jelly,” said Eduardo Corona, a radio operator with civil protection. Building codes and construction practices have improved since 1985, along with earthquake preparedness. There was a drill just two hours before the earthquake rocked the city, though some thought citizens were becoming complacent and have acted nonchalantly. “Maybe the 1985 earthquake was stronger. But this felt even stronger” as the epicentre was closer to Mexico City, said Corona, a musician who moonlights as a civil protection volunteer. “People are a little more prepared. Communications are better. We have more rescue groups. “But this earthquake was so strong. No one believed this could happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/21/nt-failed-boy-who-said-he-sniffed-inhalants-to-stop-hunger-royal-commission-told","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T06:38:26Z","webTitle":"NT failed boy who said he sniffed inhalants to stop hunger, royal commission told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/21/nt-failed-boy-who-said-he-sniffed-inhalants-to-stop-hunger-royal-commission-told","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/21/nt-failed-boy-who-said-he-sniffed-inhalants-to-stop-hunger-royal-commission-told","fields":{"headline":"NT failed boy who said he sniffed inhalants to stop hunger, royal commission told","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Northern Territory child welfare authorities failed to act on pleas to help a neglected young boy who said he sniffed inhalants to stop hunger pains, telling the rehabilitation camp that was caring for him to “stop calling”, the royal commission has been told. The boy later died. The boy’s story is one of a number of “high risk” young people who were “ineffectually managed” between August 2014 and August 2016, described in a submission to the royal commission into the protection and detention of children in the Northern Territory. The Alice Springs-based Bushmob, which has provided therapeutic residential services and drug and alcohol programs since 1999, said the cases illustrated a systemic failure in NT child protection and youth justice, which enabled successive governments to “abrogate responsibility”. The submission, published on Thursday, said the young boy was a “genial child” who related well with staff, who was referred to Bushmob by a court – with the support of his mother – after stealing food from a supermarket. He was known to the Department of Children and Families (DCF) and service providers for his use of volatile substances and there had been previous notifications to the department for physical and medical neglect, it added. After a month he began absconding to seek out volatile substances, resulting in five notifications made to police and DCF. While police responded with assistance no safety response was triggered within DCF. “On one occasion DCF asked Bushmob not to contact them as the child was not their client,” it said. Eventually Bushmob was no longer able to take responsibility for the boy but DCF did not respond when it was told he would be discharged and that Bushmob had concerns about his physical neglect and risk of harm. On several occasions police found the boy “in a state of extreme hunger and physical neglect”, and took him to Bushmob, which provided care outside of its funded duties. DCF was notified each time and each time Bushmob received no feedback. Some time later a Bushmob employee – who was also a relative – learned the boy had been found unresponsive in an Alice Springs car park and died in hospital as a result of sniffing inhalants. Bushmob said that, in its view, the boy’s death was preventable and there were “multiple points” at which DCF could have investigated his circumstances. It suggested short-term protection orders, additional staffing to Bushmob to care for the boy, or family conferences leading to a well-supported placement with another Aboriginal family. Another case – which was also referred to the children’s commissioner – described a young man on the cusp of his 18th birthday who had been in the care of DCF since a young age and, despite his identified substance abuse and anxiety issues, had no apparent mental health assessment on file. “On arrival at Bushmob he had violent outburst, paranoia and psychosis, which indicated it was an obviously inappropriate referral and, due to the risks to the safety of others, there was a planned discharge within a week,” Bushmob said. DCF initially refused to be involved as he had just turned 18 but eventually collected the young man. Bushmob was not told where he was being taken and the next day he returned, intoxicated, after DCF allegedly dropped him off at a backpackers hostel in Alice Springs with $20 for food. Bushmob said the man’s case was an example of DCF making a “significant number” of inappropriate referrals with incomplete, inaccurate or misleading information. It said a significant number of young people had entrenched violence and dangerous behavioural issues that were likely developed or perpetuated by the lack of proper assessment and treatment. Bushmob also described the “stark failure” of the health and education systems in the early life of a young boy from central Australia, who spoke no English, had poor hygiene and dental health, skin sores, mumps and who had had no immunisations. The boy was terrified, the submission said, and wouldn’t allow a GP to treat him. Despite Bushmob’s requirement that participants give informed consent, the boy did not understand how or why he was there and ran away two days later. “The police are looking for him and if they find him again he will presumably go back to Corrections, where he will be detained again.” About 110 young people enter Bushmob’s rehabilitation programs every year with at least one – but usually multiple – orders under youth justice, protection or substance abuse legislation. About 70% are referred by the juvenile justice system. Nearly all are Indigenous and arrive in a traumatised state, presenting with issues including untreated health needs, unrecognised health and behavioural needs, social vulnerabilities, or have come from unsafe environments. Bushmob said the NT’s child protection and justice systems had no single point of accountability or responsibility for high-risk young people, enabling government agencies to “abrogate responsibility by transferring risk onto services such as Bushmob”. Services, including Bushmob, were inadequately and sporadically funded, and never for long periods, it said. It is primarily funded by the health department and the federal Indigenous advancement strategy but the DCF – which is the primary referrer of cases to Bushmob – does not contribute funding, the submission said. It recommended juvenile justice reform, including an end to short-term camps and establishing therapeutic residential placements as a preferred option, creating a single administration point for high risk young people and better connecting children with their families. The royal commission has finished its 10-month run of public hearings examining the child protection and juvenile justice sectors, and is now preparing its final report. It recently received an extension on its reporting date, which has been pushed to November.

After we asked readers to submit misleading survey material, Guardian Australia has continued to receive complaints of unauthorised material, even after the safeguards law came into force on 14 September. These ranged from leaflets that identify they are from the Coalition for Marriage but lack further details, to anonymous leaflets warning that marriage equality will lead to gender fluidity and “child abuse” such as hormone therapy, and a Facebook post urging a no vote depicting Christ in chains. Electoral experts, including Prof Graeme Orr, from the University of Queensland, and a former Australian Electoral Commission official, Michael Maley, have warned that authorisation provisions may be difficult to enforce unless people are caught distributing anonymous so-called “shit sheets”. The Coalition for Marriage “3 ways gay marriage will affect your family” leaflet was distributed with other unaddressed junk mail in Forestville, South Australia, at the weekend. It claims marriage equality will lead to “radical gay sex education”, “weaponise federal and state anti-discrimination law” and prevent churches and schools from teaching their beliefs. The new law requires paid advertisements, printed material and material intended to affect whether a person provides a response to the survey or the content of the response to be authorised. Breach of the provision can lead to a “civil penalty” of up to $25,200. The leaflet includes the URL of the Coalition for Marriage website, which says it is authorised by “L Shelton” and includes a postal address, details Orr said should be disclosed on the leaflet itself if sent after the new law came into force. The Coalition for Marriage makes the leaflet files available on its website for download and distribution by anyone. While the English-language pamphlets now have authorisation details on them, foreign-language pamphlets do not. Guardian Australia contacted the Coalition for Marriage and the Australian Christian lobby for comment. Guardian readers have reported other material with no authorisation details. One reader submitted a photo of a leaflet titled “10 reasons to vote no in the marriage plebiscite”, and said it had been received some time between 19 and 22 September. The leaflet said only that it was “sent to you by a member of the deeply concerned and silenced majority”. The leaflet claims marriage equality will lead to “a raft of gender fluidity laws that will impact the opinions we are permitted to hold, what we say and what we do, and what schools must teach (eg radical queer theory via Safe Schools propaganda)”. The issue is not limited to printed material. Guardian Australia has been sent details of Facebook ads in the form of “sponsored posts” that do not have any authorisation, including some that link to homophobic material which we have chosen not to publish. One post from the Facebook page titled This Is Christian Australia was originally posted on 27 August but was promoted as a sponsored post as recently as Thursday, according to one reader who saw the post in their feed. “When you are on your knees begging for mercy; the Lord will reply ‘but you voted for this’,” it warns. “Vote no for gay marriage and worship the Lord to bless your family.” Neither the post nor the Facebook page contains any details on who might have authorised the ad. The AEC commissioner, Tom Rogers, told a Senate committee on Friday the authorisation requirement was not retrospective, meaning it did not apply to material published before the law. He said social media posts may need to be authorised where “further sharing is paid for” after 14 September. The co-chair of the Equality Campaign, Anna Brown, said it was “deeply concerned about the increasing amount of unauthorised anti-LGBTI no material and it’s content”. “These materials are impacting on LGBTI people, their friends and families. All Australians would find this unacceptable,” she said, citing a 40% increase in demand for helplines for LGBTI people in the Past few weeks. The Equality Campaign has already complained to the AEC about an unauthorised robocall it believes is push-polling because it claims same-sex marriage will lead to “radical gay sex education”. The Anglican dean of Darwin has complained to the AEC about unauthorised anti-marriage equality emails “full of homophobic dog whistles”. Maley said where authorisations were left off inadvertently, the issue could be rectified easily after a complaint to the AEC. But Orr said enforcement of authorisation laws for anonymous material had always been difficult. “If someone is willing to put out anonymous material they are not going to put the name or the printer on it or they will put a false name,” Orr said. “Short of CCTV, a tipoff dobbing them in or catching them in the act distributing it, it’s very difficult to enforce.” Orr noted the safeguard law set a three-month time limit on all prosecutions, meaning aggrieved campaign organisations, the AEC and police would have until mid-February to investigate and prosecute alleged breaches. Orr said it could take “many months ... to track down some of the more egregious material” using techniques including cyber forensics to probe the IP addresses hosting websites. But if the survey material was considered electoral material the AEC could still have jurisdiction even after the limitation period, he said. Maley said “nasty” material circulated in letter boxes was “deliberately anonymous … because it’s stuff people are ashamed to put their names to”. “You can go to authorities with the piece of paper and the lack of authorisation is obvious, but not who has distributed it. If people want to do very dirty stuff, particularly in hard copy, there is very little you can do unless you catch them in the act.” We will continue to monitor campaign material throughout the survey period.

Top-down measures don’t work","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In the 1980s I led a delegation from the Federation of Land Councils to the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations, chaired by Erica-Irene Daes. The working group’s task was to establish the foundations for an international human rights instrument which would set a global standard for the protection of Indigenous rights. In 2007, after more than 20 years of international consultations and discussion with Indigenous nations, the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People was adopted by the UN general assembly. In recognising the “urgent need to respect and promote the inherent rights of Indigenous peoples”, the declaration was brought into existence to enshrine rights that “constitute the minimum standards for the survival, dignity, and wellbeing of the Indigenous peoples of the world.” While non-binding, the declaration benchmarks the standards of global respect and efforts by nation states to help reduce levels of disadvantage and discrimination experienced by many of the world’s 370 million Indigenous people. There are 46 articles listed in the declaration, which provide clear guidance for advancing reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in the light of their tangled and often unsatisfactory histories. The two elements I see as most pertinent to the Australian reconciliation journey are the right to self-determination and the right to free, prior and informed consent (Article 4 and 19). We should recall that in the development stages of the declaration the Australian government was supportive – the minister for Aboriginal affairs himself, Robert Tickner, attended the working sessions on several occasions. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their organisations were leaders in the process of crafting the declaration and were diligent participants, offering their insights. But despite the hard work and dedicated commitment, in a shameful episode, Australia was one of only four countries who refused to ratify the declaration, claiming it was incompatible with our national laws. The prime minister of the time, John Howard, stated: “We do not support the notion that you should have customary law taking priority over the general law of the country.” But this was a misrepresentation. This idea that the declaration could cause division within our country ran contrary to article 46 which states: Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, people, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act contrary to the Charter of the United Nations or construed as authorizing or encouraging any action which would dismember or impair totally or in part, the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States. Despite this, Howard defended Australia’s decision not to sign, boasting: “It wasn’t difficult at all, because it is wrong to support something that argues the case of separate development inside one country.” If I recall the political climate of Indigenous Affairs at the time, it is no surprise the government took issue with Australia in signing the declaration. In 2007, the federal government suspended the Racial Discrimination Act in order to roll out theintervention in the Northern Territory. The intervention under the Howard government disrespected the collective and individual rights of Indigenous people; it sought to ensure that their ability to pursue their own development was stripped; it discriminated on the basis of race and was imposed without any form of consultation with the Aboriginal communities involved. The international declaration posed a threat to a coercive government policy. It was not until 2009 that Australia formally adopted the declaration under the Rudd Labor government. Because of the previous government’s opposition, Australia could not become a signatory, but the Labor government stated their intention to reset relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians and to build trust in order to work together to overcome past trauma and build a more reconciled future. When it was endorsed by Indigenous affairs minister Jenny Macklin, my brother Mick Dodson spoke at the ceremony at parliament house: “Human rights do not dispossess people, human rights do not marginalise people and human rights do not cause the gaps in life expectancy. It is the denial of human rights that is the large contributor to these things. The value of human rights is not in their existence it is in their implementation. That is the challenge for the world with this declaration. The standards have been set. It is up to us to meet them.” Eight years on from endorsing the declaration, Australia too often fails to meet the standards. In September the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Victoria Tauli-Corpuz released her report on Australia’s treatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The report describes Australia’s lack of progress on Closing the Gap as “woefully inadequate” and states the policies of the Australian government “do not duly respect the rights to self-determination and effective participation” of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. For too long, Australia’s Indigenous peoples have been on the receiving end of policies and programs dreamed up by authorities who do not themselves have to suffer the consequences of their decisions. Increasingly, however, there is clear evidence that the mistakes of the past are being repeated, that the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous Australians is not being met and that policies are continuing to be imposed that have not properly engaged Indigenous people in design or implementation. Cashless debit card Today, compulsory income management is being applied by the Turnbull government in the form of the cashless debit card. It applies to 80% of welfare and payments and can be used anywhere that other debit cards can be used. According to the government, the cashless debit card is a success. A report by Orima to the federal government claims 23% of participants said it made their lives better. This is promising. However, a less publicised finding is that 32% say it made their lives worse and 42% said it made no change. In moving forwards we need to make sure the information base is robust and the data is carefully analysed. I am told by people in my region that it is impossible to use the card to go to the local footy, to buy school lunches, purchase things second hand, or send gifts as money. This is a concern that must be addressed by the government as it implements the scheme. I recognise that there are some Australian communities who may choose to trial the cashless card but this must be on the basis of their free, prior, informed consent. And the card alone will never be a solution to their community problems. The wrap around support services must be community designed, agreed upon and resourced. When making policies, laws or undertaking activities that affect Indigenous peoples, governments should listen to the people and negotiate to obtain their consent. Malcolm Turnbull has called the cashless welfare card “an act of practical love”. Any such act requires informed agreement. I am appalled by the domestic violence in our communities and the abuse of our children. I know that communities want help in addressing alcohol abuse and violence. But there is a nexus between the situation these communities find themselves in and the policies imposed upon them by governments – policies grounded in a philosophy of institutional control. Top-down measures which seek to address the behaviour of people who are vulnerable breeds a situation of hopelessness, dependency, and destabilisation in communities. There are many people living in communities with great ideas about how to address the issues. But they are not listened to. Indigenous communities need and want to be part of the solution. We need support services that are community generated, implemented and properly resourced. Community Development Program Another program which demonstrates the government’s disregard for the views of Indigenous people and our right to be listened to is the imposition of the community development program (CDP). This program was sold to Aboriginal people in remote communities as a work for the dole scheme similar to the former community development employment program. But the government did not explain that the new program lacks community control and is excessively punitive. Labor secured an inquiry into the community development program in March after communities across the Northern Territory and Western Australia told us that this system leaves people poorer, struggling to feed their families and in a situation of powerlessness. It was a proud moment in 2009 when under prime minister Rudd, Australia formally endorsed the UN Declaration of Indigenous Peoples – but eight years on, Australia still needs to work harder to consistently respect and promote the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the eyes of the international community and in the eyes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples themselves. The domestication of the declaration into Australian law would give expression to the sincerity of Australia’s commitment to resetting the relationship with Indigenous people. The call at Uluru for a Makarrata commission to deal with truth-telling and agreement making would also be advanced by the implementation of the declaration into domestic law. Eight years on from endorsing the declaration, there is only procrastination from government, evident in its lack of commitment to respond to the calls of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Implementing the declaration is a necessary pre-condition for governments to close the gap of Indigenous disadvantage and to reset relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians and to build trust in order to work together to overcome past trauma and build a more reconciled future. Today, our governments, both federal and state, have much to do to meet the international standards for the protection of Indigenous rights.

It is unclear if the two things are related. Police confirmed that officers were at a premises in Melbourne Docklands conducting a “safety check”. AFL spokesman Patrick Keane tweeted that AFL House – the sport’s headquarters – had been evacuated after a “hoax threat” was phoned into the building on Thursday morning. “All staff were removed while police checks proceed,” he wrote. The new “yes” logo was the subject of a backlash from talkback hosts in Melbourne and the Carlton football club released a statement saying it did “not intend to campaign on the issue”. The logo was taken down at the end of the day on Wednesday but the AFL denied it was because of any threat of vandalism. The AFL chief executive, Gillon McLachlan, said that it was important the organisation made a “strong statement” on the issue. “This is an issue that means a lot to many of our players, many of my employees and a lot of people in the community,” he told Fox Footy on Tuesday night. “It’s incumbent on us to have a view. It’s also, it’s incumbent on us not to lecture people ... but say ‘this is who we are as a brand’.” Numerous sporting organisations – including the ARU, the NRL, Cricket Australia and Football Federation Australia – have also declared their support for a yes vote in the Australian Bureau of Statistics postal survey."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/24/on-body-and-soul-review-rule-breaking-romance-abbatoir","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T06:59:38Z","webTitle":"On Body and Soul review – rule-breaking romance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/24/on-body-and-soul-review-rule-breaking-romance-abbatoir","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/24/on-body-and-soul-review-rule-breaking-romance-abbatoir","fields":{"headline":"On Body and Soul review – rule-breaking romance","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Cinema might be guilty of creating many of the cliches of romance, but, occasionally at least, it also destroys them. And this year brings two particularly strong examples of the latter. On Body and Soul, the Berlin Golden Bear-winning account of two outcasts who find love in a Hungarian abattoir, might not have the showy impact of Guillermo Del Toro’s forthcoming The Shape of Water (mute cleaner hooks up with fish monster) but the pictures share two things. Both combine the fantastic and idiosyncratic to beguiling effect; both rewrite the rules that govern who is deemed worthy of love in the movies. The two main characters in On Body and Soul are Endre (Géza Morcsányi), the reserved manager of a slaughterhouse who hides his emotions along with his useless left arm, and Maria (Alexandra Borbély), the new quality-control manager at the plant. It’s never explained, but Maria seems to be on the autistic spectrum. She struggles with the banal to-and-fro of social interaction and recoils from physical contact. But at night, she and Endre share the same dreams – a mystical but matter-of-fact connection that transforms both into deer in a sparkling winter woodland. The film gets much of its considerable impact from director Ildikó Enyedi’s elegant juxtapositions. The obscene, intimate details of animal butchery against the delicate suspense of the dream sequences; the lovely crystalline score that sounds like melting icicles against the brutal sound design in the abattoir; the palette of frosted pastels for day, which warms to something more sensual and inviting at night. It’s an exquisitely offbeat love story and I fell headlong for its angular, awkward charm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/20/jake-lamotta-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T16:13:12Z","webTitle":"Jake LaMotta obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/20/jake-lamotta-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/20/jake-lamotta-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Jake LaMotta obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jake LaMotta, who has died aged 95, is generally acknowledged as one of the toughest men to have entered a professional boxing ring – a world middleweight champion best remembered for having fought the great Sugar Ray Robinson on six occasions. Brought up in poverty, a teenage hoodlum, married six times, imprisoned for pimping, a confessed rapist and sometime actor and standup comedian, LaMotta led a life that reads like a film script and was the basis for the greatest boxing movie of all time, Martin Scorsese’s Raging Bull (1980). Robert De Niro won an Oscar for his portrayal of the violent, paranoid, wife-beating LaMotta, who had nevertheless endeared himself to the American public at a time when boxing was a hugely popular spectator sport, commanding enormous newspaper coverage, with his almost unbelievable feats of bravery within the ring. The film was based on LaMotta’s memoirs, Raging Bull: My Story (1970), co-written with Joseph Carter and Peter Savage, and republished on several occasions. LaMotta would boast, “no son-of-a-bitch ever knocked me off my feet” – not strictly true as he was floored in one of his last fights, by Danny Nardico in 1952. He was a fine example of the sort of fighter prepared to absorb numerous punches to land more telling blows of his own. Born Giacobbe LaMotta in the Bronx neighbourhood of New York, he had an impoverished childhood and told of how his father – a Sicilian by birth and the only man he feared, owing to the regular beatings – would force him into fights with other children. The loose change thrown into the ring by the adult spectators helped to pay the family’s rent. Living a feral life and frequently in trouble with the law, he spent time in the notorious Coxsackie Reformatory for delinquent youths after being convicted of attempted burglary. But he was scarred for many years by another incident in which he believed he had beaten to death a man he had mugged. LaMotta had followed Harry Gordon, a neighbourhood bookie, whom he knew, as he carried his day’s takings, and attacked him with a piece of lead piping. The subsequent beating was so savage that he left the man for dead before escaping with a wallet full of cash. It was only years later, when “the ghost” – as LaMotta described him – turned up in his dressing room, still bearing the scars of the attack, to offer his congratulations after LaMotta had won the world middleweight title in 1949 from France’s Marcel Cerdan, that “the Bronx bull” realised he was not a murderer after all. It was a crime to which LaMotta confessed in his memoirs, published after the bookie – who never knew the identity of his assailant – had died. The fighter also admitted to having raped a woman as well as beating the women he married. He spoke of one particular attack on his second wife, Vicki, attempting to explain his behaviour: “If you had a girl and she was beautiful and other people were trying to invite her out and seduce her, wouldn’t you get angry? I saw these jerks and schmucks coming out with lines and it bothered me. But I never really and truly hit my wives. If I had hit them properly, they would be dead.” LaMotta could turn on the charm when it suited, and had a comedian’s sense of timing with his anecdotes and one-liners, which continued to earn him a living several decades after the paid fighting had ended. His movie credits included a bit-part in The Hustler (1961), starring Paul Newman, along with a cameo with another former boxer, Rocky Graziano, in the Sophia Loren film Firepower (1979). Bigger roles included low-budget films such as Chivato (1961) and House in Naples (1965), and he later cashed in on his Raging Bull success with a bigger part in Hangmen (1987). A bit-part followed in Mob War (1989). He periodically owned bars and nightclubs and was much in demand after the release of Raging Bull, for which he personally tutored De Niro, and was still touring autograph ceremonies and attending the annual Boxing Hall of Fame celebration in Canastota, New York, until fairly recently. LaMotta turned professional in 1941, quickly becoming a crowd favourite because of his style of pressure fighting. His great rivalry with Robinson – regarded by many as the best pound-for-pound fighter of all time – began the following year, when Robinson won a 10-round points decision at Madison Square Garden, New York. In 1943, in Detroit, LaMotta would become the first man to defeat Robinson when he knocked him through the ropes in the eighth round. Robinson was saved by the bell, but was outpointed. The fighter had beaten the boxer and the crowds begged for more. Although it seems incredible in the modern era, the rematch took place in Detroit only three weeks later. This time, Robinson got the judges’ verdicts, despite having been put on the canvas once more in a fierce battle. They would fight twice more in 1945, with Robinson taking a unanimous decision in New York and then being awarded a fiercely disputed split decision in Chicago. The pair would not face one another again until six years later, this time for a world championship. LaMotta went on to win the undisputed world middleweight title four years later. But the circumstances of the Bronx bull getting his title shot resulted in him being suspended from boxing and having his purse withheld in 1947 by the New York State Athletic Commission after he lost a fight that he would later confess had been rigged by the mafia. In an era when the mob effectively controlled boxing, LaMotta had been told that to get his chance at the title, he had no alternative other than to lose his contest against Billy Fox, as mob figures demanded. The fight – such as it was – ended in the fourth round with LaMotta standing still, allowing Fox to hit him at will. In 1961, he testified to a senate committee investigating mafia involvement in boxing, saying he had lost deliberately. He subsequently wrote: “By the fourth round, if there was anyone in Madison Square Garden who didn’t know what was going on, he must have been dead drunk.” LaMotta made two successful world title defences before losing in 1951 to Robinson in what has become known as the St Valentine’s Day Massacre, held at the Chicago Stadium. LaMotta’s strength gave him the lead after eight rounds, but he was flagging by the 11th when a last despairing barrage of punches failed to stop “the Sugarman”. Hammered mercilessly in the 12th, LaMotta swore and shouted: “You can’t do it, you can’t put me on the deck.” Although he was stopped in the next round, the crowd saluted his bravery and never forgot. He continued to fight for a further three years but with patchy results, having taken to drink. Out of a total of 106 professional bouts, he won 83 (30 of them by knockout) and lost 19, with four draws. Two sons, Jake Jr and Joseph, predeceased him. LaMotta is survived by his fiancee, Denise Baker, and by four daughters, Jacklyn, Christi, Elisa and Mia. • Giacobbe “Jake” LaMotta, boxer, born 10 July 1922; died 19 September 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2017/sep/22/why-are-comic-cons-no-longer-about-comics","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T06:00:39Z","webTitle":"Why are comic cons no longer about comics?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/22/why-are-comic-cons-no-longer-about-comics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/22/why-are-comic-cons-no-longer-about-comics","fields":{"headline":"Why are comic cons no longer about comics?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On the website of a recent comic con in Lancashire, the big draws were: a puppeteer who worked on Star Wars and The Dark Crystal; an actor who was in Space: 1999 and played the Stormtrooper in Star Wars who said: “These aren’t the droids we’re looking for”; a child actor who appeared in Game of Thrones. Oh, and Knight Rider’s car was there, as was The Simpsons school bus and Luke Skywalker’s Land Speeder. There was a gaming area. All of which, I hasten to add, sounds absolutely brilliant to a geek like me. And yet … this was a comic con, right? What became of the comics? I find myself annoyed by the ever-growing number of comic cons that don’t seem to be about comics at all. The five comic creators named on the aforementioned con’s website were tucked away at the bottom: two from the Beano, one at Marvel, a Jack Kirby expert and the fifth who was more a fantasy illustrator than a comics artist. Again, all great – but isn’t it a bit disingenuous to continue to call these events comic cons? We can probably blame San Diego for all this. The godfather of comic cons began life in 1970 and was then entirely devoted to comics, thus earning its name. Actually, it was called the Golden State Comic Minicon back then. But over the years it has morphed into a glossy, media-led event where we get first looks at huge movies and TV companies announce new series. It’s very possible now to spend a day at San Diego Comic Con without getting so much as a sniff of an actual comic. The myriad events around the world that use “comic con” as a term for “loads of cool geeky stuff and autographs at a tenner a time from some guy who once made some coffee for the cast of the Tomorrow People” are really just taking their lead from San Diego – and why wouldn’t they? It works for them, it works for the people who go there and get to sit in an old Ford Cortina pimped to look like Zebra Three from Starsky and Hutch. It’s at times like this I thank Galactus above for Thought Bubble, a Leeds-based festival, now in it’s 11th year that will devote this coming weekend fully to comics. Yes, you’ll see the odd Ghostbuster or Terminator cosplayer, but Thought Bubble – along with the Lakes international comic art festival, which takes over Kendal next month – is one of the few events that not only focuses on, but joyously celebrates the form. And they don’t stint on guests. Heading in from the US this year is Gerard Way, former frontman of alternative rock band My Chemical Romance and current curator of DC comics’ Young Animal imprint, who now writes Doom Patrol. He’s backed up by a veritable who’s who of international comic talent: Brian K Vaughan, Sara Pichelli, Jody Houser, Hannah Berry, Becky Cloonan, Paul Cornell, Andy Diggle, Duncan Fegredo … Suffice to say, if you’re into comics of any kind, there’ll be someone you’d like at Thought Bubble this year. Thought Bubble is the brainchild of Lisa Wood, an artist of some renown under the pen name Tula Lotay, who decided a decade ago to create the kind of event she’d like to attend – one focused on artists, writers and readers. “I always think it’s really bizarre that you have all these events around the country called comic cons when they really don’t have much to do with comics,” says Wood. “People do enjoy them, and that’s great. But … I want to see writers and artists, I want to see the creators that help the medium flourish. We’ve always wanted to celebrate comics in their purest form.” This year, the biggest test for Lotay’s “pure and simple” ethos will be Way, with his hinterland in music. But as Wood says, his presence has the potential to draw newcomers to comics: “He’ll pull in a whole new audience for us … But if these people come, and maybe pick up the comics he’s involved in, then perhaps investigate others as a result, that’s what we’re all about – bringing along the next generation of comics readers, to help the medium survive and thrive.” All without a 10-quid-a-go Batmobile in sight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/20/life-threatening-winds-and-floods-hit-puerto-rico-as-maria-makes-landfall","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T06:58:58Z","webTitle":"Hurricane Maria leaves Puerto Rico in total blackout as storm batters island","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/20/life-threatening-winds-and-floods-hit-puerto-rico-as-maria-makes-landfall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/20/life-threatening-winds-and-floods-hit-puerto-rico-as-maria-makes-landfall","fields":{"headline":"Hurricane Maria leaves Puerto Rico in total blackout as storm batters island","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Puerto Rico is without electricity, officials have said, after Hurricane Maria’s strong winds and flooding knocked out the US territory’s power service. Island residents endured a day of punishing winds and life-threatening flooding on Wednesday from the category 4 storm, which was the third hurricane to pummel the Caribbean in as many weeks. Maria, now a category 3 storm with winds of 115 mph, is currently lashing the Dominican Republic as is it passes to its north and is expected to move near the Turks and Caicos later on Thursday. It previously hit the islands of Dominica, Guadeloupe and the US territory of St Croix, where Donald Trump has declared a major disaster. “Once we’re able to go outside, we’re going to find our island destroyed,” warned Abner Gomez, Puerto Rico’s emergency management director. “The information we have received is not encouraging.” The storm made landfall early on Wednesday morning with winds of 155mph (250kph). Residents said roofs were torn off buildings and doors flew off their hinges. Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rossello, ordered a curfew every night until Saturday, from 6pm until 6am, saying the move was essential to maintain order. “Remain in safe places,” Rosello said. Emergency personnel, health workers and reporters are exempt. Widespread flooding affected the capital, San Juan, and a flash-flood warning was declared in central Puerto Rico, where river levels are at a record high. People took cover in stairwells, bathrooms and closets as trees and communication towers were knocked down in the storm. Felix Delgado, mayor of the northern coastal city of Catano, told the Associated Press that 80% of the 454 homes in a neighborhood known as Juana Matos were destroyed. “Months and months and months and months are going to pass before we can recover from this,” he said. Mike Brennan, a senior hurricane specialist at the NHC, said Maria would remain “a major, very dangerous hurricane” for the next couple of days and that rainfall would be a problem even after the center of the hurricane moved away from the island. Federal officials were reporting that all energy customers in Puerto Rico had been left without power late on Wednesday afternoon, a spokesperson for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) told the Guardian. The executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration (PRFAA), Carlos Mercader, said there were 13,000 evacuees in Puerto Rico’s shelters. This includes people who evacuated from other islands during Hurricane Irma. In a meeting broadcast online on Wednesday morning, Mercader warned power was expected to shut down. Because of this, he said, his administration was prioritizing getting generators to help power hospitals, schools, the water system and flood pumps. “In order to help with the floodings, we need electricity,” he said. Earlier on Wednesday, Rossello warned the country would lose “a lot of infrastructure”. Homes built after 2011 – when the island, a US territory, introduced newer construction codes – could survive the winds but those in flood-prone areas “have no chance”, he said. Maria is the first category 4 hurricane to hit Puerto Rico since 1932. As Puerto Rico residents braced for the storm on Tuesday, Trump sent a message of support on Twitter: “Puerto Rico being hit hard by new monster Hurricane,” he said. “Be careful, our hearts are with you – will be there to help!” Residents of the British Virgin Islands told the Guardian that it was hard to tell how badly the islands had been hit because the damage inflicted by Hurricane Irma was so fresh. Communication with the territory remained patchy, and a strict curfew was being enforced. The hurricane was still category 5 early Wednesday morning when it pummeled St Croix, the largest and southernmost of the US Virgin Islands, and Guadeloupe, where at least one person died and about 40% of homes were without power in the aftermath of the storm. There were “multiple casualties” on Dominica, the first island struck by Maria, according to the Organisation of the Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), and at least 90% of buildings were damaged. The storm took out all of the island’s communication systems, triggered landslides and blocked roads, OECS said. Communications with the island were severely disrupted and inhabitants were only able to make contact with the outside world using shortwave radios. At least seven people died there, according to Hartley Henry, a chief aid to the prime minister, Roosevelt Skerrit. Henry gave an update on the impact of the hurricane after speaking to Skerrit, who he said expected the death toll to increase as they received more information from rural communities. Henry said: “The country is in a daze – no electricity, no running water – as a result of uprooted pipes in most communities and definitely to landline or cellphone services on island, and that will be for quite a while.” If you want to check on a Puerto Rico resident, you can reach Puerto Rico’s Federal Affairs Administration at 1-202-778-0710."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/20/theresa-may-to-fly-boris-johnson-back-early-from-us-to-discuss-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T21:30:34Z","webTitle":"Theresa May to fly Boris Johnson back early from US to discuss Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/20/theresa-may-to-fly-boris-johnson-back-early-from-us-to-discuss-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/20/theresa-may-to-fly-boris-johnson-back-early-from-us-to-discuss-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May to fly Boris Johnson back early from US to discuss Brexit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May will seek to heal the rifts in her cabinet and bind them into backing her over Brexit on Thursday, after Boris Johnson changed his plans in order to fly back to London at her side. The prime minister is convening a cabinet meeting on Thursday where she is expected to meet little open resistance to the thrust of a closely-guarded speech she will deliver in Florence on Friday, but differences remain about how close Britain’s future relationship with the EU should be. May appears to have decided to make a direct pitch to EU leaders, some of whom she met on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York, amid frustration over the lack of progress in talks between Brexit secretary, David Davis, and the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Davis and Barnier resume negotiations in Brussels next week, but Donald Tusk, president of the EU Council, will travel to London to discuss Brexit directly with May in Downing Street. Speaking to journalists, May said, “the negotiations are structured within the European Union: so of course the council has delegated a mandate to the commission, the commission has appointed Michel Barnier. But the decision will always be one that is taken by leaders.” The prime minister’s trip to New York was overshadowed by reports that Johnson could be close to resigning, in a split over the speech May will deliver in Florence on Friday. But after the foreign secretary publicly backed away from the idea, her spokesman announced that he was expected to fly back to London alongside the prime minister on her RAF Voyager plane, to attend Thursday’s specially-convened meeting of the cabinet. “Programmes permitting, the foreign secretary is flying back with us tonight,” May’s spokesman said, briefing journalists in New York. Johnson had been due to host an event on Somalia on Friday, on the sidelines of the general assembly. Whitehall sources insisted May had not changed her speech since the foreign secretary’s article. However, backbenchers wanting a soft Brexit said they feared the prime minister would now be less bold. They argued that the past year had convinced the government of the need for compromise. “Friday would’ve been opportunity to lay down sensible options but I can’t see that now,” said one MP. “It should be designed to kickstart negotiations. But if it is a fudge it won’t have any impact at all.” One politician said even “supportive folk” thought Johnson had gone too far. May’s former chief of staff added to the sense of disunity in cabinet with a column in the Telegraph. Nick Timothy claimed that the chancellor, Philip Hammond, was “on manoeuvres,” and the Treasury was refusing to see the positives in Brexit. The prime minister will be flanked by Johnson and Hammond, at the speech in Florence, and hopes to persuade her fellow European Union leaders to allow Brexit talks to move beyond withdrawal issues, to Britain’s future relationship with the rest of the EU, when they meet in October. Her speech is being read across government as a signal that she will take more direct control of the Brexit process. It comes after chief negotiator Ollie Robbins was moved from the Brexit department to the Cabinet Office to report directly to May. As well as speculating about Britain’s future relationship with the EU, the foreign secretary’s 4000 word Daily Telegraph article also resurrected the claim that up to £350m a week could be diverted to the NHS after Brexit, sparking a row with the chief statistician, Sir David Norgrove. The former international aid secretary, Andrew Mitchell, said the foreign secretary’s intervention would not be welcomed by those carrying out the talks with EU officials. “The most important thing is for the Brexit negotiator to be given the space to achieve the best possible deal for Britain. In these circumstances senior colleagues delivering advice through a megaphone is bound to be unhelpful,” he said. Sources suggested that Johnson was backed up by Vote Leave colleagues and had planned to deliver a major speech last Monday with Downing Street agreeing in principle with him layout out an optimistic take on Britain’s future outside the EU. Gisela Stuart, who chaired Vote Leave, suggested there were worries among Brexit campaigners. “Theresa May’s speech on Friday is important and it is important that whoever looks at this is clear that she intends to implement the outcome of the referendum.” She highlighted the benefits of the Canada-EU trade deal, CETA saying it showed Canada could trade and retain sovereignty. Some Brexiteers regard a “CETA-plus” model as a good template for the UK. Anne Marie Trevalyan, a Tory MP on the European Research Group of MPs desperate to deliver Brexit, said: “I’m looking forward to hearing [the speech]. This is another marker to progress the talks. There have been a lot of discussions over summer and more progress behind the scenes than they would admit to publicly.” She said trade was important both for Britain and the EU27. Asked about a story in the Financial Times that May is preparing to offer to pay up to €20bn (£17.67bn) into the EU budget during a transition period, to secure continued access to the single market and customs union, the spokesman said: “There has been much speculation in advance of this speech and I’m sure there will be much more, but it’s just that.” Johnson was understood to be concerned about aspects of a draft of the speech, and had the backing of some of his cabinet colleagues in rejecting the idea that contributions into the EU budget could continue after a transitional period. Asked whether Johnson had threatened to resign after the furore over his article, the spokesman said: “The prime minister has been clear that they’re all working together and they’re all heading in the same direction.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/20/parsons-green-tube-bombing-arrests-five-now-held","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T06:33:36Z","webTitle":"London tube bombing arrests: five now held","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/20/parsons-green-tube-bombing-arrests-five-now-held","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/20/parsons-green-tube-bombing-arrests-five-now-held","fields":{"headline":"Police arrest sixth suspect over Parsons Green tube bombing","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Police investigating the attempted bombing of a London tube train last Friday have made a sixth arrest. A 17-year-old boy was arrested under the Terrorism Act shortly after midnight on Thursday morning in Thornton Heath, south London, the Metropolitan police said. His home has been cordoned off as police search the property. The latest raid came after a a 25-year-old was arrested in a Newport street on Tuesday night, and two other men, aged 30 and 48, were detained on Wednesday following a pre-dawn raid on a house in the city. Detectives in London continued to question Yahyah Farroukh, a Syrian student, aged 21, who was arrested in west London on Saturday night, and an 18-year-old detained in Dover as he attempted to board a ferry to France on Saturday morning. All of the five men, and the 17-year-old boy were being detained at a police station in south London, Scotland Yard said. Speaking after the south Wales arrests, Commander Dean Haydon, head of Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command, said: “This continues to be a fast-moving investigation. A significant amount of activity has taken place since the attack on Friday. We now have five men in custody and searches are continuing at four addresses.” A witness to the arrest on Tuesday night described how policepicked up the suspect as he walked along the street. Sully Ali, 19, who lives nearby, said: “A big van pulled up and six officers got out and jumped this guy. There were two armed officers there, they didn’t have their guns pointed at him but they had them on show. The guy was smiling. I didn’t hear him saying anything or the police saying anything to him.” He said he recognised the arresting officers as Metropolitan police. The suspect was arrested and handcuffed by plain clothes officers, he said. Residents said the arrested man had lived in the area for many years; he had worked as a painter and decorator, and attended local mosques. “He was a nice guy, everybody knew him,” one man said. “He was a student here and he worked as a painter and decorator.” One woman said: “He did some painting on our house about two years ago. He was a nice guy, he was very softly spoken. He used to condemn terrorism in front of my husband – my husband would condemn terrorism and he would agree with him. I know he is a Muslim but I don’t know what mosque he went to. Muslims in this area are totally shocked, we condemn terrorism totally and we totally condemn what happened in London.” Shortly after the arrest, police sealed off Jeffrey Street on the east side of the city and began to search a terrace house in the street. Neighbours said the occupant was a devout Muslim who prayed several times a day. They described him as quiet and friendly. Abid Ali, a shopkeeper with a store in the street, said: “He was a neighbour and a customer. He called in and always had a chat. He’d lived next to us for a couple of years but he came originally from Iraq about five years ago. He’s a hard-working guy. It was a real shock to us all when he was arrested. We don’t know anything about what he was meant to be doing. He lived in the house with a couple of friends and there was always a lot of coming and going. But it was just normal to us. He didn’t seem like an extremist or anything like that.” Neighbours who saw the raid a few hours later on the house in West Street, on the other side of the River Usk and close to the city centre, said they saw a man being led out in handcuffs a short while later. One said: “It was crazy, there were loads of police cars here and they all arrived at the same time. About 15 officers went into the house. The first guy was taken out in handcuffs; he was wearing a blue hoodie and covering his face. Officers have been coming out with bags ever since.” Neighbours there said the property housed asylum seekers. They said there were about five men of “Middle Eastern appearance” living there. One neighbour said: “Five of them lived there. All men. They were friendly. Two of the guys moved in recently.” In December 2015, Siful Haque Sujan, a Bangladeshi man who had run a computer business in Newport, was killed in a US drone strike in Syria. The Pentagon said he had been a senior figure in Islamic State. Three months earlier Reyaad Khan, 21, from Cardiff, 14 miles to the west, had been killed in an RAF drone strike. Two brothers from Cardiff, Aseel and Nasser Muthana, went to join Isis. Mohammad Asghar, a Welsh assembly member, said the arrests had frightened residents. “Radicalisation is a growing problem in Wales, but it is reassuring that our intelligence services are able to act so quickly to apprehend suspects. Whilst we mustn’t jump to any conclusions, we need to have an open and honest conversation about radicalisation in our communities. The law cannot take the place of familial and community responsibility, but our governments have a duty to take the action necessary to protect its citizens.” The first two men to be arrested following the tube train attack had both been cared for by the foster parents Pauline and Ronald Jones, aged 71 and 88, at a property in Sunbury on Thames, Surrey. At about 6.50am on Friday CCTV captured images of a man carrying a Lidl supermarket bag in the street next to the Jones’ home. Ninety minutes later a bomb built inside a plastic bucket and placed inside a Lidl bag partly detonated on a District Line carriage shortly after the train pulled into Parsons Green station, west London. The train was packed with commuters and schoolchildren. Thirty people were injured. Some suffered flash burns and others had minor injuries as people trampled over others to try to escape. Bomb disposal experts said that photographs of the smouldering remains of the bomb showed that the initiating charge had exploded but had failed to detonate the main charge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/20/hillary-clinton-what-happened-book","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T15:42:15Z","webTitle":"Hillary Clinton's What Happened sells 300,000 copies in first week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/20/hillary-clinton-what-happened-book","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/20/hillary-clinton-what-happened-book","fields":{"headline":"Hillary Clinton's What Happened sells 300,000 copies in first week","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hillary Clinton’s memoir What Happened has enjoyed a hugely successful debut, with publisher Simon &amp; Schuster reporting that the book has sold 300,000 copies since its release on 12 September.

The Electoral Reform Society (ERS) said an analysis of parliamentary records shows that of the almost 800 peers in the Lords, 115 of them – about 15% of the total – did not contribute in a debate between June 2016 and April 2017 yet claimed an average of £11,091 each. But the society’s conclusions have been challenged by a House of Lords spokesman, who said they failed to take into account other work conducted by peers including serving on committees, amending legislation and putting down written questions. Peers can claim up to £300 per day for turning up to the upper chamber in one of the debating rooms, but do not have to contribute or vote to get that allowance. The society claims to have analysed 779 peers’ voting, speaking and expenses records between June 2016 and 27 April 2017. It concluded that £4,086,000 was claimed by 277 peers who spoke five times or fewer in the past year. The data also found £7,321,000 was claimed by 394 peers who spoke 10 times or fewer this past year, while 131 peers who spoke and voted 10 times or fewer claimed £658,000. The most active 300 peers claimed just half the expenses, “showing the size of the Lords can be cut without significantly limiting its work”, according to the ERS. Darren Hughes, the ERS chief executive, said the data appeared to show a growing “something for nothing” culture. “There are a worrying number of couch-potato peers and lobby-fodder lords at a time when there is plenty to scrutinise,” he said. The ERS said it had chosen not to release the names of the peers who claimed expenses or allowances but had not spoken in the chamber, as its aim was “not to name and shame – it’s to show the problem is systemic”. A House of Lords spokesman said: “The Electoral Reform Society’s calculations are undermined by their narrow focus on spoken contributions. “Speaking in the chamber is only one of the ways members hold the government to account and this research ignores members’ contributions including amending legislation, asking the government written questions and serving on select committees – more than 320 members served on committees in the last session of parliament – as well as parliamentary work away from the chamber. “The Lords is an active and effective revising chamber.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2017/sep/23/kathy-griffin-trump-went-for-me-easy-target","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Kathy Griffin: 'Trump went for me because I was an easy target'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/23/kathy-griffin-trump-went-for-me-easy-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/sep/23/kathy-griffin-trump-went-for-me-easy-target","fields":{"headline":"Kathy Griffin: 'Trump went for me because I was an easy target'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“KATHY GRIFFIN BEHEADS PRESIDENT TRUMP”. So shrieked the headline to a story posted on scurrilous gossip site TMZ on 30 May of this year. Griffin, best known for a standup act in which she acts as a showbusiness tattletale recounting mortifying run-ins with more famous celebrities backstage (her most famous targets include Cher, Josh Groban, Ryan Seacrest and Céline Dion), was pictured brandishing a blood-spattered Donald Trump mask looking like a recruiter for a Beverly Hills branch of Isis. Fallout from the photograph was swift. The 45th president tweeted his displeasure (“Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself … Sick!”) and noted that his son Barron was having a hard time dealing with the image. The First Lady added that someone who would pose for such a photograph must be mentally ill. Griffin explains that the offending snap was taken in about 20 minutes at the end of day-long photoshoot. “I took a picture that you or any one of your friends could make,” she explains. “I put it online and was under federal investigation for conspiracy to assassinate the President of the United States of America. I didn’t do anything wrong. It’s insane and I truly believe if it happened to me it could happen to you.” Her professional standing was dealt a number of blows. She was speedily axed from her regular job of co-presenting CNN’s New Year’s Eve show with long-time friend Anderson Cooper. An upcoming live tour was cancelled due to death threats. The Secret Service opened an investigation into Griffin’s motives in posing for such an inflammatory picture. The flame-haired comic was assailed by outraged tweets from political and showbusiness luminaries affiliated with both sides of the ideological divide. “I was vilified by everyone,” says Griffin in her characteristic manic rasp. “I was vilified by Chelsea fucking Clinton. I was vilified by my friend Don Cheadle. I was vilified by people I’d had at my fucking home. Nobody had my back. It happened so fast. I didn’t see it coming.” That it happened to Kathy Griffin at all is ironic. Prior to the Trump decapitation, the most controversial moment in her career was her 2007 Emmy acceptance speech for her reality sitcom, My Life on the D-List, when she reacted to the previous procession of celebrities dedicating their awards to their buddy, Jesus, with a jubilant “No one had less to do with this award than Jesus. Suck it, Jesus. This award is my god now.” While Griffin is politically engaged on a personal level – “I’m a resister. I still go to every march in the world”– politics is not what built the $10.5m Los Angeles home that is situated next door to Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s residence. If the name Kathy Griffin was notable in any way to the pop culture consumers of the 1990s, it was either because of a small role in Eminem’s The Real Slim Shady video or a slightly larger one as Brooke Shields’s inappropriate, loudmouth sidekick in the unfondly recalled sitcom Suddenly Susan. At the same time Griffin was honing her standup persona (Sandra Bernhard and Garfield leafing through The National Enquirer) at comedy clubs, including the Groundlings theatre where, in 1992, she started Hot Cup of Talk with fellow comics Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo. Her set evolved to include bits where she would play video clips capturing the likes of Julia Roberts and Mariah Carey at their most deluded and least relatable (“I love Mariah Carey. Remember the breakdown? I love the breakdown”). She comments: “Hollywood is like high school: the celebrities I make fun of are pretty much the mean cheerleaders in school.” Griffin may share a following and a similarly pugnacious delivery with her friend and mentor Joan Rivers, but Rivers spent much of her stage life dispensing advice on ensnaring men, while Griffin treats straight males with a mixture of disinterest and disbelief. (“Are you a gay man?” she asks me at one point. When I own up to identifying as a straight man, she utters a revolted, “Ugghh. Who’s the publisher of this fucking fishwrap? What are you doing giving me a fucking straight for this interview?”) Mocking celebrity obliviousness propelled Griffin into the mainstream. In 2005, her cable show My Life on the D-List catalogued the daily indignities of being on the periphery of fame, while also dealing with the dissolution of her marriage, the death of her father, and displaying the occasional fragility of her self-esteem. American comedy in 2017 is synonymous with being loudly anti-Trump. Saturday Night Live’s ratings have never been higher. Bill Maher and John Oliver both just saw their Trump-excoriating current affairs comedy shows renewed until 2020. Late night is filled with highly rated left-wing Trump bashers such as Samantha Bee, Trevor Noah and Seth Meyers. I go through this list with Griffin to illustrate all the people more likely than her to have detonated such a far-reaching explosion. I bring up the name of Stephen Colbert, who started the year with TV experts predicting the day and date of his likely dismissal and is going to end it crowned King Of Late Night. “Fuck Stephen Colbert!” she bellows. “He has the whole power of CBS behind him. Bill Maher frickin’ dropped the n-word and then was back at work four days later with full support of HBO. I was on the no-fly zone for fuck’s sake!” Returning to a woe-is-me theme she knows that I know is partly material she’s getting in shape for her act and partly genuine indignation, she thunders on. “I’m not a CNN employee. I work there for one night when [network head] Jeff Zucker says, ‘I’m going to pay you a hundredth of what I pay Anderson Cooper and I’m going to limit your jokes so even though you have to co-write the whole four and half hours, you can only have three Trump jokes’,” she says. “This is the head of a global news organisation censoring a comedian on the very night he’s hired that comedian to be as outrageous as possible with their very stoic tentpole star with steely blue eyes.” Griffin’s reference is to now former friend Anderson Cooper, who denounced her Trump picture. I suggest that Cooper wanted to be seen as being titillated by her comedy while still maintaining a detachment. “That’s the story of my life, honey,” she drawls. “They want to suck the comedy out of me and then they want to detach.” Griffin doesn’t even pause for breath when asked why, among the plethora of comics trading in potentially treasonous material, she was the one to take the fall. “Fifty-six-year-old female,” she says bluntly. “I will not be convinced this was not a straight-up case of sexism and ageism. I really think Trump went for me because I was an easy target.” Recently, Hillary Clinton spoke about the dichotomy between Griffin’s treatment and hers during the presidential race. “We recently had this big kerfuffle – this condemnation of Kathy Griffin – for the picture she had of herself holding a head of Trump like a play on Perseus holding the head of Medusa,” she said on the With Her podcast. “They were selling T-shirts and mugs at the Republican [National] Convention with Trump holding my head. Nobody said a word. Not a word!” On 3 June, Griffin, shaken by the onslaught of disapproval, held a press conference during which she apologised for the picture and mumbled, “I don’t think I will have a career after this.” She has subsequently announced a world tour – “I have to go to Reykjavik to get a laugh!” – whose official poster features her holding a globe in the same way she posed when clutching the Trump head. So, is that apology still applicable? “All my comedian friends were mad that I apologised at all, but having performed in two war zones, I thought this is a narrow apology because the thing people think was depicted I understand,” she says. “Rosie O’Donnell, the pre-eminent expert on being terrorised by Donald Trump, said, ‘What if Daniel Pearl’s [US journalist who was beheaded by terrorists] mother sees the photo?’ So I totally get it. But in light of everything Trump and the administration have done since, I 100% withdraw my apology.” Griffin says that it was hypocritical that she was singled out, considering all the things Trump has been responsible for. “I will openly accuse the President of the United States of human rights violations,” she adds. “You know, my whole life and career has been championing the rights of women, gay folk and disenfranchised folk. This administration is a fucking nightmare for us.” Beyond the death threats, beyond the damage to her reputation, beyond the irreparable damage done to cherished personal relationships, one consequence of that fateful photo session wounds Griffin most deeply. “I was the face of Squatty Potty,” she wails, referring to her endorsement of a popular US toilet stool designed to enhance bowel posture. “Squatty Potty is an organisation run by two married gay guys who hired me for a commercial which they wrote that said, “Kathy Griffin Is Full of Shit.” They put me on the front page of their website and it said, “Kathy Griffin, Queen of Poop.” And then those two gay guys go on Fox News and they say, ‘Kathy Griffin ruined our business!’” Griffin cackles at the loss of her Squatty Potty millions but then turns sombre. She mentions other celebrities such as Johnny Depp, Snoop Dogg and Bill Maher who have taken a vocal anti-Trump stance. “This will not follow them the rest of their careers,” she says. “I’m the only one who had to do the perp walk. I’m going to have to figure my way out of this and I’m going to have to do it one joke at a time.” Kathy Griffin plays Vicar Street, Dublin, Wednesday 8 November; London Palladium, Friday 10 November; Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh, Saturday 11 November"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/20/peter-hook-settlement-new-order-royalties","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T16:05:18Z","webTitle":"Peter Hook reaches 'full and final' settlement over New Order royalties","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/20/peter-hook-settlement-new-order-royalties","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/20/peter-hook-settlement-new-order-royalties","fields":{"headline":"Peter Hook reaches 'full and final' settlement over New Order royalties","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"New Order have reached an undisclosed settlement with their former bassist Peter Hook, bringing an end to the long legal feud – if perhaps not the antipathy – between the two parties. A statement by the band about the “full and final” settlement reads: The disputes were based upon Hook’s use of various New Order and Joy Division assets on merchandising and in the promotion of shows by his new band, and the amount of money he receives from the use of the name New Order by his former colleagues since 2011. The Joy Division and New Order names mean a great deal to so many of the fans, and the band felt it important to protect the legacy. With these issues now dealt with, Bernard (Sumner), Stephen (Morris) and Gillian (Gilbert) can continue to do what they do best, make music and perform live. New Order formed in 1980 after the suicide of Ian Curtis, the frontman in their previous band Joy Division. Driven often by Hook’s melodic basslines, they became hugely popular for blending guitar rock with the nascent club culture of the 1980s, scoring hits with Blue Monday, True Faith and Regret. After a hiatus in the 1990s, they reformed for 2001 album Get Ready, before Hook left the band in 2007. The initial catalyst for the falling out is still somewhat unclear, but the band variously expressed annoyance with Hook playing Joy Division songs with his new band the Light, for trademarking the name of the Haçienda nightclub, and for focusing on a DJ career. “We’re a bunch of fat old men arguing,” Hook told the Guardian in 2011. “It’s pathetic really, but we’re all happy to keep on doing it.” He then sued the band in 2015, claiming that he was losing millions of pounds in royalties after a restructuring of the band’s finances following his departure, a case which the new settlement addresses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/22/mae-martin-waiting-for-guffman-funniest-film-ever-seen-canadian","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T12:00:26Z","webTitle":"Mae Martin: ‘Waiting for Guffman is the funniest film I’ve ever seen’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/22/mae-martin-waiting-for-guffman-funniest-film-ever-seen-canadian","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/22/mae-martin-waiting-for-guffman-funniest-film-ever-seen-canadian","fields":{"headline":"Mae Martin: ‘Waiting for Guffman is the funniest film I’ve ever seen’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The funniest standup I’ve ever seen This is so hard.

It was another exciting evening in the Milk Cup. Manchester United conceded a goal. Manchester City conceded a goal. Chelsea conceded a goal. And Arsenal nearly conceded a goal. More please, English football! But despite all the rollocking entertainment enjoyed by hundreds of fans in half-packed stadiums across the nation, some cynics are questioning the very point of this grand old three-handled tin can. Well, when we say some cynics, we really just mean one person. And that person is José Mourinho, who wondered whether English football would be better off without a second cup competition clogging up the schedule, came up with the resounding conclusion of “maybe”, and yes it has been a slow Fiver news day. Mourinho was talking after Manchester United’s 4-1 win over Burton Albion, a yawn in match format witnessed by just over 54,000 fans, a good 20,000 below Old Trafford’s capacity. “Could English football survive or even be better without this competition?” he asked himself, unprompted, in the middle of one of those lengthy, meandering post-match monologues he enjoys performing so much these days. “Maybe. Maybe we would be fresher for European competition.” As far as planting seeds goes, it was nothing on his seven-minute epic after Chelsea-Southampton back in 2015, in which he launched a vehement defence of his position at Stamford Bridge despite nobody in the entire world having previously questioned it. Even so, suddenly the continued existence of the Coca-Cola Cup has become a hot topic again. Oh José! Who could have predicted this? His opposite number on Wednesday night, Nigel Clough, was quick to defend the competition. “Our fans will go home with wonderful memories,” he exaggerated for effect. “We gave a good account of ourselves. It will help us in our bid to stay in the Championship. The chairman is happy, it’s a big part of our budget. The [Worthington] Cup is not a nuisance.” To be fair to Mourinho, he’s taken the competition very seriously in the past, winning it four times, and promises to continue to show it “respect”. And if his side respects and retains the trophy this season, he’ll become the competition’s most successful manager of all time, beating the mark he jointly holds with Lord Ferg and Nigel’s dad Brian. At which point, if they were to shut the competition down as he’s sort of suggesting, he’d be guaranteed a place in the history books forever. But that won’t be what’s going on here, oh no. SAMPSON SACKED “WiF understands that questions over Sampson’s suitability for the role were flagged to the FA as early as 2013 during the recruitment process. The safeguarding investigation of 2014, Sampson being sent on an education course in 2015, Eniola Aluko’s complaint in 2016 and Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson’s Duty of Care report published in April 2017 were all missed opportunities for the governing body to more closely examine the issues. Indeed it is unfathomable that an England manager could be sent on a course to emphasise the appropriate boundaries between coach and player, as a direct result of a safeguarding investigation, and not be subject to any sort of due diligence” – Women in Football claims that questions about Mark Sampson’s suitability for the England job were flagged as early as 2013 … more than four years before FA suits sacked him on Wednesday after being alerted to “clear evidence of inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour by a coach” while he was at Bristol Academy.

That is the impression I have, yes.” Liverpool boss Jürgen Klopp says, for the millionth time, stop exaggerating. “It sounds like we have no points and are completely the worst team in the league,” he tooted. “Yes we have problems, that is why we ‘only’ have eight points and not 15. We can make it more serious than it is or we can take it like it is.” Zinedine Zidane has the hump over Real Madrid’s finishing after they were beaten 1-0 at home by Real Betis. “We played better but the result is what matters,” he sniffed.

Then think of what an ordinary German reader will make of these search results: “How Boris Johnson makes a fool of himself in an interview.” “New Zealand: Boris Johnson makes jokes about the Maori indigenous people.” “Boris Johnson whistles – editorial.” “Boris Johnson: the EU should pay for Britain’s departure.” “Boris Johnson, the man who never believes his own sentences.” And so on. Arguably the most serious newspaper in Europe (it only introduced colour photographs on the front page in 2007), the FAZ is extremely critical of eurozone policies and of Angela Merkel. It is in favour of strong ties with the anglophone world, and with its economically liberal, free-trade outlook the newspaper should have among its readers many who think of themselves as allies, friends or even admirers of Britain. But perhaps that last sentence should now be in the past tense. These are increasingly trying times for Britain’s allies and friends in Europe. Imagine you have been a European anglophile all your life, presenting Britain to your friends and family as the country of democracy and the rule of law. You have defended Britain by pointing out that in the EU referendum both sides resorted to exaggeration and lies. You have told them that this is how politics works these days and that Britain will surely now be returning to its age-old traditions of honesty, pragmatism (keep calm and carry on), competence and reliability. Over the past 18 months this must have been a hard enough case to defend, with Theresa May displaying extraordinary ineptitude over the Brexit process, the Daily Mail portraying fellow citizens with a different point of view on the EU as “traitors” and Brexiteers denying parliament the final say over a Brexit process meant to restore parliament’s sovereignty. Britain’s friends must have been struggling to defend all this, but fortunately their friends and family will have had other things on their minds, following British politics only superficially – it is pretty rare to see a story about Brexit on a European front page. But news of how Britain has become its own worst enemy does get through and with his 4,200-word article in the Daily Telegraph, Johnson will have dealt another blow to Europeans’ admiration, sympathy or even respect for Britain. Politicians have been lying for as long as they have been around. But with the exception perhaps of Silvio Berlusconi, they always did so surreptitiously, at least pretending to speak the truth. Johnson, however, displays an almost psychopathic pleasure in shamelessly telling lies. What kind of message does that send to our children, to dictators the world over, and to fellow European leaders who find themselves having to cooperate with a man who is simply unreliable? What kind of country would appoint a man such as Boris Johnson to such an important office? For more and more Europeans the answer to that question is: a country that no longer deserves our friendship. It is not just the untruths. As an EU member Britain has outstanding obligations and these must be settled. That is not an extortionist “exit fee” or a “Brexit bill”. It is simply a case of the rule of law needing to be observed. Over the centuries British law has built up a formidable reputation, which is why European corporations prefer to settle international disputes in British courts – creating a legal industry that earns the UK a whopping £3.4bn in overseas fees. But how is that reputation for legal reliability to be squared with the promise by Johnson and his fellow Brexiteers to renege on commitments their country has made as an EU member? How can non-European countries trust Britain to uphold new trade agreements if it refuses to keep its promises to the EU? These are some of the questions in the minds of all those Europeans who once thought of themselves as pro-British. Many of those live in Germany, a country still intensely grateful for the sacrifices Britain made to rid the world of the Nazis. German mainstream politics is extremely polite, leading many commentators to say that the election debate earlier this month between the two main candidates Angela Merkel and Martin Schulz looked more like coalition talks than a clash between opposing views. It is highly unusual for German mainstream politicians to say something rude or even forthright and so it should give Britain pause that the recently departed German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier broke with this custom when asked to describe his British counterpart. Ungeheuerlich was Steinmeier’s term: monstrous. Around the same time rumours began to spread that Steinmeier had told aides that he simply “cannot stand being in the same room” as Boris Johnson. The amiable Steinmeier never took the trouble to deny the rumour even though he still runs into journalists quite a bit. Because Steinmeier is now the president of Germany. • Joris Luyendijk is an author"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/21/remove-safety-net-disabled-toddlers-dirty-clothes-social-fund","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T09:40:00Z","webTitle":"We had a safety net for the poor.

Now they fall to earth","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The new washing machine sitting in Kirsty’s kitchen is worth its weight in gold. In their council house in Manchester, Kirsty, 25, is caring for her two young boys – four-year-old disabled Keaton and three-year-old Braydon. Keaton was born with end-stage renal failure and it’s gruelling on him and the family: years of dialysis, multiple operations, and even a kidney transplant from his mum last year. (Kirsty wears a bracelet with the date 9/6/16 and stars round it to mark a “life-saving date”.) But money – keeping the boys fed and warm and dry – is another weight on her mind. Kirsty had planned to go back to work after her sons’ births – she sold football kits in Manchester City’s club shop and before that cleaned for years – but it was impossible with Keaton’s health. Her fiance – wracked with ulcers and a form of Crohn’s disease – is currently applying for out-of-work sickness benefits and getting nothing in the meantime. It means that for years, their only income has been Keaton’s disability benefit, disability living allowance (DLA) and Kirsty’s carer’s allowance. When money is that tight, a sudden cost such as the washing machine breaking can leave you, in Kirsty’s words, desperate. The house is visibly damp – a danger for Keaton’s compromised immune system – and heating and electric bills are already high. Keaton’s disability means he soils himself and has a “urine bag” (“If his bag leaks, he can go through clothes every two minutes,” Kirsty explains), and the washer and dryer are a lifeline. When it broke in the spring, the family had to find a couple of hundred pounds overnight. The only reason there’s a new one in the kitchen now is because a charity, Buttle UK, donated it in May. This isn’t the first time they’ve had to turn to charity: this latest washer was a replacement for one Kirsty got through a children’s centre in 2016. When the family moved into social housing last year, there was no washer or dryer in the house – “The only thing I had was a bed and a couch,” Kirsty says – and with no money to buy one, for two months she washed the children’s clothes in the bath. Keaton was on life support at the time – “tubes coming out of everywhere,” Kirsty recalls – and she would spend two hours a day on her knees in the bathroom, scrubbing stains with Vanish by hand. Kirsty’s parents had told her that local councils offered grants to help in emergencies so she asked her housing officer if they were eligible. Kirsty remembers the answer well: “She just said, ‘We don’t do that any more.’” This is what the removal of Britain’s safety net looks like – disabled toddlers in dirty clothes and mothers forced to go to charity. Just four years ago, Kirsty could have turned to what was known as the “social fund”, a central government-run system of low-cost loans and grants for families in financial emergencies. But then austerity arrived and in 2013 the coalition government scrapped all community care grants and crisis loans, replacing them with a patchwork of devolved programmes that cash-strapped local authorities had no obligation to fund. The Conservatives claim that councils are “best-placed to decide how to support local welfare needs”, but it just so happens that when central government transferred responsibility to local authorities, the deal came with a £120m annual funding cut. It doesn’t take an economics degree to guess what happened next. Four years on, nearly two-thirds of English councils have either closed the “welfare assistance schemes” or offer only a threadbare service, according to a new study by the Centre for Responsible Credit (CfRC). Many have done away with cash altogether, instead handing out food bank vouchers or redirecting families to local poverty charities. Consequently, at least one in seven households in England no longer have access to a council-run crisis support scheme. Pause on that: that means one in seven families in financial crisis cannot turn to the state for help. Like so much Conservative social policy, this is not only callous but also riddled with economic short-termism. Give a 20-year-old homeless man £300 for furniture for a new flat and he has a chance to build a life, get a job and pay tax; help a cancer patient with £50 for food and gas until her new disability benefits come in and the strained NHS won’t need to pick up the pieces. A climate of social security cuts, soaring poverty and growing dependency on high-cost credit means demand for “local welfare” can only increase. That’s the added kick of the bedroom tax, replacing DLA, child tax credit cuts, or universal credit delays: just as the government brought in policies that pushed families into crisis, it abolished the emergency fund designed to help them. In many ways, the erosion of the local welfare fund is the definition of austerity at its worst: the state should be stripped back and the poorest and ill must go cap in hand to survive. But how we respond to it can define the sort of society we want Britain to be: whether in a crisis there should be a safety net to help a family get by or whether, ultimately, we are all on our own — families with disabled children included. • Frances Ryan writes the Hardworking Britain column for the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/01/anthony-powell-dancing-music-of-time-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T05:59:10Z","webTitle":"Anthony Powell: Dancing to the Music of Time by Hilary Spurling – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/01/anthony-powell-dancing-music-of-time-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/01/anthony-powell-dancing-music-of-time-review","fields":{"headline":"Anthony Powell: Dancing to the Music of Time by Hilary Spurling – review","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Anthony – Tony – Powell was born in 1905, part of a brilliant generation that included Eric Blair, AKA George Orwell (1903), Evelyn Waugh (1903), Malcolm Muggeridge (1903) and Graham Greene (1904). Among these headstrong Edwardian boys, inside-outsiders all, Powell, who outlived them, is the least colourful and the most English: phlegmatically reserved, aloof and nonconformist. He was, in the heyday of his 12-volume masterpiece A Dance to the Music of Time, very much a a contender, but has now been eclipsed. In posterity’s cruel audit, A Dance lingers as a curiosity in secondhand bookshops, while its author is almost as neglected, outshone by Orwell, Waugh et al. Hilary Spurling’s authorised biography arrives in the nick of time to remind us of her subject’s quiet genius. Addressing Powell’s “work, life and loves”, hers is the first full-scale life. It must also, perforce, grapple with what we might call the Powell Problem. There is, immediately, a debate about A Dance to the Music of Time, Powell’s principal claim to fame, a work that has not worn well. Powell’s social comedy is realistic, based on closely observed contemporaries. Unlike Wodehouse, for example, whose lunatic Eden is timeless and untroubled by the 20th century, Powell’s milieu has come to seem dated, its texture threadbare and its colours faded. He is not a moralist like Orwell, nor a great satirist like Waugh. He lacks Greene’s Manichean ferocity. He is, perhaps, too true to himself to be in the company of those big beasts. Powell’s Dance is many things, most of them admirable. Outstandingly, however, it is a roman à clef, triggered, coloured and inspired by its author’s life whose career it dominates. This is another problem. His biography must be more than a series of footnotes to a sequence of novels, however brilliant. Powell’s rootless childhood and education at Eton and Oxford have their moments, notably in the antics of his extraodinary parents. Once he found his vocation, these vivid countrified beginnings are overtaken by the routine grind of the writer’s life. Despite these formidable obstacles, however, Spurling has triumphed. She has achieved an affectionate portrait of a man who, in the words of one contemporary, was just “a colourless young man with some humour”. Spurling’s solution to the Powell problem is to treat Powell as he himself treated his alter ego and protagonist, Nick Jenkins, in A Dance: to make him a camera lens on the interwar decades that became the neurasthenic playground for some bright young things. Powell’s neutrality was widely noticed. “Nobody could get the wrong impression of you,” wrote one exasperated lover, “because you don’t give anything to go on.” He had a lot of affairs. Spurling’s account of his sex life revels in a succession of sleek, gamine girlfriends, often in matelot costume, voracious young women with shingled hair, a cocktail in one hand and a cigarette holder in the other. As an attractive, blond heterosexual with two or three well-received novels (notably Afternoon Men) to his name, Powell cut a figure in the boho crowd of Chelsea and Fitzrovia as fresh, smart and up-to-date. Later, in A Dance, he would rattle his fictional kaleidoscope to connect a disparate cast of characters. It was a small world. Everyone was writing novels, and everyone was writing and talking about everyone else. Spurling enjoys the gossip of the age, an impression reinforced by her extensive use of first names. Powell is always “Tony”, except, oddly, on p396; Waugh is “Evelyn”; Orwell “George”; Muggeridge “Malcolm”; and so on. What’s at first irritating becomes integral to Spurling’s exploration of a world as remote as Restoration England. Powell had made his name with social comedies obsessed with the torments of unrequited love. By the mid-30s, his generation was coming to terms with the painful challenge of the pram in the hall. How, as Spurling wittily puts it, “to survive marriage without being wholly engulfed by boredom, loneliness or insanity”. Falling in love is one of the themes of A Dance, and Powell seems to have become addicted to casual or commitment-free relationships. But then, after another affair with another crop-haired beauty in a polo neck, he met Violet Pakenham, a junior member of the Anglo-Irish dynasty. She was everything Powell was not: pretty, funny and vivacious with an appetite for experience, especially at parties. The couple bonded through their shared experience of a rootless childhood. Wisely, I think, Spurling does not delve too far into their marriage, except to report that Violet had an affair with “the love of her life”, an unidentified man, during Tony’s wartime absences. The married Powell turned his back on his rackety metropolitan past, shed some fashionable friends such as Constant Lambert, and, once his sons were born, converted the joyless discipline of daily writing, his antidote to the lifelong threat of depression, into the engine that would drive the narrative of A Dance. Its long gestation was interrupted by the second world war, which took Lieutenant Powell to Northern Ireland and, briefly, on Churchill’s say-so, to some months with the joint intelligence committee. It was in the 1940s that Powell’s relationship with his Etonian contemporary Eric Blair came into its own. Some of Spurling’s most moving pages describe Orwell’s last years in wartime London, his struggle with Nineteen Eighty-Four, and the Powells’ support for “a friend for whom it was impossible not to feel a deep affection”. Once the war ended, Powell’s world was dead and buried, too. A Dance came to the front of his imagination, partly inspired by John Aubrey’s Brief Lives. Whatever the Proustian dimension to A Dance, Powell had no appetite for the blind alleys of modernism. A Question of Upbringing, his opening volume, would have a simple English clarity rooted in his remembrance of his recent past, seen through the eyes of that colourless narrator. But it took the fancy of the reading public. On publication in 1951, the Observer saluted “the most exciting experiment in postwar English”. Some reviewers even put Powell in the first division, comparing him to Waugh and Beerbohm. He was soon deep into sequel after sequel, writing steadily with his unique mix of wit, austerity and reserve from a lovely house in Somerset. There were other distractions (reviewing for the Telegraph; a stint on Punch), but the rest of his long life would be consumed by A Dance. Spurling, who now steps into the story as a fan for whom these novels “changed my life”, is exceptionally good on postwar Grub Street, a world she understands in her bones. The experiences of a man chained to a desk, writing 300 words a day, are hard to animate. Some diverting literary gossip, braided with speculation about the models for the odious Widmerpool, does not make for a scintillating life. Awkwardly, too, Powell’s contemporaries began to turn against him. Muggeridge knifed him; Larkin eviscerated what was left. The thing that rescues this long biography is Spurling’s wit, intelligence and deep, ironic affection for her subject, whom she knew as a friend. She has converted her admiration into a compelling portrait of a lost Englishman, a writer profoundly embedded in the literary life of his century and whose reputation is still in the balance. In the posterity stakes, she has certainly done him a favour. • Anthony Powell: Dancing to the Music of Time by Hilary Spurling is published by Hamish Hamilton (£25).

So what does the writer who won a Pulitzer prize in 2011 for A Visit from the Goon Squad – an experimental, audacious novel that embraces discontinuity, told in 13 chapters from varying points of view, including a surprisingly moving chapter in the form of a PowerPoint presentation – try next? Unpredictably, Egan has written something that looks at first glance like a traditional historical novel. A work of remarkable cinematic scope, Manhattan Beach portrays the lives of an Irish family in Brooklyn, set against the backdrop of the Great Depression and then the second world war. A young woman becomes a diver to help the war effort and uncovers the powerful forces that led to her beloved father’s disappearance; a father is forced to leave his family behind to save his own life; and a successful mobster gets swept up in cultural tides that threaten everything he’s built. As a novelist, Egan possesses an unusual mix of qualities, combining a powerful social realism with poetic resonances that derive from her precise imagery and her fascination with the limitations of language. Here, she places her characters in situations that permit trenchant cultural observations, writing revealingly about the challenges of coming of age in the middle of the American century, when women’s lives were substantially circumscribed. But this novel is also metaphysical in nature: Egan’s characters are transformed by the vast ocean around them, which both hides and reveals. In the vivid opening set piece, 11-year-old Anna Kerrigan accompanies her father Eddie to visit a charming mobster named Dexter Styles at his house in Manhattan Beach. A former stockbroker, Eddie hit hard times during the Depression. Now he’s working “at subsistence wages” as a bag man for Dunellen, a corrupt union official and old friend. But Eddie is angling for a new job: he needs money to pay for a wheelchair for Anna’s sister Lydia, who is severely disabled. Anna, of course, knows none of this, and the scene is written with the watchfulness of a young girl. When her father leaves her alone with Dexter’s daughter and her nurse at the beach, she finds herself driven to plunge her feet into the icy water, producing “a flame of ache that felt unexpectedly pleasant”, and resonating with the novel’s theme of loss: There was a feeling she had, standing at [the sea’s] edge: an electric mix of attraction and dread. What would be exposed if all that water should suddenly vanish? A landscape of lost objects: sunken ships, hidden treasure, gold and gems and the charm bracelet that had fallen from her wrist into a storm drain. Dead bodies, her father always added, with a laugh. To him, the ocean was a wasteland. While the reader might expect this scene to precede a book exploring Eddie and Dexter’s developing relationship, Egan thwarts our expectations, and Manhattan Beach is driven instead by the suspense of wondering what really happened that day. After the opening section, we flash forward to the mid-1940s: Anna is 19, working at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and Eddie has disappeared. Six years earlier, he “had left the apartment as he would have on any day – she couldn’t even recall it. The truth had arrived gradually, like nightfall.” Anna now supports her mother and Lydia, who has turned almost entirely inward, not speaking or moving, and whom Anna loves with a doomed tenderness that Egan evokes with painful realism. She fiercely pushes her way into a job as the only female diver in the Navy Yard, and later pursues a one-night stand with Dexter after meeting him at one of his night clubs, concealing her identity and hoping to learn what happened to her missing father. Egan shifts perspectives fluidly, moving from Anna to Eddie to Dexter – all written in the close third person that allows us to shadow the characters’ inner lives. Dexter is drawn with uncommon complexity, a man driven to define himself against his father, aware of how power creates a “radical reordering” of one’s place in the world. In one crucial scene, Anna asks him to take Lydia to the beach, where Lydia briefly awakens and speaks. The moment changes not only Anna but Dexter for ever. In this crucial scene, Egan pushes the writing towards a kind of Joycean musical fragmentation that convincingly conveys the extraordinariness of the encounter. We tell ourselves stories in order to live, as Joan Didion said, but often those stories are wrong or horribly partial. Egan’s interest seems to be in all the ways that our single perspective limits the stories we tell – how our lives get reordered by the discovery of key facts we lacked. Anna thinks her father disappeared because he couldn’t deal with her sister’s disability. Likewise, her boss and the many men she encounters tell a limited story about her: they believe that because she is a woman, she can’t be mentally or physically strong enough to do the work. Her quest to prove them wrong is one of the real thrills of this book. Egan describes diving, beautifully, as an act that delivers Anna “to a purely tactile realm that seemed to exist outside the rest of life. It was like pushing through a wall and finding a hidden chamber just beyond it.” Egan’s decision to withhold crucial scenes until late on ends up feeling disappointing, even if one can appreciate the reasons for her doing so. It’s in the later sections that we meet Eddie once more, now a third mate on a cargo ship, the Elizabeth Seaman. We learn what happened all those years ago as we follow him in his own role in the war effort, but at this late stage the narrative feels less urgent than expository. This may be a weakness of Manhattan Beach, but it comes from an admirable attempt to deploy narrative as a tool to enact – to mimic – the disruptions we experience in real life. This is a novel that will pull you in and under and carry you away on its rip tides. In particular, Anna’s plight as a woman whose will is larger than her circumstances is dramatised with tremendous power. Its resonances continue to wash over the reader long after the novel ends. • Jennifer Egan is appearing at Sydney Writers festival 2018, held between 30 April - 6 May at Carriageworks. • Manhattan Beach is published by Little, Brown.

After all, hers was the kind of complaint – small-scale, wholesome, relatable – that has held up housing projects for years in cities around the world. She didn’t expect the wrath of the yimbys. “You’re talking about zucchinis? Really? Because I’m struggling to pay rent,” retorted an indignant Victoria Fierce at that 13 June meeting. Fierce went on to argue that it was precisely the failure to build new housing that is causing rents to climb in San Francisco, to the point that she can barely afford to live anywhere in the Bay Area. Fierce is a leader of one of a series of new groups that have sprouted up in cities from Seattle to Sydney, Austin to Oxford, lobbying not against development but for it. They say their lives are threatened by housing shortages and skyrocketing rental prices. Calling themselves yimbys, they are standing up to say “Yes, in my back yard” to any kind of new housing development. And courgettes be damned. The movement is fuelled by the anger of young adults from the millennial generation, many of whom are now in their late 20s and early 30s. Rather than suffer in silence as they struggle to find affordable places to live, they are heading to planning meetings en masse to argue for more housing – preferably the very kind of dense, urban infill projects that have often generated neighbourhood opposition from nimbys (“not in my back yard”). The birthplace of the yimby movement, the San Francisco Bay Area, has among the highest rents in America. It added 307,000 jobs between 2010 and 2013, but built fewer than 40,000 new housing units, according to state of California estimates. “It’s clear that this is a housing shortage – and the answer is to build housing,” says Laura Foote Clark, who heads San Francisco-based Yimby Action. “You generate policy by yelling about things.” Clark and other members of yimby groups consider themselves progressives and environmentalists, but they’re not afraid to throw the occasional firebomb into the usual liberal alliances. They frequently take aim at space-hogging, single-family homeowners and confound anti-capitalist groups by daring to take the side of developers, even luxury condo developers. They have started a “sue the suburbs” campaign that targets cities that don’t approve big housing projects and have even attempted to take over the board of the local Sierra Club. Their willingness to lobby for market rate housing in traditionally minority neighbourhoods has seen them called techie gentrifiers and developer stooges. Their penchant for market-based solutions, has seen them called “libertarians” with “trickle-down economics”. A yimby conference organised in Oakland this summer attracted protests from Gay Shame, a radical queer activist group, with about a dozen protesters stood outside chanting “Queers kill techies” and “It’s not your backyard.” But they don’t mind name-calling. Ever since that June meeting, they have adopted the zucchini as the emblem of their rage. In online postings, they pass on zucchini jokes, tips for growing zucchinis in the shade and even shared a picture of a hunter with a rifle on “opening day of zucchini season.” San Francisco resident Sonja Trauss, 35, a former maths teacher, says the housing shortages facing many big western cities are not financial, technical or due to any kind of material shortfalls. “The cause of our current shortage is 100% political,” wrote Trauss in 2015, in an internet post that helped her build an army of followers to speak at public hearings, send letters and drum up support for housing on the internet. The idea caught like wildfire. The yimby movement, which Trauss started in 2013 as a letter-writing campaign, has spread around the globe. In Oakland, local yimby organisers helped win approval for a 24-storey housing tower to be built next to the low-slung MacArthur BART subway station. In Seattle, activists have been instrumental in pushing to the city to “upzone” – or allow higher density building – in neighbourhoods including the University District. In Vancouver, yimby groups are organising tours to show the most wastefully zoned lots in the city, including a ritzy area where 150 acres houses only about 400 people. In Britain, groups have formed in London, Oxford and Cambridge and are looking at how to change the government process to enable more new housing. In Australia, newly formed yimby groups are looking to change laws to allow people to rent out the loft spaces above their garages or “Fonzie Flats”, as they are known Down Under. In the California state legislature, yimby activists have helped Democrats pass a sweeping new package of legislation designed to spur the creation of affordable housing. In San Francisco, supporters have even formed a yimby political party and signed Trauss up to run for a seat on the city’s Board of Supervisors in 2018. Assembly member David Chiu said that when he was president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors before being elected to state office in 2014, residents would rarely speak up in favour of any local development projects. “Often the only voices we would hear would be neighbours who were opposed,” said Chiu, who called on yimby support to get affordable housing measures through the legislature this year. “I think they’ve provided a counterbalance. They’ve been changing the conversation on the local level as well as in the state.” Yimby groups want to reduce the need for cars by building dense, infill housing close to transportation. They want to do away with suburban sprawl. Most of all, they want somewhere to live. That simple cry for housing can in practice turn out to be anything but straightforward. In the trenches of local politics, each battle for a single development can turn into vicious neighbourhood warfare. Nowhere have these battles been more fiercely fought than in San Francisco’s Mission District, a historically low-income, Hispanic neighbourhood, which has been rapidly transforming into an upscale enclave for mostly white, well-heeled tech workers. The huge number of tech jobs created in San Francisco and nearby Silicon Valley has pushed up rents in the Mission to a median of $4,250 a month. Due in part to evictions and the lack of affordable housing, the number of Latinos in the area has been dropping sharply. A 2014 study estimated that between 2000 and 2020 more than 10,000 Latinos, or a third of the Mission’s Hispanic population, will have disappeared from the area. Angry protesters have vowed to stem the gentrification by stopping any further development that doesn’t include significant amounts of low-income housing. Yimby groups have jumped right into this debate, arguing that any new housing is better than none at all. On 14 September, Trauss and other yimby activists went to the San Francisco Planning Commission to argue on behalf of a proposed 75-unit development in the Mission that would be mostly market rate. Hispanic activists argued against them. “Eighty-nine percent of the units that are to be constructed are going to be out of income range of the vast majority of the Latino population living in the Mission District,” argued project opponent Carlos Bocanegra of La Raza Centro Legal, a legal aid group. But Trauss countered that not building is not the answer to the housing shortage. “The 100 or so higher income people, who are not going to live in this project if it isn’t built, are going to live somewhere,” she said. “They will just displace someone somewhere else, because demand doesn’t disappear.” Yimby groups have received funding from founders of several hi-tech companies, including tens of thousands of dollars from Jeremy Stoppelman, a co-founder of Yelp, and the Open Philanthropy Project, which is partly funded by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz. Deepa Varma, director of the San Francisco Tenants Union, says it has been frustrating to see a new group come in and portray Latinos fighting for preservation of their neighbourhood as nimbys. “They’ve flipped the script. It’s a mostly white, mostly young, mostly able-bodied bunch of people suggesting that working class neighbourhoods are being nimbys,” said Varma. It also riles opponents of gentrification that yimbys often lobby on projects far from their home turf. “It’s helpful to know your community for a while before you decide to change it,” said Andy Blue, an activist with Plaza 16 Coalition, a group trying to preserve the Mission’s Latino culture. “The folks in the Mission feel tremendously disrespected by these people telling them what’s good for them.” Generational divide The net wealth of millennials in the US today is only about half of what of their parents’ generation, the boomers, had when they were the same age in 1989, according to Young Invincibles, a research and advocacy group. The typical millennial has accumulated about $29,000 in assets compared to $61,000 amassed by those in the boomer generation by 1989. “They earn less, carry more college debt and face greater challenges to home ownership,” says Tom Allison, Young Invincibles’ deputy director of policy and research. But he says they seem more willing than other generations to stand up and change the world. “This generation is resilient. They are changing things in the face of adversity. That is the silver lining,” Allison adds. Greg Magofna, 33, a nonprofit worker who was raised in the leafy East Bay town of Alameda, formed his own East Bay yimby chapter as he struggled to afford to live in his home region. He has been lucky that Berkeley’s rent control held down the price of his 300-square-foot micro-apartment to $1,200. But he still can’t afford a car and his bikes, refrigerator, kettle and favourite chair compete for space along one crowded wall in his unit. “There is a generational divide. A lot of the older generation doesn’t recognise the world has changed,” he says, adding that it can be confrontational for a yimby to go to a public meeting where opponents might call them gentrifiers or worse. “The world is changing and there’s lots to be angry about,” he says. “The yimbys are saying: ‘We can do something about this.’” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/26/manchester-united-cska-moscow-mourinho-champions-league-group","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T16:08:39Z","webTitle":"Manchester United need to stay respectful at CSKA Moscow, says Mourinho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/26/manchester-united-cska-moscow-mourinho-champions-league-group","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/26/manchester-united-cska-moscow-mourinho-champions-league-group","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United need to stay respectful at CSKA, says Mourinho","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"José Mourinho believes the key to Manchester United beating CSKA Moscow in Wednesday’s Champions League game and maintaining their fine start to the season is to be dominant while staying humble and respecting the home side. United are unbeaten in eight matches this season, winning seven including Saturday’s 1-0 win at Southampton. In that outing they had to defend for prolonged passages having overrun all of their previous opponents apart from Stoke City, with whom they only drew 2-2. United won their Group A opener 3-0 against Basel at Old Trafford a fortnight ago and Mourinho is again targeting maximum points at the VEB Arena against Viktor Goncharenko’s side, who finished second in the Russian Premier League last season. “We cannot guarantee this line of success but the way to try to keep it going is to do what we’re doing,” Mourinho said. “We try to play well and in some moments of the match, if the opponents have moments of superiority, we have to be humble, like we were against Southampton, and to cope with the difficult moments. “Looking at the match at Southampton on TV, I think there was an episode in the first half that could transform the game [Shane Long’s first-half challenge on Marouane Fellaini which resulted in an ankle injury for the Belgian]. We were winning 1-0 when that happened and we could be in control and win the game easily, but in the second half we had to be humble and accept the opponent was on a high and we had to fight hard. “So I think it’s a mixture of our quality and trying to be dominant, like we want to be always, but accepting the reality of high-level football, that when the opponent has a strong moment, you have to cope with it.” Fellaini completed the match although he was subsequently ruled out of the trip to Moscow and the hope is he will be available after next month’s international break and will only miss Crystal Palace’s visit to Old Trafford on Saturday. With Paul Pogba and Michael Carrick also injured the manager has only two frontline midfielders available, Ander Herrera and Nemanja Matic. Mourinho, who is also without Phil Jones and Antonio Valencia, said: “For me Craig Pawson is not one of the big guns of refereeing in England but he was so calm and so much in control [at Southampton]. After I watched it on television it became clear to me, but there was no camera for Craig so he made that decision.” Mourinho hopes Fellaini will not now be called up by Belgium for their international matches as they have already qualified for the 2018 World Cup. “Fellaini was lucky – he could have been in a much worse situation but at the moment … when we don’t have Pogba and Carrick,” he added. “I expect him not to be out for a long time and after Crystal Palace – Belgium are the first country to qualify so I hope he can be playing for us.” Mourinho has faced CSKA with three of his previous clubs and believes Goncharenko’s side are the strongest. “I played against CSKA with Real Madrid, with Inter, with Chelsea and now with Manchester United, so it’s something normal in my Champions League career,” he said. “Opponents wise, I think it’s the best CSKA that I’m going to play against. I think it’s the best team that I face with CSKA as an opponent.” Henrikh Mkhitaryan was among United’s best players when they won the Europa League last season. The attacking midfielder scored six times, one of them in the 2-0 final win over Ajax. Yet Mourinho wants the 28-year-old to elevate his game. “He played well in the Europa League but that was last season and we need him to perform again and the level is higher; the matches away from home are more difficult and we need the best from our players,” the manager said. After the Basel win Mourinho declared himself unhappy with the display after United had gone 2-0 up on 53 minutes and only added one more, comparing it to “PlayStation football”. Mkhitaryan agreed. “Everyone knows that José Mourinho is very demanding and what he said is right,” the Armenian said. “He didn’t say exactly names, but everyone thinks he had done something bad or done some mistakes, but we’re trying to improve that aspect and be more focused during the whole game.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"travel/2017/sep/27/bolivia-che-guevara-trail-last-days-la-higuera-vallegrande","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T11:49:20Z","webTitle":"Revolutionary road: on the trail of Che Guevara’s last days in Bolivia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/sep/27/bolivia-che-guevara-trail-last-days-la-higuera-vallegrande","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/sep/27/bolivia-che-guevara-trail-last-days-la-higuera-vallegrande","fields":{"headline":"Revolutionary road: on the trail of Che Guevara’s last days in Bolivia","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Deep in southern Bolivia – where peaks and cacti soar and condors glide – is a cluster of white-washed homes and a former classroom turned shrine. Inside this school house, 50 years ago this October, the world’s most famous revolutionary, Ernesto “Che” Guevara, was executed. Today, the room where the 39-year-old was killed on 9 October 1967, is decorated with pictures, messages, flags and, weirdly, driving licences, by visitors who have paid homage to the Argentinian revolutionary. The chair, where it’s said Guevara was sitting when executed, is lost in the tableaux of eulogies and pictures pinned to the wall by Che’s admirers from around the world, who have made the pilgrimage to the village of La Higuera over the last 50 years (La Higuera Museum, 8am-noon, 2pm-6pm, admission £1). With Roli Galarza Meneces as my guide, I had set off in search of where Che was captured by the Bolivian army. Roli’s father, a nurse, helped Che track down medicine for his asthma in the pretty colonial town of Samaipata, which is the gateway to the Che Trail we’re taking. The Quebrada del Churo ravine is 3km north of La Higuera. There, we trekked down for an hour through gorse and banana palms under a blue sky to where Che’s men had hidden. Just beyond is a mosaic memorial and the fig tree the injured Che was hiding behind when apprehended by elite Bolivian troops. Roli scattered coca leaves at the site. “I’m offering the coca to the spirit of Che to say thank you,” he said. “Che was unique; he was a failure but at least he tried. When I’m here I have a sense of injustice. It was 500 men against Che’s men.” Emerging from the ravine we headed towards the high-altitude huddle of 17 homes at La Higuera via the same trail used by the captured Che. The walls of La Higuera’s buildings now beam with images of his face. Amid the painted propaganda, I met 70-year-old Irma Rosado at her Store Estrella. Irma was asked to take peanut soup to Che by soldiers guarding the CIA’s most-wanted in the school room. He was executed there by a volunteer sergeant at about 1.10pm. “I was shaking so much,” she said. “I could hardly see his face as he had a beard like a goat. The only thing he said to me was ‘Gracias niña’.” Guevara pitched up in Bolivia to foment revolution and arrived, in disguise, in La Paz in 1966, staying in room 504 at the Hotel Copacabana (Zona 9, Av Illampu, £30 a night). Ask at the hotel reception and they will show you the room. Che and his guerrillas then set up a base in the south of Bolivia before trying to secure local support and recruit fighters. La Higuera’s two hostels expect plenty of Che pilgrims for the 50th anniversary commemorations. Casa del Telegrafista (rooms from £10pp, +591 6773 3362) is hosting a Che photo exhibition (until June 2018), and discussions. For gourmet meals (beef bourguignon marinated in red wine for two days) and Che conversation go to Los Amigos (rooms from £9pp). Both can arrange local guides. Che’s corpse was helicoptered to Hospital Señor de la Malta at Vallegrande, 60km north of La Higuera. It’s a small town with cobbled streets and roofs carpeted with moss. Here, the Che route is structured and an official guide is required to see all three official sites – as the hospital is still functioning. There are six guided visits a day (£4.50pp) and guides can be found at the tourist information centre (Plaza Principal 26 de Enero, +591 7009 1023). Leo Lino, one of the guides, joined Roli and me and showed us the Vallegrande hospital’s backyard laundry where Che’s body was brought for identification and displayed to the world’s press. The walls and wash basin are scrawled with adoring graffiti. Leo told me locals light candles appealing to “San Ernesto” to cure illnesses: “Many people say their illness has been cured around here.” This belief in the miracles from a dead Che emerged when his lifeless eyes appeared to follow observers around the room. The scene, captured by Bolivian photographer Freddy Alborta, was likened to Andrea Mantegna’s Dead Christ by art critic John Berger in 1968. Not everyone sees Che as a hero but in Vallegrande he is honoured every October, his death marked by concerts and events. For what’s on this year, check the Facebook page of Turismo Vallegrande Bolivia and the 50aniversarioche.bo website. On 9 October an official act of remembrance will be held in Vallegrande. Cuban first vice president Miguel Díaz-Canel will attend as well as Che’s four children (who all live in Cuba). Acts of homage will be held in La Higuera on 8 and 9 October. As we entered the hospital’s former morgue on the tour, Roli whispered, “This is where they cut off Che’s hands.” They were severed by a doctor for fingerprint ID, though they later went missing, a cause célèbre highlighted in the documentary The Hands of Che Guevara. From the morgue it was back out into the open air and to the garden of remembrance, which is decorated in memorial stones to honour the fighters who died during Che’s Bolivia campaign. Last October, a new Che museum opened, as part of the Centro Cultural Ernesto Che Guevara, next to the air strip where his body was dumped in 1967. The museum features photographs, posters and assorted artwork relating to Che and his campaigns. And behind the centre is the memorial building erected over the site where his body lay in an unmarked grave until unearthed in a search in the 90s. At the Café Galeria de Arte Santa Clara, on Vallegrande’s main plaza, under a vast portrait of Guevara in death, I asked Roli why Che’s Bolivia experiment failed. “The locals were afraid to sell food to the guerrillas and they were afraid of dollars. Also, the US sent Green Beret Ralph “Pappy” Shelton to train the Bolivian army in counter-guerilla tactics.” Just two weeks after their training, Che had been captured and the order came from Bolivian bosses: “Di buen día a Papá” (Say good morning to dad): the code to kill Che Guevara. Che might have died 50 years ago but Bolivian president Evo Morales has revived his spirit and his name has been rehabilitated in Bolivia, Roli told me. As we left the trail, the walls of a nearby town, daubed with a slogan, seemed to speak this truth: “Che, more present than ever.” • The trip was provided by Journey Latin America, which has 11-day holidays to Bolivia taking in the Che Trail, Santa Cruz, Sucre and La Paz, from £2,736pp, including flights, full-board during the Che Trail, breakfast daily, excursions and transfers.

The billionaire who revolutionised the vacuum cleaner said 400 engineers in Wiltshire had been working since 2015 on the £2.5bn project. No prototype has yet been built, but Dyson said the car’s electric motor was ready, while two different battery types were under development that he claimed were already more efficient than in existing electric cars. Dyson said consumers would have to “wait and see” what the car would look like: “We don’t have an existing chassis … We’re starting from scratch. What we’re doing is quite radical.” However, he said the design was “all about the technology” and warned that it would be an expensive vehicle to purchase. While he did not name a price, he said: “Maybe the better figure is how much of a deposit they would be prepared to put down.” He said he had long been concerned by diesel particulate pollution and while he had designed filters for such engines, he had concluded that electric vehicles were the best way to progress. Dyson said: “I’m not a Johnny-come-lately to electric cars. It’s been my ambition since 1998 when I was rejected by the industry that has happily been creating dirty vehicles, and governments have kept on allowing it.” The car will count as a British export, he said, although it will probably be manufactured in the far east. While the UK remained a “frontrunner” for the production base, he added: “We’ll choose the best place to make it and that’s where we’ll make it … Wherever we make the battery, that’s where we will make the car. We see a very large market for this car in the far east … We want to be near where our markets are and I believe the far east has reacted [to electric] more quickly than the UK or Europe.” He said people in Asia had been far more aware than in Britain of the detrimental health effects of diesel particulate pollution. The cars will be fitted with Dyson’s air purifying technology to protect their drivers: “It’s not the owner of the VW that has the problem, it’s the person driving behind them.” The inventor said he was announcing the extent of his plans after Dyson’s ambition to develop a new form of battery-powered car was accidentally disclosed in a government document last year. Clues to the direction of travel had come when Dyson, which made its name with the bagless vacuum cleaner and later its “airblade” hand dryers, announced an investment of £1bn in battery technology last year. The recruitment of senior staff from motor manufacturers heightened industry speculation. Dyson has now announced a further £1bn on designing the prototype vehicle and another £500m in associated costs – bringing the total to £2.5bn. Research and development work on the car will continue at a new facility being built on a former second world war airfield at Hullavington, close to Dyson’s headquarters in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. The car is most likely to be a rival to the upmarket vehicles produced by Silicon Valley firm Tesla – another non-traditional car manufacturer founded by a celebrated inventor and engineer, Elon Musk. But Dyson said it “would not be a sports car”. Tesla’s most affordable car, the Model 3, is expected to cost at least £35,000 when it goes on sale in the UK next year, while a Model S costs from £62,000 to £130,000 with add-ons. Dyson has invested in robotics and AI research for its existing products, but the Dyson vehicle is not likely to have any greater degree of autonomy than other new cars. The inventor sounded a sceptical note over driverless cars: “I think that total hands-off driving is some way off.” Established British car manufacturers are now moving towards building purely electric vehicles, although concerns remain about the cost, the battery technology, and the charging infrastructure. Jaguar Land Rover has announced plans to develop electric or hybrid versions of all its models by 2020, with a fully electric car on sale next year, while BMW has said it would built an electric Mini in Oxford – all following Nissan’s bestselling Leaf, built in Sunderland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/26/senate-republicans-vote-doomed-healthcare-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T18:31:37Z","webTitle":"Senate Republicans admit defeat in latest effort to repeal Affordable Care Act","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/26/senate-republicans-vote-doomed-healthcare-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/26/senate-republicans-vote-doomed-healthcare-bill","fields":{"headline":"Senate Republicans admit defeat in latest effort to repeal Affordable Care Act","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The latest Republican attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act died on Tuesday as it became obvious they did not have the votes to pass a bill that would leave millions without health insurance. The admission of defeat came from Senate leader Mitch McConnell and the sponsors of the bill after party discussions over lunch on Capitol Hill left them in no doubt their slim majority could not survive a revolt. Republicans were at least one vote short in their effort to repeal Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement and were running out of time to force the bill through this week before a key procedural deadline. They conceded defeat on one of their central promises of the last decade, hours after Donald Trump was left railing against “certain so-called Republicans” refusing to vote for the latest bill. “To be clear, through events that are under our control and not under our control, we don’t have the votes,” said Louisiana senator Bill Cassidy, one of the authors of the measure. “We’ve made the decision since we don’t have the votes, we will postpone that vote. Am I disappointed? Absolutely.” At a press conference after lunch, the bill’s authors insisted that Republicans supported the substance of their proposal, which would direct billions of dollars under the healthcare law to states in the form of block grants, transferring sweeping new discretion over how to deliver healthcare. “Patience is a virtue,” co-author Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said. “Time is actually on our side. The votes we were lacking were actually more about process than substance. We can fix the process and we can improve the substance, so that’s why I’m optimistic.” Addressing conservative voters and donors who helped revive the repeal effort after it failed in a dramatic fashion in July, Graham pledged Republicans still had the “fight” left to ensure the law is replaced. Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of Republican leadership, said he expected voters would be frustrated. “I don’t blame them,” Thune said. “They have to hold us accountable and we made a commitment. I hope they’ll have a little bit of patience.” On Tuesday, McConnell opened debate in the Senate by assailing the ACA, widely known as Obamacare, but offered no guidance on whether he would hold a vote or not. Hours later, he admitted defeat. Later that afternoon, McConnell made clear his caucus was moving on to other legislative priorities. “We haven’t given up on changing the American healthcare system. We are not going to do that this week but it still lies ahead of us,” McConnell said. “We do think it’s time to turn to our twin priority: reforming the tax code. We’ve reached significant agreements inside the budget committee to go forward and I’m optimistic that we’ll achieve that.” Trump has been frustrated by Republicans’ repeated failures on healthcare and has expressed displeasure with the senators who have stood in the way of repeal measures. Asked on Tuesday if he would demand Republican leadership hold a vote on the healthcare bill, Trump replied: “We’ll see what happens.” He said: “It’s going along and at some point, there will be a repeal and replace. But we’ll see whether that point is now or whether it will be shortly thereafter. But we are disappointed in certain so-called Republicans.” His frustration came after the very public opposition of Susan Collins, Rand Paul and John McCain, who made clear they would vote no. That would be enough to sink the bill given the Republicans’ narrow 52-48 majority in the Senate. On Monday, Collins announced her opposition moments after the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office published an analysis that found millions of Americans would lose their health insurance if the bill became law. During a televised debate on healthcare on Monday night, Cassidy and Graham acknowledged the setbacks but vowed to push forward with their bill. “We are going to press on,” Graham said during the CNN debate. “It’s OK to vote. It’s OK to fall short, if you do, for an idea that you believe in.” For seven years, Republicans have won elections on the promise to repeal the healthcare law and replace it with a conservative plan that removes decision-making power from the federal government. Repealing the ACA was also a central thrust of Trump’s campaign, though his fickle expectations for its replacement have complicated Republican attempts to repeal the law. To overhaul the healthcare system on a party-line vote, Republicans want to use a process called “reconciliation” that allows lawmakers to pass bills affecting taxes and spending with a simple majority. But the reconciliation process is time-bound, tied to a budget resolution Congress passed earlier this year, which ends on 30 September. The analysis followed a frantic attempt by the bill’s authors to win over reluctant senators, revising the bill to deliver more federal funds to states where the senators were undecided, such as Alaska and Maine. While Paul opposed the measure because he believed it did not go far enough in repealing the ACA, Collins and McCain, two of the three senators who derailed a repeal attempt in July, lamented a rushed process and urged a return to “regular order”, which includes public hearings and a full CBO analysis. Reacting to the news, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said Americans would “breathe a sigh of relief” and commended the voters and activists who quickly mobilized against the bill. “Our colleagues had no choice, in the face of opposition from one end of the land to the other, to withdraw their bill,” Schumer said. “Now we hope that Republicans don’t come back to this bill. It will meet the same fate that it did this time because the people didn’t like it.” Schumer urged Republicans to resume the bipartisan negotiations over ways to stabilize the insurance markets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/26/labours-manifesto-contained-nothing-radical","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T17:51:38Z","webTitle":"Labour’s manifesto contained nothing radical | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/26/labours-manifesto-contained-nothing-radical","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/26/labours-manifesto-contained-nothing-radical","fields":{"headline":"Labour’s manifesto contained nothing radical","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Your article on Labour’s 2017 election campaign (The inside story of Labour’s election shock, 23 September) was welcome. However, it is important to reject a myth about the manifesto. It was not a radical document and contained no new analysis of the pressing issues of our time. It had nothing worthwhile to say on how we should tackle the problem of long-term care of the ageing population, on the persistent failure to achieve productivity growth in our industries and its effect on our international competitiveness, or on new ways of preventing terrorism and halting the alienation and radicalisation of young people. Instead it presented multiple commitments for public spending to be financed by higher taxes on those who earn more than £80,000 a year and enhanced corporation tax; the need for significant reform of the tax system was also ignored. Populist yes, but radical no. Martyn Sloman Melton Constable, Norfolk • Those of us who followed coverage of the 2017 general election, or are politically active, may have begun reading Heather Stewart’s account of Labour’s campaign with few expectations of new revelations. However, helped by citing arch critic Chris Leslie, who erroneously compares the 2017 outcome with Kinnock’s “snatching defeat from the jaws of victory” in 1992, she succeeds in illuminating the true scale of Corbyn’s achievements. Labour didn’t win -– thanks for reminding readers more than once – but to have performed so well in the face of hostile candidates like Leslie and a party machine working against the interests of party members is quite remarkable. Jeremy Corbyn is a generous man for not having sought the resignation of a substantial number of party employees. Les Bright Exeter • In response to Roy Boffy (Letters, 25 September) the Labour conference might indeed be a tightly managed affair. However, with a general election possibly looming that is not necessarily a bad thing. And at least Labour is being controlled by the widely supported Momentum, some of the unions and the parliamentary leadership. In New Labour’s day it was much smaller, with an undemocratic coterieof Tony Blair, Alastair Campbell, Peter Mandelson and others pulling all the strings.

Archibald delivers the cosmic vocal lines with stunning cool; she swirls and seduces but never overeggs it. Meanwhile conductor Ludovic Morlot does beautifully precise and evocative things with the Seattle Symphony, but I’m not convinced by his choice to use a boys’ choir in place of women’s voices in Trois Petites Liturgies de la Présence Divine.

But the new season, which appeared on Amazon last Friday, proves it can. Jill Soloway’s show has always played at the intersection between queer and Jewish pathos, particularly on the ways the experiences of both trans and Jewish folks are passed through generations, like heirlooms. Watching the Pfefferman family – Maura, Shelly, Sarah, Josh and Ali, each of whom have sadness and secrets aplenty – navigate their fraught past and present has been one of the joys of the series. But it’s been equally fun watching them wait for their standing order at the local Jewish deli or rendezvous with the family rabbi or exchange Yiddish witticisms at family gatherings. Transparent understands Jewishness as something not wholly religious but cultural, too. Past traumas seep into the present, coloring Pfefferman get-togethers with a poignant blend of humor and melancholy that few other shows replicate; as Judith Light’s Shelly puts it in season three, it’s “a swamp pit of mishegas”. In season four, Soloway’s turbocharged that mishegas (craziness) by moving the Pfefferman family from its comfortable dwellings in Los Angeles to Israel, where Jeffrey Tambor’s Maura is delivering a lecture on Judaism, gender and the cold war. At first, only Maura’s youngest daughter, Ali, tags along. She thinks a trip to the Holy Land will shake her out of a spell of angst and depression. It’s a malaise made worse by a poem about her nether regions, written by her former lover Leslie, appearing in the New Yorker. Meanwhile, the other family members are stuck in LA, each attempting to find happiness – via polyamory (Sarah and Len), sex addicts anonymous (Josh), and improv (Shelly). When Maura discovers – spoiler alert – that her father, long presumed dead, is an old, rich Israeli television personality, with a pristine mansion in the suburbs, the whole family is soon flown out to join them. That plot twist ensures that the bulk of the season is set in Israel: a place replete with meaning, tradition and conflict. In other words, it’s a perfect foil for the Pfeffermans, each of whom seeks a certain spirituality in both authentic and artificial ways. Maura’s long-lost father plays tour guide to the Pfeffermans as they journey to the sites of Israel – there’s a wonderful and surprising scene at the Western Wall that’s perhaps the best distillation yet of the show’s exploration of religion and gender. Ali experiences something of an identity crisis when her internal conflicts are magnified by those of the country she’s visiting. She breaks away from the group, joining friends in Ramallah, and then chooses to stay abroad when the Pfeffermans head back to LA. In between, the show addresses the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – which it doesn’t opine about so much as represent – and all the ways Israel is and isn’t the utopia this particular American Jewish family wants it to be. Past seasons of Transparent have had songs that more or less defined them, subtly guiding us as the characters experience revelations of the sexual, familial and romantic sort. In the first season, a cover of Nina Simone’s New World Coming accompanies Maura coming into her own new world as a trans woman, while in season three, Shelly’s show-stopping performance of Alanis Morissette’s Hand in my Pocket announced she’d no longer play second-fiddle to her ex. Most of the new season is set to the soundtrack of Jesus Chris Superstar, beginning with a flashback to pre-transition Maura dancing to the song Everything’s Alright in her nightgown as Shelly, whose water has just broken, begs for some sauerkraut. Andrew Lloyd Webber’s rock opera is an ingeniously perfect choice. Selections from Superstar provide the soundtrack to some of the show’s more overtly religious moments – for example, The Last Supper plays while the family floats in the Dead Sea – and Soloway returns constantly, and in several different episodes, to Everything’s Alright. In the musical, it’s sung by Mary Magdalene to Jesus as she gives him a healing ointment. But in the context of Transparent, it reflects a simpler, more secular desire for calm and contentment. By the end of the season, when Maura is singing the song again, this time in Los Angeles, with background vocals from her ex Shelly, her friend Davina, and her new lover Donald, not everything, as you’ll see, is all right. But in the world of Transparent, which revels in the Jewish American neuroses of Larry David, mixed with the camp of Andrew Lloyd Webber and the gender-bending theories of Judith Butler, it’s about as close as we can get. And still, four seasons along, there’s nothing else on TV like it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/28/marius-neset-circle-of-chimes-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T17:45:02Z","webTitle":"Marius Neset: Circle of Chimes review – deft, poignant and jam-packed with ideas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/28/marius-neset-circle-of-chimes-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/28/marius-neset-circle-of-chimes-review","fields":{"headline":"Marius Neset: Circle of Chimes review – deft, poignant and jam-packed with ideas","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Norwegian reeds star Marius Neset often sounds like several saxophonists playing simultaneously, and, as a composer, he can similarly suggest he’s aiming to pack in every possible new discovery he’s made from album to album.

Bookended by the sombre chiming of tubular bells, peppered with mind-warping rhythmic switchbacks and high-speed improv, see-sawing between stuttery minimalism and grooves, and leavened by airy sax and flute reveries, poignant cello parts and Loueke’s sensuous singing, the album is packed with surprises. Neither Neset’s deft manipulation of anchoring motifs, nor the fluency of the soloists (also including pianist Ivo Neame, vibraphonist Jim Hart, and Neset’s sister Ingrid on flute) dispel a slightly inchoate impression, but Loueke’s vocal warmth in the finale of Star, the Phronesis-like momentum of A New Resolution, and the pretty melody of Prague’s Ballet are highlights of a venture buzzing with fresh contemporary musical thoughts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/26/global-economy-risk-financial-crisis-wef-uk-world-economic-forum","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T22:01:16Z","webTitle":"Global economy at risk a decade on from financial crisis, says WEF","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/26/global-economy-risk-financial-crisis-wef-uk-world-economic-forum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/26/global-economy-risk-financial-crisis-wef-uk-world-economic-forum","fields":{"headline":"Global economy at risk a decade on from financial crisis, says WEF","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The 10th anniversary of the worst downturn since the Great Depression finds the global economy at risk of a fresh crisis and ill-prepared for the disruption likely from the robot age, the World Economic Forum has warned. The body that organises the annual gathering of the global elite in Davos each January used its annual league table of competitiveness to stress that the failure to push through growth and productivity-friendly policies since the crash of 2007-08 had jeopardised chances of a sustained recovery. WEF sources said recent Bank of England concerns about a potential consumer debt crisis were timely since there was evidence that the global banking system was less sound than before the financial crisis and that conditions were deteriorating in some parts of the world. Last month, the International Monetary Fund warned of a “dangerous” growth in China’s debt. The WEF said there was also a need to combine labour market flexibility with enhanced rights for workers, with countries that had managed to do so enjoying higher employment and lower levels of inequality. Zero-hours contracts were a “sticking plaster” rather than a long-term solution, it added. According to the 12 criteria used by the WEF, Switzerland retained its place as the world’s most competitive country in this year’s standings. The next four countries in the table were the US, Singapore, the Netherlands and Germany. The UK slipped one place to eighth, although the WEF said the decline was due to a better performance from other countries rather than the impact of the Brexit vote. The UK’s overall competitiveness score was the highest since the WEF started using its current method of calculating competitiveness a decade ago. The 12 categories looked at in the WEF report are institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic environment, health and primary education, higher education and training, goods market efficiency, labour market efficiency, financial market development, technological readiness, market size, business sophistication, and innovation. Britain’s weakest performance was in the macroeconomic environment where the persistence of a large budget deficit meant it ranked 68th in the world. In the other 11 areas, the UK was in the top 20, ranking fourth in technological readiness – the category highlighted by the WEF as essential if countries were to make the most of the new wave of innovation. “Global competitiveness will be more and more defined by the innovative capacity of a country. Talents will become increasingly more important than capital and therefore the world is moving from the age of capitalism into the age of talentism. Countries preparing for the fourth industrial revolution and simultaneously strengthening their political, economic and social systems will be the winners in the competitive race of the future,” said Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the WEF. Further down the league table, there was little evidence that the pick-up in growth in the eurozone had boosted the competitiveness of the bigger economies or narrowed the region’s north-south divide. France dropped one place to 22, and there was little change in the rankings for Spain (34), Italy (43), or Greece (87)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/27/why-does-obesity-cause-diabetes-google-answer","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T07:00:27Z","webTitle":"Why does obesity cause diabetes?

You asked Google – here’s the answer","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"‘Cause” is a strong word. It means that A results in B happening. Causality is also surprisingly difficult to prove. Most medical studies only show association between A and B, while causality often remains speculative and frustratingly elusive. Obesity and diabetes are no exception. There are many types of diabetes. All are unified by elevated levels of blood sugar. Type 1 diabetes accounts for less than 10% of cases and results from autoimmune destruction of the beta cells in the pancreas, which produce and release insulin. (In an autoimmune process, antibodies that normally target and fight infection instead target one’s own cells). Type 3c (secondary) diabetes can occur when there has been destruction of the pancreatic beta cells through some other process, such as excessive alcohol, inflammation or surgical resection. There are also many genetic forms of diabetes, each usually resulting from a single gene mutation that affects pancreatic function in some way. Finally, there is type 2 diabetes (T2D), which accounts for more than 90% of cases globally. Media reports of diabetes, particularly in the context of obesity, usually relate to T2D, the two terms often being used interchangeably. Only T2D appears to be associated with obesity. Epidemiological studies across the world have shown that the greater one’s body mass index (BMI), the greater the chance of developing T2D. However, this is not the same as saying that obesity causes T2D. The majority of people who are obese will never develop T2D – a fact that exposes the statement “obesity causes diabetes” as absurd. Rather than referring to obesity as a cause of diabetes, it is more accurate to frame the issue as one of association between obesity and T2D (which is incontrovertibly true). As we gain weight, the sensitivity of our tissues to the effects of insulin diminishes (so-called “insulin resistance”). In response, our pancreatic beta cells, which produce insulin, need to work harder to produce more of it. Imagine driving a car up a hill: this is analogous to your body encountering insulin resistance following weight gain. To get up the hill, you change gear, step on the accelerator and make the engine work harder. In the same way, the pancreatic beta cells need to work harder to produce more insulin to compensate for insulin resistance. If you are lucky enough to drive a car with a good engine, you will make it up the hill, however steep, and never develop T2D regardless of how much weight you gain. If, however, your car’s engine has insufficient power to get up the hill, your car will eventually stop, and may roll back down. The chance of this happening depends on the steepness of the hill (how much weight you gain) and the strength of your engine (or the strength of your beta cells and their ability to produce more insulin). The point at which your car stops (when your pancreatic beta cells are no longer able to produce enough insulin), is termed, aptly, “beta cell exhaustion”. From this point, there is usually an inexorable decline in the release of insulin from the beta cells, when blood sugar levels progressively increase and T2D eventually becomes manifest. Our genetic makeup determines the strength of our pancreatic beta cells, and therefore influences which of us will make it up the hill and which of us will halt and roll back down. This is why T2D is in fact a genetic condition, and weight gain or obesity often contribute to its manifestation. Why does insulin resistance occur with weight gain? To answer this, it is important to understand that abdominal (visceral) fat confers the greatest risk. Blood from visceral fat, laden with fatty acids, drains directly into the liver. Some of these fatty acids can spill over into the general circulation, where they can compete with glucose (sugar) uptake into more peripheral tissues, such as muscle. Given that glucose uptake is an insulin-mediated process, this competition promotes insulin resistance. Visceral fat also produces hormones called adipokines, some of which can further dampen the sensitivity of the insulin receptor to the effects of insulin. Using our analogy, weight gain around the waist confers the steepest gradient up which to drive a car. The development of T2D is complex. There are many processes implicated, ranging from excretion of glucose in the urine, appetite regulation, control of pancreatic hormonal function and the role of gut bacteria. However, weight gain and insulin resistance appear to be associated with many of these processes. Currently, we cannot do much about the elements of our genetic makeup that influence pancreatic beta cell function, although this may change in the future. We can, however, improve our insulin sensitivity – and reduce the gradient of the hill ahead of us. Aside from weight regulation, exercise and regular activity are important: exercise, in addition to numerous other benefits, improves our insulin sensitivity. Avoiding sleep deprivation, which can promote insulin resistance, is also important. On top of this, a varied diet – one that limits processed food and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) – can help improve insulin sensitivity: preparation technique involving high moisture, short heating times and the use of acidic marinades (such as lemon juice and vinegar) are techniques that can reduce our consumption of AGEs. Type 2 diabetes is a genetic condition – but there is plenty we can do to make our mountains into molehills. • Thomas Barber is an associate clinical professor in endocrinology and diabetes based at the University of Warwick, and honorary consultant endocrinologist at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire (UHCW) NHS trust, where he leads the obesity service"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/26/mark-mazower-grandad-russian-secret-father-happy-london","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T15:38:39Z","webTitle":"How my family’s history in London hid a revolutionary Russian secret","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/26/mark-mazower-grandad-russian-secret-father-happy-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/26/mark-mazower-grandad-russian-secret-father-happy-london","fields":{"headline":"How my family’s history in London hid a revolutionary Russian secret","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When the acclaimed historian Mark Mazower decided to write a book about his family history, he had no idea about the secrets he would uncover. “I just had this question: what is it to be a historian of your own family? How does history produce you, your personality, your outlook on life, your relationships and the things you value?” To answer these questions, Mazower, a professor of history at Columbia University in New York city, decided to delve deep into his dead father’s past. “When historians use biography, they generally either write about very noteworthy people – which was not the case with my father – or they use the lives they are writing about to illustrate some bigger story.” He wanted to do the opposite, and investigate how historical events shape the lives of apparently insignificant individuals. “Most of the time, as a historian, you can’t do that because you don’t know the people well enough. The only people you’re likely to know well enough, where you can even begin to do that, are members of your family. So my question was: how did history produce my dad?” The question was important to him because his father, Bill, whom he greatly admired, was a very contented man, he says, who always tried to live a good life until he died in 2009. “To a large extent, more than most of us, I think he succeeded. I was interested in this very, very old question: what is the secret of happiness? And how does history produce that? Because in the case of my father, he had this very settled life that revolved around north London. And yet he was the son of immigrants who had lived very turbulent lives. Their fate had been intimately bound up with the Russian revolution, Stalinism and the second world war. So how had history impacted Dad?” He also wanted to know what it was about England that allowed families such as his to flourish. “There’s something very special and rather beautiful about England in the middle of the 20th century that I wanted to explore and understand better. The country was so open in the 1920s for immigrants to come in. Social mobility was possible in the 40s in a way we have lost. That seemed to me a story worth remembering, and thinking about what it did for the country.” To write his book, What You Did Not Tell, Mazower used his father’s diaries and testimony as a starting point. He then investigated historical archives and researched genealogical websites to reveal the closely guarded secrets his grandfather, Max, kept quiet about his entire life. “The book started with Dad, and Dad didn’t have mega-secrets. Then I realised that the stories of his parents were going to be formative, especially the story of his father, who had been involved in revolutionary activity in Russia.” Max, it turned out, was a man of secrets. He had been a member of the Bund, a huge, secular Jewish socialist party active in the Russian empire between 1897 and 1920, and helped to print illegal books in Yiddish that would promote “socialist feelings” among Jews. In 1903, he wrote a widely circulated leaflet revealing the truth about an antisemitic Russian pogrom that had taken place in Gomel, modern-day Belarus, Mazower discovered. By 1907, Max had been repeatedly arrested by the Tsarist police – who helpfully kept surveillance files about him for Mazower to find – and was imprisoned in Siberia twice, eventually fleeing the country for Europe and settling in England with his wife, Frouma, in 1924. But the only thing he ever revealed to their son Bill was that he had escaped from Siberia. “Anything that was real suffering was left out.” In hindsight, Max was one of history’s losers, Mazower says. “The Bund – this big, courageous strand of the Russian left, concerned about equality and social justice – got completely wiped out. Between Stalinism and Nazism, nothing was left of it. That was a tragic story, and Max lived the tragedy.” His revolution was lost. “That hung over him. But I also think he felt fortunate. He knew what it was to have ended up in England.” Max, after all, deliberately chose to call his son William – at the time a very unusual, British choice for a boy with Russian Jewish parents. Yet his father’s name, Mazower says, was always so much a part of him. Undoubtedly, it helped Bill to identify with the English boys growing up around him. “I think there is a pressure in being the son or daughter of immigrants. You feel the precariousness. Dad had a classic mid-20th-century English stiff upper lip. That’s how he dealt with it.” Another secret Max took to the grave concerned his son, Andre, Bill’s half-brother, who was born out of an affair in 1908 with a fellow revolutionary, Sofia Krylenko. At the time, neither she nor Max could have had any idea that Sofia’s younger brother, Nikolai, who was just 13, would grow up to become prosecutor general of the Soviet Union, one of the most feared figures in Russia. Mazower discovered this secret by tracing the family tree of Andre’s mother. Max kept quiet about it all through his life. “Max’s love affair with Sofia meant he was tied very closely to one of the most powerful and dangerous men in the Soviet Union. That was something anybody with any sense would have kept totally silent about – especially if you still had family in Russia, as Max did. You didn’t want to get on Nikolai Krylenko’s radar and you also didn’t want to get on the radar screen of people who were opposed to Krylenko, and who eventually brought him down. It was about protecting people who you love.” At this point, the boundaries between what was history and what was family started to blur for Mazower. “I realised that your family history and the history of the Soviet Union could start to bleed into one another, even though your grandfather was not a particularly important person. Max was still living with Soviet realities in England in the 1930s.” Max rarely spoke to Bill about his family in Russia, even though he did everything he could to send money back to them – at one point selling the family home to do so. Even when he discovered that his beloved brother and niece had died in Lithuania’s Vilna ghetto during the second world war, he kept quiet about it. Why had Max said so little? “Compared with some families, the Holocaust was not something that was endlessly discussed. There was no great anti-German feeling. Max’s silence enabled Dad to take his own position on that.” Bill was aware, though, that his fate might have been very different if his parents had not chosen to move to England. “I think my father did feel very fortunate, and I think it was part of feeling English.” Overall, Mazower believes Max’s decision to keep his secrets secret had a liberating effect on his father. “Think about what Max gave my dad, by being silent. Because Max never imposed on his son his own stories of suffering, it cleared the ground, in a way, for Dad to have happiness. The silences were important.” Yet his father, he says, always found it frustrating that his grandfather was quite so silent. “Dad would have really wanted to know all this stuff I found out about Max. I wish he could read the book. He would have been the best person to discuss it with.” Mazower interviewed his father about his family history 12 years before he died, recording five hours of tapes. “We just sat together and talked. It was my idea. I said we’ve got to do this.” He has eight-year-old twins and says he wrote the book for them to read in 20 years’ time. “I wanted them to understand the family, and England. We live in New York and when I started writing it, I was feeling nostalgic for London and trying to figure out what it was about some places that makes you miss them. The short answer is: they are home. But that raised a bigger question: how did Golders Green, this small suburb of north London, become home for my dad? Writing it helped me to understand that – and why it felt like home to me.” Mazower also discovered that his grandparents regularly met with active Russian-Jewish revolutionaries who were drawn to Golders Green. “Growing up in Golders Green was a weird experience for me because this place has no history. It was a big revelation to discover that Golders Green in the 1920s was full of these super-important world anarchists, who were hanging out with my grandparents and recovering from the revolution. It suddenly made the whole place make sense.” This English suburb was a survivor’s paradise at the time, Mazower says. “Here, people could be themselves. There weren’t generations of people from round here, so this place became theirs. They felt that very strongly. They understood the value of England, perhaps more than other people did. Because nobody in the 1920s and 1930s knew more than some of the people living here about what was going to happen when the Nazis came in.” By trying to find out how history had shaped his father, he began to realise he was making important discoveries about himself and his own relationship with north London. “It matters a great deal what roots you, who forms you, what forms you, where forms you. This became clear to me. I hadn’t appreciated the extent to which I had been shaped – my outlook and my taste – by things that predated my birth by a decade.” For example, he says, he always thought he felt a connection to Hampstead Heath because he used to go to school there. “Then I realised reading through Dad’s diaries that he was cycling all over there in the 1940s and 1950s. Then I realised from a little more digging that was where Max had lodged in the 1920s. In a funny way it was almost as though the places that mattered to me had nothing to do with me at all: they had been set there for me.” He thinks everyone should interview their relatives about their family history. “Otherwise, those stories that you have in your family will die. Otherwise, you’re like a blind man on a raft that’s being whirled down a turbulent river. At least, if you’ve got the stories, you can see where you’re going and where you’ve come from. Personally, I’d rather know.” • What Did You Not Tell by Mark Mazower (Allen Lane, £20; published in the US by Other Press, 17 October 2017).

Celia Hollingworth died after visiting an archaeological site in Mesimvria last Thursday. A local pathologist aided by specialists from the University of Thrace will conduct a postmortem on Wednesday in the north-eastern town of Komotini. “This is a very special case.” said the coroner Nikolas Kifnidis. “I am waiting for experts to come so we can examine the remains together.” A veterinary surgeon will also be present. “Wolves, wild dogs and jackals are known to attack people,” Kifnidis told the Guardian. “There are mountains here, forests here, I have seen it before, Greeks and Bulgarians dying in this way.” The manner of Hollingworth’s death has shocked authorities. Police are investigating how the 63-year-old tourist came to be at the remote spot where her dismembered body was discovered. “What was she doing there? It was a very remote place, very difficult to negotiate by foot, and between three to four kilometres away from the archaeological site,” said a police spokesman, Theodoros Chronopoulos. “We are painstakingly trying to piece it together. What happened is unbelievable.” Chronopoulos said a mobile phone found at the scene along with other items including a passport, hat, shoe and bag could also help shed light on the case. “We have asked for privacy protection data to be lifted to see what her last calls were. They may tell us a lot.” Greek media have reported that in her last moments Hollingworth made calls to friends and relatives appealing for help. Hollingworth, a retired university worker and human rights campaigner who lived outside Bradford-on-Avon in Wiltshire, took a taxi on Thursday morning to see antiquities in the area of Thrace, close to the Turkish border. She is believed to have been staying at a hotel in the seaside village of Maronia, between Komotini and Alexandroupolis. The region is rich in antiquities, with monuments scattered across its olive groves, foothills and mountains. Police have been gathering witness testimony in an attempt to trace her last steps. Chronopoulos said Hollingworth may have been attempting to trek back to Maronia when she got lost. Her disappearance was reported late on Thursday by her brother in the UK to police in Durham, who alerted the British embassy in Athens, which in turn alerted Greek authorities. “We have been interviewing witnesses and now know she was last seen on the beach at Petroton, not far from the archaeological site, between 4 and 5pm,” Chronopoulos said. “It is very likely she was trying to trek back to Maronia when the attack occurred.” Neighbours have paid tribute to Hollingworth, emphasising her kindness and saying she was “always doing things for other people”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/28/death-homo-economicus-peter-fleming-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T13:00:39Z","webTitle":"The Death of Homo Economicus review – why does capitalism still exist?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/28/death-homo-economicus-peter-fleming-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/28/death-homo-economicus-peter-fleming-review","fields":{"headline":"The Death of Homo Economicus review – why does capitalism still exist?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"To certain segments of the progressive left, capitalism has been “late capitalism”, or in its death throes, or already dead, for a very long time. So how come it still exists? Part of the answer may lie in the argument of this sparklingly sardonic book by Peter Fleming. Our entire lives, he argues, have been economified. The ruling narratives of work and commerce hypnotise us into thinking of our very selves as micro-businesses, so that it becomes ever harder to imagine life outside the paradigm of capital investment, productivity and profit. “Homo economicus” is the totally made-up creature who is the proletarian hero of mid-20th-century economics: going about his daily life with unimpeachable rationality, efficiently calculating ways to maximise his self-interest. But people don’t actually live like that, as the behavioural economists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman pointed out. It is a refuted model, yet its malign influence persists. Fleming offers an excellent historical analysis of the associated idea of “human capital”, according to which each employee really is a little entrepreneur, investing in his or her skills. This amounts, Fleming thinks, to a deliberate atomisation of the workforce and a hollowing-out of education itself. The skill of an individual, he insists rightly, is not a private good – and this applies not just to the most obvious examples, such as doctors, but to everyone. Neoliberalism has now given way to what Fleming calls “wreckage capitalism”, the continuation of financial operations in the rubble of the post-crisis order. The “free-market” principles of neoliberalism are, after all, conveniently ignored in favour of monopolisation and unproductive rent extraction by, for example, the publishers of academic journals or the bankers overseeing the privatisation of utilities. (To illustrate the phenomenon of “taxpayers funding their own asset stripping”, Fleming here tells the depressing stories of Royal Mail and the British rail network.) Neoliberals will often plead in response that we just need to be even more purely neoliberal. “The present setup is not capitalist enough,” as Fleming ventriloquises the prognosis. “Of course,” he continues, “in the last instance it never is … Leaders of industry enjoy a state-funded socialism because they understand that pure capitalism is a mere impossible abstraction that is meant for the masses to toil with, out there beyond the perimeter.” In the meantime, especially for the young, debt has become “a way of life” and jobs are increasingly precarious. Fleming has an excellent chapter on the “theatre of work”, where looking busy and adopting the right emotional attitude in an office can be soul-destroying burdens, and he is very astute on the inhumanity of the zero-hours contract, allied to unprecedented methods of electronic surveillance over employees. Delivery drivers, for example, are paid only for each package they deliver, with no sickness or other benefits. Fleming extends the logic remorselessly: why pay a bartender for any time other than those exact seconds when she is pouring a drink? Employers, he writes, should be paying for “availability” over a period of time; paying only for exactly measured micro-quantities of work is just the newest way to shaft the little guy. About Uber, Deliveroo, TaskRabbit et al, Fleming is particularly scathing: what is dishonestly termed the “sharing economy” is a cynical monetisation of the widespread hardship caused by the 2008 crisis, and the final stage in the “atomisation of the employee”. Nor will such problems somehow be solved by our coming robot overlords. New waves of automation have never, throughout industrial history, resulted in significantly less labour and more civilised leisure pursuits, as economists of the late 19th and early 20th century fondly imagined was inevitable. Today, “sophisticated technologies are now paving the way for millions of ‘crap jobs’ to flourish”, and millions of human beings are being downgraded to the undignified status of sub-automata: they still have to work because they are cheaper than machines. This is all enlivened by a marvellously insulting turn of phrase: most economics, the author claims, takes place in “a kind of nerd’s dreamtime”. He writes contemptuously of “the state and its semi-lobotomised think-tanks” (the “semi-” might be rather generous), as well as the “sub-mental technocrats” who enforce targets in university teaching. The reader may periodically demur at what can seem like apocalyptic exaggeration, but that is after all in the nature of polemic. What, then, is to be done? Fleming doesn’t buy the Paul Mason fantasy that voluntary cooperation on the model of Wikipedia or open-source software will somehow scale up to rebuilding society along more equitable lines. He also disapproves of the death drive he perceives in “accelerationism” (full speed ahead with rampant wreckage capitalism so as to hasten its inevitable implosion), and the misanthropic eco-fanatic’s desire to dismantle civilisation for the sake of the worms and the mosquitoes. Instead he favours a “radical de-privatisation of the public sphere”, some version of universal basic income and a fellowship of the precarious to demand universal workers’ rights – as for instance with the court victory of London Uber drivers, who argued successfully that they were employees rather than atomised contractors. It’s notable that next to such rousing ideas the final lines of The Communist Manifesto – “Workers of the world, unite” – would not look outdated. But there is also a more contemporary hint of Game of Thrones throughout the book, as Fleming warns that if we do nothing, a dark “winter” of humanity is coming. Yet the nicest thing about his book is its avoidance of despair: it is often hilariously angry, but the stylish expression of outrage can itself be a positive and optimistic act. • The Death of Homo Economicus is published by Pluto Press.

Scarcely past midday on a Monday lunchtime, a full 45 minutes before curtain up, the queue for the box office is already snaking on to the road. Inside Òran Mór, a spacious pub-cum-performance venue in Glasgow’s West End, the line of ticket holders is even longer. They are here for A Play, a Pie and a Pint, a lunchtime series launched by David MacLennan in 2004 and not so much a success as a phenomenon. Nobody could have predicted its popularity back then, but today is typical. They line up like this six days a week for 40 plays a year (plus summer and winter pantomimes), almost all of them new with just a handful of classical adaptations. The tally to date is in excess of 400, making A Play, a Pie and a Pint a bedrock of the Scottish theatre industry. And it is not short on ambition. In its first 13 years, the shoestring organisation has programmed plays by Gregory Burke, Zinnie Harris, David Harrower, David Greig, Liz Lochhead, Bill Paterson and Simon Stephens, not to mention fielding actors from Robbie Coltrane to Mel Giedroyc. In its current month-long collaboration with Edinburgh’s Traverse, it has lined up work by Ian Pattison, creator of Rab C Nesbitt, and Karen Dunbar, star of Phyllida Lloyd’s all-female Shakespeare trilogy at London’s Donmar Warehouse, along with fellow actors-turned-playwrights Julia Taudevin and Anita Vettesse. In past seasons, its influence has stretched to the National Theatre of Scotland, Aberdeen Performing Arts and the Sherman theatre, Cardiff. It should be said that context is everything. Not every show put on by A Play, a Pie and a Pint is essential viewing. With two weeks’ rehearsal, small casts and limited budget, the shows frequently scrape by on actors’ rough-and-ready energy and the generosity of a willing audience tucking into their pies and pints as the plays proceed. That’s part of the appeal. The atmosphere is goodhearted and convivial; everyone is pleased to give even the shakiest play a fair go. Why not? It’s a better way to spend your lunchtime than most – and it’s a bonus when the play is first-rate. Kicking off the Traverse series is Pleading by Rob Drummond, whose interactive electoral teaser The Majority was recently at the National Theatre. First heard as a radio play earlier this year, it is typical Play, Pie, Pint fare, in its modest, single-set ambition, bursts of humour and high-stakes tension. It’s a keep-’em-guessing thriller set in a godforsaken cell in some long-haul resting point between Brisbane and London in an Asian state with a zero-tolerance approach to drug trafficking. Two 18-year-olds, Freya and Michael, have been held there for 22 days after heroin was found in their luggage. “We’re not foreign – we’re British,” they protest indignantly, incapable of assessing the severity of their situation or the limits of their sense of entitlement. Kim Allan and Daniel Cameron play them with a suitably adolescent tetchiness, torn between mutual lust and violence. In David Ian Neville’s production, Nicole Cooper looks on as the local lawyer, scornful of the egocentricity of the two captives even as she attempts to save their lives. Drummond has pursued two strands in his writing. There are those shows, usually performed by himself, that rest on a clever conceit or theatrical sleight of hand. They would include Mr Write, an improvised children’s play inspired by a volunteer in the audience; Bullet Catch, a recreation of a music-hall magic trick; and last year’s In Fidelity, a live speed-dating show. Perhaps Our Fathers, his forthcoming collaboration with director Nicholas Bone about being atheist sons of religious dads, will be added to the list. On the other hand are plays he has written along more conventional lines, including Quiz Show, about child abuse in the world of light entertainment, and Grain in the Blood, about a rural family haunted by a dark past. Pleading is in this category, right down to Drummond’s playful love of withheld information. He is forever pushing us in the wrong direction so as to surprise us with what he has hidden in plain sight. He’s a playwright who thinks like a magician. Misdirection is his forte. From that point of view, Pleading can seem less like a fully fleshed-out play than an exercise in bluff and double bluff, a whodunnit construct with only a limited amount to say about the world at large. Drummond keeps the tension up, though, heightening his warped love story about delusion and obsession with life-and-death stakes, as Freya and Michael come to terms with the likely penalty they face. Keeping us guessing until the end, it certainly provides more twists and turns than your average lunchtime. A Play, a Pie and a Pint is of far greater significance than a daytime distraction, however. While audiences get the benefit of the shows, the high turnover of work is a boost to the wider theatrical ecology. Many plays have gone on to have an extended life, the format being especially suited to small-scale touring and slots on the Edinburgh fringe. But even without that, the series is a fruitful seedbed for first-time writers, a chance to flex the muscles for established writers, and an extra source of employment for cast and crew. It may fly in the face of marketing logic, but audiences, like artists, know they’re on to a good thing. Pleading is at Òran Mór, Glasgow, until 30 September (box office 08444 771 000). Then at Traverse, Edinburgh, 3–7 October. The 24th season of A Play, a Pie and a Pint continues until 25 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/live/2017/sep/26/apoel-nicosia-v-tottenham-hotspur-champions-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T20:54:06Z","webTitle":"Apoel Nicosia 0-3 Tottenham Hotspur: Champions League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/sep/26/apoel-nicosia-v-tottenham-hotspur-champions-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/sep/26/apoel-nicosia-v-tottenham-hotspur-champions-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Apoel Nicosia 0-3 Tottenham Hotspur: Champions League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"And with that, I’m off. Here’s a match report. Bye! And Eric Dier also speaks: The first half was tough. It was a bit frantic at the beginning and we struggled to get hold of the game. But we knew it was going to be difficult. We had to match their aggression and then our quality would come through, and I think that’s what happened. I think last year was a real eye-opener for us and I think we’re showing that we’ve learned from that. Tonight was massive for us. We needed to win here, and we’ve done that. Looking back at the goals, Waterman made the first as easy as possible by running out of goal and just standing up, making himself as small as possible, and Carlão assisted the third by failing to even compete for a cross that landed about a foot from his right shoulder. Kane has 34 goals from 30 games for Tottenham in 2017. Remarkable. Harry Kane speaks: It was a very proud night for myself. I try and score every game and obviously it’s a bonus when I get three. It was a hard night. We weren’t really pleased with how we played the first half. Even the second half, we came out, maybe weren’t as aggressive as we wanted to be but we were more clinical in the vital moments, and that’s what you’ve got to be in the Champions League. Of course we’re missing a few players but the lads that stepped in today were fantastic. We’ve got a great squad and you’ve got to be ready. 3-0 away in the Champions League, no matter who you’re playing is a fantastic result. And in other English-team news, Manchester City have beaten Shakhtar Donetsk 2-0, and Liverpool have been held to another ridiculous draw-despite-having-loads-of-chances, 1-1 at Spartak Moscow. So Madrid and Spurs both have maximum points and are taking control of the group, albeit with but two games played. Elsewhere in Group H, it’s finished Borussia Dortmund 1-3 Real Madrid, with a lovely goal from Gareth Bale and a couple for Cristiano Ronaldo. 90+4 mins: The final whistle blows, and Kane prowls back onto the pitch in search of his match ball. 90+3 mins: This level of goalscoring is just ridiculous. 90+1 mins: We’re into stoppage time, of which there will be about three minutes. 88 mins: Makris runs down the right and tries to pick out Alexandrou, all alone on the left of the area, but it’s a disastrously bad pass and the chance is gone. 86 mins: From the free kick, Rueda shoots harmlessly over. 85 mins: Winks gets himself booked. for catching Farias’s heel. 83 mins: More substitutions. Nektarios Alexandrou comes on for Nuno Morais, and Tottenham give Anthony Georgiou his debut, in place of Sissoko. 82 mins: The game has now ended its sleepy final phase. Nkoudou jinks into the penalty area but shoots into the nearest defender. 79 mins: Apoel patiently work a fine shooting chance for Ghayas Zahid, a couple of yards inside the area, but Sánchez closes him down and deflects the effort wide. Llorente heads the corner clear. 75 mins: Agustin Farias has replaced Stathis Aloneftis, a man who looks about twice his 34 years. 74 mins: Kane has earned a breather and will now get one, as Spurs bring on Nkoudou in his place. 73 mins: Dier brings the ball to the right-hand corner of the area and spots Kane all alone on the left, but his chipped pass isn’t great, Kane is forced too wide, and Waterman falls on his low cross. 70 mins: Kane’s hat-trick tonight is sheer striking perfection. Of course it is the classic perfect hat-trick – one with the left foot, one with the right foot and one with the head – but it has also been a nigh-on unimprovable display of attacking efficiency. Every finish executed with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of class. 69 mins: Now Son has a shot, which looked nasty but was deflected wide. Another hat-trick for Kane! Kane plays the ball wide to Trippier and then runs untracked into the area to meet the cross with a fine downward header! 64 mins: Sissoko is played down the right again, an almost identical position to the one which led to the second goal, but this time he takes a shot himself, which is easily saved. 63 mins: Antreas Makris has replaced Sallai for Apoel. That is tough on Apoel, who have been excellent this half. But it is also excellent strikership by Kane. Sissoko pulls back to the Englishman, central and just outside the area, and he takes one touch to control before sidefooting unstoppably inside the post. 61 mins: Apoel cross from the left, but De Camargo glances a header well wide. They collect it again and cross from the right, and this time the ball clears the same player. 60 mins: Another glimpse of goal for Apoel, and again they’re not shy to have a shot! This shot, though, is skewed well wide by Sallai. 57 mins: Tottenham are bringing off Aurier, and bringing on Llorente. 56 mins: Save! A long, low ball plays in Aloneftis, who surges into the area and slams in a shot that Lloris tips over! 55 mins: “This is a dangerous 45 for Spurs,” insists Jeremy Dresner, as Apoel raid down the left again, without reward. “Apoel will have fancied that this game is where they can most likely to get points in this group. They will have their proverbial periscope up this half.” 53 mins: This is much brighter stuff. Aloneftis crosses from the left, and it’s headed wide by De Camargo at the back stick. 51 mins: Vinicius fouls Winks in midfield, and is booked. 48 mins: Moments later Sallai is played in, and Sánchez wrestles him to the floor rather than let him get away. Happily for Spurs, the linesman’s flag is waving. 48 mins: And a chance for the home side! A long ball from the left finds De Camargo, who nods down to Sallai, who volleys at Lloris from the edge of the area. 46 mins: They’re off! And Son shoots just wide within 30 seconds! He runs outside Kane, who lays the ball into his path, and he shoots across goal with his left foot from an acute angle! The players are back out. There don’t appear to have been any halftimely substitutions. Spurs are lucky to be leading, but in six minutes between the goal and the interval they had a couple of promising attacks, suggesting that they could a) enjoy a bit more space in the second period, and b) have some fun with it. 45+1 mins: Just the six seconds of stoppage time, and Spurs take a lead into the break. 45 mins: Son carries the ball into the Apoel half, and spots Trippier in all sorts of space on the left, but his pass is slow and Vouros comes across in time to cut it out. 43 mins: The goal was far from deserved, but on the plus side it should bring Apoel out of their (clam)shell, even if, for all their defending, they had come closest to scoring. 42 mins: Boy Waterman has been booked for, I think, protesting that Kane was offside. He wasn’t. 39 mins: It’s a long, low pass from Alderweireld to Kane, who has been given too much space by Rueda and is played onside by Vouros, and the Englishman controls, spins and slots past the onrushing Boy Waterman! From nowhere, a goal for Spurs! 37 mins: Near-calamity for Spurs, but they get away with it! A long ball from Apoel is too close to Lloris, who comes out of the area to deal with it only to hit it straight into Sánchez! It rebounds back towards goal, keeper and striker give chase, but before either can reach it it rolls a yard wide! 36 mins: Now Apoel have a corner, their first. And it’s a great one, picking out Carlão who is unmarked at the far post. There’s no defender on that post, and a good chunk of goal to aim at, but Carlão misses it! 33 mins: Apoel win a free-kick, 10 yards into Tottenham’s half. Their centre-backs slowly trudge forward and spend a while getting in position, whereupon it’s played short, and backwards. 31 mins: Spurs have had plenty of corners, most of them taken by Davies, left-footed from the right. None of them have led to much, and the latest is headed over. 28 mins: For a fraction of a second there Son had a chance to play in Kane. His pass was behind the striker, rather than in front of him. 26 mins: Apoel’s defence is so deep they’ve just spotted one of these swimming past the window. 22 mins: “With no Eriksen or Dele Alli it’s looking a bit killer-ball-less from spurs,” writes Jeremy Dresner. “That is predictable. An out of position Trippier and the rugby style backward passing and running of Sissoko are not much helping matters. How do you sink a submarine anyway without torpedo distribution?” It looks like they’re relying on Trippier or Aurier coming up with a defence-destroying inch-perfect cross from wide, without much of a plan B. 20 mins: Apoel look more likely to score than Tottenham, who are enjoying plenty of possession but don’t seem to have any particularly smart ideas for unlocking the home defence. 19 mins: And Apoel hit the bar! De Camargo with a rising left-footed drive from 10 yards or so which beats Lloris but not the woodwork! 18 mins: Chance for Spurs! A proper good one! Tripper finds space on the left, cuts back onto his right foot and pings a delicious cross onto the head of Son in the six-yard box, but it’s a fraction high and he heads over! 17 mins: Apoel have an effort on goal! It’s a header from Sallai, and it bounces well wide, but still. 15 mins: Aurier blasts a cross into Lago’s shoulder, and Spurs have another corner. It’s played back to Aurier, who finds Davies with a clever pass, but he’s tackled and that’s where the move ends. 14 mins: Apoel attack! A lovely flick sends Stathis Aloneftis running down the left, but he’s offside. 10 mins: It’s hard to express quite how deep Apoel’s defence is sitting at the moment. It’s less a defence than a submarine. 7 mins: A scrappy spell, in which the ball has spent almost all its time within 20 yards of the half-way line, occasionally being aimlessly booted forward and then booted back again. 4 mins: A nice break from Spurs ends with Aurier being played into space on the right. His low cross hits Carlão and rebounds to Son, whose shot is deflected wide. 3 mins: Spurs, all in white, knock the ball about for a while as whistles cascade from the stands. Then they pump the ball forward, it’s knocked down, and Kane’s first-time left-footer rumbles gently wide. 1 min: It’s on! Anthems played, hands clasped, action imminent. I’m going yes to this. Serge Aurier looked like a mobile suspension-magnet at the weekend, but hasn’t received a straight red card since 2012-13. The players are in the tunnel! The Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has had a chat with BT Sport: I think for different reasons we needed to change. I think we’re guaranteed to try to win, to perform as well. It was compulsory to make some changes but it’s no excuse for today, to [not] try to win and perform in the right way. Always to play here in Cyprus is tough, and of course the conditions are not the best, but we are ready to compete. The opposition will be tough. They have some good players, good organisation, good set pieces. It will be tough like always in the Champions League. I think always it’s important to improve. Improve the record away from home in the competition. And for us it’s important to get three points today. But first of all we need to fight, we need to play well, and then to get the three points. Other famous Boys include Boy William, an Indonesian actor and VJ (real name William Hartanto), Boy Abunda, a Filipino TV presenter (real name Eugenio Romerica Abunda Jr) and Boy George, well-known singer. One thing that connects all of those Boys is that none of them are actually called Boy. “Some fringe players on that Spurs bench, that’s for sure,” writes Woolie Madden. “Most people won’t even have heard of some of those potential subs, though I was lucky enough myself to see Oakley-Boothe at the National Sunglasses Expo this year at the Kensington Olympia.” Tashan Oakley-Boothe could make his Spurs debut this evening, as indeed could Anthony Georgiou, who as a member of London’s Cypriot community would probably have been excited enough about this fixture already. The teams! The team sheets are in, and these are the names upon them: Apoel: Boy Waterman; Vouros, Rueda, Carlão, Roberto Lago; Vinicius, Nuno Morais; Zahid, Sallai, Aloneftis; De Camargo. Subs: Gudino, Poté, Alexandrou, Antoniou, Farias, Merkis, Makris. Tottenham: Lloris; Trippier, Alderweireld, Sánchez, Davies; Aurier, Winks, Sissoko, Dier, Son; Kane. Subs: Vorm, N’Koudou, Llorente, Foyth, Walker-Peters, Georgiou, Oakley-Boothe. Referee: Pavel Kralovec (Czech Republic). So, then. Apoel v Spurs at the GSP Stadium, or to give it its full title, Athletikos Podosferikos Omilos Ellinon Lefkosias versus Tottenham Hotspur at the Gymnastic Association “Pancypria” Stadium of Eugenia and Antonios Theodotou. I think we’ll stick with the abbreviation from now on. Antonios Theodotou, as I’m sure you’d like to know, was a doctor who was involved in the foundation of the Pancypriot Gymnastic Association back in the very late 19th century. A trip to Cyprus should, in theory, be a stroll for a mighty cash-laden Premier League-contesting side such as Spurs. I mean, the trip itself would certainly not be a stroll. It would generally be a flight. I’m talking figuratively. But they would be foolish to assume it will be so – Apoel drew with Chelsea when they last visited London in 2009, Spurs had to come from behind to win 2-1 the last time they were in Cyprus in 2014, Mauricio Pochettino was a member of the Espanyol side that drew 2-2 away at Apoel in 1996, and Hugo Lloris was in nets when Lyon were dumped out of the 2011-12 Champions League by the very same outfit. What’s more, Christian Eriksen is ill, Dele Alli and Jan Vertonghen are suspended and Mousa Dembele and Victor Wanyama are injured. On the other hand, Apoel have won one and lost three of their five matches so far this season, and while going down 3-0 at Real Madrid is forgivable enough, losing 3-1 at Enosis or 1-0 at home to Anorthosis is less clever. “Apoel are very tough,” says Pochettino. “It is important to respect them because we need to win. It’s so important. We need to fight and play better than them.” Apoel is also the current home of the least imaginatively-named footballer in the entire history of football, the Dutch goalkeeper Boy Waterman*. Imagine having a baby boy, and then deciding, after getting to know the little bundle of joy for a few days, that of all the names in the world the one that suits him best is Boy. It is an astonishing level of literalism. Though I suppose it is possible that his parents wanted to name him Roy but just had bad handwriting. Or Bob. Dennis Bergkamp was famously prevented from being called Denis, his parents hoping to use a single N in homage to Denis Law, because Dutch baby-naming administrators thought it so similar to Denise it might cause some confusion. Where were these eagle-eyed pen-pushers when Mr Waterman Snr turned up? Boy might not be so easily confused with something you might call a girl, but it is very easily confused with something you might call a slave. * Not however the most unfortunate name for a current top-flight footballer, which if my extensive research is to be trusted is a title currently held by the 23-year-old Suphanburi defender Suphan Thongsong. Though I’m open to alternative suggestions. Since discovering Thongsong, I have dreamed of Notts County ushering out of their youth system someone called Nottinghamshire Ucanttouchthis, or Manchester United signing Manchester Mambonumberfive. One day. Simon will be here soon. In the meantime, here’s David Hytner on Harry Kane’s drive for success: To Harry Kane it is a numbers game and, like every football fan in Europe, the Tottenham Hotspur striker is in awe of those posted by two players in particular. You know who they are. There was a time when a goalscorer would be feted for getting 20 in a league season; for reaching a ratio of one in every two matches. That was in the era before Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. The Big Two have redefined the concept of productivity. What they have done and are doing is, quite simply, freakish. Messi, for example, has scored 96 goals in 116 Champions League games; Ronaldo 107 in 141. And what about their records in La Liga? Since Ronaldo joined Real Madrid from Manchester United in 2009, he has scored 285 goals in 267 matches. In the corresponding period, Messi has 304 goals in 279 games for Barcelona.

There was the smell of rosemary and lavender on the desert air. Guided by a booming kick drum, I arrived at the rectangular pool that reflects the main stage of Oasis festival. As I joined the sweating crowd, a smooth electro track drifted into a soaring Arabic a cappella. A young Moroccan woman in a vest top that said “Detroit Hustles Harder” danced alone nearby. As Jaar slammed into a techno groove, thousands of hands flew into the air, beyond them the half-smile of a moon was almost lost among the stars. I instantly forgot about my injury. European tourists have long come to Marrakech, chasing a fantasy of exotic Moroccan culture. And they find it: people in Djemaa el-Fna square really do charm cobras and pile colourful spices into gravity-defying pyramids. But over the past three years another kind of tourist has been visiting Morocco. Spurred by a wave of new electronic music festivals, the country’s clubbing scene has jumped into the spotlight, pulling in the kind of crowd who might usually spend their long weekends in Berlin or Amsterdam. The biggest festival is Oasis (2018 dates tba), now in its third year, and held in September at a hotel complex just outside the city, with big names such as Richie Hawtin and Solomun playing alongside underground heroes and local DJs. The set-up strikes a neat balance between local culture and the gloss of a European festival: there’s the Moroccan square where music fans sit cross-legged and eat juicy grilled lamb but also a secret garden with sunset yoga sessions. “Oasis made our biggest dream come true,” says DJ Amine K. “It shows people the culture and open-mindedness of our country. Some people still think we just ride camels and that the women all wear veils.” Two other festivals sprang up in its wake: last year saw the first Atlas Electronic (30 August-3 September 2018), focusing on underground programming and cross-cultural collaborations; and the Atlantic surf city of Essaouira hosts Moga (postponed this year but running in 2018), aimed at a local crowd, and with cheaper tickets. These festivals are helping put Morocco on the worldwide rave map. “The main goal was to use music to attract a different kind of tourist to Morocco,” says Marjana Jaidi, founder of Oasis. But Morocco’s alternative music scene isn’t confined to festival season. In Marrakech’s well-heeled Guéliz district, I watch DJ Mehdi Sabir on the mezzanine of L’envers, a narrow bar with a hipster vibe, strung with bare filament bulbs. Here, local art vies for space on the walls with graffiti and Arabic calligraphy. It’s midnight on Monday but the place is heaving, with dancers whistling and throwing shapes. L’envers is unique in Marrakech, a bar dedicated to underground culture, with local DJs four nights a week and a defiantly open music policy. As Sabir brings in a brutal bass line the place erupts and a few people lose their beers. It’s OK though: the drinks here are some of the cheapest in town. Though Marrakech has a lot of clubs, none is wholly dedicated to electronic music. Commercial places such as Mariinski and Rasputin run electronic nights but they’re very expensive. However, there are raucous parties for those who know where to look. The trick is to follow local promoters such as Plug-in Souls, RAK Electronik or Moroko Loko, who host parties in poolside venues such as Fellah Hotel and Jnan Lotf on the outskirts of the city. Entrance costs £15-£25 and often includes food and use of the pool. Locals dance hard and are very welcoming – it’s hard to leave a party without a clutch of new friends. “There’s an intensity you can see in the people,” says Amine K, slapping his wrist. “People go out to listen to music and party hard.” At Moroccan weddings, he says, you’ll see 70-year-olds dancing until 5am. “We are a people who like to enjoy life. Moroccan people love tribal, repetitive music.” Amine K could also be talking about Gnawa, the spiritual music rooted in Moroccan culture. When music streaming platform Boiler Room came to Marrakech in 2014, it filmed a performance by Gnawa master Mahmoud Guinia. Halfway through the set, Guinia and his group abruptly stopped playing and sat in silence. After a moment, the adhan, or call to prayer, echoed through the courtyard: in Islam it is forbidden to play music during the call to prayer. After a few minutes, the group started where they’d left off. This confluence of traditional and modern cultures is one of the unique draws of Morocco’s club scene: strobes blaze across Islamic mosaics and techno rhythms are loosened by the lilting rhythm of the goblet-shaped darbouka drum. Before I arrived in Marrakech I wondered if the rash of new events was just the boutique festival machine finding a new destination, having little impact locally apart from lining the pockets of hoteliers. Instead, I found a vital party circuit ready to take off, with promoters and DJs building a scene according to their own visions. Yasmean is a DJ from Casablanca who performed at Atlas Electronic this summer. She said: “I saw my country wasn’t doing parties the way it should and it broke my heart. The change needed to come from within. It was a struggle but I’m thrilled every time I go to a local party. We’re really making it happen.” • This trip was provided by Oasis (theoasisfest.com)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/26/dilys-howell-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T16:37:29Z","webTitle":"Dilys Howell obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/26/dilys-howell-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/26/dilys-howell-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Dilys Howell obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My cousin Dilys Howell, who has died aged 90, was a television director and producer whose education and religious programmes included ITV’s flagship Stop Look Listen. Aimed at seven-year-olds and above, it was widely used as a teaching aid for the English language. Between 1968 and 1993 she worked on more than 60 programmes, mainly on film, including documentaries on subjects ranging from bricklaying to sausage making and carmaking, and from pottery and pilgrimages to coalmining. She also made an often-repeated French language teaching series, for which she had to teach herself French from scratch, as well as the religious education programme Believe It Or Not. Born in Oswestry, Shropshire, the youngest of four daughters of Frederick Howell, a corn and seed merchant, and Mabel (nee Edwards), she was brought up by her mother, her oldest sister, Phyllis, and her aunt and uncle after the early death of her father. On leaving Howell’s school, Denbigh, she went to the Central School of Speech and Drama to study speech therapy, but soon changed to stage management. Her first job in the early 50s was as an assistant stage manager with Amersham rep, and she then joined the Wilson Barrett repertory company, with which she travelled the length and breadth of Britain, and toured South Africa. In her late 20s she joined BBC radio, and then moved into television in its early days, as a floor manager, vision mixer, then director and producer. The religious programmes covered all faiths, and often involved travel far afield. She was particularly proud of a rare interview – not long before his murder in 2005 – with the influential cleric Roger Schütz, known as Brother Roger, founder of the ecumenical Taizé movement. She spotted the potential of the young Chris Tarrant, who did many voiceovers for her education programmes, including Pottery, and a Stop Look Listen programme about ice cream (1983). Long after he became well known, he continued to voice many programmes for her out of loyalty to the person who had given him some of his earliest experience in broadcasting. Her antidote to the pressures of television was to restore a Tudor cottage in Chirbury, Shopshire, rebuilding many of the dry stone walls herself. In the early 80s she and her niece Carolyn ran highly popular needlepoint workshops there, and she also had a particular interest in making and collecting exquisite miniature furniture and needlework for doll’s houses. After her retirement in 1993, she devoted herself to birds and animals, supporting rescue charities, as well as caring for a large menagerie of dogs, cats and foxes at her then home in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham. She is survived by her nephews, Robert and Julian, her nieces Carolyn, Pamela and Charlotte, eight great-nephews and nieces and eight great-great-nephews and nieces."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/10/mall-of-america-poet-brian-sonia-wallace","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T11:00:46Z","webTitle":"What happened when a poet was sent to the biggest US mall to write for shoppers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/10/mall-of-america-poet-brian-sonia-wallace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/10/mall-of-america-poet-brian-sonia-wallace","fields":{"headline":"What happened when a poet was sent to the biggest US mall to write for shoppers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In March of 2017, I responded to a ridiculous post that a friend shared on Facebook. “Apply now! Mall of America seeks writer-in-residence to celebrate its 25th birthday!” A quick Google search turned up reams of articles skewering the residency as nothing but a shameless publicity stunt for the biggest mall in North America, deriding the idea that a writer would come and be inspired by a Nordstrom or its customers. “Hey,” I thought, “if the supreme court says corporations are people, why can’t a mall have a birthday? It even has a parent company!” Competing to stand out in the longest of long shots against 4,300 applicants for the mall residency, I wrote an 800-word poem and sent it as a PDF so I could include unsolicited pictures of my typewriter in action with crowds of adorable children. In corporate America, I understood literary merit wasn’t what I was selling. I was a photo op, an interactive novelty and, though corporate clients usually only learned this in retrospect, a budget therapist. The poem with which I sold myself to corporate America ended with these lines: This vision is about writing as connection – poetry as a service industry. This is a vision of poetry as it can be, brought down from the ivory tower and into the mall, out to the public, bards spinning tales in Viking marketplaces … What is a mall but the repository of our collective desire? … And what, poetry, but the shortest distance between feeling and expression? ••• This was my setup: each day, for four hours, I’d be stationed at a different place in the mall. I’d arrive at the standard-issue mall-white table and chairs and set up my typewriters – a teal Olvetti for myself, and a Smith Corona I’d painted orange-yellow and decorated with roses, which I kept facing outward as an invitation for kids to try a typewriter for the first time. Over five days, I would write poems for a hundred people who came up to me and answered the question: “What do you need a poem about?” Every time I write for strangers in public, I’m nervous. I always wonder: will this be the time, the place, where no one wants a poem? But even at the mall, when we set up to take photos, people stopped and I breathed a sigh of relief. Poetry would work, here, next to Wetzel’s Pretzels. When a middle-aged woman just passing by learned that I was writing poems based on any topic people gave me, she barked, “My word is Disney!” so quickly and aggressively that I jumped. The first person I wrote for was John, my de facto boss at the mall. He started things off with a surprising burst of vulnerability. John wanted a poem about his son. The son was a father himself, now, and this would be part of his gift for Father’s Day that Sunday. John told me about a trip to Disneyland for his 50th birthday that his son had surprised him with, about raising a kid as a single dad, and his hopes that the next generation would do better than he could. He and his son share a love for Disney, he told me, those Florida vacations a point of easy intimacy in a world where grown men are rarely allowed to show their feelings to one another. When I asked their favorite Disney story, John said: “Peter Pan.” The boy who never grows up. I’d never been a Disney kid. Though I grew up just an hour from Disneyland in California, my one trip there as a kid with my mom ended up a disastrous slog through heat and endless lines, and we’d never gone again. Because my hippy parents refused to allow a TV set into our house, I even missed out on the perpetual loop of Disney classics on VHS that acted as surrogate parents to raise so many in my generation. Suffice it to say, I did not understand Disney. But I at least knew the story of Peter Pan, and I had some ideas about dads. I digested everything John told me, through the typewriter, while he watched, into a poem that started: We never stopped believing in faeries… we were lost boys, both of us And ended: There is no one I would rather not grow up with than you. I was about halfway through reading the poem out loud to John when he started to tear up. All of his staff was gathered around, with a camera crew from the local news station to boot, and this silver-haired man, who was the reason I was here in the first place, just bawled and hugged me and disappeared. Day one, I’d made my boss cry, and he liked it. But John wasn’t the last person to cry in front of me outside of Nordstrom. The mall team was keen that I track certain metrics so that they had fun facts to share on social media: number of poems written, number of steps walked around the building’s cavernous interior. After my first day writing, I started keeping another tally – the number of people who cried. It happened every day, like clockwork: four or five people would come away from our interaction with water streaming down their faces, weeping openly in front of the Lego store. In the end, 20% of all the people I wrote for in the mall wound up in tears. When people come to a mall, especially this mall, they come to scratch an itch. People come to the Mall of America with intention. They are looking for something. Sometimes it’s ice cream, sometimes clothing, and sometimes it’s just reconnecting with family. Old folks who come for exercise in the morning give way to afternoon shoppers and diverse families in the evening, tourists and immigrants alike indoctrinating their kids in Americana. Everyone’s in a special state, somewhere between empty and full, invisible and seen. The mall boasts that it’s the number one tourist destination in the midwest, with 40 million annual visitors. It might not be the Happiest Place on Earth, but it’s big enough to be “of America”. When I stalked the mall with just my notebook, scribbling observations, it earned me no end of sideways glances from families and shoppers. What could this dude be writing about? Us? This was a place for uncritical experience, not methodical reflection. I was a poor spy, and middle America, actively assimilating under their bindis and hijabs, shrunk away from me and my notebook. But behind the typewriter, when people knew for certain that I was writing about them, I transformed from spy to priest. As the temporary darling of the mall’s publicity machine, pilgrims began to search me out. Some people came back day after day. Empathy became addictive, beautiful moments stacking up, gift-giving and gratitude and people crying. People started bringing gifts themselves, making offerings, and gaining absolution: “I read about you in the Star Tribune,” or “I saw you on the TV.” They brought me their own poems, their photographs, newspaper articles they’d clipped out which they thought might interest me, handwritten lists of places I should go to write, birthday cards because they’d heard it was my birthday. Some of the people told me about other pilgrimages they’ve made, Tibetan meditation retreats to concerts in other countries. A young Korean American woman asked for a poem about her favorite Korean pop star. “My sister and I have been in this fandom for ten years,” she told me. “As a poor college student, I spent all my money to get to Hong Kong and Hawaii for concerts.” There was a comfort, she said, in admiring someone so much that you’d literally cross oceans to see them for two hours. Another woman stopped by a few days later with a story about a solo three-day trip to California to see her K-pop crush. She’d spent 13 hours in the sun arguing with security, finally breaking down in tears mid-concert at how simultaneously worth it and not worth it the whole experience had been. The people who came to the mall seemed to have this terrible longing to speak and be listened to, to be witnessed. A base, human need to break from the constant impersonal bombardment of consumer culture that lives in that space and to sit, in silence, with a stranger who was there explicitly to care about personal stories. Lots of people would ask how much the poems cost – in a citadel of commerce, unless the free thing is a sample to lure us into buying, nothing is free. ••• Nathan and his wife Abby, John’s No 2 in PR, met here, at the mall. At dinner, John shared his story about hiring her, about how she’d worked all over the park in minimum wage positions, temping on this project and interning there, persisting. In this millennial world, to keep a job, the key was not to have the best credentials but to cling to the targeted employer and refuse to let go. The word “passion” scared me for what it revealed about the deeply held convictions corporate employees are required to hold. But there was a homemade quality to the mall. I’d been afraid that the team would be corporate drones, but they were star-crossed lovers and single dads, and they loved kids and rollercoasters because they were kids themselves. Abby and Nathan talked about finding each other, at last, after tough times, a relationship that blossomed despite painful reminders of the past. “Battle scars mean you’ve survived,” Nathan said. He was a single dad raising his son, a 10-year-old from a previous relationship with awesome green hair, until he met Abby. Nathan told me that they were their own worst enemies, struggling against the self-doubt they carry. They had a pressed earnestness when they invited me to their family barbecue. What emerged was a realness desperately constructed through consumption and imitation, fandom not as a distraction but a weapon and a shield against the painful vicissitudes of family drama and divorce and the loneliness of drowning in a grown-up world. The goal of the mall wasn’t just entertainment, what Abby and John and Nathan and the whole crew were trying to create, by making each mall experience a story, was feeling. As the mall reached the end of its day, I made my way to Nickelodeon Universe to catch the end-of-day light show, designed to make getting through a day at the mall feel like a celebration. Nathan talked about the challenge programming a light show with a glass ceiling under an airplane flyway, trying not to blind pilots ferrying passengers to every corner of the United States. Under the dancing lights, elementary-school age kids with faces painted like skulls jerked and cavorted while smoke rose from the ticket booth. A woman’s voice that sounded like it was ripped straight out of an animated kids’ movie crooned a pop song: “We’re always here – always heeeeeere for you!” At the end of every day, the mall closed with this light show and song. In an age when malls are closing left and right, the story of physical experience abandoned in favor of online shopping, it was a promise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/27/fifa-18-review-football-tackling-tactics-goalkeeping-intelligence-new-story-pes","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T10:31:17Z","webTitle":"Fifa 18 review: plenty of footballing bang for your bucks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/27/fifa-18-review-football-tackling-tactics-goalkeeping-intelligence-new-story-pes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/27/fifa-18-review-football-tackling-tactics-goalkeeping-intelligence-new-story-pes","fields":{"headline":"Fifa 18 review: plenty of footballing bang for your bucks","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The long-running video game rivalry between Fifa and Pro Evolution Soccer is every bit as partisan as Arsenal v Spurs or City v United. At least 90 per cent of football sim fans make their respective buying decisions long before either game hits the shelves: PES season ticket holders decry the opposition as all-style, no-substance, while Fifa disciples mock their foe’s licensing issues and off-key presentation. There’s little reasoning with either side. The 2017-18 editions of the big two reveal those preconceptions to be built upon half-truths. PES 2018 does suffer from publisher Konami’s lack of riches comparative to EA’s, with Man Blue, Man Red and North East London duking it out for top-flight honours. Yet its on-field action is a touch more substantive, the smoothest passing system seen in a video game especially worthy of praise. But in a sport whose very foundations centre on vanity and bragging rights, where Sunday League pretenders attempt stepovers in pro-aping luminescent boots, it’s snobbish to dismiss the stylings of Fifa. On the pitch it’s very good if not quite excellent, and off, it dwarfs all contemporaries, Pro Evo included. The majority of fans really do care that all major top flight clubs are present and correct, with authentic faces, kits and – increasingly – stadia. La Liga and MLS join the Premier League in having TV-accurate presentation overlays. Devotees of Ultimate Team, meanwhile, share stories of spending 200+ hours in the mode building teams and completing squad building challenges, in addition to time spent playing matches. I know, because I did exactly that in Fifa 17. Fifa’s omnipresent card-trading mode is again bolstered this year with offline-only squad battles, where defeating celebrity- or community-created dream teams earns mammoth in-game rewards. At £50, the exhaustive depth of this mode represents more-than-respectable value. For the purist who considers on-pitch action paramount, Fifa does look to resolve some longstanding gripes. From a player-control perspective, that means a completely reworked crossing mechanic; simplified to a single tap of the square button on PS4 for a default ball into the box, and a double-tap for a low cross. Default, however, is an understatement; players truly whip the ball through the area this year, causing havoc for defenders and meaning a fast-winger/strong-header combo is often devastating. Also upgraded are off-the-ball runs, low shots, a new halfway-house standing tackle and goalkeeper awareness. After years of accusations that net-minders are broken, there are now times where they feel too strong, emphatically repelling deliveries into the six-yard box (likely a design call implemented to prevent that new crossing system from becoming too deadly) and palming low shots away with such ferocity that throws-in near the corner flag stockpile in record numbers. Better that than too many goals conceded through flaky glove work, although it won’t be a surprise if the first patch downgrades the Hulk fists. Welcome changes are introduced from an AI opponent standpoint. Recent Fifa reviews have repeatedly criticised a lack of tactical variety from computer-controlled teams, and it’s addressed by every one of the game’s 700-plus sides being given two of 12 possible play styles. (One attacking, one defensive.) It doesn’t completely eliminate the issue, and is still an area where PES outperforms Fifa, but at least ensures career mode matches against possession-heavy Arsenal, Vardy-targeting Leicester and stoic, defensive Burnley no longer feel identical. Other career mode changes equate to subtle Mourinho-style tinkering rather than wanton Redknapp-like reconstruction. A big deal was made of Fifa 17’s Frostbite implementation, and the engine now feeds into careers by way of face-to-face transfer negotiations; try to buy a player from Real or Chelsea and you actually get to sit down with Zidane or Conte to seal the deal, using click-wheel conversational choices. It’s a constant smile-raiser at Premier League level; less so when controlling Exeter City and being confronted with a series of suit-wearing genero-heads. Even Fifa’s licensing doesn’t stretch to fourth-tier managers. Transfers are much improved generally, with a new bespoke hub enabling you to manage all incoming and outgoing moves in list form, instead of having to trudge through labyrinthine menus to get any deal done. One area of Fifa to which PES has no answer is The Journey: Hunter Returns. Where fictional prospect Alex Hunter’s predictable-yet-fun story rode a voice-acting rollercoaster in Fifa 17, season two finds both scriptwriters and cast on mature, Tuesday-night-ITV calibre form. Tomiwa Edun (Hunter), Sharon Duncan-Brewster (mum Catherine) and Lisa Solberg (I won’t spoil it) offer understated-yet-polished performances opposite footballing names such as Rio Ferdinand, Thierry Henry, and Cristiano Ronaldo. OK, Ronny’s bits are excruciating, but the tale is just about believable and contains agreeable diversions from matches and cut-scenes: a Fifa Street-like mini-game in Brazil, a training session with Solberg’s character in LA and – later on – neat player-choice elements when selecting a new club and famous strike partner. Plus this time around, your cut-scene decisions shape the mode from a cosmetic standpoint. Hunter’s hair, tattoos, casual wear and kit accessories (tape, wristbands, those aforementioned luminescent boots) can all be customised via a smart, GTA-influenced wardrobe selection screen, and many of these items – such as a monstrous leopard-print hair-don’t, cloned from Paul Pogba’s Juventus days – are only unlocked by developing Hunter’s personality in a certain direction. It’s a thoroughly enjoyable mode lasting between 12-15 hours, depending on key choices – the same length as many a full-priced game outside of the sports genre, again hammering home Fifa 18’s strong value proposition. Whichever side of the footballing gulf you plant your neon footwear, there’s no question that EA’s behemoth delivers bang for its megabucks.

Thanks for following. Here is Jamie Jackson’s report from the Etihad. There’s still plenty more football today. Leicester City v Liverpool is about to begin soon. Follow the liveblog here: So what have we learned? This was an easy win for Manchester City – and an expected one too – but their wide range of scoring options will leave the rest of the Premier League worried. As for Palace, it is hard to see them even scoring against their upcoming opponents: Manchester United, Chelsea and Newcastle United. It’s going to be a long, long season for Palace. The referee puts Palace out of their misery. They are still winless and goalless. Meanwhile, City cannot stop scoring – that’s 21 goals they have now scored in the Premier League. They are top on goal difference. A beauty from substitute Fabian Delph, with a curling long-range effort with his right foot. Poor old Palace. A devastating afternoon for Hodgson’s men. 86min: Leroy Sane voted man of the match. And quite right, too. Sergio Aguero joins in the fun with a simple header after an excellent cross from the left by Sane. The Argentine is now just one goal away from equalling Eric Brook’s record City haul of 177. Sane has been excellent. 75min: Sane claims for a penalty after having his arm pulled by in a tussle with Timothy Fosu-Mensah but instead receives a booking for his subsequent complaints. Guardiola is far from pleased on the sidelines. Schlupp also goes into the referee’s notebook for fouling Danilo. 70min: It goes from bad to worse for Palace. Striker Christian Benteke has taken a worrying knock and is coming off. Bakary Sako is on which means Palace have a Sako and a Sakho on at the same time – could get confusing. 69min: With a Champions League group game against Shakhtar Donetsk to come in midweek, Guardiola is wisely resting his key players with this game all but won. Fabian Delph is on for John Stones. Another goal for City and another for Sterling. De Bruyne plays the ball over the City defence, Aguero unselfishly squares the ball for Sterling to tap in. And with that he is substituted off, with Bernardo Silva coming on. 56min: Booking for City substitute Danilo after he hacked down Townsend. Meanwhile, Jason Puncheon is on for Yohan Cabaye. Mendy also received a yellow card before he came off with an injury, I should add. Sane, the goalscorer, this time turns provider as he squares the ball from the left to Raheem Sterling to score from close range. Was it Sane that Joachim Löw came to see? If so, he will be impressed. Hard to see Palace coming back from this. 46min: City get us underway for the second half. There were some raised eyebrows when the team was announced why Sane was given a starting berth by Guardiola – but he showed just why with a classy goal to give City a deserved lead. Palace have had their chances, particularly through Loftus-Cheek, but they will have entered the dressing room deflated by that late goal. 45min: Peep! And that’s the half-time whistle, with City one goal to the good. And there’s the breakthrough. Leroy Sane plays a lovely one-two with David Silva, collects the ball and neatly dinks the ball past a Palace defender and then Hennessey into the net. It is Sane’s fifth goal from just six shots on target in all competitions for City this season. With Manchester United and Chelsea also winning, it is a timely goal for the home side – and agony for Palace who had done so well to keep the game goalless for so long. 37min: A deep sense of frustration is growing among the City fans at the Etihad as Palace begin wasting time before the break. Hodgson will be delighted with how his team have performed thus far. Guardiola is even giving a pep-talk to a ball boy to keep the action going. 33min: Aguero, who is just three goals shy of becoming City’s all-time leading scorer, scoops the ball over the bar from close range. “How is this still nil-nil?” asks the NBC TV commentator. 27min: Loftus-Cheek comes close again, dragging the ball just wide. Meanwhile, there is an early injury-enforced substitution for Manchester City – Mendy is off, with Danilo coming on. 19min: The woodwork is hit again by a Palace player but it is almost a goal for the visitors. Loftus-Cheek smashes the post with a long-range effort. One keen observer in the City stands is Germany head coach Joachim Löw. 12min: City keep knocking at the door. Fernandinho fires on target from close range but it goes straight to Hennessey, who parries well. Still goalless. Further to my tweet about the City dressing room and the Royal Albert Hall, Noel Bayley emails in: “The Albert Hall roof was, of course, manufactured a couple of miles away from here (ie The Etihad), in Ardwick - which is where City originated...” How about that? 6min: Early chance for City. Sakho almost scores a spectacular own goal with his head after a dangerous ball from De Bruyne, hitting the post and out. 5min: City are dominating possession, coolly passing the ball between themselves, much as Guardiola’s Barcelona teams used to. How long before they find a breakthrough goal? 1min: Crystal Palace kick off and immediately give the ball away. It could be a long afternoon for the south London side. As we wait for the game to start, why not sign up for The Recap. It includes stand-out features and interviews, insightful analysis and highlights from the archive, plus films, podcasts, galleries and more... Ever wondered what the Manchester City dressing room looks like? A little like the Royal Albert Hall (well the ceiling anyway). Kick-off is coming up. What’s happening in the other Premier League games and around England and Scotland? Find out here: Pep Guardiola on NBC: “We are OK after just five games. Players from Crystal Palace have the quality so anything can happen.” The Catlan has given Leroy Sane a rare start, with Gabriel Jesus having to make do with a place on the bench. Hodgson said: “There is some belief and confidence in the team but ideally we need some good performances and good results to boost that belief and confidence.” Tottenham, meanwhile, have held on to defeat West Ham 3-2. It got a little nervy at the end there for Mauricio Pochettino’s men. North of the border, Celtic have just defeated Rangers 2-0. Just seven games into the new Scottish Premiership season, eight points now stand between the Old Firm rivals. Are they, in fact, still rivals? Roy Hodgson, for his part, is clinging to Fulham’s unlikely survival under his stewardship nine years ago as inspiration to keep Palace in the Premier League. “We were doomed, week after week, but we just kept believing,” Hodgson said, before adding of the current campaign: “As far as we’re concerned, May is still a long way off. It’s up to us to keep improving, keep working hard and pick up some points along the way so we’re at the right end of the table come May. I refuse to believe we’re doomed.” Man City: Ederson, Walker, Stones, Otamendi, Mendy, De Bruyne, Fernandinho, Silva, Sterling, Aguero, Sane. Subs: Bravo, Danilo, Mangala, Delph, Bernardo Silva, Gabriel Jesus, Toure. Crystal Palace: Hennessey, Fosu-Mensah, Dann, Sakho, Van Aanholt, Milivojevic, Cabaye, Townsend, Loftus-Cheek, Schlupp, Benteke. Subs: Speroni, Ward, Tomkins, McArthur, Sako, Puncheon, Riedewald. Referee: Neil Swarbrick (Lancashire). It’s top v bottom and, what’s more, a team who have scored 16 goals in their opening five Premier League matches against a team who have scored, um, none. “We should be embracing the challenge,” said Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson unconvincingly on Friday, before adding: “But, realistically, we know they have a better chance on paper than we do.” The fixture list has not been kind to Hodgson. As he tries to pick up the pieces of Frank de Boer’s miserable (and brief) spell in charge, Palace take on City today before fixtures against Manchester United, Chelsea and Newcastle United. At least in their effort to shore up their defence Mamadou Sakho, the former Liverpool defender, is due to make his first Premier League start since his permanent move to Selhurst Park. “We hope, with his quality and his leadership qualities, he helps us move away from the relegation zone,” Hodgson added. As for City, Sergio Agüero can make Manchester City history today. The Argentine, who scored a hat-trick against Watford last weekend, is just two goals shy of equalling Eric Brook’s record City haul of 177. “That is going to happen – he is going to take that record,” said City manager Pep Guardiola. “He has to be so proud, and Manchester City have to be so proud of that.” Bob will be here soon.

Manafort had known Donald Trump for a couple of decades, and the two men, only three years apart in age, had friends and certain superficial traits in common, including their tastes for expensive suits and lavish waterfront real estate. But Manafort, then engaged in a lucrative political consulting business based in Kiev, the Ukrainan capital, had an air of keen intellect and global savvy that his landlord lacked. When they crossed one another in the elevator, they were casually friendly, in an incurious kind of way, acquaintances have said. Less than a decade later, Trump and Manafort are much more closely entwined, to their mutual discomfort. In the spring of 2016, as he sought to prevent a fight for the Republican presidential nomination from breaking out on the floor of the party’s national convention, Trump would hire the man from the elevator, a longtime political operator who happened to be a veteran of a similar struggle in 1976. Five months later, the partnership would end in shambles, with Manafort forced to resign as Trump’s campaign chairman over his controversial work in the former Soviet Union and questions about his personal finances. The final straw was a newspaper article in August claiming that Trump’s attention span was so short that aides had to go on TV to catch his eye. “You think you gotta go on TV to talk to me?” Trump reportedly said to Manafort in front of other senior aides. “You treat me like a baby! Am I like a baby to you … Am I a fucking baby, Paul?” Manafort resigned and, that same day, in something of a signature move, set up a shell company which would soon receive millions of dollars in loans, including $13m from two businesses with ties to Trump, according to media reports. The purpose of the loans was unclear. The public may soon know more about Manafort’s money, however. As part of his investigation of alleged ties between the Trump presidential campaign and Russian operatives, special counsel Robert Mueller is believed to be conducting a major money-laundering investigation of Manafort’s activities going back to at least 2006. The presence of Mueller, a former FBI director, and his mission to investigate alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives, represent a twist neither Trump nor Manafort could have foreseen. Mueller was appointed after Trump’s firing of FBI director James Comey and since his appointment, his portfolio has gradually expanded to include Manafort’s business affairs. Manafort has not been charged with a crime, and a spokesman denied the allegations against him. Former prosecutors believe Mueller’s interest in Manafort indicates an effort to get Manafort to testify about the inner workings of the Trump presidential campaign. If Mueller can get Manafort to flip allegiances, his testimony could strengthen any potential obstruction of justice or campaign finance case against Trump or his coterie. So far, Manafort, 68, does not appear to be cooperating with the investigation. Justice department lawyers have informed Manafort, however, that he is a target – as opposed to a witness, or a subject – meaning that an indictment might not be far off. And that could change everything. “To date, it does not look like he has shown any interest in cooperating, at least publicly,” said Joyce Vance, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches at the University of Alabama law school. “How that looks when he’s staring down the barrel of an indictment is a different question. “For instance, if prosecutors were to make a money-laundering case on him, there is some pretty long potential sentence time. And he might decide that he would rather cooperate than spend 20 years in a federal penitentiary. “It may be a question of whether he wants to die in prison or not.” ‘The Torturers’ Lobby’ There are multiple versions of how Trump and Manafort met. The political operative and longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone claims to have introduced the two at the 1988 Republican national convention in New Orleans. Another version has the introduction made by the late Roy Cohn, Trump’s former lawyer and his escort through the sybaritic 1980s New York nightlife. Stone, one of Manafort’s earliest professional associates, is in a position to know. After successfully working to elect Ronald Reagan in 1980, Manafort and Stone opened a lobbying firm with associates Charles Black and, later, Peter Kelly. The firm came to specialize in cultivating favors in Washington on behalf of foreign clients with tricky images. “Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly lined up most of the dictators in the world that we could find,” Stone said in a podcast last year. “Pro-western dictators of course. Dictators are in the eye of the beholder.” It wasn’t empty boasting. A 1982 article in Spy magazine ranked the firm at the top of its “blood-on-the-hands” index of Washington lobbyists, for its foreign accounts from Somalia to Zaire to the Dominican Republic. A 1992 Center for Public Integrity report titled The Torturers’ Lobby detailed payments the firm had taken from foreign regimes, and corresponding US aid that flowed to those regimes. The firm’s client list included Zaire’s Mobutu Sese Seko (1989); the Philippines’ Ferdinand Marcos (1985); Angolan rebel Jonas Savimbi (1985); and regimes in Kenya and Nigeria accused of committing human rights abuses. Manafort had a relationship with Abdul Rahman el-Assir, a Lebanese arms dealer who by Manafort’s own account paid him almost $87,000 in 1994 to advise a French presidential candidate. In 1991 alone, Manafort’s firm took in more than $3m in fees to represent regimes in Nigeria, Kenya, the Philippines and Savimbi’s group Unita, according to the CPI report. Manafort’s strength as a lobbyist was directly related to his skill as a political adviser, and the relationships he built by re-entering the campaign cycle every four years. He played central roles in the Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush and Bob Dole presidential campaigns. Trump hired him in part for his experience on the 1976 Gerald Ford campaign, when Manafort helped to beat back a potential convention challenge by Reagan. At times, Manafort’s extreme efficacy at making Washington work for his clients attracted the wrong kind of attention. In one infamous episode in the mid-1980s, Manafort, representing a developer, extracted a $43m grant from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development for housing in New Jersey that local officials did not want. Called to testify before Congress about the deal, Manafort was uncowed. “I will stipulate for the purposes of today that you can characterize this as influence-peddling,” he said. The Ukraine years Manafort’s move into the former Soviet bloc after his most active Washington years set him on a course that would sharpen questions about the Trump campaign and Russia ties, and eventually fuel the investigation now placing everyone from the president on down in legal jeopardy. In the autumn of 2005, Manafort and associates opened an office at 4 Sophia Street in Kiev. For the next decade, Manafort would perform consulting work for the Ukrainian Party of Regions, whose leader, Viktor Yanukovych, had made a botched grab at the presidency a year earlier. Manafort had been recruited by the Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov, the party’s main backer, to rehabilitate Yanukovych and advance the party. “As a person, he [Yanukovych] is growing,” Manafort told the Guardian’s Luke Harding in 2007. “I think the time out of power helped him.” Yanukovych won the presidency in 2010. “The role that I played in that administration was to help bring Ukraine into Europe, and we did,” Manafort said in an interview last April. “We succeeded.” Manafort’s work was not limited to Ukrainian politics. He entered business relationships with Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash and with Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch with close ties to Putin. It is unclear when Manafort’s relationship with Deripaska ended, if it has. Earlier this week, the Washington Post reported that during his time as Trump’s campaign chairman, Manafort offered Deripaska “private briefings” on the election. During the Ukrainian years, the lobbyist’s financial arrangements became increasingly byzantine. After Yanukovych fell in 2014, a hand-written ledger was recovered at his house, which showed $12.7m paid to Manafort. An ensuing Ukrainian investigation found no evidence of illicit payments to Manafort. But multiple payments from the ledger have been confirmed, including $1.2m that arrived to Manafort’s consulting firm in the United States via companies once registered in Belize, according to an Associated Press investigation. Federal prosecutors are looking at that money flow, as well as accounts tied to Manafort in Cyprus, a tax haven; and at contemporaneous real estate investments by Manafort in New York, Florida, Virginia and Los Angeles. Manafort’s spokesman has pointed out that it is not illegal to be paid for foreign work. People who conduct that work are required by law, however, to register with the US government as foreign agents, which Manafort failed to do at the time. His status as a foreign agent was officially unknown when he ran Trump’s presidential campaign. It was only in June of this year that Manafort registered his years of lobbying activity in the former Soviet bloc. In thousands of hacked text messages posted in 2014 on a Ukrainian website, his daughter Andrea, a lawyer, said his activities in Ukraine were “legally questionable”. “Don’t fool yourself,” Andrea Manafort wrote in one message to her sister, Jessica. “That money we have is blood money.” Will Manafort flip? In the early morning hours of 26 July, Manafort and his wife Kathleen were in bed at home in Alexandria, Virginia, when FBI agents entered without knocking, guns drawn, to seize files, computer drives and other potential evidence. Afterwards, Trump came to Manafort’s defense. “I’ve always found Paul Manafort to be a very decent man,” the president said. “He’s like a lot of other people, probably makes consultant fees from all over the place, who knows, I don’t know, but I thought it was pretty tough stuff to wake him up, perhaps his family was there.” But Manafort had reason to expect clashes with law enforcement. The Wall Street Journal and CNN reported this week that Manafort had been under government surveillance before the campaign, possibly as early as 2014. Based on that surveillance and other potential unknown activity, investigators are likely to already know much more about Manafort’s activities than has been made public. They may seek to convert that intelligence into knowledge about Trump’s activities, said Vance, the former prosecutor. “This is someone who had an apartment in Trump Tower, who was in meetings with Jared Kushner and Donald Trump Jr, and he presumably spoke to the president very frequently,” she said. “The question is, what did he see firsthand? What did he observe, what did he participate in, what did he read, what did he know?” Manafort CV Born 1 April, 1949, in New Britain, Connecticut Family His father was the popular Republican mayor of a working-class, largely Democratic town.

McKeague was last seen in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 24 September last year, entering a bin loading bay known as the Horseshoe at about 3.25am. Although the four men are not being treated as suspects or key witnesses, police have appealed for all those in the CCTV images to come forward. Officers believe the group might have information that could help police understand what happened to McKeague, 24. One of the men, seen in the entrance to Flex nightclub, identified himself on Thursday. Suffolk police hope to speak to the other men in due course. A Suffolk police spokesman said there had been a “brief interaction ending on friendly terms” and that “the group of four knew Corrie and joked with him before they went their separate ways”. McKeague, from Fife, Scotland, had been “known to sleep in rubbish” while on a night out, according to police. The movement of McKeague’s phone signal matched that of a bin lorry that picked up rubbish from bins in the Horseshoe loading area. Detectives traced the RAF gunner’s mobile phone signal to Barton Mills, about 14 miles away, shortly after 4am. However, an error in reporting the weight of the truck meant that police initially did not search the landfill. Police subsequently conducted a 20-week search of the site but found no remains. Suffolk constabulary has already spent more than £1m investigating McKeague’s disappearance, with Sunday marking a year since he vanished. This weekend, police will set up a pod on Brentgovel Street in Bury St Edmunds for people to come forward with information. Katie Elliott, the deputy superintendent, said the search for Corrie remained an active investigation. ‘We have deliberately placed the police pod on Brentgovel Street as we know this is the route Corrie took on that evening,” she said. “We would appeal directly to the public who were out in Bury St Edmunds exactly 12 months ago on the night he went missing and, maybe a year on, are once again back in the town centre this weekend.” Nicola Urquhart, McKeague’s mother, responded to the latest information on Facebook, saying that that she will retrace her son’s final steps this weekend in a bid to “jog someone’s memory” and solve the case."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/22/the-facts-about-girls-mental-health-laid-bare","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T17:38:06Z","webTitle":"The facts about girls’ mental health laid bare | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/22/the-facts-about-girls-mental-health-laid-bare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/22/the-facts-about-girls-mental-health-laid-bare","fields":{"headline":"The facts about girls’ mental health laid bare","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"New research showing that one in four girls have signs of depression (Report, 20 September) is yet more evidence of an alarming trend of increasingly poor mental health among girls and young women. Young women are now the most at risk group for mental ill health, with extremely high rates of self-harm and post-traumatic stress disorder. Although the drivers of mental ill health are complicated, we can’t ignore the fact that poor mental health among women and girls is often closely linked to physical and sexual abuse. Agenda’s own research has shown that more than half of women who have mental health problems have experienced abuse. This needs to be addressed. To avert a growing crisis in women and girls’ mental health, the government and health service need to take urgent action. We need to see investment in services in schools and in the community – and we must also ensure that the care and support women and girls receive takes into account their specific needs, particularly their experience of trauma. Katharine Sacks-Jones Director of Agenda, the alliance for women and girls at risk and co-chair of the Women’s Mental Health Taskforce, Department of Health • As a girls’ rights charity, we welcome the study commissioned by Girlguiding which shows how many girls in the UK are struggling to express themselves and speak freely because of their gender. Sadly, the fact girls are growing up in environments where stereotypes are reinforced on a daily basis is not news to us. In our report The State of Girls’ Rights in the UK, released last year, we heard from girls who said if they didn’t conform to expectations they were often policed or silenced. We also found that stereotypes around girls’ capabilities were often reinforced by teachers, peers and families. We must address the root causes of gender inequality, including in schools, and stop the persistent, harmful stereotypes that limit girls’ opportunities and wellbeing. A whole-school approach, which includes engaging with boys and parents, is key to tackling this issue. Lucy Russell Campaign manager, UK Girls’ Rights • Thank heaven that at least one national newspaper is addressing head-on the burgeoning crisis in our children’s mental health with the urgency it merits (Editorial, 21 September). Some of us have been banging on about this issue for years – only to be dismissed by many as irresponsible scaremongers. The elephant in the room is undoubtedly the nature of the schooling system itself. Since the 1990s, successive governments of all hues have ratcheted up the unforgiving “audit and accountability culture” in ways that are not only anathema to healthy learning, but which generate enormous amounts of unnecessary stress and anxiety. Such managerialist policy obsessions are invariably anxiety-driven, and almost always bring about the opposite of their alleged intention. In opposition, politicians often say the right things, but then as soon as in government they continue the audit culture all the more furiously and uncritically. It’s time for politicians to listen to progressive voices in the education world, rather than merely to hand-picked advisers whom they know will tell them what they want to hear. Many thousands of children are suffering unnecessarily (not to mention our poor teachers); and only a root-and-branch challenge to the flawed assumptions of the audit and accountability culture will get anywhere near addressing this mental health crisis satisfactorily. Dr Richard House Child psychologist and education campaigner, Stroud, Gloucestershire • The Millennium Cohort Study is a follow-up of a cohort of children born in 2000-01. At 14, for the first time, the children themselves were directly asked about emotional symptoms. The question is important: whether they had experienced a range of emotional symptoms at any time in the previous two weeks. The results showed an increase in emotional symptoms in adolescence, more pronounced for girls (18%) than for boys (11%). This is hardly surprising. We know adolescence to be a time of moody emotions. It is consistent with the two large point-prevalence studies carried out in 1994 and 2004 by National Statistics, which both showed that at any one time 24% of the adult population had emotional symptoms in the previous week. However, “have depression”, meaning depressive disorder, is something else. The diagnosis of even mild depressive disorder requires at least four depressive symptoms to have been present continuously for at least two weeks. The conclusion of alarming levels of depressive illness in girls is unjustified and confuses a transient emotion with mental illness. Dr Richard Symonds Broadstairs, Kent • Is it any coincidence that the alarming increase in poor mental health among the young coincides with the steep decline in provision of local authority youth services since the Conservatives took power in 2010? To this can be added disturbing and much-chronicled surges in the sexual exploitation and abuse of vulnerable young people, knife crime, youth homelessness, obesity, online bullying and anxiety surrounding sexual identity. Youth services used to offer somewhere to go, something to do and, most importantly, someone to talk to. Sadly, far less than they used to.

There was a palpable sense that this tech unicorn was a serious source of progress in big city travel, and that its removal would be a step back into the wilderness. Of course, minicabs did exist before Uber, and will continue to after Uber is gone, but the revolution brought about by the company’s use of technology is undeniable. The question is: at what cost? Progress isn’t always a good thing. It does not have to be accepted regardless of its consequences – whether to the safety of passengers, the living conditions of its drivers, the traffic on our roads, or the amount of tax collected by the Exchequer. Since arriving in the capital in 2012, Uber has become a staple due to its ease of use and relatively low costs – but also the feeling of safety that it has offered people, especially women, travelling alone. That you can be picked up where you are, quickly, by a driver whose face, name and rating you can see beforehand is of great comfort to many. Yet it is fears for passenger safety that makes up a large part of TFL’s reasoning for the ban, and it was only in August that Uber was singled out by the Metropolitan police for a failure to promptly report sex attacks by its drivers. The idea that Uber is the safest way to get home may be more one of perception than reality. The reasons for Uber’s success go far beyond this, though. Uber has broadened accessibility to taxis in much the same way that Ryanair increased access to foreign travel. It’s become a favourite of my generation, who might be able to afford a flat white and avocado on toast, but in London wouldn’t have been able to shell out for a black cab after a night out. That’s not a problem any more. A quick dip on to the app, and a cheap ride is with you in an instant. The appeal isn’t hard to see – why should private hire cars be the sole preserve of the rich? But that doesn’t mean the company can be given a free pass. There isn’t a right to cheap taxi travel around cities any more than there’s one to a £5 flight to Malaga, and if a company behaves badly the authorities have to be able to step in, regardless of how inconvenient that may be to users. And that’s the reason for London’s decision: Uber is not “fit and proper” to hold a licence. After all, digging up dirt on the company is not hard, whether it’s failings on passenger safety, underpaying its drivers (independent contractors of course, not actual “employees”) or the vile sexism of the recently ousted CEO, Travis Kalanick. As my colleague Hannah Jane Parkinson put it, “If it’s shitty behaviour, Uber has probably done it.” This is a company that has become a byword for Silicon Valley excess – it’s not a business model to admire. This makes the number of left-leaning people bemoaning its possible exclusion from one city slightly surprising. Uber makes multibillion-dollar losses. The much-loved convenience and low prices rely on these losses, and on an excess of driver supply, so there’s always a car available when you need it. This isn’t good for the drivers, and ultimately it won’t be good for the passengers. It’s inevitable prices will rise – the company can’t continue to be loss-making for ever – and one theory goes that this will happen once it has driven its competition out of business, and/or developed the driverless cars that will put thousands out of work. Government should not be in the business of encouraging would-be monopolies – as Sadiq Khan said in welcoming the decision, all companies need to “play by the rules”. And if they do, we all benefit: not only from good services, but also from well-paid staff and large, taxable profits. One shouldn’t expect TfL or the London mayor to do anything that might damage public transport. London’s system, despite the many complaints, is very good. The bus network is wide and affordable, the tube is constantly improving, and the night tube still expanding. The idea of us all travelling around in our Ubers everywhere might seem nice, but we’d soon be snarled in endless traffic if mass public transportation were allowed to wither. In any case, despite the wailing, the likely outcome of all of this isn’t that Uber will be driven from our roads for ever – or even at all. It will continue to operate until its appeal is heard – and who knows how long that may take. This decision is about firing a warning shot to Uber and others like them. Big, global companies cannot be allowed to behave however they choose, with politicians forced to accept it for fear that the electorate will rebel if a service they’ve grown to love and rely on is stripped. Corporate responsibility is a must. If this decision forces Uber to clean up its act (perhaps even pay more tax) then it should be welcomed on to our streets, a shining beacon of what the creativity of capitalism can achieve, a business to be respected, not one that debases the entire tech sector. • Toby Moses is assistant opinion editor at the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/25/michael-ondaatje-opens-archive-to-reveal-his-writing-methods","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T06:01:06Z","webTitle":"Michael Ondaatje opens archive to reveal his writing methods","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/25/michael-ondaatje-opens-archive-to-reveal-his-writing-methods","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/25/michael-ondaatje-opens-archive-to-reveal-his-writing-methods","fields":{"headline":"Michael Ondaatje opens archive to reveal his writing methods","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An image of a drunken Oxford party that Michael Ondaatje clipped from a magazine and stuck into a notebook would, years later, inspire a scene in The English Patient, according to the novelist’s archives, which have just been acquired by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. Ondaatje, in an interview with the Center’s director Stephen Ennis, said he writes around four drafts of a book by hand before moving it on to a typewriter or computer and then “reworking it, printing it out, rewriting it by hand”. He added: “During those early stages of handwriting the novels, I sometimes need a few visual breaks along the way. I might stick in someone’s poem fragment, just a few lines, or perhaps a stray visual image of a party at Oxford where quite a few are drunk that I came across in a magazine. There might be perhaps some subliminal influence.” The Sri Lanka-born, Canadian writer said that particular photo inspired part of the book that was later rewritten as a scene where titular character László de Almásy imagines meeting his love interest, Katharine Clifton, when she was young, “long before he actually met her”. Ondaatje said: “When I came upon that long-ago notebook years later — that was the first time I realised and recognised its influence on a scene in The English Patient.” Running to more than 90 boxes, Ondaatje’s archives include the dozens of handwritten notebooks that he uses to write his novels, his hard-to-decipher handwriting peppered with images he has inserted into the pages as he writes. Heavily annotated drafts and notebooks for works including The English Patient, along with novels such as his latest, 2011’s The Cat’s Table, have been collected, along with drafts for his poetry collections and correspondence with authors including Alice Munro, Margaret Atwood and John Berger. His papers also include address books, calendars, photographs, speeches, scripts, as well as correspondence with actors Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas about the film of The English Patient. Ennis called Ondaatje a “master stylist” in both poetry and prose. “Displaced by history, the inhabitants of [his] novels often find their most stable home in language”. Ondaatje, whose next novel – Warlight, following two siblings in the aftermath of the blitz – was announced this week, said that his notebooks each reflect a specific stage in the making of his novels. “I always enjoy the look of these handwritten books more than a typed manuscript. Ideally I would like to publish a novel that way, but my handwriting is terrible, unreadable, even to me sometimes,” he told Ennis. Ondaatje, who lives in Toronto, said that he chose the University of Texas for his archive following a visit to the Ransom Center. “[I] was amazed at their photography collection, then more recently I came back and was shown the literary archive, that gathering of wonders – Robert Browning’s address book, a draft of Faulkner’s Light in August, a letter from Tennyson to Whitman – who knew!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/23/stress-anxiety-fuel-mental-health-crisis-girls-young-women","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"Stress and social media fuel mental health crisis among girls","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/23/stress-anxiety-fuel-mental-health-crisis-girls-young-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/23/stress-anxiety-fuel-mental-health-crisis-girls-young-women","fields":{"headline":"Stress and social media fuel mental health crisis among girls","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Girls and young women are experiencing a “gathering crisis” in their mental health linked to conflict with friends, fears about their body image and pressures created by social media, experts have warned. Rates of stress, anxiety and depression are rising sharply among teenage girls in what mental health specialists say is a “deeply worrying” trend that is far less pronounced among boys of the same age. They warn that the NHS lacks the resources to adequately tackle the problem. New NHS data obtained by the Guardian reveals that the number of times a girl aged 17 or under has been admitted to hospital in England because of self-harm has jumped from 10,500 to more than 17,500 a year over the past decade – a rise of 68%. The jump among boys was much lower: 26%. Cases of self-poisoning among girls – ingesting pills, alcohol or other chemical substances – rose 50%, from 9,700 to 14,600 between 2005-06 and 2015-16. Similarly, the number of girls treated in hospital after cutting themselves quadrupled, from 600 to 2,400 over the same period, NHS Digital figures show. Rising levels of “body dissatisfaction” – insecurity and low self-esteem about their appearance – have been identified as driving the unprecedented levels of mental turmoil in young women. “There is a growing crisis in children and young people’s mental health, and in particular a gathering crisis in mental distress and depression among girls and young women,” said Dr Bernadka Dubicka, the chair of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists. “Emotional problems in young girls have been significantly, and very worryingly, on the rise over the past few years.” Increasing numbers of academic studies are finding that mental health problems have been soaring among girls over the past 10 – and in particular five – years, coinciding with the period in which young people’s use of social media has exploded. So many girls are now seeking help that NHS children and adolescent mental health services cannot cope, warned Dubicka. “Over the past few years we have seen overwhelming demand from young girls presenting with emotional distress and self-harm. We don’t have the resources to meet the demand.” Government-funded research last week showed that one in four (24%) girls aged 14, and 9% of boys the same age in the UK are beset by such negative emotions – including loneliness, self-hatred and feeling unloved – that they are depressed. That was double the 12% rate of depression seen in girls, and 5.5% in boys, a decade earlier, said Dr Praveetha Patalay, the lead author of the study. Previous work by Patalay found that “a significant increase in emotional problems in girls” aged 11-13 occured between 2009 and 2014. Those years saw a jump in the number of girls that age facing such issues from 13% in 2009 to 20% in 2014. However, the same study of 3,366 secondary-school pupils in England also found “a decrease in total difficulties in boys in 2014 compared to 2009”. The mounting evidence of low self-esteem among British girls reflects a trend in many other countries in recent years of more and more young females suffering from anxiety and depression. Girls aged 11, 12 and 13 displayed a “gender-specific vulnerability”, triggered by the onset of puberty, which made them much more likely to worry, sometimes intensely, about their appearance around the time they started secondary school, added Patalay, a lecturer in population mental health and child development at Liverpool University. “Body dissatisfaction is seen in about 10% of girls at primary school but really jumps in early adolescence, as puberty is starting. During this period girls tend to self-objectify more than boys, experience more teasing around weight and shape and perceive more pressure from friends and family to be thin,” she wrote in a 2015 paper. Evidence suggested girls could start to internalise anxieties about their appearance from the age of 11, which about a year later emerged as mental health problems, she added. About half of 15-year-old girls in England and Scotland and a quarter of boys the same age think they are too fat, the World Health Organization found last year. “Many of the teenage girls we work with tell us that they face a huge range of pressures. In particular, the rise of social media means they need to always be available, they may seek reassurance in the form of likes and shares, and they are faced with constant images of ‘perfect’ bodies or ‘perfect’ lives, making it hard not to compare themselves to others,” said Sarah Brennan, chief executive of the charity Young Minds. Dr Helen Sharpe, an expert in youth body image and lecturer in clinical psychology at Edinbugh University, said: “In girls, body dissatisfaction is associated with higher levels of dieting, unhealthy weight control behaviours like skipping meals and smoking cigarettes, and also lower levels of physical activity.” Social media such as Snapchat and Instagram “can be damaging and even destructive” to girls’ mental wellbeing, said Dubicka. “There’s a pressure for young people to be involved 24/7 and keep up with their peer group or they will be left out and socially excluded.” Use of social media was also contributing to a growing culture of sleep deprrivation among young people, which could both be a symptom of mental illness and also increase the risk of one developing, including depression, she added. Girls’ tendency to worry more than boys, and their greater sensitivity to criticism have also been pinpointed as potential triggers for distress. “Girls do have a tendency to ruminate – to worry extensively – more than boys about things of concern, like their friendships, their appearance and fallouts, often in groups. This worrying is a risk factor for depression and may help explain the high prevalence of depression in 14-year-olds,” added Dubicka. In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

There was also no clearer indication of Ronald Koeman’s predicament or his club’s muddled transfer strategy than the chant of “Oumar, Oumar” that echoed around the old ground against Sunderland. Everton added seven players to their senior squad this summer at a cost of almost £140m. Yet here was Koeman, having decided to withdraw the 20-year-old Dominic Calvert-Lewin, turning for the first time as Everton manager to a striker he told to find another club after 45 minutes of a pre-season friendly against Jablonec 14 months earlier. Niasse, of course, did not depart six months after his £13.5m arrival from Lokomotiv Moscow and found himself banished to the under-23s, without a locker and ordered to stay away from the first-team changing room at Finch Farm before enjoying a successful loan spell at Hull City. He almost left permanently last month only for a proposed transfer to Crystal Palace to collapse on deadline day. Suddenly he was playing in the Carabao Cup for one of the biggest spenders in the summer window; a reward for his positive attitude in training, admitted Koeman, and a glaring symbol of Everton’s failure to replace Romelu Lukaku despite having time and money at their disposal. “I knew we couldn’t get the striker that we wanted maybe two or three days before the end of the transfer window,” said the Everton manager, who targeted Arsenal’s Olivier Giroud at the start of the summer. “It was all about whether we signed the fourth, fifth or sixth option – yes or no – and that wasn’t what we wanted. So then we spoke about the situation if we don’t sign a striker. We have Sandro [Ramírez, the £5.2m signing from Málaga], we have Dominic and we had the possibility for Niasse. We didn’t want to go for the other options, that’s true, and it’s too early to say what will happen in January.” Everton did spend £68.6m on Davy Klaassen and Gylfi Sigurdsson, with six weeks spent negotiating with Swansea City for the Iceland international, in addition to bringing back Wayne Rooney from Manchester United. No established Premier League strikers but plenty of options for the No10 role, and imbalance has been an inevitable feature of Everton’s performances, as well as a distinct lack of pace and threat. Koeman, who had persisted with a pedestrian team before Wednesday, also wanted competition and cover for Leighton Baines at left-back. In its absence, the right-back Mason Holgate was deployed there against Simon Grayson’s side as Jonjoe Kenny made his long-awaited full debut in defence. Koeman has cited a lack of confidence, integrating so many new faces and a demanding schedule that brought consecutive league games against Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United on top of Europa League commitments as contributing to the flat start. Valid arguments all. He has also railed against José Mourinho’s claim that Everton should be aiming for a top-four finish this seasonafter such heavy investment. Unrealistic, retorted Koeman. “It’s crazy to put pressure on the team by saying we need to finish top four,” he added this week. “In my opinion it’s ridiculous.” It is not unrealistic, however, to expect a club who have spent almost £170m this calender year to avoid such abject results as the 3-0 defeats by Spurs and Atalanta, to prioritise more than damage-limitation exercises at Old Trafford or Stamford Bridge, and a manager of Koeman’s experience to have a clearer idea of his preferred and most effective side. Sunderland brought respite after a run of four successive defeats with no goals scored and 12 conceded. The Carabao Cup also made it easier for Koeman to rest big names, rotate his squad and inject youthful energy into the team. It will require a big call to do likewise against Bournemouth on Saturday but the supporters who cheered Niasse in midweek are unlikely to object. “Tell me one manager who doesn’t have difficult or tough periods,” Koeman said. “Every season you have a period and let’s hope we have put ours to the back and can now go forward. I had a difficult time at Valencia but you can’t compare Valencia with Everton or Southampton or Benfica or PSV because that was really difficult and it was a revolution with a new stadium that was not built and still isn’t finished, I believe. That was the wrong club at the wrong time, but even when it is a negative period it is a learning point. “The most important thing, and this is for every manager, is the connection with the players. If you feel you still have that good connection with the players and you think they are committed then that is the key point. The rest is all about decisions that don’t belong to the manager. But the connection with the players, the feeling with the players, that is the most important thing. I don’t have any reason to doubt my connection with the players at Everton. I believe in good results and winning games because of the quality we have in our squad.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/27/breaking-bad-how-to-give-up-drinking-smoking-nail-biting-and-other-unwanted-habits","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T14:01:58Z","webTitle":"Breaking bad: how to give up drinking, smoking, nail-biting and other unwanted habits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/27/breaking-bad-how-to-give-up-drinking-smoking-nail-biting-and-other-unwanted-habits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/27/breaking-bad-how-to-give-up-drinking-smoking-nail-biting-and-other-unwanted-habits","fields":{"headline":"Breaking bad: how to give up drinking, smoking, nail-biting and other unwanted habits","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sunday is the start of October, which means that people across the country will be attempting to give up bad habits; some will try to give up smoking for Stoptober, while others try to quit drinking for Sober October. We asked readers to tell us what enabled them to give up a longstanding bad habit, and how their life changed as a result. Ruth, 53, Nottingham: ‘I read Allen Carr’s The Easy Way to Stop Smoking and gave up cigarettes three days later’ I had recently started a new job and there were two staff rooms: one was large and inviting, bright, light and airy; the other was a cramped, rancid-smelling box room with a large, overflowing basin of stubs and fag butts on a low table in the middle. Yes, the gossip in the box room was juicier, and the camaraderie more cosy, jammed shoulder-to-shoulder as we were in the smog, but it was all tinged with ... well, just what was it? I found myself, not for the first time in 18 years of smoking, questioning my predicament. A colleague who frequented neither staff room enthused about a book called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr, and said I should read it. I dismissed the idea. “I don’t do self-help books,” I said, with obstinate pride and lofty disdain. I didn’t like the colleague much, so was not disposed to listen to him. But a week later I noticed the book on sale, and bought it. I went home, made a cup of tea and settled down, with my cigarettes at my side, to read it. What happened was a surprise rewiring of my brain. Myths were exploded. Truths were exposed. A shift in my consciousness changed my life as a smoker and set me free. I stopped smoking for good three days later. Lisa, 54, Birmingham: ‘I used to binge drink but now I’m about to do a half-marathon’ Every time I went out socially it would involve drinking and late nights, and I would often have a feeling of remorse the morning after because of what I might have said or done. I used to drink either sauvignon blanc or prosecco and quite often shots would follow. Drink is great when you’re in control – but I often wasn’t. I broke the habit by nursing a drink sometimes, but not drinking it all. It meant people couldn’t refill it and it looked like I was still drinking. I would also buy a much bigger drink, but make it last the whole evening. I now consume less alcohol and save money as a bonus. I am outgoing and sociable anyway, but it took me a long time to realise heavy drinking did nothing to improve my evening. My partner of 11 years doesn’t drink at all, so that makes it easier. The past three years I have taken up running: I started with 5k races, then 10k and now I’m about to do a half-marathon in three weeks. I go out and have fun but I rarely get drunk and I wake up fresh and energised. Harry, 23, Beckenham: ‘A small anniversary gift enabled me to give up biting my nails’ I wanted to give up biting my fingernails because of the pain that accompanied biting too much off, how my nails looked and its association with my anxiety. After starting to work in the mental health sphere, I began making associations between my thoughts and behaviours. I tried going cold turkey with the nail biting but I would always find myself with my finger in my mouth, playing with any extra bit of nail. My girlfriend suggested a nail file and gave me a metal one as a little anniversary gift. Immediately I liked the fact that it gave me something to distract myself with while also keeping my nails strong. It was a bit embarrassing to begin with, but has proved a solid investment. It has been well over three months now since I stopped biting my fingernails, and my life has changed in ways big and small. I can now peel off a label, and have a crack at tough knots without my teeth getting involved. My confidence has also increased and I feel better about my ability to kick other annoying habits. Rob, 65, Durham: ‘I made a tape-recording of myself citing all the reasons to stop drinking. I played it once and stopped’ I woke up one day and knew I had hit rock bottom with my drinking. I had had an attack of gastritis a few days before and been told my liver function was not so good. Basically, I was in hell. In an attempt to give up I made a tape- recording of myself talking to my unconscious, citing all the reasons to stop drinking. I played the tape once and stopped drinking and haven’t had any kind of alcohol since. That was 21 April 2005. I don’t have hangovers any more or depression. I’ve also managed to save a lot of money. At the same time, giving up was the hardest thing I have ever done. Now that I can’t use alcohol as an escape route, I have to face my anxiety, fears and weaknesses head-on. Lauren, 27, Leeds: ‘A book by Marie Kondo helped me kick my hoarding habit’ I had brought a boyfriend back to my flat and he accidentally opened the door to my hoarding cupboard and got a shock. He was good-natured about it and laughed it off but I was so embarrassed that I realised if I wanted to really let anybody in emotionally, I’d have to kick the hoarding. I bought the book The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo, and made the decision to throw away everything that wasn’t reusable. By the end of this process, I still had a lot of stuff, but only about a third or a quarter of what I had before. I’ve been working on reviewing my possessions a couple of times a year since then, and getting rid of anything that doesn’t work for me. I feel more emotionally stable now. Although I still suffer from anxiety from time to time, it is actually easier to deal with without all that clutter holding me back. Donald, 55, France: ‘A diagnosis of tongue cancer led me to grab the nicotine gum and patches’ In 2011, I was diagnosed with tongue cancer, so gave up the cigarettes, cold. I had been a heavy smoker, about a pack a day, starting when I was 13 or 14, so had been smoking for more than 35 years. I announced my condition to everyone, and told them I had given up smoking, grabbed nicotine gum, puffers and patches and went for it hell for leather. After about three weeks of tension I relaxed, and have not had a moment of missing cigarettes since. When I had given up in the past, the desire was a real problem. I would dream of smoking, and the feeling was so real that I would wake up with the smell in my nostrils. I noticed no real effects from not smoking. Having said that, this year I was diagnosed with lung cancer and have had surgery to remove a lobe containing it. My surgeon, commenting on my long recovery time despite keyhole surgery, said my lungs were a mess from long-term smoking. But outside of lung function, the benefits are that I no longer smell like an ash heap, I don’t get so many colds, and my sense of smell is better. My taste buds are better too, but that may be recovery from the tongue cancer radiotherapy, which destroyed them. The last thing I would want anyone to experience is having no taste buds; everything tastes like ashes in your mouth and it is so depressing. But when they grow back, they are young again, like a baby’s and so you taste things afresh. The first few days after they came back I couldn’t suck a Polo mint – it was too strong.

I’d been listening to Black Crow by Joni Mitchell and said to Ben, my songwriting partner: “Wouldn’t it be great if we could do a song with similar, flowing open chords?” I sat down with a little Casio keyboard and the music came quickly, but I struggled to write lyrics for months. Then one day I just sat at the window with a typewriter and the phrase “constant craving” came into my head. Once I had that, the lyrics flowed. “Constant craving” relates to samsara, the Buddhist cycle of birth and death, but I wasn’t a practising Buddhist then so I honestly don’t know what the impetus for the song was. I just wrote it from the perspective of desire and longing. Recording it was tortuous. I was singing off key and didn’t know why, a shocking thing for a singer to experience. Then it turned out a dental problem was affecting my hearing. I had root canal surgery and was cured. If you’re a terrible singer, get a root canal! Also, I was pissed off that we had this song. It was poppy, celebratory, upbeat and didn’t fit with the mood of the Ingénue album. I knew we needed a 10th song but dragged my heels and was reluctant to sing or record it. I guess part of me knew that it was going to be a big thing. The year 1992 was a watershed for me because I came out as gay in The Advocate magazine. We released Constant Craving as a single and it did OK – then I did a photoshoot for Vanity Fair. I’d seen a French movie called The Hairdresser’s Husband and had this idea of being pictured in a barber’s shop, so my friend Herb Ritts took a photograph of me being shaved by Cindy Crawford, which they put on the cover. It caused a huge sensation. People started questioning Cindy’s sexuality but I’m very proud of that cover. I’m not sure Constant Craving would have been such a big hit without it and I don’t think I’d have been in The Advocate or Vanity Fair without Constant Craving. It was a moment in time that clicked. The song is part of who I am. At the time there weren’t really any other pop stars who had properly come out, especially female. I was on the cusp of being really famous, so there was a lot to lose. The previous year, there was a huge backlash when I did a “Meat Stinks” campaign for Peta, but by the time I came out I think people had exhausted all their anger and hate for me. When we were nominated for the Grammys, there were religious groups outside picketing, but it wasn’t too bad. Ben Mink, musician, songwriter Constant Craving was originally titled Easter Passover, because it was written on a day that coincides with both holidays. For me it’s like a spiritual, like We Shall Overcome: an inspirational song about getting through the shitty parts, which may be partly down to how it was made. When we first started it, it was in a much slower tempo and didn’t have a melody at all. I sat there for two days just trying to settle on the right chords for the chorus. At one point, it got very eastern, because we’d been listening to klezmer music – very dark, minor key, Kurt Weill, dark cabaret, “I vont to be alone” music. When we first recorded it, we put instruments on and took them off again. Then it turned out that it was in too low a key for kd’s voice, so it was almost abandoned. I stayed up late and reworked the guitars in a key that suited her, and she said: “OK, let’s leave it in the running.” If I hadn’t stayed up, it might never have been finished. It was released in Britain first and nothing really happened. Some of the early reviews for the album were horrible. People magazine destroyed it, but other places loved it. And when DJs in America started playing it, the Warner Bros switchboard lit up with people calling in. Having such a big hit was life-changing. Five years later, I got a call from the Rolling Stones’ management. They’d written a song called Anybody Seen My Baby, but Keith Richards’ daughter had told him, “Dad, that’s Constant Craving!” They were real gentlemen about the similarity and gave us songwriting credits. When I was a kid in garage bands playing Stones songs, we used to joke: “One day the Stones will cover one of ours.” So to have a credit reading Jagger/Richards/Lang/Mink is a childhood dream that I still can’t believe actually happened.

The rise, combined with Trump’s rollback of Obama-era safeguards, has sparked renewed concern from MPs and human rights groups over the UK’s role in US counter-terrorism operations, in Yemen and other countries with which Britain is not at war. The number of covert American airstrikes in Yemen more than doubled in 2017, rising to 93 compared with a total of 40 the previous year, according to figures from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which tracks US air and drone operations in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen. At least two children have been killed in US airstrikes in Yemen this year, according to a report by Reprieve. Brothers Ahmed and Mohammed al-Khobze, both under 15, died in a US strike in Yakla on 6 March, local residents said. The US military have said they were not aware of “credible civilian casualty allegations” in the 6 March strike. Both Reprieve and TBIJ report at least 30 civilians have been killed so far this year, including 10 children, as a result of covert US operations, although the figures recorded by the groups have not been reported officially by the US military. Most died in a Navy Seal raid on the village of Yakla, on 29 January, in which a Navy Seal also died. No casualties were recorded by TBIJ as a result of covert US operations in Yemen in 2016. The US is now carrying out at least one covert strike every two days. If the rate is sustained to the end of the year, it would represent a fivefold increase in airstrikes across the country. The report by Reprieve draws on interviews with individuals on the ground and press reports of US operations in Yemen. Trump is accused of “ripping up” rules introduced by Obama to reduce civilian casualties and limit the circumstances in which the US carries out counter-terrorism operations in countries like Yemen, where it is not at war. There is “mounting evidence” for British support for US operations in Yemen and elsewhere, Reprieve said. This includes press reports of British bases providing intelligence and operational support for drone strikes, and of British personnel on the ground in Yemen providing intelligence for selecting targets and directing drone strikes. Earlier this year, Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said: “We continue to work with regional and international partners to tackle the threat posed by terrorist organisations including the AQAP [al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula].” Reprieve described the escalation in US airstrikes in Yemen as a “wake-up call” and demanded the UK government publish its secret guidance to British personnel involved in US drone strikes. Katie Taylor, deputy director of Reprieve, said: “Since taking office, President Trump has unleashed a barrage of strikes on Yemen in a flagrant breach of international law, killing scores of civilians and making a fragile country even less stable. “Secret strikes that kill children in countries where we are not at war will do nothing to make the world safer. It’s shameful that the UK provides operational support for this disastrous strike programme. “The UK government must urgently publish its secret guidance – or so-called joint targeting policy – and explain Britain’s role in Trump’s secret Yemen war.” Labour MP Clive Lewis, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on drones and former shadow defence minister, said: “President Trump’s plans to give greater authority to the CIA to conduct secret drone strikes out of the view of public scrutiny and to widen the rules of engagement should be of real and immediate global concern. “The UK government must provide assurances to parliament that neither intelligence sharing nor operational provision make the UK complicit in the operations of our closest ally that we would not carry out ourselves. “In light of the recent changes in US policy, the UK has an opportunity to emerge as a global standard setter for the transparent, accountable use of drones and the minimisation of civilian harm.” It is not known how many US airstrikes were carried out by drones in 2017. In March, Trump exempted Yemen from constraints brought in by Obama to reduce civilian casualties and limit the circumstances in which the US carries out counter-terrorism operations in countries with which it is not at war, including Yemen, Pakistan and Somalia.President Trump’s administration is now preparing to further dismantle key Obama-era limits on drone strikes and commando raids outside conventional battlefields, including an expansion of the CIA’s authority to conduct drone strikes in a number of countries, both in and out of war zones. While administration officials have agreed they will keep in place an important constraint for such attacks, the “near certainty” that no civilians will be killed, the changes have been criticised as potentially leading to additional civilian casualties. The joint committee on human rights has raised strong concerns about the UK’s involvement in the US targeted killing programme, noting that the UK’s intelligence agencies work “hand in glove” with the US. The all-party parliamentary group is holding an inquiry into how the UK works with allies and coalition partners in armed drone use. It is expected to make recommendations on transparency and accountability by the end of the year. In response to calls for assurances over the UK’s role in US covert airstrikes in Yemen and for the publication of guidance, the Ministry of Defence said they would not comment on “covert operations or intelligence matters”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/shortcuts/2017/sep/24/stop-the-bombs-how-slough-became-britains-most-dynamic-town","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T14:00:47Z","webTitle":"Stop the bombs!

Why are you talking funny? I’m not. That was John Betjeman talking funny, in his very famous poem, Slough. Come friendly bombs and fall on Slough! That’s right. But apparently, it is fit for humans now. Says who? Says worker satisfaction research conducted by the jobs site Glassdoor. By its reckoning, it is now the UK’s very best town to work in. Hang on a minute. We’ve all seen The Office. Working in Slough means crushing tedium and insecure bosses with only brief interludes of sexual tension and witty bullying. The Office was never intended as a documentary about working in Slough. Besides, Slough has changed a lot since then. Really? Absolutely. Most of The Office’s title sequence is now consigned to history. Brunel bus station and the Brunel Bridge roundabout – and indeed Crossbow House, which appears as the Wernham Hogg office itself – have been demolished. Just demolished, or replaced with things? Replaced with things. According to the research, there are 26,387 jobs available in Slough, offering a median base salary of £35,000, in dynamic fields such as sales and recruitment consulting. Glassdoor gives it a score of 4.2 out of 5. Meaning what? I neither know nor care. But it does mean that it’s time to take Slough seriously again. I’m not sure I did to start with. Well, that’s just typical of the snobbery this thriving town has had to tolerate for 80 years since that wretched poem was written. It’s like Jane Austen battering Birmingham with, “I always say there is something direful in the sound.” And look what Ali G did to Staines. What did he do? He dragged its reputation so deep through the mud that, in the end, the name was changed to Staines-upon-Thames. That’ll fool people. Yeah. So just remember, Thunderbirds was filmed in Slough. It’s where the Mars bar was born. And the new Crossrail connection and the Slough Urban Renewal master plan will take it to even greater heights! Do say: “You’ll find plenty of grass to graze a cow in Herschel park or Baylis memorial gardens.” Don’t say: “It’s best to obtain permission from the local authority before leading livestock into the town centre.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/22/cordelia-fine-if-women-arent-sweet-then-theyre-called-bitches","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T16:16:25Z","webTitle":"Cordelia Fine: ‘If women aren’t sweet, then they’re called bitches’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/22/cordelia-fine-if-women-arent-sweet-then-theyre-called-bitches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/22/cordelia-fine-if-women-arent-sweet-then-theyre-called-bitches","fields":{"headline":"Cordelia Fine: ‘If women aren’t sweet, then they’re called bitches’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If you have ever worked alongside both men and women, you will almost certainly have seen for yourself some of the classic gender differences in behaviour. Anyone still in doubt about their existence could have observed how Cordelia Fine conducted herself this week. On Tuesday night, the distinguished neuroscientist was awarded the Royal Society’s science book prize. One of six nominees, she had flown into London from her home in Melbourne on Monday, and is trailing her suitcase behind her when we meet the following afternoon, before heading back to Heathrow for the 24-hour journey home. I assume she must have known she would win, as who would come all this way otherwise? She looks surprised and shakes her head. “No, no. I was just really, really thrilled and excited about being nominated.” At 42, Fine is enormously successful. After graduating with a first from Oxford in experimental psychology, she took a masters at Cambridge, followed by a doctorate from University College London. Her first book was nominated for the Royal Society prize in 2007, while her second, Delusions of Gender, was listed by the Huffington Post under: “Books women think men should read”. Her third, Testosterone Rex: Unmaking the Myths of Our Gendered Minds, was acclaimed by the judges this week as an “original”, “very funny”, and “cracking critique of the ‘men are from Mars, women are from Venus’ hypothesis”. With a cheque for £25,000 in her case, Fine could have been forgiven for swaggering – or at the very least strutting – across the hotel lounge to be interviewed. But the woman who sidles up to the table is so equivocal and self-effacing, it’s hard to believe she can be the author. Her sentences are prefaced with “Ummm”, a pause, a sigh, and “I suppose …”, delivered in a barely audible murmur with the demeanour of a rabbit who hates being caught in the headlights even more than the norm for her species. If Fine looked only half as uneasy, I would ask her why, but I’m too afraid the question will only make matters worse. Instead, I draw her attention to a news story about the purported finding of a connection between men with wide faces and promiscuous or risky behaviour, all determined by varying hormone levels, thinking it will be a nice prompt to get us going. But after skimming the story, she puts it aside in inscrutable silence and begins by telling me that, while posing for our photographer earlier, on the pavement amid the crowds at Oxford Circus, she attracted the attention of a passing gaggle of teenage boys. “What’s she famous for?” they shouted. “She wrote a book which just won a science prize,” explained the publicist. “And, of course,” Fine smiles wryly, “they dispersed immediately. So if there was ever any danger of me getting a bit ...” She completes the sentence with an upwards tilt of the chin, to gesture grandeur, an alert to a danger so comically remote in her case that I could hug her. I spend a lot of the next hour trying to work out why this eminent winner is so startlingly unlike almost every man I’ve ever interviewed after an awards-ceremony triumph. Her awkward inhibition has to be partly down to the difficulty all scientists face, when asked to explain their work in terms a scientifically illiterate fool like me can understand. But Fine’s gift for rendering complex neurological concepts comprehensible is one of the many reasons why her book is so brilliant. The daughter of the celebrated novelist Anne Fine, she writes like a dream, not just by the lifelessly humble standards of most scientific prose, but by any literary measure, and her book sparkles with pithy wit when describing, for example, a demographic of rich white men as: “Those who, in response to the social justice movement’s currently fashionable suggestion to ‘check your privilege’, would take significantly longer than others to complete the task.” Anyone who writes this well couldn’t fail to have plenty to say in person, so I’m inclined to put the discrepancy between her confidence in print and reticence in person down to catatonic jetlag. There is, however, another plausible explanation. From the pay gap to the boardroom, we have overwhelming evidence that men are typically competitive, boastful and pushy at work, while women consistently undervalue their worth, undersell their services and underestimate their ability and potential. Fine’s book does not dispute the truth of these stereotypes, but instead challenges the widely held belief – whose popularity we can mistake for authority – that gender inequality is biologically programmed by our hormones, and thus the natural order of things. To boil the vast diversity and complexity of humanity down to testosterone, and explain everything from extramarital affairs to the financial crisis on this one hormone, is, she argues, both scientifically baseless and absurd. For years, evolutionary biologists have claimed that men and women are programmed to be promiscuous and monogamous respectively, in order to maximise their reproductive prospects. However, according to Fine, the vast range of different sexual behaviours found both between different species and within species comprehensively disproves the myth of a universal reproductive principle dictating all of our sexual norms. “There are many, many other factors involved that can greatly complicate the picture, whether to do with idiosyncracies within the species or the particular context they’re in, whether within one species or across species. And it just complicates the whole picture. But what it means is that you can’t generalise from one species to another. “One of the really interesting things about humans in relation to sexual behaviour is just how inefficient our reproductive activity is, more than any other species. Our hit rate for sexual activity to reproductive success is extremely low, so that has significance for the reproductive benefits of casual sex with multiple partners versus monogamous sex. It also points to the other key feature, which is that sexual activity for us is not just about reproduction. It’s come to serve some other purpose. And you see that in other primates as well. You don’t have that tight hormonal sexual activity that you see in other species that’s like: job done.” Similarly, our assumption that men are programmed by testosterone to take more risks, and that what caused the financial crash was an excess of testosterone among bankers, is not substantiated by the evidence. All we have to do is expand our definition of risk-taking to include activities not traditionally investigated, and account for the different benefits and costs men and women face, and the evidence for some sort of innate behavioural disappearance falls apart. For example, Fine writes: “The reported gender gap in risk-taking would almost certainly narrow if researchers’ questionnaires started to include more items like: ‘How likely is it that you would bake an impressive but difficult soufflé for an important dinner party, risk misogynist backlash by writing a feminist opinion piece, or train for a lucrative career in which there’s a high probability of sex-based discrimination and harassment?” Fine stumbled upon her field of gender neuroscience by accident, when her two sons were still infants and she read a popular parenting book, Why Gender Matters, which cited all sorts of scientific studies in support of its thesis that boys and girls have such innately different brains they must be raised quite differently. Smelling a rat, she consulted the studies for herself, and found they had been wildly misrepresented and proved nothing of the sort. How does she explain, I ask, the popularity of the “men are from Mars, women are from Venus” oeuvre, if it is so flawed? “When we look at the world as it is, and the continuing inequalities that we have – my book looks particularly at occupational inequalities – I think there’s some kind of a relief in thinking: ‘Well, look, it’s not injustice that’s creating this situation, it’s just naturally ordained.’ So you can think: ‘Oh well, that seemingly impossible task of creating something more like gender equality – we’re off the hook.’ I think that’s one plausible explanation.” It’s easy to see how the theory that testosterone governs all male behaviour, making it futile to ask them to change, might appeal to men. But why have so many women been willing to subscribe to it? What’s interesting, she says, is how easily what she calls the T-Rex theory of gender politics can be superficially misleading and easily misread “as very positive towards women. ‘Women are wonderful, they’re so warm and kind and caring.’ It’s very much an equal but different. So it’s not a kind of antipathy towards women, and I think there’s an appeal for women in being perceived more positively than men are. Unless, of course, women start to behave in ways that don’t conform. Benevolent sexism says: ‘Oh, women are so sweet and kind and caring.’ But that very easily pushes into hostile sexism, because if they’re not sweet etc, then they’re bitches.” As the mother of two boys myself, I’m keen to know how Fine’s work has informed her own parenting, and how she hopes it will influence that of her readers. I should by now have guessed, though, that didactic prescriptions will not be forthcoming.

Yesterday, we found out that even though he repeatedly said no contacts with Russians, his emails now reveal that while he was Trump’s campaign manager Manafort offered to give a Russian billionaire private briefings on the 2016 campaign.” “The billionaire is Oleg Deripaska, who’s among the two to three oligarchs Putin’s turned to on a regular basis,” the host continued. “It’s two to three, depending on who’s been poisoned this week.” “While Manafort made the offer, we don’t know if these briefings ever happened, and Manafort’s spokesman said these emails just reflected ‘an innocuous effort to collect past debts’,” Colbert explained. “You know, innocuous effort to trade presidential campaign secrets for cash. He was just going back and forth between the man he worked for and the man he secretly worked for.” “One of the emails contain cryptic mentions of black caviar, which instigators believe is a veiled reference to payments Manafort hoped to receive,” Colbert said. “Either that, or black caviar describes how Steve Bannon reproduces.” Jimmy Kimmel of ABC discussed the Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill, legislation proposed by senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy that would repeal and replace Obamacare. “If you’ve been watching over the past few days, and you haven’t, I’ve found myself in a the middle of a battle over American healthcare,” Kimmel began. “After my son Billy had open heart surgery at the end of April, the senator Bill Cassidy came on our show and made some promises and assurances he did not keep. The reason I had him on the show in the first place is because he started telling people any plan he’d support would have to pass what he called the Jimmy Kimmel test. And then, he teamed up with senator Lindsey Graham to write a bill that most definitely does not pass that test.” Kimmel continued: “It doesn’t protect people from having their rates priced up for preexisting conditions, it doesn’t prevent insurance companies from putting lifetime caps on how much they’ll spend on a person with medical issues, and it cuts a huge amount of money from healthcare funding.” Kimmel then showed president Trump’s tweet about the bill, in which he express his support for the legislation and promised again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. “Those are the key words, repeal and replace,” Kimmel said. “For Donald Trump, this isn’t about the Graham-Cassidy bill, it’s about getting rid of Obamacare, which he hates primarily because Obama’s name is on it. He likes to have his name on things. At this point, he’d sign anything to get rid of Obamacare. He’d sign copies of the Qur’an at the Barnes &amp; Noble in Fallujah if it meant he could get rid of Obamacare.” “Some people tell me I should give him the benefit of the doubt, and I do give him the benefit of the doubt,” Kimmel said, in reference to Senator Cassidy’s about-face. “I doubt all the benefits he claims are part of the new healthcare bill.” “But I do admire what he’s done with most of his life,” the host continued. “He’s a doctor, a gastroenterologist, he founded a community clinic in Baton Rouge. He’s done good things. I just want him to keep doing good things. His plan is not a good thing.” “His supporters say he’s a doctor and you’re not, what do you know?” Kimmel added. “To them I say: all of these very reputable organizations, the American Diabetes Association, American Medical Association, American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, all of these groups, populated by doctors, say this healthcare bill is bad.” “We haven’t seen this many people come forward to speak against the bill since Cosby,” Kimmel joked. Meanwhile, Trevor Noah of Comedy Central discussed the Russia investigation, zeroing in on the ways its subject have so far avoided answering tough questions. “Over the last few weeks, we’ve seen a barrage of hurricanes hammer the Carribean and the Atlantic coast,” Noah began. “But for the White House, there’s been another storm brewing, one that could also leave them without power. I’m talking, of course, about Hurricane Mueller. “One of Mueller’s recent targets has been Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign chairman and undercooked Sylvester Stallone,” Noah joked, showing news coverage of reports that the FBI conducted an overnight raid of Manafort’s home. “Surprise visits in the middle of the night? All up in his phone?” Noah said. “Ladies, get you a man who wants you as bad as Mueller wants Manafort.” “I get why Manafort is drawing this much heat, because everything he’s done until now has been shady,” Noah said, with regard to the most recent reports that Manafort offered briefings to a Putin-affiliated Russian oligarch. “Ask yourself this: when has the phrase ‘Russian oligarch’ ever been a good thing? It’s like the word a cappella concert, or unmarked van, or homemade condom. “Thanks to the Russian investigation, we’ve learned so many new ways to avoid questions. You’ve got Manafort with the stutter step, Mike Pence with the smoke screen, and if you really want to know how to not answer a question, there’s only one man you can go to: Master Spice.” Noah then showed a clip of Spicer’s recent interview with ABC News, in which he responded to questioning about the Russia prove by saying “I’m not going to discuss that issue at all” four times. “Did you catch that look at the end there?” Noah concluded. “That’s a man who knows where the bodies are buried.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/live/2017/sep/23/west-ham-v-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T13:27:22Z","webTitle":"West Ham 2-3 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/sep/23/west-ham-v-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/sep/23/west-ham-v-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"West Ham 2-3 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"That was a game of three thirds. West Ham were superior for the first half hour, Spurs were magnificent either side of half-time to go 3-0 up - but they had to survive a late onslaught after the sending off of Serge Aurier. Thanks for your company, you can follow all the 3pm games here. Spurs have held on to win their third consecutive away game in the league this season. 90+6 min Yellow cards all round: Carroll, Llorente and, I think, Alderweireld. 90+5 min It’s all kicking off now! It started with a foul by Carroll on someone, and now players on both sides are shoving each other. It’s a bit more than manbags, though I don’t think any punches were thrown. Chicharito, who has already been booked, might be in trouble. 90+3 min Ayew is booked for a lunge at Davies. 90+2 min Carroll’s long-range shot deflects behind for another corner. Cresswell curls a lovely outswinger towards the far post, where Carroll arrives imperiously ... and then heads the ball away from goal! He ended up ahead of the ball. Did he mistime his run or was he shoved by Sanchez? Carroll thinks the latter. There was some contact, but it’s hard to judge whether it was enough for a penalty. 90+1 min There will be four minutes of added time. Spurs suddenly looked ragged. 90 min Masuaku, who has made a significant impact on the left wing since coming on, wins a corner for West Ham. Cresswell takes it short to Masuaku, gets the return and stands up a gentle, deep cross that Lloris can only fingertip towards the right corner of the box. Reid runs round the ball and wallops it into orbit. He should have lifted that back into the area before Lloris was out of his goal. 89 min For Spurs, a cheery stroll has turned into a grim struggle for survival. They make their final substitution, with Fernando Llorente replacing the magnificent Harry Kane. Oh my. Is something brilliant happening? Masuaku beats Winks on the left and curls in a beautiful cross to the far post. Kouyate attacks it at pace, gets above Davies and thumps a memorable header through the leaping Lloris. That was a brilliant goal. 82 min Carroll, who has had an absolute beast since coming on, ruins a promising attack with a needless foul on Davies. 81 min Chicharito is booked for a foul on Dier. Spurs are pretty comfortable, even with 10 men. 80 min Alli and Kane break dangerously for Spurs, but Alli can’t find the moment or angle for a shot and the danger passes. Moments later, Kouyate is booked for something or orher. 79 min Chicharito’s volleyed backflick hits Sanchez in the chest. While everyone is appealing for a penalty Chicharito collects the loose ball and smashes a shot from 15 yards that is beaten away by Lloris. Had that been anywhere near either corner I think he’d have scored. 78 min Another Spurs change: Kieran Trippier replaces Mohamed Sissoko at right wing-back. 77 min Carroll drags a shot well wide from the edge of the area. West Ham have been far too excitable since Spurs went down to 10 men. 75 min “It’s nice to see there’s at least one cavernous, divisive London stadium in which Spurs can win,” honks Matt Dony. 74 min A substitution apiece: Harry Winks for Christian Eriksen, and Arthur Masuaku for Jose Fonte. West Ham have gone to a back four, Spurs are now playing a 3-5-1 formation. 73 min West Ham need to calm down a bit. The red card has given them fresh hope, but they’ve been a little giddy in the few minutes since, hammering cross and shots from all angles. 71 min Spurs have moved Sissomo to right wing-back in a 3-3-2-1 formation. 70 min He’s an accident waiting to happen, this chap. He lunged at Carroll, who was leading a West Ham break, and a second yellow card was a reasonable decision from Michael Oliver. 68 min Noble crosses from a deep position on the right to Hernandez, who strains his neck muscles like a cuckolded Bruce Banner to power a header towards goal from 15 yards. It’s too close to Lloris, who saves comfortably, but it was a good effort. 67 min “To be fair Rob, Danny is right,” says Alistair Donegan. “West Ham look a bit poo.” They do now. I thought they were the better team for half an hour. 66 min Andre Ayew replaces Marko Arnautovic for West Ham. West Ham have got one back. Cresswell’s excellent corner is headed across goal by Fonte, and Chicharito backpedals into space to head in from four yards. A classic Chicharito goal. 64 min Serge Aurier has been asking for a yellow card all day and now he’s got one for a foul on Carroll. 63 min Kane hits the other post! He ran at Reid on the left side of the box, shifted the ball down the line and cracked an early left-footed shot that rattled off the outside of the post. It seems Hart got a slight touch with his right foot as a corner has been given. 62 min Spurs were subdued for half an hour, but since the goal they have been quietly majestic. They are such a lovely team to watch. All right-thinking neutrals should want them to win the league this year. Game over. Kane, on a hat-trick, hits the post with a sensational free-kick, whacked across goal from an absurd angle on the left. The ball comes to Aurier, whose deflected cross bounces nicely for Eriksen to sidefoot a classy half-volley into the corner from 15 yards. 56 min Sissoko slides a straight pass into the area for Alli, who tries a clever turn back inside Reid and goes over. His penalty appeals are ignored by Michael Oliver. I thought Reid got something on the ball but replays show he didn’t. Whether he got enough of Alli to warrant a penalty is debatable; you could also argue that the sharpness of the turn was the main reason for Alli going down. 54 min This game is really open now, with West Ham trying to rough Spurs up. The next goal feels even more important than usual. This game could conceivably end 3-2 or 0-6. 52 min West Ham are starting to lump a few crosses into the area for Carroll. So far Spurs have dealt with him comfortably. 49 min Eriksen fouls Noble just outside the area on the right. Cresswell dinks in the free-kick and Vertonghen heads clear. Spurs break three-on-two only for Alli to overrun the ball. 48 min Arnautovic and Cresswell combine to win a corner. It’s headed away by Alderweireld. 47 min “Not sure what game you’re watching to call this scoreline a lie - West Ham had some dangerous looking runs into the box early on but no clear chances to speak of (Aurier’s hands on Arnautovic during his brilliant tackle would have been a soft penalty to give),” says Danny Michaux. “Spurs usually take a while to find a rhythm, and since Kane’s offside miss 25 minutes they’ve looked comfortably in control, even more so since Antonio came off injured.” Cheers Danny. I don’t know if I could this do this without you. 46 min West Ham begin the second half, kicking from right to left. There are lies, damned lies and this half-time scoreline, but Spurs won’t care about that. Harry Kane scored twice in four minutes to flatten a buoyant West Ham, who have a job on to get anything out of the game. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 45+1 min “Arnautovic + Carroll, time for some kick and rush?” says Yoann Lechenault. “Come on England, we know you want it!” 45 min Alli flips a lovely pass with the outside of the foot to usher Davies towards goal. He gets on the inside of the last man Zabaleta, who just does enough to ensure Davies can’t get a clear run at the ball. That was excellent, if slightly desperate defending. 43 min Spurs, so subdued until they scored, are now swaggering around like they own the place. West Ham looked a bit stunned, not unreasonably, and desperately need to hear the half-time bell. 41 min Kane demonstrates his stratospheric confidence by shooting from a ridiculous angle on the left, curling the ball across goal and a few yards wide. Hart had it covered. 39 min West Ham have been mugged. Harry Kane gets another one! Eriksen and Vertonghen combined smoothly down the left to o put Alli through on goal. His first-time shot was well saved by the outrushing Hart but it rebounded straight to Kane, who had an open goal from 12 yards. Spurs take the lead against the run of play with an excellent goal. Eriksen, picking up a loose pass from Carroll just past the halfway line, puts Alli clear down the right with a fine angled pass. He takes a touch and clips a fast cross towards the near post, where Kane stretches to flash a header in off the far post. That was clinical: from the moment Carroll played a poor pass on the halfway line Spurs needed just five touches to score. 33 min Arnatuovic’s long, dipping free-kick hits the arm of Aurier, who mistimed his attempted header. There were no real appeals for a penalty by West Ham. 32 min Noble ploughts through Sissoko, taking man and ball, and the players square up to each other. The excellent Michael Oliver sorts it out with the minimum of fuss and the two players shake hands. 31 min Eriksen plays a brilliant cutback to find Kane in space in the D. He tees himself up and hits a fierce shot that is crucially blocked by Fonte. 29 min “Well, Rob,” says Paul Neilan. “What’s the Sissoko situation? Where/how/why/who/which is he playing? We must know this information(s).” He’s playing as a kind of inside-right midfielder in a loose 3-3-3-1 formation. 28 min Carroll does replace Antonio, so Chicharito will presumably move to the wing. Unless Andy Carroll is going to roam up and down the flank like an inverted Ormondroyd. 27 min Antonio is struggling with what looks like a thigh injury, and Andy Carroll is going to replace him. 24 min Harry Kane misses an open goal, though it wouldn’t have counted. Spurs worked the ball neatly until Sissoko eased a through pass to Aurier on the right of the area. He blasted the ball towards the far post, where the partially unsighted Kane diverted it wide from three yards. Just as hundreds of non-Spurs fans were deliriously preparing some banter, the linesman’s flag went up to thwart them. 22 min “So wrapped up as I am in my own team’s looming crisis I have lost track of the repercussions of Alli’s finger-gate,” says Ian Copestake. “Did he get a rap on his knuckle?” No idea. I’ve developed a sophisticated internet tool that blocks anything with even a whiff of faux outrage. 20 min Spurs aren’t playing well, though much of that is down to the quality of West Ham’s defending and counter-attacking. 19 min Arnautovic runs at Alderweireld and wafts a poor cross straight out of play. He is getting in some dangerous positions, though, and has been the most threatening attacker on either side. 16 min West Ham break and Noble curves a superb long pass towards Arnautovic. He rumbles thrillingly into the area, between Aurier and Alderweireld, before Aurier makes a brilliant recovery tackle. I say brilliant: replays showed he had a fair chunk of Arnautovic’s shirt as he did so. That should have been a penalty. 15 min The game has been pretty low on intensity for a derby, certainly when compared to the match at Ibrox. West Ham look slightly sharper at the moment. 13 min Eriksen’s deflected shot is shovelled over the bar by Hart, who didn’t risk trying to catch it as it dropped out of the sky. Nothing happens from the corner. 11 min Antonio drags a through ball towards Arnautovic, and Lloris hares from his area to clear. 8 min West Ham are starting to play some good stuff. Chicharito plays a one-two with Antonio and whips an extravagant, long-range curler onto the roof of the net. Lloris had it covered but it was a decent effort. 6 min Spurs seem to be playing more of a 3-3-3-1 formation, with Dier just in front of the three defenders and Sissoko, Eriksen and Alli playing behind Kane. Tactics are so damn hot right now. 5 min Arnautovic beats Alderweireld with a stepover on the left side of the box and drives a dangerous low cross that is cleared from inside the six-yard box by the stretching Sanchez. 3 min Spurs have started confidently, with some smooth passing in the West Ham half. Alli plays a through pass round the corner to himself, in a manner that evokes Dimitar Berbatov’s awesome goal against Charlton all those years ago, and Cresswell comes across to cover. 1 min Spurs kick off, from right to left as I look at my 23-inch HD TV screen. They are in white; West Ham are wearing claret and blue. Opta stats show that West Ham fans are precisely 0.00 per cent enamoured of Tottenham Hotspur, and there’s a decent atmosphere at the London Stadium as a consequence. “It might indeed get nawty - which, naturally, turned my thoughts to Danny Dyer,” writes Gary Naylor. “Twelve years ago, he was brilliant in The Business, a film that more pseudo-highbrows than just me treasure as a guilty pleasure. So, betting without Wilson Phillips and the OC, what’s yours Rob?” Good question, Gartholomew. Does Masterchef count? When I was a twentysomething kid my guiltiest cinematic pleasures were crap postmodern slashers and the American Pie films, though I reckon I could still go into bat for the American Pies. The slashers, not so much. Actually, my guiltiest pleasure these days is probably aggro in sport, although it’s a strange, confusing kind of guilt. This isn’t the only early kick-off today. The Old Firm derby is taking place at Ibrox, and you can follow that with Barry Glendenning. West Ham (3-4-3) Hart; Fonte, Reid, Ogbonna; Zabaleta, Kouyate, Noble, Cresswell; Antonio, Chicharito, Arnautovic. Substitutes: Adrian, Masuaku, Byram, Rice, Ayew, Carroll, Sakho.

Hello and welcome to live coverage of the lunchtime meeting between the homesick henries of the Premier League. Spurs have away advantage against West Ham, and really need a win to keep the Mancunian pacemakers within sight. The next few weeks are likely to determine whether Spurs will challenge for the title again, or whether this will become a bit of a lost season in which they end up focussing on the cups. West Ham have started to pick up after a difficult start to the season, though Slaven Bilic still has reason to look over his shoulder. And he keeps having those weird dreams about Rafa Benitez and Anne Boleyn. Both sides need a result, they don’t like each other, and Tottenham want to avenge the May defeat that ended their title challenge. It should be lively, it might be nawty; it kicks off at 12.30pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/24/strictly-come-dancing-hosts-millions-antiques-roadshow","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T06:00:37Z","webTitle":"Strictly come grinning all the way to the bank","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/24/strictly-come-dancing-hosts-millions-antiques-roadshow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/24/strictly-come-dancing-hosts-millions-antiques-roadshow","fields":{"headline":"Strictly come grinning all the way to the bank","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Hear an inevitable, omnipresent chink of the cash register now as the BBC’s talent make their Saturday night bow.

He affirms that the Spanish government is violating European values and civil rights by sending the police to “imprison democratically elected politicians”, among other activities. He mentions specifically the searches and arrests of the “paramilitary police” which took place on 20 September, and considers that they have driven Catalonia “to a de facto state of emergency” violating “the European charter of fundamental rights”. The government did not send the police to those regional government buildings, offices and private homes. It was a judge in Barcelona who ordered the police operation, a judge who acts in accordance with the principle of separation of powers, as happens in every other modern democracy. Moreover, the judge has the backing of the constitutional court. The civil guard – which in no means is a paramilitary force – fulfilled its role of judicial police. As for the pretended state of emergency, the freely exercised freedom of demonstration shown in the streets of Barcelona clearly denies Puigdemont’s false accusation. No single civil right has been suspended. He argues that “Catalan home rule has effectively been suspended”. Once again, this assertion is false. None of the legitimate activities of the Catalan government granted by its regional charter have been suspended. On the contrary, the Catalan government is not entitled to organise a secessionist referendum, as the constitutional court has stated. Therefore the rule of law is simply doing its work. Puigdemont says that Madrid has rejected all possibility of dialogue and the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has employed “aggressive tactics”. The government has attempted and is still offering dialogue. Puigdemont has been invited to express his ideas in parliament and has refused. But “dialogue” for him implies authorising a referendum which goes against Spain’s fundamental law. Puigdemont says “all we want is to carry out the greatest expression of free democracy”, but his projected referendum – that will not take place – is rather the result of a process that repeals constitutional democracy and their own charter of self-government. The laws recently approved by the regional parliament failed to comply with their own rules and denied parliamentary rights of Catalan deputies. When a series of falsehoods are stated in this manner, it is our right and duty to respond. As Mahatma Gandhi reminded us: “Truth never damages a cause that is just”.

Lawton is one of several thousand Britons who obtained German passports in the wake of the Brexit referendum, fearing the loss of his rights as an EU citizen to live and work in Germany, and who are now eligible to vote for the first time in Sunday’s election. “I take a lot of satisfaction at knowing that having lived here for decades, I can finally have a say in shaping the country,” he says. “Even though I still feel very attached to Britain, when I look at the chaos there over the exit negotiations I despair and feel I hardly understand it anymore, compared to Germany.” Citizenship applications from Britons leapt by 361% in 2016 as a record number of almost 3,000 UK citizens became German, a figure that is is expected to be considerably higher this year, according to Germany’s federal statistics office. “I was disenfranchised a long time ago,” says Ed Collins, originally from Ilford, who has lived in Germany since 1988, and lost his right to vote in UK elections in 2003 after an absence of 15 years. “Having been on the sidelines politically for quite a while now, I’m glad I’m finally able to exercise my right again.” Collins, who works for a funeral directors in Potsdam and became a German citizen in the spring, sees his right to vote as functional rather than attractive. “I am not emotive about it, it’s a utility, but I’m finally exercising my right because I live here and am affected by politics at every level and it’s important to have my say.” Having a vote has made him more aware of the pros and cons of both countries’ voting systems, he says. “I can see the advantage of Germany’s proportional representation system, as opposed to the first past the post in the UK, where many votes get swept under the carpet. The disadvantage of the German system, however, is that there’s not much scope for political change.” He despairs of the dramatic fall in support for the Social Democrats, but is confident that when the anti-immigrant AfD, as expected, enters the Bundestag “they will be suffocated fairly quickly, because they’ll be forced to take a more moderate line”. Judith, a 51-year-old caterer who is originally from London, became a German citizen six months ago, motivated mainly by wanting to secure her rights as an EU citizen. “But it was a bonus to know I could vote as well,” she says. She is especially glad to have a say in this election “because it’s scary with the AfD due to get into the Bundestag for the first time. I have huge concerns.” The issue of Brexit itself has not played a part in the German election campaign, says Judith – aside from being an issue alongside others like Trump and North Korea. But “it has definitely influenced my political thinking and made me a hundred times more European. Although it wouldn’t affect the party I choose, as almost all of them here are pro EU.” Issues close to her heart that will sway her decision include refugees and education. She will vote strategically, she insists, “which may mean giving my vote to a smaller party in order to help prevent the AfD from doing well. But it’s not like I’m passionate about a particular party”. For Esme, a 38-year-old broadcast journalist from Berkshire who has lived in Germany for 16 years, it is a question of duty. “I want to play my part, however small, in safe-guarding Germany from the AfD. “After Brexit and the US election, everyone is looking to see what happens in Germany, and I think there has been a lot of complacency. Merkel is going to win, but look how well the AfD is doing. No one has talked about that enough.” She is fascinated to learn more about the German system. “Every German has two votes and I have spent a lot of time considering how to place mine. The first is for a local candidate and is a first past the post direct mandate, while the second vote determines the distribution of seats in the Bundestag. It requires a lot of thought as to how you place yours,” she says. Hugh Williamson, 53, who received his citizenship in January, says that having a child at school and working in the human rights field in Germany, has made him view the party programmes accordingly. “I appreciate being able to spread my political commitments more broadly due to the two votes. Having German citizenship during this campaign has made me pay more attention to the issues that are important to me, and I take comfort from knowing that my vote will be counted.” Louise Churcher, 57, an English teacher from Winchester who has lived in Babelsberg, just outside Berlin, for the past decade and became a German earlier this year, says the sensation of being an outsider is gone now that she can vote. “Being enfranchised at last, I have a different feeling about myself because I’m no longer excluded from the electoral process,” she says. “Because the political spectrum is widening, it seems even more imperative to be able to influence what’s going on. Also the fact of Brexit occurring makes me glad to have a vote within a European Union member (state).” Learning more about the German political system now that she has a say, she believes it is “probably one of the fairest there is in terms of getting people into parliament who reflect what people actually think”. But, admitting she still feels “like a novice”, she is happy to follow the advice of her 16-year-old daughter, Beth, who studies politics at school. “I’m thinking of splitting my first and second votes between different parties, though my daughter has said she thinks that’s too non-committal.” She feels excited, she says: “In a school girlish sort of way. I’ve asked my daughter if she wants to come with me to the polling booth.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/22/angela-merkel-vote-mutti-miele-washing-machine","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T12:48:45Z","webTitle":"Angela Merkel would get my vote.

Mutti’s the leader all Europeans need","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Novelists of the future will surely do a Hilary Mantel on Angela Merkel – try to recreate the secret gyroscopes of her mind, in her time. Here’s my advice to them: look west. For that, above all, is what Mutti – Mummy – as she is known to every German, whether they like or loathe her, believes in. How could she not, with her life-story? Unlike almost everyone else in East Germany, she was there not because of bad luck and barbed wire. Her father, a Lutheran pastor, moved of his own free will from Hamburg to East Germany shortly after her birth in 1954, becoming a senior figure in the state-tolerated church. The Berlin Wall went up when she was seven. By then, whatever innocence there might once have been in East Germany was dead. She must have grown up knowing that she could have been a West German; she can hardly have failed, as a rather brilliant young woman and scientist, to feel every day, directly, the effects of Papa Merkel’s deluded utopianism. At 35, she lived the triumph of the West not only as simple, literal freedom but also as mental freedom, at last, from the lies into which millennial ideas inevitably descend. For the historical uniqueness of the west is not untrammelled “freedom” but the unidealistic notion that deals must be cut and power shared. This goes back to AD754, when Europe was rebooted from the dark ages in the great bargain of Saint-Denis: the Frankish dynasty got the sanction of Rome, while the church got worldly lands and Germanic muscle to defend it. Ever since, call it what you will – church and state, king and parliament, checks and balances – this principle stands against every heady fantasy of some perfect society. This is the key to Merkel’s instinct for seeking out the centre ground. She realised fast and early what all sane people eventually learn: that noisy idealism is not a virtue but a curse, and quiet, deal-making realism not the absence of conviction but its pure expression. No political lesson could be more different from the dire mix of grandstanding in the moment and backstabbing in the dark that our own big Tory beasts learned in the gilded testosterone snakepits of Eton and the Oxford Union. In the age of Brexit and Trump, when men shout to the cheering galleries about “taking our country back”, and “independence day”, we should all thank God that Europe’s strongest country has a leader who has lived the difference between messy western freedom and true unfreedom, and who grew up in a world where fake news was all you got. We should admire the fact that when the Germans go to the polls, they do so happily knowing it’s all but impossible for any party to get an overall majority – so anyone who can’t do reasonable deals with people of differing opinions is never going to become chancellor. And we should all be glad that Mutti, the Miele of politics – the German brand that says unglamorous but dependable – is sure to be chancellor again, and so utterly in charge that the editor of Die Zeit last week suggested she might take the foreign ministry too, which hasn’t happened since Konrad Adenauer at the height of the cold war between 1951 and 1955. You don’t think things are bad enough to need that? Think again. The populists still think tomorrow belongs to them. European, British and American radicals of both the hard left and the hard right all look to Russia, which happily extends a helping paw to anyone who might cause trouble. The Germans well know that holding referendums in troubled times is a device of “dictators and demagogues” (as Margaret Thatcher herself famously suggested). That’s why – I heard this from someone who spoke to her privately at the G7 in 2015 – Merkel, who was Cameron’s best friend in Europe, begged him not to hold his utterly needless referendum. But what? Have patience? See things quietly through? Make a rational, cross-party deal for what the vast majority of MPs on both sides agreed was the good of the country? Not Dave. Anyone who saw the live TV debate between Merkel and her main challenger, Martin Schulz, will suspect my German father-in-law is right in having long predicted yet another grand coalition of the Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Social Democrats (SPD). Schulz’s performance seemed less a bid for power than an application to become Merkel’s chief of staff, as one pundit put it. My father-in-law is delighted. He was born 90 years ago into a part of Germany so far east it’s now in Russia, so he has seen a thing or two. The cursed baby boomers, that most pampered and self-indulgent generation, may have forgotten that history has teeth, but he has not. So God bless Mutti, Queen of the Centre, the unexciting but unbreakable Miele of our times. She is our best pilot in the storm. And when we British finally come to our senses, she will be ready to welcome us back into the fold of the true west she loves. • James Hawes is the author of The Shortest History of Germany"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/22/aaron-hernandezs-cte-diagnosis-heightens-the-nfls-brain-trauma-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T12:41:18Z","webTitle":"Aaron Hernandez's CTE diagnosis heightens the NFL's brain trauma crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/22/aaron-hernandezs-cte-diagnosis-heightens-the-nfls-brain-trauma-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/22/aaron-hernandezs-cte-diagnosis-heightens-the-nfls-brain-trauma-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Aaron Hernandez's CTE diagnosis heightens the NFL's brain trauma crisis","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We probably didn’t need Aaron Hernandez’s attorney to declare Thursday that his dead client had the brain of a near-70-year-old with severe dementia. Too many decisions the one-time New England Patriots star made before killing himself earlier this year at 27 made no sense. Experience has told us that when young, wealthy football players start making erratic life choices, there is probably a physical reason lurking inside their skulls. The question is: what will anyone do about it? The time for hand-wringing about the role football plays in the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy is over. Science is only beginning to understand CTE. It’s going to take decades to assess how much the pounding of football helmets affects players’ brains. But enough is known now to say that dire measures need to be taken. For more than 10 years, neurologists have been drawing a connection between the blows players take to their heads and the growth of tau deposits that signal CTE. They have measured the power of enough hits to the head and looked at enough slides of brain tissue to say football has some culpability in the sudden aging of otherwise healthy men’s brains. Even the NFL has conceded this fact. And yet for all the talk about better helmets or smarter tackling or trying to get players to not turn themselves into human torpedoes when going for the hit, no one wants to deal with the bomb ticking inside their helmets – the one that makes sane, smart men go crazy. We get lots of chatter. We get promises about brain study initiatives, but we don’t get the kind of action needed to maybe save players’ lives. A few days ago the Canadian Football League and the league’s players union together announced that the league is eliminating full-contact practices during the season. “It was clear we had an opportunity to get this out and do something proactive for player safety,” CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie told the CBC while unveiling the new policy. The move isn’t as significant as it sounds. CFL teams only have 17 full-contact practices during the season which amounts to slightly less than one a week - NFL teams are allowed roughly the same number. But it’s a message that the CFL and their players’ union is committed to at least addressing the root of the problem – a message the NFL has said it doesn’t expect to match. An impression is stuck in people’s minds that the biggest cause of CTE is the big, booming hits players take in games, those where they are smashed to the ground or knocked out completely. It’s an impression built in the earliest days of the discovery of CTE in dead football players and further fed by the movie Concussion, which tells the story of how a link between CTE and football was first made. But most research now is focused less on those crashing blows but on the seemingly benign day-to-day cracking of helmets in practices and games. It might not seem like much to watch a football practice and watch players bump heads over and over and half speed – or even to see them do the same with more power in games. And yet each crack of hard plastic against hard plastic triggers some kind of trauma. The wounds might be small at first but they build up over time. At some point the damage can reach dangerous levels. This, scientists suspect, may be where the real trouble lies. An invisible killer. The NFL has been slow to embrace CTE discussion, perhaps for obvious reasons. Litigation from former players has cost the league close to $1bn in settlements. Hernandez’s attorney Jose Baez said Thursday he is suing the Patriots and NFL on behalf of the player’s young daughter. The league seems to operate with litigation in mind, employing fleets of lawyers to counter potential lawsuits related to many of their decisions. In some ways the NFL is right in raising questions about how much CTE affects their players. It will take years for scientists to properly study the disease that can only be detected posthumously. The brains doctors have been given to study have come from players like Hernandez, whose behavior troubled relatives enough to allow researchers to take chunks of their dead loved one’s brain. Brains of the thousands of ex-players who have lived normal lives have not been examined, meaning CTE studies are self-selective and perhaps misleading. CTE can’t be the reason for everything that goes wrong in a player’s life. Sometimes bad behavior is just bad behavior. We can’t say CTE led Hernandez to kill Odin Lloyd in 2013, the crime for which he was sentenced to life in prison. But CTE is something and that something is serious. It will take more than cutting full-contact practices during the season to reduce the risk of CTE, Maybe teams at all levels have to eliminate nearly all their contact practices. Maybe football has to reinvent itself completely. But at least the CFL has taken a positive action to deal with the menace that has destroyed lives. A small step, perhaps, but a step nonetheless. The time has come to stop listening to the lawyers and take many steps more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"global/2017/sep/26/guardian-weekly-letters-plastic-tap-water","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T10:56:40Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly letters, 29 September 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/sep/26/guardian-weekly-letters-plastic-tap-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2017/sep/26/guardian-weekly-letters-plastic-tap-water","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly letters, 29 September 2017","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Plastic and tap water Your excellent article on contamination of water (A world with plastic on tap, 15 September) is limited by its anthropocentricity. It’s not just our own nest we’re fouling, but the homes of myriad aquatic species, from newts and blue whales to migrating salmon and waterlilies. I’m thinking particularly of phytoplankton (a million in a litre of seawater) which generate half the planet’s oxygen. By defiling their habitat, we may be literally depriving ourselves of breath. Whose amniotic fluid are we poisoning? The ways we violate, disrupt, and discriminate against the intricate ecologies of our [estimated] 8.7m non-human co-species are a fundamentalism that needs a name. How about “Earthism”? Human survival depends on radically recalibrating our relationship with this multi-voiced, sentient, uniquely beautiful planet; on evolving from a paradigm based on abuse and dominance to a dance of ecozoic reciprocity, to thinking, feeling and sensing like a biosphere. Annie March West Hobart, Tasmania, Australia • A good, timely articles on plastics, which have alarmed me since the mid-1970s. Unfortunately the contamination will increasingly include air pollution. Abandoned plastics are slowly turning into dust around the planet. Clever heads are needed to come up with solutions. The quicker the better. Michael Cowan Conondale, Queensland, Australia • I was really pleased about the findings reported in your article A world with plastic on tap for two reasons. First, at last it is found that humans – the creators of plastic – are also suffering the results and not only the marine creatures. Second, maybe now effective efforts will be made to reduce the problem. Ingrid Carstens Meise, Belgium • May I congratulate the Guardian Weekly and Damian Carrington on one of the most creative bits of writing I have seen for years. From a handful of water samples from a few selected locations found to contain a few nanoparticles of plastic of unknown morbidity, and the accumulation of plastic in eddy currents in certain oceanic locations, to the menace of a world swimming in plastic is a leap of Olympic magnitude. To have built such a great story from such a slight database was a feat of such creativity that it should not go unrecognised. David Barker Bunbury, Western Australia • When we read that 72% of tap water is contaminated by microplastic particles, how do we react? By buying bottled water: a conundrum. Elizabeth Keating Orcemont, France • In order to read the headline article A world with plastic on tap, I had to first cut away the plastic wrapping. Julie Price Garlin, France Myanmar leader’s silence George Monbiot suggests that Aung San Suu Kyi is silent because she fears losing power (Comment, 15 September). A more charitable view is that she fears not for herself but for her country which has suffered repeated coups ever since her father Gen Aung San was assassinated in 1947. The generals still hold all the real power in reserve, and could undo decades of struggle and pitch the country into more years of misery. Monbiot thinks she has not read the UN report and knows nothing about Rakhine state. I am convinced she reads everything. And in 1997 when she was under house arrest, she told me, “We really don’t have a very good record on how we’ve treated Muslims in Arakhan.” She urged others in Myanmar to join her in speaking out against the army’s atrocities in the tribal states, and said one of her dreams was for meaningful dialogue between Buddhists and other faiths. She is now finding it’s a lot easier to hold high ideals when you’re under arrest than when you’re the one who holds the power. Perhaps only shame will make her do the speaking out she once advocated, but will it be too late? Roger Bowen Cambridge, UK Briefly • Napoleon the nice (8 September)? Certainly not. If he had lived in the 20th century he would have been considered on a par with Hitler or Stalin, or other similar butchers. If, as Kim Willsher says, “many French see him as representing a warmongering, authoritarian regime”, they are totally right. Napoleon had no respect whatsoever for the life of his countrymen, and much less for the life of the populations in the countries his armies invaded. José María Gallardo Durán Campanario, Spain • The headline on the piece by Matt Haig on the back of the 15 September issue reads “I used to think that social media was a force for good …” “Was”? Surely “media” is still plural and “medium” is the singular form. Or “has” the social media so corrupted our language that singular and plural are now interchangeable? Bill Atkin Wellington, New Zealand • The Shortcuts article about the stowaway scorpion (15 September) reminded me of sitting in my aircraft seat in Mumbai a few years ago.

Perhaps as soon as in four years. “I said this was a 15-year project when we started in 2007, that was the sort of timeframe that seemed to work,” Mark Waller, the NFL’s executive vice-president of international and events, said. “The next four or five years should be very doable.” A lot has to happen for the league to place a full-time franchise in the UK. Most importantly, the owner must want to move his team to London and the other owners would need to agree that such a move is a good idea. But there is a definite sense the NFL is pushing harder on its experiment to test whether American football can work in London. While expanding the league internationally has been a priority of the commissioner, Roger Goodell, the NFL had to first place a team in the long-empty Los Angeles market before it could address London. Filling LA was a laborious, two-decade process that appeared to stall several times before the league allowed the St Louis Rams to move there in 2016 and the San Diego Chargers to do so this year. After the Rams move, several owners and league officials said they were ready to focus on a UK team. “If you look at what happened with LA it’s a good indication that things won’t move at all and then they will move very quickly,” Waller said. “We want to be sure London is ready and we have a fan base and this is something we can do. With LA it was: wait, wait, wait and suddenly go.” Can the NFL suddenly go after years of slowly building its presence in London? It seems possible. Last year the league played three games in one month in two different stadiums – Wembley and Twickenham – replicating, in a way, a regular month during the season for a home market. This season they have games in consecutive weeks at Wembley and Twickenham, hoping to gauge fan interest and the feasibility of playing games on consecutive weeks in various venues. While league officials remain encouraged by the regular sellouts of their London games, including all four this year, they want to play as many as eight games – matching a team’s regular season home schedule – before making a decision. That way, the games will hardly be considered a novelty any more for fans in the UK and US, giving the league a true gauge of the market. It may be hard to schedule eight games, however. Already the NFL seems committed to playing a game each year in Mexico as well as a 2019 game between the Rams and San Francisco 49ers in China. Finding enough teams willing to give up home games so the league can fill an eight-game slate in London may be challenging. The international games are not popular with many American fans and several teams have leases on expensive stadiums that say they must play eight home games a year in those facilities. The NFL has passed two resolutions in recent years to push more games out of the US. One forces teams in the middle of relocations – the Rams, Chargers and Oakland Raiders ( who are moving to Las Vegas) – to play an international game in each year before they move into permanent new homes. The other says that Super Bowl hosts must also play an international game within five years of landing the game. Waller called the eight-game plan “a helpful data point” but added it is “not on the front burner”, meaning the league may never be able to play that many games in London before making a decision on a UK franchise. When asked if he as optimistic a team can be placed in London, Waller said “yes”. “I don’t think there is any other sport that can do this with scheduling and logistics,” he added. “I think the thing for me is that it feels like we are an authentic part of the sporting calendar in London.” Privately, league officials are encouraged by the large crowds at both the London games and at fan events. Last year, one top executive scrolled through photos on his phone to show a Guardian reporter pictures of the league-themed street fair in Regent Street taken the day before one game. What surprised him most, he said, was the number of British people he encountered that day. “Not all of those were ex-pats,” he said. NFL executives have also worked hard to convince teams that travelling to London will not be a significant disruption. In the early years of the UK experiment, the teams who went overseas were given byes the following week as a way of decompressing. This year, three of the eight teams who play in London will play the next week – including the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars who play at Wembley on Sunday. Baltimore, in fact, will play their bitter rivals the Pittsburgh Steelers the following Sunday, perhaps as strong a test as any about a team’s ability to play the week after going to the UK. “Teams are less nervous about the schedule disruptions,” Waller said. Getting coaches and players to see travelling to London as no different than going to, say, Seattle might yet be the most critical piece in moving a team to the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/22/the-fiver-popes-o-rangers-queens-celtic","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T14:56:50Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Cranking up the tension by insisting there is tension to be cranked up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/22/the-fiver-popes-o-rangers-queens-celtic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/22/the-fiver-popes-o-rangers-queens-celtic","fields":{"headline":"Cranking up the tension by insisting there is tension to be cranked up","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"HERE WE GO AGAIN Ahead of a weekend jam-packed full of intriguing derbies and needle matches – West Ham v Spurs, Juventus v Torino, the Steel City set-to and AFC Wimbledon v Franchise FC – The Fiver has decided to focus its gimlet-eyed stare on Saturday lunchtime’s Old Firm fitba festival between the Queen’s Celtic and the Pope’s O’Rangers. While there are many in Glasgow who claim O’Rangers have only existed since 2012 and liken the current squad to the White Walkers in Game of Thrones, they have enjoyed a bitter rivalry with their city rivals for well over a century, in which time the two clubs have played each other 407 times. O’Rangers, indeed, have the edge courtesy of just nine extra wins. In recent times, however, the Queen’s Celtic have been whittling away at that advantage, having won five of the six meetings last season. Indeed, you have to go back to March 2012 for the most recent occasion the team in blue won the scrap to discover the tallest pygmy in the village, but if they can win here they’ll end an unbeaten domestic run that stretches to 56 games. Ibrox is the setting for what promises to be a lively affair and in the buildup Brendan Rodgers has been cranking up the tension by insisting there is tension to be cranked up. Upon hearing comments from Craig Bellamy, who suggested people outside Scotland don’t care about fitba, Rodgers responded with remarks that suggest he spends far too many weekends in training-ground dining rooms. “I have been in enough canteens – where, if the game is on, they are watching it,” said Rodgers, referring to former charges at Watford, Swansea and Liverpool. “Where they know the intensity and they think ‘bloody hell, what type of game that must be to play in?’ Absolutely it’s box office, no question.” Already five points behind the Queen’s Celtic after a mediocre start to the season, O’Rangers will be hoping for big things from their new striker Alfredo Morelos. The 21-year-old Colombian has scored eight goals in 10 matches for the club, but his Mr 15% has warned of his young client’s fiery nature and voiced fears he may get sent off. “He is the kind of player who thrives on the big games,” whooped Jonne Lindborn. “The only worry is you can see that he can get overly excited at times. Hopefully the [Queen’s] Celtic players won’t target him that much because he can lose his head sometimes.” Lindborn’s concerns are shared by O’Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha, who said he expected Morelos would be “provoked” by the Queen’s Celtic players. “I don’t think he needs any help in that, watching the game the other night against Partick,” parped Rodgers, referring to an incident in which Morelos got away with kicking out at an opposition player. Expect famously mild-mannered Queen’s Celtic captain Scott Brown to have taken note of Morelos’s apparent combustibility and to act with appropriate measures of patience and understanding.

I turned around and already the first blow had landed in the middle of my face. A few more strikes followed. I turned and wanted to escape, but I stumbled over the camera. I fell over on the ground.

In particular, the magnitude 7.1 Puebla tremor on 19 September demonstrated Mexico’s vulnerability, causing severe damage in Mexico City and taking more than 270 lives. However, Mexico’s most lethal earthquake remains the 1985 Michoacán earthquake of magnitude 8, which occurred 32 years earlier, to the day, and killed as many as 10,000 people. Strangely, many of the buildings that survived in 1985 succumbed to the tremors from the magnitude 7.1 last month. That’s because the two earthquakes produced different kinds of shaking. Although last month’s 7.1 was 30 times less energetic than the magnitude 8 in 1985, its epicentre was much closer to Mexico City: 130 kilometres away compared with 400. This distance explains the differing damage patterns between the two earthquakes. It is the low “booming bass” waves that travel across long distances. They cause the ground surface to roll like a boat riding rough seas and tall buildings are especially vulnerable to this motion. In 1985, it was the tallest buildings (between five and 20 storeys) that suffered the worst damage. Quakes such as the event of 7.1 magnitude last month produce intense “jerky” shaking. This high-frequency movement (which diminishes over distance) is more damaging for shorter buildings (less than six storeys). So, in this case, the taller buildings swayed violently but remained standing, while the smaller buildings, many of which had survived the earthquake in 1985, quickly became heaps of rubble."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/23/relaxed-britains-drug-culture-revolution-deaths-legalisation-ecstasy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"I was relaxed about Britain’s drug culture revolution – but not any more | John Harris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/23/relaxed-britains-drug-culture-revolution-deaths-legalisation-ecstasy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/23/relaxed-britains-drug-culture-revolution-deaths-legalisation-ecstasy","fields":{"headline":"I was relaxed about Britain’s drug culture revolution – but not any more","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Thirty years ago this November, a DJ called Danny Rampling co-founded a club night in Southwark, London, that he called Shoom. Essentially, he was trying to capture what he had experienced that summer on the Balearic island of Ibiza: a celebratory subculture built around so-called house music, and the drug methylenedioxymethamphetamine (or MDMA), otherwise known as ecstasy, whose euphoric rush inspired Shoom’s name. So began the revolutionising of British popular culture, and the decisive passage of an array of illicit drugs from the cultural fringes to the mainstream. The saga is long and complicated, but it reached an unlikely kind of denouement this week, when that well-known raver the Duke Of Cambridge paid a visit to a treatment centre near London’s Liverpool Street station, and asked a group of recovering addicts the kind of “massive question” guaranteed to instantly crash-land in the headlines. “There’s obviously a lot of pressure growing in areas about legalising drugs and things like that,” he said. “What are your individual opinions on that?” Back in 1987, Rampling and his friends were in the vanguard of what was quickly known as acid house, which initially developed away from the attentions of the media. But by the autumn of 1988, ad hoc raves around the M25 and two ecstasy-related deaths (one of which was caused by ingesting 18 tablets) had sent an alliance of MPs, senior police officers and journalists into one of their customary panics. Six years later, the Conservative government passed the Criminal Justice Act, which stands as the only item of legislation to specifically outlaw gatherings of people fond of a particular musical genre, one characterised “as a succession of repetitive beats”. The authorities had clearly decided that what acid house had spawned was nothing but trouble; the clear intention was to kill it. Inevitably, the opposite happened. We are now as far from the initial stirrings of acid house as its pioneers were from the arrival of rock’n’roll in the 1950s, but its legacy is immovable. Its implicit offer of a more peaceable, open-minded alternative to the standard Saturday-night staples of drinking and fighting was built into the culture for keeps. The music’s mixture of incessant rhythms and gurgling electronics is now an ingrained part of no end of successful pop. And ecstasy use sits at the heart of hundreds of thousands of people’s weekends. Moreover, partly because acid house also found room for other substances (the joint to ease the ecstasy comedown, the cocaine to give the experience that extra edge, the LSD that would give nights out a different kind of trippiness), these too have become part of everyday life, to the point that talking about a self-contained “drug culture” seems absurd. In both sociological and geographical terms, illegal intoxicants are everywhere, and the contexts in which people take them are as varied as Britain itself. As much as consumerism, or the resentments that flared up around Brexit, this is part of who we are now. Walk around the nightlife district of any British city and you will soon see – and hear – the telltale teeth grinding and self-fixated chatter of recreational cocaine users. At any number of summer festivals, the mood in the small hours and beyond is usually defined by great crowds of saucer-eyed millennials, high on ecstasy and frantically looking for their next source of excitement. More mundanely, marijuana smoke routinely wafts through the British air, sometimes in the most unlikely places: I got my last faceful earlier this week, while waiting for my local branch of Argos to open on a drizzly Tuesday morning. And then comes the more malign end of it all. In any sizeable British settlement, if you know what to look for, it is not hard to pick out the local unfortunates craving their next hit of heroin or crack (or both), these days sometimes joined by the pitiful devotees of such synthetic highs as spice, apparently beloved of people with a taste for oblivion and nothing left to lose. According to figures released last month, 2016 saw the highest-ever recorded number of deaths in England and Wales from what the Office for National Statistics calls “drug poisoning”, which includes everything from paracetamol to amphetamines: 3,744, up from 2,600 20 years ago. Heroin and morphine were involved in 1,209 deaths, which amounted to about a third of the total; cocaine was cited in relation to 371 fatalities. And ecstasy was named on the death certificates of 63 people, up from 57 in 2015, 43 in 2014, 31 in 2013 – and, back in 1993, a mere 12. Each drug-related statistical category has its own cliches: the hardened heroin addict OD-ing in some grimy hovel, the lifelong cocaine user succumbing to a coronary arrest in her luxury apartment. Within hours of the ONS figures’ release, the fact they suggested people aged 40-49 were now at the greatest risk of drug-related death had spawned another handy trope: that of the “Trainspotting generation”, the fortysomethings who began taking drugs in the slipstream of acid house and never really recovered. But in the case of deaths caused by ecstasy (or, rather, whatever version of it is sold to the people concerned by unscrupulous dealers), the prevailing stereotype is altogether younger – and in its own way, more heartbreaking. Go through the archives, and the human stories behind such numbers become painfully clear. An inordinate number of ecstasy deaths involve teenagers and twentysomethings, whose life stories are often illustrated with a portrait taken from social media of some gap-year escapade or college trip. Such people usually seem to have been as innocent as I was when I took my first E. But they are the victims of a grim historical coincidence: the fact that ecstasy use has reached a modern peak (in 2015, its use among young adults was reckoned to have risen by 84% in just two years), just as it has become much stronger. Some modern pills contain as much as 300mg of MDMA, as against the 50mg to 80mg that was the norm when acid house first arrived; in some cases they are also cut with PMA and PMMA, substances that bring on some of the same effects as ecstasy, but are way more dangerous. Which takes us to the question posed by our presumptive next king-but-one, and the stupid tangle of legal and cultural conventions that get in the way of recognising what is happening, and doing something about it. Just as hardened heroin addicts are often killed by dealers who play fast and loose with their supply, so it is with scores of young ecstasy users. In other words, for as long we allow our young people to ingest chemicals cooked up in bathtubs by career criminals, with no means of checking what on earth they are about to swallow, tragedies will happen. I am as unsure about the sweeping legalisation of drugs as Prince William appeared to be. God knows how you liberalise the supply of crack; the idea of powerful hallucinogens available from your local off-licence seems problematic to say the least. But the idea of decriminalising at least the possession of most drugs seems increasingly unanswerable – and in time, it is not hard to envisage the liberalisation of cannabis pioneered by a handful of US states extending to Britain, as well as ecstasy being legalised, made subject to official standards, and freely bought and sold. In the meantime, given that pills and powders can be quickly tested for their constituent ingredients so as to allow people to either moderate their intake or not bother at all (a practice pioneered in Switzerland and the Netherlands, and trialled at a handful of British events this summer), such arrangements ought to be an in-built part of clubs and festivals, if not the average high street. The idea that we can somehow convince young people to chant “just say no” and stick to the questionable pleasures of booze is laughable. No one, surely, is going to be able to roll back a social transformation that dates back to the era of Margaret Thatcher. The point needs to be made as repetitively as all those beats: if acid house changed everything, it is surely time for the official attitude to drugs and the people who take them to be pushed towards their own belated revolution. • John Harris is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/25/its-like-walking-through-fire-competitive-fitness-tribal-clash-crossfit","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T05:00:05Z","webTitle":"'It's like walking through fire' – the rise of competitive fitness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/25/its-like-walking-through-fire-competitive-fitness-tribal-clash-crossfit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/25/its-like-walking-through-fire-competitive-fitness-tribal-clash-crossfit","fields":{"headline":"'It's like walking through fire' – the rise of competitive fitness","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"You probably didn’t notice but at the end of this summer, on the sandy beach of Bantham, near Kingsbridge in South Devon, 960 men and women gathered for a gruesome battle. For an entire weekend, this stretch of English coastline saw teams of furious men and women dashing across hilly trails, hoisting atlas stones and lugging a 240kg sandworm, in both blistering heat and torrential rain. This wasn’t a Viking re-enactment (too much compression gear for that), but an annual competitive fitness event called Tribal Clash, the appetite for which is almost as strong as the participants’ mettle. Since its launch in 2013, Tribal Clash has more than doubled in size, from 100 teams of four to 160 teams of six, and has also begun holding a second annual event in Portugal. It is almost certainly inspired by the growth of CrossFit, the high-intensity, competitive strength and conditioning programme that has captured the heart and lungs of hundreds of thousands of people around the world. In 2016, CrossFit was reported to have 13,000 gyms in more than 120 countries - even more than the 12,500 Starbucks in the US. Yet while competitions such as Battle of the Beasts and the CrossFit Games, with their huge prize money, have become the playground of elite athletes and bodybuilders, the new-wave competitive events such as Tribal Clash, Wild West Fitness, the Superhuman Throwdown and nationwide gym chain Fitness First’s own competition, Fit Brit, aim to be more inclusive. “There are no qualifying events or age divisions in Tribal Clash,” says one of the event organisers, Heidi Clover. “You need a base level of fitness but some teams just enter for fun, while, for others, this is like their Olympics – they train all year for it. But it’s great for beginners because there are no technical moves, such as Olympic weightlifting.” “It hurts, though,” she adds. “It’s hard, and we’re always looking for ways to enhance the athlete experience. This year, we staged the biggest ever stand-up-paddleboard race and we added a little twist to our trail run in the form of a 150m uphill sprint section where times were scored separately.” Unsurprisingly, people get injured doing these events. Beginners are especially vulnerable because their bodies aren’t conditioned for it, says former CrossFit coach Stretch Rayner: “Connective tissue strength is critical, for example, and that can take 230 days to build. Muscle strength can take 90 days and, for many athletes, it takes years of hard work and dedication to reach a high level.” The brutality of a weekend spent doing a range of physical activity under very competitive conditions is no deterrent. Spots in Tribal Clash cost £110 a head – excluding accommodation and travel – and are snapped up within 24 hours of going on sale. So what is the appeal? Magdalena Rotsztejn, a 30-year-old Tribal Clash finisher who works as a delivery manager for a technology firm, says: “For me, competing means finding my limits and going beyond them. There are so many moments in an event when the adrenaline kicks in and I surprise myself with what I’m capable of. I feel independent, powerful, as if I can achieve anything, and then that carries over into the rest of my life.” Renata O’Donnell, 41, works for a small investment bank in London and has competed in Tribal Clash for the past two years. “I love that it takes the vanity out of fitness and gives it more purpose,” she says. “It has helped me give my training more focus and stick to a healthy lifestyle, but, more than that, I love the team aspect. It’s about communicating and working together as a unit, because you’re only as strong as your weakest link.” O’Donnell describes the final race, a log-carrying contest, at the 2016 event: “There was a team with a girl who had sprained her ankle and the task was to run around the arena with the log, go out into the sea and swim with it. All six members had to be involved and have their hands on the log at all times. Rather than drop out, this team put the injured girl on the log and ran the course with her on it. She was able to do the swimming part, as it didn’t hurt her ankle. Yes, they came last, but it was tough as nails and the most brilliant display of teamwork I have seen in a long time.” So is competitive fitness inspirational, motivational and perhaps also educational? CrossFit coach and competitor Alexis Rufus, 38, certainly thinks so. She was part of the winning team at the competitive fitness European Championships this year, but insists that regardless of one’s competitive level, the personal discoveries are limitless: “Most people ask themselves the same questions when entering a fitness competition: am I really good enough; will there be lots of people watching and judging me? But do you really know how your body works under pressure? Can you truly know what will take place? Physically, I’ve found the competitions seriously tough, but the greatest challenge by far has been mental. Sometimes what I have to put myself through is like voluntarily walking through fire.” So why do it? “It’s simple,” she says. “I love competing. I love testing what I am capable of doing and constantly pushing those limits. I actually enjoy walking through the fire and seeing what comes out the other side. Because if I didn’t try then I would never know and the only real failure is not trying.” • This article was amended on 3 October 2017.

Imagine having the sheer willpower to come back from behind not once, but twice, having already run the best part of 26.2 miles at about 4 min 45 sec mile pace. No, I can’t either. Kipchoge is a legend, and deserves a world record even if circumstances and weather have conspired against it. Though talking of legends, Yuta Shitara - who came sixth - is shaping up as one.

Impressive enough, before you take into account that he ran a half marathon last weekend in 60:17 - a new Japanese record - and a 28min 56sec 10km the weekend before. I don’t know what he does for recovery, but clearly we all need to emulate ... And, of course, there were the non-elites - though obviously any member of the Guardian Running Blog Club is an elite.

Together, these two rugby league tournaments represent the largest gathering of Indigenous people in the country, eclipsing all other cultural festivals. Established in 2011, the Murri Carnival is the much younger and more formal little brother of the Koori Knockout, which began in 1971. For the past six years the Carnival has been run by the Arthur Beetson Foundation and hosted at Redcliffe Dolphins’ home ground in Brisbane. Former Queensland and Australian player Tony Currie came up with the idea after attending the Koori Knockout in Armidale while working for NITV’s Barefoot Rugby League Show in 2009. “I thought, how good is this, we should have something similar,” explained Currie. “I wanted complete endorsement from the governing body in Queensland, making sure that all insurances were in place, and using rugby league as a catalyst to improve employment opportunities, education and all those social issues we have in our communities.” Arthur Beetson, the first Indigenous captain of Australia and the inaugural captain of Queensland in State of Origin, was an ambassador for Currie’s fledgling carnival in 2011. When Beetson passed away later that year, Currie handed over responsibility to the Arthur Beetson Foundation. Beetson’s eldest son, Brad, is a board member of the foundation. With more than 50 men’s, women’s and Under-15 boys sides involved this year, he believes 2017 is the biggest carnival yet. “It’s part of Aboriginal history, getting together for sporting events,” he said. “People travel from all over Queensland, from as far north as the Torres Strait.” Funded by federal and state governments as well as corporate sponsors, part of the Murri Carnival’s social dividend is its commitment to health and educational outcomes. To be eligible for the carnival every player is required to get a 715 Health Check and the Under-15s must have a 90% school attendance rate. Over the years Queensland has produced some of the best Indigenous players, from the first Indigenous Kangaroo, Lionel Morgan, through to the likes of Colin Scott, Sam Backo, Joe Kilroy, Steve Renouf, Gordon Tallis, Justin Hodges, Johnathan Thurston and Dane Gagai. Another objective of the Murri Carnival, according to Brad Beetson, is continuing this pipeline of Indigenous talent into NRL, Queensland and Australian sides. Every year the foundation selects an Under-15 squad for an overseas trip. In previous years the destination has been Fiji and New Zealand. This year the group will go to Papua New Guinea. They will leave in December in order to coincide with the end of the school year, but according to Beetson, in years gone by when the trip was directly after the carnival, hopeful kids would turn up with their passports ready to travel. After the overseas experience, the best of these juniors are then selected for the Murri Under-16 side that plays against the Koori Knockout Under-16 side before the Indigenous All Stars match. One of the graduates of this Murri Under-16 side is Ash Taylor, who was selected in 2011 and is now the starting halfback for the Gold Coast Titans. Another recent graduate is Brisbane Broncos rookie David Fifita, who this year was touted by Fox Sports commentator Andrew Voss as “the best schoolboy forward I have ever seen in over 20 years of calling the competition.” Beetson is proud of the role that the Murri Carnival has played in Fifita’s development. “He’s probably the best junior in Australia at the moment,” said Beetson. “And he’s just a quality human being as well.” While the Murri Carnival is a career stepping stone for some, for most it is a chance to catch up with friends and family and reaffirm connection to community. From Wednesday to Saturday, four fields and the main ground at Dolphin Oval in Redcliffe were in constant use as thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men, women and juniors played for their chosen teams. The full diversity of Murris in Queensland are represented at the carnival. There are First Nations teams such as the Mununjali Eagles, urban sides like Inala Wangarra Panthers, island teams like the Dunwich Darkies, regional sides such as Oakey Redbelly Blacks from the Darling Downs, South West Dos United from Charleville in the far west and Arafura Heat from the north. There are also a few memorial sides, and mission teams from Cherbourg, Woorabinda, and Yarrabah. At the Murri Carnival the Yarrabah Seahawks are also known as Yarrabah Guyala, which means “seahawk” in language and is the totem for the community. Before the games and when they defend their line, players can be heard calling out “guyala” to one another in a show of strength. Home to roughly 2,500 people, Yarrabah is a former Aboriginal mission situated on the Coral Sea more than 1000km north of Brisbane. The club fields teams from juniors through to seniors, although due to the huge distance and the massive travel costs, only the men’s senior side made it to this year’s Murri Carnival. “The council supports the club throughout the year,” explained Yarrabah mayor Ross Andrews. “For Indigenous carnivals there are sponsors from here and there, donations, and everybody loves rugby league so much they chip in their own money to travel.” On the weekend before the Murri Carnival, the Yarrabah Seahawks won the senior premiership and the reserve grade for the first time since the club entered the Cairns competition 17 years ago. Considering many of their local rivals such as Innisfail, Tully and Mareeba have rich leagues clubs, it was a remarkable achievement. The Seahawks coach, Edward Prior, believes the return of former Queensland Cup player Hezron Murga, as well as the leadership of captain Milton Mossman, made a big difference. Palm Islander Vern Daisy, one half of the legendary Daisy brothers that dominated North Queensland football in the 1970s, was excited to see the Seahawks triumph. “Yarrabah is similar to Palm Island – they love their football,” he said. “It took them a number of years to win a grand final, but what’s more, they had three teams in the final. The reserve grade and the A-grade players came up victorious. We’ve been talking about it at the carnival.” The first patron of the Yarrabah Seahawks, 83-year-old Arthur Malcolm, said “it was wonderful to see the people of Yarrabah come together as a unit”. Malcolm, who was the first Aboriginal bishop in the Anglican Church of Australia, was born in Yarrabah in 1934 and can remember the dormitories of mission days, the spear fishing and playing barefoot rugby league. As a community elder he follows the team everywhere and gives the players pre-game pep talks. “I said to the players before they went out, when you see flags around the ground and people cheering you on, you’re playing for yourself but you’re also playing for your community,” he said. “The pride of our community.” Vincent Schreiber, a fifth-generation tribal King of Yarrabah and a self-described “jack-of-all-trades”, echoes Malcolm’s view. Schreiber, 52, has seen the tension that sometimes divides the different clans and tribes in the community. Rugby league, he believes, eases those tensions. “In the generations before we had fighting between clan groups,” he said. “But now we’ve got different clan groups coming into one to make a big group. No matter what happens after the football finishes, they’re still brothers. That’s where the strength of the community comes from – it’s not just one family, it’s the community as a whole.” Missing several of their key players and still recovering from the celebrations that followed their famous premiership win, the Yarrabah Seahawks bowed out at the playoffs. In the end, the Brisbane Natives beat Gundalu Gadyu in the women’s final, and Dhadhin Geai Warriors – a sensational Torres Strait Island side featuring NRL players Eldrick Lee and Travis Waddell – put on a masterclass to beat the SEQ Indigenous All Stars 48–0 in the men’s final. With the Murri Carnival finished and the Under-15 side selected for 2017, this weekend the 47th Koori Knockout will be played in Sydney. NITV commentator Brad Cooke, who has called both the Murri Carnival and the Koori Knockout for years, says these tournaments are vital to the future of the sport. “The Under-15s event at the Murri Carnival and at the Koori Knockout is the pinnacle of the future of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island rugby league,” said Cooke. “At the moment in country areas the sport is dying. But teams are still playing rugby league in these Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities. And they’re saving the game of rugby league, not just the future of the Indigenous All Stars teams. Not enough credit is given for that. More than 12% of players in the NRL are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Where are they coming from? They’re coming from here at these carnivals.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/25/new-zealand-party-leaders-woo-winston-peters-support-after-election-stalemate","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T06:08:36Z","webTitle":"New Zealand party leaders woo Winston Peters' support after election stalemate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/25/new-zealand-party-leaders-woo-winston-peters-support-after-election-stalemate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/25/new-zealand-party-leaders-woo-winston-peters-support-after-election-stalemate","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand party leaders woo Winston Peters' support after election stalemate","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"New Zealand’s major political parties are scrambling to woo the support of the smaller New Zealand First party to form a government after Saturday’s stalemate election. Neither the incumbent National party, led by a revitalised Bill English, nor the opposition Labour party, led by Jacinda Ardern, are in a position to take office, with 15% of the vote still to be counted. The ruling National party won 58 seats and Labour 45 – both short of the 61 needed to form a government in the 120-seat parliament. New Zealand First’s Winston Peters, an unpredictable populist, has been left as the kingmaker after winning nine seats. Coalition negotiations are expected to take weeks, possibly months, as all parties wait for the more than 300,000 special votes to be counted by 7 October. Special votes are made up of overseas voters and voters who enrolled and voted on the same day. The turnout on Saturday of 78.8% was lower than expected, but slightly up from 77.9% in 2014. Voter numbers were disappointing for Labour who were relying on young voters to push them into government. However Maori voters showed a huge level of support for Labour, electing seven Labour politicians for the seven Maori-reserved seats in parliament. The minor Maori party lost all its seats and a number of its members announced their retirement. The Labour leader said the vote of confidence from Maori – who make up about 15% of the New Zealand population – meant Labour had a “real responsibility” to improve the lives of New Zealand’s indigenous people, who are overrepresented in poor socioeconomic outcomes, high unemployment rates and high suicide rates. “It is now incumbent on us to ensure we are doing everything we can to deliver for Maori,” said Ardern. “Regardless of what position we’re in, we’ll be advocating to lift Maori home ownership, lift outcomes for Maori health, and lift job opportunities and hope for our rangatahi [younger generation],” she said. Ardern reported that Australian Labor leader Bill Shorten called her on Sunday night to talk about the election and the path ahead for New Zealand Labour. The prime minister, Bill English, said a timeframe of “two to three weeks” was reasonable for coalition negotiations to take place between his party and NZ First. English described Peters as a “maverick” but said his positions on certain issues were well-known and could be reflected in a National-NZ First coalition government. “People want to continue with the economic direction and they voted for progress,” English told Radio New Zealand. “We have yet to secure a mandate to govern ... but I think there is a clear indication from voters of continuing the direction National campaigned on.” English added he had known Peters “a long time” and the National party would not rule “anything out” before talking privately with Peters. “He understands his role; he’s very experienced. Some of his long-held positions I think he would expect to be reflected in government policy.” Over the past nine years of National government, Peters has repeatedly opined on his many “bottom lines” if he were to form a coalition government with a major party at the next election. These may include: plans to slash migration to 10,000 a year – a drop of more than 60,000 annually; a ban on foreigners buying land and establishing a foreign ownership register; moving public service jobs out of Wellington to regional areas; holding a referendum on the anti-smacking law; and installing New Zealand woollen carpets in all government departments, schools and agencies.

The Australian Energy Market Operator has reported next year’s gas supply shortfall could be “higher than expected” which could lead to even higher energy prices for eastern and south-eastern Australia, particularly for industry, which accounts for almost 40% of gas usage. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also warned of a coming shortfall. The government has a mechanism which would keep more gas onshore for domestic use and earlier this year started the process to enact it. Labor has been calling on the government to start it up, but although the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said it was “ready to go”, the government needed to make sure it was “fit for purpose”. “It is a process of careful consultation,” Turnbull said on Monday. “Had we made a determination a week ago, we would have done so on the basis of information which was inaccurate. “If we are not able to receive the assurances from the industry to our satisfaction and that of the ACCC, then we will impose those export controls.” Turnbull said states with a moratorium on gas exploration “have failed” and it was “one of the biggest long-term problems”. In a statement which accompanied its report, Aemo’s chief executive, Audrey Zibelman, said: “Projections of aggregated gas production and LNG gas demand vary, based on market conditions and contracting, indicating a dynamic situation that can change rapidly and warrants continued close attention and monitoring.” Turnbull said he had spoken to the gas export companies on Monday morning and said “they’ve indicated that they’re committed to ensuring [a shortage] does not occur too”. “We want to see a plan from them, we want to see a commitment, then we want to be satisfied that it meets the requirements of the ACCC,” he said. “This is all part of the process that we set out when we set up the gas security mechanism at the beginning of the year.” Labor has repeatedly called on the government to pull the trigger to enact the export control mechanism but Turnbull said that proved “they have no idea how the mechanism works”. “They haven’t bothered to get into that sort of detail, too much hard work I suspect,” he said. “The process is going exactly as we planned it to.” The government has until 1 November to enact the mechanism, which would come into effect on 1 January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/25/why-the-world-expert-on-aspergers-took-30-years-to-notice-condition-in-his-own-son","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T06:58:24Z","webTitle":"Why the world expert on Asperger's took 30 years to notice condition in his own son","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/25/why-the-world-expert-on-aspergers-took-30-years-to-notice-condition-in-his-own-son","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/25/why-the-world-expert-on-aspergers-took-30-years-to-notice-condition-in-his-own-son","fields":{"headline":"Why the world expert on Asperger's took 30 years to notice condition in his own son","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Will Attwood has been addicted to drugs for the past two decades, an affliction which has seen the 35-year-old jailed multiple times and reliant on support from his family. His father, Prof Tony Attwood, describes him as “a hero”. It’s a feeling towards his son that has come about since his decision about five years ago to watch an old family video. Until then Attwood, an internationally renowned clinical psychologist known for his knowledge of Asperger syndrome in children, had been reluctant to look back on the videos of Will as a toddler, a time before addiction and pain. “They were hard to watch,” he said. But his daughter Rosie, a teacher to preschool children with autism, convinced him to play one of the videos for her and reminisce. They watched as Attwood appeared on the screen with Will, who was then about four. They were at a beach. “In the video I was trying to engage with him, and he really just didn’t want to know me,” Attwood said. “I was giving him all signs of interaction and trying to play with him, and he was basically in a world of his own. It wasn’t shyness, because he knew me. Something more was going on.” A few minutes into watching, Attwood and Rosie looked at each other in shared recognition of what they were seeing. “He’s got Asperger’s,” they said at the same time. The world expert on Asperger syndrome had for three decades failed to diagnose the condition in his own son, whose crippling anxiety led him to use alcohol and marijuana when he was a teenager, which progressed into an addiction. “I realised that I couldn’t make the diagnosis myself because I’m his dad, which would make it hard to be objective,” Attwood said. “And love is blind. “So I arranged for someone I know and who I very much respect to see him, and she confirmed the diagnosis.” His son has just finished serving a two-year sentence, and said having a diagnosis made his time in prison easier. “Previously he was lost in the social world not knowing where he was going, but suddenly he had a road map guiding him about why he felt certain ways and this helped him to understand what he needed to do to cope,” Attwood said. “Will is now writing a book to help people with Asperger’s cope with prison, as a very high proportion of those in alcohol and drug dependency services have Asperger’s and often end up in prison because of that. So really, I see him as a hero.” Although Attwood couldn’t help but wonder what might have turned out differently for his son had the diagnosis been made when he was a child, he also knows better than most how scant any research on the condition was back then. Asperger syndrome, a condition on the autism spectrum, is a developmental disorder that can affect social and communication skills. It is not unusual for those with the condition to be high-functioning, with expertise in a specific topic that can at times be prodigious. “On one end of the spectrum you have children who are silent, with no speech and poor communication skills and who need a high-level of support in a special school, while on the other end is someone working as a professor or engineer,” Attwood said. Attwood was just 19 and volunteering at a special school in England, where he was born, when he first encountered children with autism. Back then, the children were described as having “childhood schizophrenia”, even though schizophrenia is a much different neurodevelopmental disorder. With such a limited understanding about the field, the children were particularly challenging for Attwood at the time. But he knew he wanted to understand them and decided that was how he would spend his career. More than 45 years later, he is so highly sought after that he can no longer accept patients at his clinic in Brisbane, in Australia, or even manage a waiting list. But he regularly answers questions on his YouTube channel, and tries to make as much of his research available as possible for free on the internet. His research has taught him that children with Asperger’s should be defined by their strengths and not by their limitations. They are often loyal and dependable; take people at face value and are less likely to label people according to sexist, age-ist, or cultural biases; speak their mind; have a high attention to detail; and are determined to seek the truth, among other strengths. He teaches psychologists around the world to identify and work with these characteristics. Attwood is focusing his research on women, who are much more affected by Asperger’s than previously thought. Until just a few years ago it was commonly said there were 10 men for every woman with the condition. Now that number is closer to two men for every woman. While he is well-known for his discoveries in the field and for his work writing “the bible” on Asperger syndrome, Attwood has only now begun to share the story of how the condition has affected his own family. The story will be the subject of an episode of the ABC’s Australian Story airing on Monday. “Realising that Will has Asperger’s was an intense relief,” he said. “Before that it was like trying to make a 5,000-piece jigsaw puzzle without the picture, and then suddenly you’re given the picture on the box. I can now explain to him what is happening to him in his language, in ‘Aspergese’. “I now know he wasn’t trying to be a difficult child and that I wasn’t a bad parent. And when I talk to other parents now, I can tell them I truly understand the genuine feeling of being an exhausted parent.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/26/acdcs-angus-young-his-top-five-rocknroll-moves","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T18:00:20Z","webTitle":"AC/DC's Angus Young: his top five rock'n'roll moves","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/26/acdcs-angus-young-his-top-five-rocknroll-moves","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/26/acdcs-angus-young-his-top-five-rocknroll-moves","fields":{"headline":"AC/DC's Angus Young: his top five rock'n'roll moves","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"During a career now spanning 40-odd years, AC/DC’s Angus Young has become renowned for many things: his distinctive dress sense, his devil’s horns, and a signature guitar sound that has inspired headbangers everywhere and helped shift several hundred million records worldwide. While the origin of his fondness for school uniforms, and the band’s name – both courtesy of his sister Margaret – are relatively well-known, what’s not so familiar is the different inspirations for the many tricks Young pulls off during one of his typically tireless, frenetic live performances. Allow me, if you will, to spill the beans. 1. The Duckwalk Young would have been perfectly comfortable if the recording of music ended some time around the late 1950s. He has regularly paid dues to the artists that have inspired him musically, and most come from the earliest days of rock’n’roll: I’m talking Little Richard, Buddy Holly and the like. But the influence of the recently departed Chuck Berry extends beyond Young’s playing and writing. Berry actually inspired the frenzied duckwalk that Young pulls off every night. Admittedly, Young’s duckwalk comes at a much faster clip than Berry’s; the onstage Angus always looks and plays like a man in a hurry. There’s also Young’s habit of “conducting” an audience with his guitar, playing a flurry of notes, stopping abruptly, inciting the crowd to chant and then repeating the process until he’s flailing at his Gibson and the crowd is wailing along like banshees. Again. Berry inspired: “When [Berry] was singing,” Young once revealed, “he always had little raps with the audience ... I figured if Chuck could do it with his voice, I could do it with my guitar.” 2. The Dying Bug This is the routine where Young drops to the floor of the stage and while gyrating madly and kicking his legs like a dying cockroach, fires off an inspired solo. This routine came about purely by accident; one night Young slipped over while playing, and fearing being mocked by the crowd, stayed down and kept soloing, doing his utmost to make it appear intentional. “I tripped over a lead,” Angus told a DJ from Sydney radio station 2JJ, “and fell on me knees. I thought people thought I was a fuckin’ idiot so I started bobbin’ around on the ground.” 3. Angus Up the Ladder Young has always had a thing for heights; as soon as the band started playing larger shows he’d usually end up on top of a PA or speaker stack, soloing as if his life depended on it, sometimes dodging bottles as he played. However, in 1986, while shooting the video for Who Made Who, Young had a very uneasy moment as he was lowered by wires from a second-storey balcony on to the stage floor – he felt genuine fear. “My whole life flashed before me,” he admitted, “and since I’m pretty short, that’s not very long.” Soon after, a doctor gave Angus an unexpected prognosis: he suffered from acrophobia and probably had for years. 4. The Shoulder Ride A favourite part of the “Bon and Angus show” – the double-headed beast that was such a trademark of early AC/DC – was the big moment, often during the track Livewire, when the brawny singer would hoist the scrawny guitarist on to his shoulders and carry him around the venue, parting punters like Moses did the Red Sea. Curiously, Bon “borrowed” the move from Brian Johnson, when he caught the future AC/DC shouter in his first band, Geordie, doing the exact same thing with that band’s guitarist, Vic Malcolm. 5. The Snot Cyclone As anyone close to the AC/DC onstage action can attest, especially during the early days of the band, coming too near Young in full flight could be dangerous. Mark Evans, their original bassist, revealed to me while writing High Voltage that the young Angus’ diet – a not quite department of health-approved blend of ciggies, chocolate milk and spaghetti bolognaise – would result in him emitting what Evans called a “snot cyclone” as he played, which usually left its mark over eager punters down front. Duck and cover. Angus also sheds as much as 2kg per show purely in sweat Backstage, band members would look on in shock as he removed the scratch plate of his guitar and poured out what seemed like litres of his own sweat. Nowadays he has someone to do that onerous task for him; but at 62, Angus still works hard for his money: a handy nest egg that currently sits at around $200m. • Jeff Apter is the author of High Voltage: The Life of Angus Young – AC/DC’s Last man Standing (Nero)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14794","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T23:00:36Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,794","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14794","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14794","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,794","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14790","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T23:00:15Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,790","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14790","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14790","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,790","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/24/brighton-hove-albion-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T17:25:00Z","webTitle":"Tomer Hemed sinks Newcastle as Brighton grab much-needed win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/24/brighton-hove-albion-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/24/brighton-hove-albion-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Tomer Hemed sinks Newcastle as Brighton grab much-needed win","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If Brighton &amp; Hove Albion get relegated this season it will not be for a lack of valour, focus or determination. This narrowest of home wins against a team who were technically their better will be celebrated in this part of the south coast, though probably only briefly. The next test, at Arsenal next Sunday, is only around the corner. Tomer Hemed’s dextrous second-half volley was enough to separate the home side from a Newcastle United who had come into the match after three consecutive wins and left it reminded of the fine margins of Premier League football. For Brighton, meanwhile, it was back-to-back victories at the Amex Stadium. Controversy after the match centred on Hemed, who had appeared to stamp on DeAndre Yedlin during a defensive spell and shove Chancel Mbemba in the build up to his goal. If found guilty of the stamp, he could face a three-match retrospective ban. Others might argue, however, that a highly presentable chance passed up by Hemed’s opposite number, Joselu, had a more important influence on the match. “I’m delighted with the win but also very pleased with the manner of it,” a typically tranquil Chris Hughton said after the match. “Once we got the goal it was very difficult because you either press for the ball and leave space or you stay compact and they get a lot of the ball.” Albion, as is Hughton’s style, opted for the latter option and it worked. “We had to defend well to win this game and I thought we did.” These two sides know each other well, of course, having contested a two-horse race for the title in the Championship last season. Both Hughton and Rafael Benítez acknowledged that there is not much to choose between them; not in personnel, attitude or even formation. “They’re quite similar in the way they play, a 4–4–1–1, though they probably have a bit more pace off the front than we have‚” Hughton said. “It was nice to win but they’d look at the fact they’re still two points ahead of us in the table.” It was perhaps an acknowledgement of the speed provided by Christian Atsu and Matt Ritchie that Brighton were happy to play on the break, even during the opening exchanges. That was where the space was however, and when Anthony Knockaert found Solly March in room on the left in the 11th minute, the first big chance of the match followed. March whipped the ball across the face of goal where it eventually fell to Pascal Gross on the edge of the box. With the goal at his mercy, the German advanced on to the ball and drove his shot fiercely into Knockaert’s back. Ten minutes later and Newcastle had contrived an even more glaring miss. It was a sweet move, flowing all the way from their own box with Mikel Merino robbing Knockaert, then advancing the ball to Atsu who drove inside and out at the Brighton defence before slipping in Ayoze Pérez for the cross. Pérez found his fellow Spaniard on the edge of the six-yard box. Joselu, who contrived a series of glaring misses against Stoke last week, rolled his marker cleverly, spun on the ball and pushed his shot well wide of the far post. From that point the first half declined. Gross put paid to a well-worked counterattack with a six-yard pass straight to Ciaran Clark. Pérez shot over from close range when teed up by Chancel Mbemba. When the half-time whistle went, Hughton had a face like thunder. Within six minutes of the restart, however, Brighton had the all-important opening goal. It came from a setpiece on the left-hand side of the Newcastle box, driven deep by Gross. Dale Stephens met the ball unmarked at the back post and nodded it back across goal where it skewed through a defender’s legs and up to chest height. With barely any time to react, Hemed managed to meet the ball both on the turn and on the volley and flashed it into the roof of the net. Newcastle did not look like their gameplan had been thrown out of the window, they remained calm and composed. But they were lacking the alacrity to penetrate a Brighton defence that had been happy to invite them on to them in the first place. For their part, Brighton’s counterattacks – even with half an hour remaining – were now largely seen as opportunities to run the ball into the corner. Benítez argued later that Hemed had shoved Mbemba as the initial ball came over the box. “It’s a player who is moving and pushing, not someone standing still,” he said. But he also acknowledged that his team needed to create more with the ball, especially after going behind. “We did some good things, we had some chances. But we have to learn from this defeat. You have to be stronger in defence if you want a clean sheet in the Premier League and you have to take your chances. It’s a pity with so much control at the end we didn’t create better chances.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/24/chelsea-thibaut-courtois-antonio-conte","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T21:30:04Z","webTitle":"Thibaut Courtois confident resurgent Chelsea are hitting form at right time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/24/chelsea-thibaut-courtois-antonio-conte","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/24/chelsea-thibaut-courtois-antonio-conte","fields":{"headline":"Thibaut Courtois confident resurgent Chelsea are hitting form at right time","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If there were any Chelsea fans still worrying whether they would make a better fist of defending their Premier League title than the previous attempt, the clinical way in which Antonio Conte’s side dispatched Stoke City on Saturday has surely dispelled those doubts. A third successive away win courtesy of Álvaro Morata’s brilliant hat-trick ensured they remain within touching distance of the two Manchester clubs at the top of the nascent table, even if Conte will be more than happy to remain the shadows for now. However, after the turbulence created by Diego Costa’s fractious departure and the surprise opening-day defeat at home against Burnley, it is a measure of their manager’s ability that his side prepare to face City in the first big title showdown of the season at Stamford Bridge on Saturday three points better off than at the same stage 12 months ago. Chelsea’s defeat against Arsenal in their sixth game of the last campaign heralded the switch to the now familiar back three as they embarked on a winning run of 13 matches. This time around, with Morata already finding his feet up front in place of Costa and his fellow new arrival Tiémoué Bakayoko beginning to form a formidable partnership with N’Golo Kanté in central midfield, Conte will have no need to instigate such sweeping changes – especially given that Eden Hazard has yet to start in the Premier League after his ankle injury. “Stoke away is a hard game and last year we only won in the last minutes,” said the goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, who will be fit to face his former club Atlético Madrid in Wednesday’s Champions League tie after emerging unscathed from a nasty fall in the second half. “This year Arsenal lost here. United struggled at 2-2, so to win by four is pleasing.” In truth the scoreline against a side without three of their frontline defenders perhaps flattered Chelsea somewhat, even if Morata deserved all the plaudits for his superb display. At first glance the player who arrived at Juventus from Real Madrid in 2014 four days after Conte had left on his way to taking over as Italy manager does not appear to possess any special attributes. But the 24-year-old showed a deceptively gliding turn of pace to skip past Darren Fletcher for his second goal and was also a physical threat for Stoke’s makeshift backline throughout. “I think now he is totally involved with our style of football and idea,” Conte said. “He is very strong and you can see that today. A lot of good contact and tackles. I think he showed he is a really good, complete player. He didn’t play a lot with Real Madrid and Juventus but now he has a great chance to show he is a really good striker, a fantastic striker.” But while Morata can expect a hostile reception on his return to the Spanish capital on Wednesday, Courtois is not anticipating any such problems. The Belgium international spent three seasons on loan at the Vicente Calderón between 2011 and 2014 and is looking forward to experiencing their the brand new 68,000-seater Wanda Metropolitano stadium. “I remember being at the presentation of the new stadium when they first revealed it,” he said. “I went there to see the place when there was only one stand – the old one – and they were doing the groundwork. It will be nice to see it. “Álvaro played a lot of games against Atlético. I think it will be a big game against his old rivals. It will be more friendly for me but between the 90 minutes I will also be a rival of Atlético.” That should at least provide Conte with more of a barometer for his side’s European ambitions than the 6-0 thrashing of Qarabag in the opening match, with the free-scoring City also looming large as the title race begins to take shape. “It will be interesting for us,” Courtois said. “We have started this difficult week well with a good victory against Stoke and hopefully Wednesday and Saturday we will carry this good form on. “The top teams are doing well this season and we are happy to be close to the top. If we want to close that gap we need to try and win next week.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/25/historic-referendum-on-independence-leaves-iraqi-kurds-polarised","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T04:00:03Z","webTitle":"Iraqi Kurds polarised as region holds historic referendum on independence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/25/historic-referendum-on-independence-leaves-iraqi-kurds-polarised","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/25/historic-referendum-on-independence-leaves-iraqi-kurds-polarised","fields":{"headline":"Iraqi Kurds polarised as region holds historic referendum on independence","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Its streets bustled with Sunday shoppers. Its teahouses brimmed with men who preferred playing dominoes to talking politics. And on boulevards and in town squares, there was hardly a Kurdish flag to be seen. On the eve of a historic day in Kurdistan, the region’s two biggest hubs were a tale of two cities. In Erbil, the centre of Monday’s independence referendum, a festival feel that had built for the past week had taken over neighbourhoods. Flags fluttered from street poles, and car windows and shops were festooned with banners proclaiming the dawn of self-determination. In Sulaimaniya, 150 miles to the east, there was no sign of celebration, or of a vote on an issue that has defined the Kurdish cause for centuries. In the Shab teahouse, a business-as-usual feel belied the imminent day of reckoning. A lone Kurdish flag was pinned among framed photos of revolutionaries, poets and scholars. None were of the Kurdish president, Massoud Barzani, who will take the Kurds of Iraq to the polls on Monday. For more than two decades, Erbil and Sulaimaniya have been rival power bases in northern Iraq. The former is home to the Barzani clan, and the latter the base of the Talabani family – the second act in the dynastic politics of Iraqi Kurdistan, whose people remain polarised even at a turning point in their history. Barzani, the veteran leader – who became de facto president two years ago after a dispute over power sharing – is popular in Erbil, but not in Sulaimaniya, where some residents view his sponsorship of the referendum as an act of partisan politics. “That’s the problem with our people,” said Nuri Kaka Khan, a veteran local actor, as he played dominoes in the teahouse. “Their mind is in their eyes. They think what they see. They think this is a project made by Barzani. But it is not the Barzani family’s fault. It is not a political project. It is bigger than that. “It’s the first time in history that the Kurds are determining their own fate. This has to be based on more than personalities. What’s important is that we put all our differences aside and offer our votes for the support of the nation.” Building on a theme that has gathered momentum in Kurdish society, but has been disavowed by its leaders, Khan said: “It has been more than a century that we have been oppressed on our own lands, as have our people elsewhere in the region.” Fears that the referendum may galvanise a cause among the regional Kurdish populations have led to jitters among senior officials in both cities – Sulaimaniya in particular. Here, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) party has built binding ties with Iran, which is bitterly opposed to the referendum and has put pressure on leaders in both cities to abandon it. Hero Ibrahim Ahmed, the wife of the PUK leader, Jalal Talabani, who suffered a stroke in 2012 and remains incapacitated, refused Iran’s demands and voted for the referendum in a rare parliamentary session this month. Barzani appeared at a rally alongside Ibrahim Ahmed in Sulaimaniya on Friday in a show of unity that emboldened him in the face of vehement international opposition. Another political party, Gorran, as well as the Kurdistan Islamic Group, boycotted the parliamentary session and called for the vote to be postponed. After a brief four-month campaign, and the futile shuttle diplomacy of diplomats and emissaries, that seems unlikely to happen. Barzani is now all but certain to take the Kurds to a historic vote, but without the unity – or overwhelming legitimacy – that he had hoped for. Omed Jalal, a teahouse patron, and supporter of the Gorran party, said: “It’s the first time in our history that the Kurds have decided on something of their own. We are like the Scottish people.” Asked to explain the lack of visible enthusiasm for what many in Erbil bill as a foundational act of nation building, he added: “The people in Sulaimaniya are more cultured and intellectual. They are more tribal in Erbil. They are taking it easy here. “My personal opinion is that I don’t feel comfortable with one family leading the Kurds. I would like someone different, like a professor. Gorran was a really good model. But it needs more time to develop. It is too early.” Announcing on Sunday that the ballot would go ahead as planned, with PUK support even in the disputed areas of Kirkuk and towns to the south, Barzani seemed to sense he had turned a corner domestically. European diplomats also believe the PUK support – as begrudging as it appears – marks a moment for the Kurds. “He should have given everyone ownership of this,” said an Erbil-based international observer. “This has exposed how factionalised they remain, not how unified they are. If they can’t get it together on this issue, then they face a tough future.” Additional reporting by Mohammed Rasool"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/24/bank-account-checks-and-modern-slavery","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T16:44:48Z","webTitle":"Bank account checks and modern slavery | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/24/bank-account-checks-and-modern-slavery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/24/bank-account-checks-and-modern-slavery","fields":{"headline":"Bank account checks and modern slavery","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The prime minister happily invokes the history of transatlantic slavery when it comes to the measures she is implementing against what she calls “modern slavery”. But her ambition to create a “hostile environment” for irregular migrants (UK banks to check 70m bank accounts in search for illegal immigrants, 21 September) evokes rather different historical comparisons. The constitutions drawn up by “free” northern states in America such as Ohio and Illinois in the early 19th century, for example, may have prevented slavery, but their white architects were at pains to discourage fugitive slaves from southern states from seeking refuge there. They crafted legislation requiring black people with free status to register with their county of residence and carry proof of freedom. Residents who harboured runaway slaves were criminalised, and to assist southern slave owners seeking to recapture runaway slaves, there were laws mandating employers and schools to verify certificates of freedom of all persons racialised as black. Had it been the norm for people to have bank accounts, banks would doubtlessly have been required to police their customers. The kind of freedom that is being protected in the UK today is no more universal or morally admirable than this was historically. Worse still, the planned checks on bank accounts will force many irregular migrants into deeper dependency on employers and others. They will be left more, not less, vulnerable to the “horrific abuses” that Mrs May claims to find so intolerable.

These ideas, technology and cutting waste could massively reduce livestock’s impact, but nobody wants the bill while benefits could still be lost. Even dramatic reductions in human emissions may not stop the climate change trend. Those most at risk won’t benefit from technological advances, and the response to climate refugees approaching richer countries can be imagined. More food from less space doesn’t guarantee more room for wildlife; environmentalists often estimate western lifestyles for all would require at least three fully exploited planets. And it isn’t just burgers: biofuels, other cash crops, mineral extraction, suburban sprawl, dams and other developments could outweigh potential gains. Underlying these concerns are free market idiocies. Resources are looted for short-term gain, having enough is an alien concept and “make more money, buy more stuff” rules. Maybe the world needs to chill in more ways than one. Iain Climie Whitchurch, Hampshire • The great thing about animals (including fish) is that they enclose a protected environment for their cells. Not only that, but they find and input their own raw materials and output their waste products.

Why?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Front Row, on Radio 4, is reliable, it is competent, it is always there, just after the news and the Archers. Its presenters are interested in their subjects, and good journalists. It knows what it is; it feels comfortable in its skin. I would care if it got taken off air. One can see, then, after the demise of BBC television’s The Culture Show and Newsnight Review (each shunted around the schedules until they died of confusion) why it was chosen to form the template of a new BBC2 arts show. But would Front Row work on TV? There was trouble before the first programme even aired on Saturday evening. Instead of giving the regular radio presenters – Kirsty Lang, Samira Ahmed and John Wilson – jobs on the telly, new anchors for the small-screen version were announced. They were to be BBC media editor Amol Rajan, radio presenter and former actor Nikki Bedi, and, weirdly, Giles Coren, not everyone’s cup of tea, a journalist noted for his newspaper restaurant reviews and for having presented The Supersizers, but having no apparent qualifications for fronting an arts show aside from once having won the bad sex award for his debut novel, Winkler. Then came an interview in the Radio Times in which Coren declared he had not been to the theatre much for the past seven years (owing to paternal bathtime duties) and found the medium “stressful”; Rajan confessed to the sin of enjoying Andrew Lloyd Webber; and Bedi said she disliked sitting through very long plays without intervals. As indignation raged among the show’s tiny potential audience, Coren gave an interview on the radio version of Front Row to Wilson (a brilliantly self-consuming BBC ploy that could have been dreamed up by W1A’s press officer Tracey Pritchard). Instead of eating humble pie and declaring his curiosity and intention to learn, which might have been the wiser course under the circumstances, Coren declared that there was “a theatrical establishment” that was silently mind-controlling audiences to believe that “there’s only one kind of thing you ought to like and here’s how you ought to like it”. (I feel once Coren has started attending the theatre regularly, he may recognise the innate ridiculousness of the claim that the British theatre world – talented and delightful as it is in so many ways – is capable of organising a global conspiracy.) To the show itself. There was one perfectly good thing about it: an interview with director Michael Winterbottom by Wilson, who had been allowed to appear briefly on the telly. However, aside from the opportunity to look at the faces of two middle-aged men – handsome as they may be – it could just as well have been on the radio. Aside from a brief performance by the band Wolf Alice, the rest was a bit of a wobble. The studio set consisted of an arrangement of what looked like giant blister-packets of paracetemol in a virulent shade of purple. Coren, perhaps advisedly, largely stuck to the autocue, though that lent a certain stiffness to proceedings. There was an interview with Gilbert &amp; George: it elicited nothing fresh about the artists. On a rather-too-small sofa sat the studio guests, writer and comedian Viv Groskop and radio DJ Nihal Arthanayake, whose job it was to have too little time to say anything interesting about quite odd subjects. (Harry Potter, good or bad? Really? The week of Simon Rattle’s blazing Stravinsky with the London Symphony Orchestra?) Nothing seemed to matter very much. The stakes were low. There was no danger, no heat, no fire. Nothing that might force the intellect into a state of gentle strain. Heaven forfend that it might have tackled subjects that weren’t obviously “popular” – there seemed about as little chance of the TV version of the programme tackling, say, the new show at the Chisenhale Gallery in east London as flying to Mars; and there was no hint of the political and issue-based items that the radio version sometimes includes. But somehow, on the radio, things are different: Melvyn Bragg gets to chat away with impunity about Immanuel Kant and people enjoy it. BBC2’s Front Row, judged on its first episode, feels like evidence of a massive failure of nerve, a shying-away from difficulty and risk, a pulped-down, food-processed version of the arts that lacked even the brisk, businesslike pleasures of its radio equivalent. Perhaps it will improve. Heaven knows that many a brilliant television show has had shaky early episodes. But not for the first time, I am forced to wonder: what is it about the arts that BBC TV fears so much?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/25/tigers-trent-cotchin-cleared-by-match-review-panel-to-play-afl-grand-final","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T01:31:27Z","webTitle":"Tigers' Trent Cotchin cleared by match review panel to play AFL grand final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/25/tigers-trent-cotchin-cleared-by-match-review-panel-to-play-afl-grand-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/25/tigers-trent-cotchin-cleared-by-match-review-panel-to-play-afl-grand-final","fields":{"headline":"Tigers' Trent Cotchin cleared by match review panel to play AFL grand final","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Richmond have been given a huge boost ahead of their first AFL grand final appearance for 35 years after the match review panel cleared their influential captain, Trent Cotchin, to play in Saturday’s premiership decider. Cotchin’s heavy collision with Greater Western Sydney player Dylan Shiel during Saturday’s preliminary final had been the focus of much of the post-match analysis, with his place in the biggest game of his career in jeopardy. The MRP met on Monday morning before delivering its verdict that Cotchin was seeking to contest the ball and therefore “contact was not unreasonable in the circumstances”. “Cotchin moves down low and braces for contact as Shiel approaches to pick up the ball,” the MRP said. “It was the view of the panel that Cotchin was seeking to win possession as his line of direction was always towards the ball and not his opponent. Cotchin, who has been in excellent form during the finals series, had been fined on two previous occasions earlier in the season for jumper punches. A third fine would have meant an automatic one-game ban. The MRP also cleared Cotchin’s team-mate Brandon Ellis of a high bump on Lachie Whitfield and Adelaide’s Rory Sloane of a bump on Patrick Dangerfield during Friday’s first preliminary final against Geelong. The Tigers booked a place in their first grand final for 35 years with victory over the Giants at the MCG on Saturday, and will meet Adelaide, who have themselves waited 19 years to reach the flag decider, at the same ground a week on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/28/decriminalisation-marijuana-civil-rights-al-sharpton","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T13:15:39Z","webTitle":"Why the decriminalization of marijuana is a civil rights cause | Al Sharpton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/28/decriminalisation-marijuana-civil-rights-al-sharpton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/28/decriminalisation-marijuana-civil-rights-al-sharpton","fields":{"headline":"Why the decriminalisation of marijuana is a civil rights cause","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In a year where the forces of racism, xenophobia and hate are ascendant, and our rights are under siege, it has become understandably difficult for many to envision a future beyond the latest injustice of the week. But the impressive resistance movement that has risen to challenge the Trump administration – and the inspiring number of first-time and long-time activists who have powered it – has grown strong enough to dream bigger than countering the president’s latest insult. There is no greater act of resistance than continuing to march towards the sweeping, systemic victories that have changed our nation’s trajectory for the better: voting rights, anti-employment discrimination measures, and most recently, President Obama’s success in securing health coverage for the 20 million Americans who were previously denied this universal human right. Determined to punish the rising majority of Americans he thinks have slighted him, our president may erode these freedoms, but he will not succeed in taking them. This is why I am proceeding undaunted towards our country’s next transformative victory – a fight I planned to pick under a Democratic administration, but one we should pursue just as vigorously in the reactionary Trump era: decriminalization of marijuana. It is a civil rights cause that we should not postpone, but accelerate during these dark and difficult times. For Democrats and progressives, the arguments have always been clear: generations of Americans, overwhelmingly people of color, have been imprisoned and starved of access to higher education, housing, and economic opportunities, and stripped of their inalienable right to vote thanks to non-violent acts. Billions of dollars in funding have been diverted from healthcare, jobs, and schools and have entrenched a prison-industrial complex built on a foundation of racism. But in truth, the conservative case for marijuana decriminalization is no less resonant. Archaic drug laws have fueled wasteful government spending, and made millions of Americans who dream, achingly, of being their family’s breadwinner dependent on the charity of others. And they have given rise of the epidemic of opiate drugs – often legally manufactured and prescribed – devastating communities that pundits have taken to calling the ‘white working class.’ The often-repeated reference to the ‘white working class’ has grown counterproductive as it focuses on a narrowly defined group instead of using more broader, inclusive categories. It also stifles the creative thinking and organizing needed to guide our efforts for the remainder of this presidency. On the issue of medical marijuana, a more accurate term for the residents of these hard-hit towns and regions – many of whom voted for President Trump – would be natural allies to the movement to decriminalize marijuana. In the coming weeks, I will be joining Decode Cannabis, a powerful new alliance of faith leaders, criminal justice reformers, healthcare practitioners, medical marijuana industry leaders and labor unions. For years, these groups have labored toward shared goals, but have too often done so in their respective silos. This initial coalition is impressive, but it is not enough to succeed. At least not on its own. To notch proactive policy wins in the Trump era, we must not retreat to the comfort of those of share our viewpoints. We must enter the lion’s den – even uninvited – to confront and cultivate the prospective allies who will mutually benefit from this cause. We must not allow the unique opportunities resulting from the intensifying rift between the White House and conventional Republicans to be squandered. I am not willing to compromise or concede on this, nor any other civil rights issue. But I am willing – and eager – to engage with those whose views I find objectionable, and who likely view me with no less animosity – to advance this cause. Doing so will determine whether or not the next generation of black Americans, Latinos, immigrants, and yes – the ‘white working class’ – fall victim to same racist and classist drug enforcement policies that brought oppression on their parents.

In a Premier League that at times seems to have all but given up anything resembling traditional defending, there was something almost comforting about a clash between two sides who play in such a familiar, unpretentious way. This was a reminder of simpler virtues, a world in which the greatest aspiration is to be compact, and produced a sort of mutually assured self-neutralisation, a game in which flair was all but absent and, where it did exist, confined to a tiny sliver on the flanks. That the one goal came from a set piece was entirely appropriate. The free-kick that produced the goal five minutes into the second half was in part a result of the Brighton left-back Markus Suttner pushing forward and linking with Tomer Hemed on the left, which always looked the most likely source of a breakthrough for Brighton. There seemed a fairly clear plan from the start to isolate DeAndre Yedlin, the Newcastle right-back, against Solly March. It was the 23-year-old’s cross, after Newcastle had been opened up by a burst from Anthony Knockaert, that led to the Pascal Gross shot that cannoned to safety off Knockaert and then his cross-shot, cutting inside, that drew an awkward sprawling save from Rob Elliot. In a tight first half, in which both sides were predictably compact and fairly narrow, most of Newcastle’s best openings similarly came down their left, Christian Atsu drifting infield to create chances for both Joselu and Ayoze Pérez. That, perhaps, should not come as too much of a surprise: both Chris Hughton and Rafa Benítez have a clearly defined way of playing that seeks, first and foremost, to maintain discipline and shape. Hughton acknowledged the importance of “solid platforms”. Only eight players – four from each side – started here who had started the Championship meeting between the clubs at the end of February, when Newcastle rather fortuitously came from behind to win with two late goals, yet the shape of the game was very similar. From the home side there was a 4-4-2 or 4-4-1-1, from the away team a 4-2-3-1, both seeking to deny the opposition space, both looking to their left-winger for creativity. Knockaert also had his moments but the organisation of both sides was such that, unless a player beat a couple of opponents, there was no space and the result was a game that flickered without ever quite catching light. Pérez, who might have been able to open the game up, was to all intents starved of possession and so his influence was limited throughout. But Newcastle are not quite a clone of last season, the change in their approach exemplified by the fact that Jonjo Shelvey has not been able to force his way back into the side after being sent off for treading on Dele Alli’s ankle against Tottenham on the opening weekend of the season. Shelvey was the creative fulcrum last season, his capacity to weight balls over the top for Dwight Gayle to run on to a key feature of the promotion campaign. But with Joselu replacing Gayle as the out-and-out striker, there has been far less need for that type of ball. Joselu may not be the most clinical finisher but he is an all-round striker and he is certainly not as quick as Gayle. But he is far more adept at holding the ball up and playing with his back to goal, giving Newcastle a more varied approach. That is the theory anyway but tactical schemes rarely exist in abstract isolation from other considerations and the fact is that Mikel Merino, the Spanish 21-year-old on loan from Borussia Dortmund, is a more reliable figure than Shelvey and probably just a better footballer. Nobody on the pitch attempted more passes than him and nobody had a better pass completion rate. Shelvey did come on midway through the second half, replacing Isaac Hayden, with Gayle joining him three minutes later, but by then Brighton had bunkered down, sitting deep so there was no space behind the back four for Gayle to exploit. He was such a peripheral figure that he had only two touches in the 20 minutes he was on the pitch. Partnering Shelvey and Merino, perhaps, might be a way of bringing a little more creativity to the midfield, although the risk is a greater openness and less protection for the back four. Benítez acknowledged it had been a “frustrating” afternoon but it was not particularly different from the games at Huddersfield and Swansea. Both of those matches were tight and hard-fought, lacking much in the way of flow and decided by a single goal. Brighton, similarly, have not conceded more than two in any game since March. Compact, solid, narrow: both sides will have a lot more matches this season settled by a single set play."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/24/jaguars-donald-trump-taking-a-knee-wembley","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T19:25:41Z","webTitle":"Jaguars send message to Donald Trump by taking a knee at Wembley | Sean Ingle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/24/jaguars-donald-trump-taking-a-knee-wembley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/24/jaguars-donald-trump-taking-a-knee-wembley","fields":{"headline":"Jaguars send message to Donald Trump by taking a knee at Wembley","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The message was simple, defiant and express-delivered to an orange-tinged septuagenarian living 3,600 miles away in Washington DC. As the Star Spangled Banner rang out across Wembley, 27 players and staff of the Jacksonville Jaguars and Baltimore Ravens dropped to one knee to protest against President Donald Trump – the largest number at an NFL game. Dozens more on the Jaguars staff, including their owner, Shahid Khan, linked hands on the touchline in support. Some say sport and politics should not mix. But after Trump’s explosive tweets over the weekend, during which he suggested that players who refused to stand for the national anthem should be fired and called on owners to “get that son of a bitch off the field” if they disrespected the flag, it was impossible to see how the two were not conjoined. And just as the Jaguars came together off the pitch, they quickly did so on it as they produced a complete performance to blunt and then skewer the Ravens 44-7. Really, though, the result was secondary to the protests. As AJ Bouye, the Jaguars’ cornerback, put it powerfully: “I’m not going to lie. I was pissed off. I don’t know the president as a man but what he’s saying about us, he’s disrespecting our mums. “And when you’re five years old and you’re seeing your dad have a gun pointed at his head because he looks suspicious in a neighbourhood at 6am because he’s dropping his son off at a babysitter. It’s not about race, it’s not about black and white, it’s about right and wrong. I’m tired of it, I’m really tired of it.” The wide receiver Marcedes Lewis, who caught three touchdowns for the Jaguars, was also eloquent. “My stepfather is a purple heart, so part of me is torn and, with the social injustices going on right now in the country, you can pull from both sides,” he said. “You have got people scared to go outside, scared to be in certain places. What’s wrong is wrong. “Man to man, you can’t tell another grown man, ‘Hey, you need to stand up’ or ‘You need to kneel’. You are going to do what you need to do. But we wanted to put it out there as a group.” Meanwhile Khan – the only non-white and only Muslim owner in the NFL – said that he fully supported his players, too. “We have a lot of work to do but the comments by the president make it harder,” he said. “That’s why it was important for us, and personally for me, to show the world that, even if we differ at times, we can and should be united in an effort to be better as people and as a nation.” It is now a decade since the first regular season NFL game was held in London, when the New York Giants beat the Miami Dolphins. Since then it is the Jaguars, who have signed a deal to play at Wembley until 2020, who have crossed the pond most often. And increasingly they seem to be getting a thirst for it, given this was their third straight win here. After opening the scoring when Jason Myers hit an early 23-yard field goal the Jaguars quickly increased their lead when their quarterback Blake Bortles faked a hand-off to the running back Chris Ivory, faked a reverse to the wide receiver Marqise Lee and then found Lewis for the touchdown. That put them 10-0 up at the end of the first quarter. And while they had made 169 total yards in the opening 15 minutes, the Ravens’ net yardage was minus one. It got even better for the Jaguars in the second quarter, as two more field goals and another Bortles touchdown pass, this time to Allen Hurns, left them 23-0 up at half-time. The Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco, who led his team to the Super Bowl in 2013, could only bang his foot in frustration as his team managed just one first down and 15 total yards in the entire first half. It was threatening to become a blowout. And soon it was thanks to two touchdown passes from Bortles to Lewes early in the third quarter that put the Jaguars 37-0 up. The Jaguars’ coach, Doug Marrone, later expressed his delight and said it was the second-best experience in his life at Wembley behind coming to watch a Freddie Mercury tribute concert in 1992. “It is always outstanding in London,” he said. “I don’t know if I have lost in this stadium and the fans were outstanding, too.” The Jaguars did not let up and went even further ahead at the start of the fourth quarter as the running back Leonard Fournette ran in from close range. There was time for a consolation score for the Ravens with three minutes remaining but by then the wind had been sucked from them and the game."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/25/smear-student-robbie-travers-racial-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T10:28:36Z","webTitle":"How smearing a woman’s reputation was irresistible for the media | Nick Cohen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/25/smear-student-robbie-travers-racial-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/25/smear-student-robbie-travers-racial-politics","fields":{"headline":"How smearing a woman’s reputation was irresistible for the media","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On 12 May, Robbie Travers sent Esme Allman, a fellow student at Edinburgh University, a Facebook message. “Hey Esme, just to let you know multiple news agencies have been delivered [sic] your comments on calling black men trash. You might want to think about saying that in future, some have been linked it [sic] to neo-Nazism.” The ill-crafted words were at best half-truths and at worst outright lies. But there was a nugget of fact beneath them, which Travers could melt and remould. Allman had indeed said “trash”. But the context, which Travers did not mention, could not have been further from neo-Nazism. Allman was in a Facebook group for black and ethnic minority students at Edinburgh. Its members talked about the abuse Serena Williams received when she announced she had fallen in love with a white man. Black men who insulted a black woman for marrying the love of her life were “trash”, Allman declared. Harsh words, but understandable in the circumstances. Whatever their colour, trolls are trash, after all. Travers appeared to have been monitoring Allman like a secret policeman looking for a dirty secret. And – Eureka! – he had found it. Or rather he had found an unexceptional opinion he could twist to make a black woman look like the very racists she opposes. He announced to his thousands of Facebook followers: “I will be unveiling a racist elected to the anti-racist post at Edinburgh University.” In view of what was to happen next, it is worth noting that Travers was the prig. He was trying to punish Allman for her words and thoughts, not the other way round. Allman thought he was harassing her and reported him to Edinburgh University for allegedly breaking its code of conduct (he was eventually cleared of this charge). So what? Student politics is so vicious because it matters so little, as the cynical wisdom has it. Two students were shouting at each other on Facebook. Who cares? About half the news organisations in Britain was the answer. If Travers’ claim that “multiple news agencies have been delivered” twisted extracts of Allman’s conversation about Serena Williams were true, none of the media rose to the bait. But, earlier this month, Travers gave multiple news agencies a story that was much more to their liking. The Mail, the Sun, Trump’s propaganda network Fox News, Putin’s propaganda network Russia Today, the Express, the Times, which broke the “story”, and the far-right US sites Infowars and Breitbart assured their gullible readers that Travers was the victim of the latest politically correct insanity. It wasn’t just the rightwing press. The Independent, the Mirror, and papers across Europe loved the story. They repeated every word of Travers’ new allegation that Allman had accused him of Islamophobia for “mocking Islamic State on Facebook”. There was no mention of Serena Williams. Travers was no longer the creepy censor trying to make others suffer. He was now the victim of political correctness gone, well, mad. Edinburgh University’s bureaucrats were going along with the witch-hunt and investigating him for making Muslim and minority students feel “unsafe”, Travers continued. But Robbie would not be intimidated. His cherubic face and flowing locks complemented the heroic image he was so keen to project. Imagine. Even Isis can’t be criticised now. A black student and a “self-proclaimed feminist” to boot was supporting barbarism and trying to turn its critics into hate criminals. Every rightwing suspicion was confirmed with suspicious ease. In a revealing interview recorded for the Sunday Times, Rod Liddle told Travers: “If it wasn’t for insanities like this, I wouldn’t have a job, so thank you.” Just so. And it’s not only rightwing journalists who are grateful. With headcounts hacked back and finances in free fall, many news organisations don’t have the resources to check a story. When it so neatly tells their readers what they want to hear, the seductive question arises: do we want to check at all? Allman told me she never mentioned Isis and the transcript of her complaint bears this out. The university covered its back by saying it wouldn’t “consider bringing charges of misconduct against any student for mocking Isis”. But it left Allman in the lurch. It told her not to talk to journalists, but refused to tell reporters what the dispute was about. Crucially, it would not confirm or deny that she had mentioned Isis. I spoke to Ronald Kerr, one of Edinburgh University’s extraordinarily large number of press officers, last week. He didn’t know the detail of what had happened and would not find out either. A student’s name has been smeared on two continents but putting the record straight was no concern of his or his university. Allman has broken her silence now, and given an interview to Edinburgh’s student newspaper. JK Rowling performed a public service by tweeting a link. But it remains the case that for the rest of her life any employer Googling Allman’s name will see dozens of news organisations suggesting that she was a fellow traveller with Isis. They will have to search very hard to find her side of the story. Terry Pratchett once wrote that a lie could run round the world before the truth had got its boots on. Now lies are like decrepit satellites that circle the Earth for ever. The dozens of news sites that spread the fake news about him could not have been expected to know Travers’ reputation. But any journalist making the most cursory of checks would have noticed that his website bears the vainglorious title: The Office of Robbie Travers. As well as saying he is an authority on global politics, the law and just about everything else, Travers claims to be the media manager for the Human Security Centre, an influential foreign policy thinktank. As no one else had bothered to phone, I gave it a call. “We let him go many months ago,” a senior figure told me. “He was a complete liability. He was never the media manager.

The Arsenal manager is at the beginning of a demanding week, in which his team face West Bromwich at Emirates Stadium on Monday and return to their home ground for another Premier League fixture against Brighton on Sunday, which kicks off at 12 noon. In between times, they play Bate Borisov in Belarus in the Europa League on Thursday. Wenger will make sweeping changes to his team for the European tie, in keeping with his policy for the group phase of the competition, and he will leave a host of names at home in London. The manager is unhappy but phlegmatic about the squeeze that has been placed on his squad, saying with a shrug it was television alone that dictated the timings and decreed the West Brom game be moved to a Monday night and the Brighton match should have a midday start. He was more animated when asked for an insight into how the club would help the players to cope with the schedule. Wenger mentioned cryotherapy, among other things – the extreme-cold treatment that proponents say can speed recovery, reduce injuries, increase energy and even improve sleep. He stopped short of calling it mumbo-jumbo, but only just. “The players will have warm-downs, they have all that, everybody does nowadays,” Wenger said. “Treatment with the physios, massage, cryotherapy – all the stuff where nobody knows whether it is efficient or not. “No one knows because you have a lot of science. If you read the science, some have proved it works and some have proved it doesn’t work. The ones that prove it works are usually sponsored by the guys who say that it does. “Is it smoke and mirrors? Yes. Because at the end of the day, since I’ve been in the job, we have improved a lot the medical treatment. A lot. But, still, if you have a muscle problem, it takes 21 days. It took 21 days 30 years ago. “We have to respect nature and nobody could make miracles unless they doped the players sometimes. That means they inject players for a big game and the guy plays with an injury, with anti-pain.” Wenger raised his eyebrows when the timing of the West Brom game was brought up. “Television decides,” he said. “Television decides when you play and that’s what you have to do. Where it becomes more difficult is that we play Sunday morning after [against Brighton]. “I think from the Doncaster game [in the Carabao Cup] last Wednesday to Monday night, we have enough time to prepare. After that, from Monday to Thursday, it will be short. And especially from Thursday to Sunday. But you have to adapt. Maybe we have to make some decisions in Borisov that will give us a chance to recover between the two games.” Wenger’s team beat Doncaster 1-0 to set up a fourth-round tie at home to Norwich City. There has been plenty of discussion over recent years as to the value of the League Cup and José Mourinho, the Manchester United manager, said last week English football might be better off without the competition. The Portuguese believes the clubs with European commitments would be fresher if they did not have to play in it. Wenger made the point it was impossible for a club to write off any competition they are asked to play in. “You cannot sacrifice deliberately any competition with the pressure that every club is under now,” he said. “But you know that you could pay the price for it. You know that if you go further in the League Cup, at some stage you play in the semi-final – home and away in January – and you have the FA Cup, the Premier League and, sometimes, you lose players in these competitions.” Arsenal face a quick reunion with Kieran Gibbs, the left-back they sold to West Brom for £7m on 30 August. Gibbs came through Arsenal’s youth system but he left in search of more regular football. Wenger said the club had not offered the defender a new contract to replace the one that was due to expire in 2018. Gibbs has said that he believes he can become a better defender with Albion while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who left Arsenal for Liverpool in a £35m deal, feels he will also improve at Anfield. “You look at the players who performed here and left, and you come back to me after,” Wenger said, on the subject of whether former Arsenal players had found that the grass was greener elsewhere. “You hope it goes well for them. I focus on my squad.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/24/britains-newspapers-lack-diversity-preventing-connecting-new-audience","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T18:23:30Z","webTitle":"Britain's newspapers could learn a lot from Jimmy the milkman | Hugh Muir","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/24/britains-newspapers-lack-diversity-preventing-connecting-new-audience","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/24/britains-newspapers-lack-diversity-preventing-connecting-new-audience","fields":{"headline":"Britain's newspapers could learn a lot from Jimmy the milkman","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When I look at the dwindling circulation graphs for Britain’s newspapers the image of a glider plane comes to mind. It’s being piloted expertly – for many remain products of high quality – but decidedly to earth. I am also reminded of a ride I once took on a milk float driven around Blackburn by John “Jimmy” Mather. That had been his family’s trade for a generation and all was well until Blackburn changed and a large number of families of Asian descent moved to his patch. Many, especially the women, had no English. He couldn’t speak to them, he couldn’t sell to them. He could have thrown up his hands and piloted his own sales graph to decline. Instead, he learned Gujarati. Not fluently, but enough to connect with and befriend his customers. The market changed, so Jimmy changed. There is a great deal our press could learn from Jimmy. We have a 20th-century press ill-equipped in spirit and practical capability to connect with the diversity of 21st-century Britain. Newsrooms are struggling to break free of the thinking, hiring and deployment practices that may have served them well over the decades but require urgent revision if they, like Jimmy the milkman, are to connect with the potential customer base as it is. And it’s worse than that. Our newsrooms aren’t where they need to be in terms of any of the strands of diversity – gender, disability, sexuality, race, religion. Over the 30 years I have worked in national newsrooms, they have also become less diverse in terms of class. We have had, in our past, editors who entered the newsroom as copy boys, transporting paper ripped from typewriters around the office. That cadre and those accessible points of entry have been filtered out. In recent years, it has been the degree as standard for recruits, preferably one from the Russell group or Oxbridge. But what the industry has also manifestly failed to get to grips with is visible diversity. Last year the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism revealed that 94% of British journalists were white and 86% university educated. Compare that with what we know of our country from the 2011 census: of 56 million residents in England and Wales 86% were white, 8% were Asian or Asian British and 3% were black African, black Caribbean or black British. Does that matter? In Press for Diversity, a documentary I’ve made for BBC Radio 4, I argue that it does, not just in moral terms – that a press purporting to cover a diverse nation, and a diverse world, should itself be diverse – but also in terms of the glider’s sorry trajectory. A non-diverse press cannot understand or easily connect with a diverse population and potential readership. Imagine a Tesco catering to a diverse area that didn’t stock its shelves with products to match. Within weeks of Polish migrants arriving in my part of east London, the supermarket shelves began filling with Polish sausage, breads, beers and beetroot. Industries that compete and thrive have antennae that tell them when the market changes and wills them to adapt. Either we have had faulty antennae, or we have lacked the will to fully respond. That has obvious and tangible results. One is that the breadth of stories we cover is limited. The bubble that preoccupies us encompassing Westminster, London and the south-east is small enough, but then we limit it further by restricting our ability to discover, understand and cover the joys and pains, issues and concerns, rows and celebrations that punctuate life in minority communities. There is a defensive view that says diversity doesn’t truly matter in that regard. A story is a story is a story and a good journalist – of whatever background – can get it. There’s some validity to that. But what are the chances of a white British journalist picking up early on, say, a spate of jewellery robberies on well-to-do Asian families in the suburbs – unless they are tipped off by the police? Or on what black churches are doing to compensate for cuts in council services to elderly people? Sathnam Sanghera of the Times told me of his reporting on the views of Indian families in Wolverhampton over Brexit. They felt comfortable with him and the process gained from that. Then there is the prioritisation process, the decisions we make about what matters. That too benefits from diversity and can otherwise be skewed. Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff, a journalist of mixed heritage, recalls one editor’s excitement about news that a girl was missing. “He shouted: ‘She’s white, she’s middle class, she’s pretty, we need to get on this’.” And what of accuracy? We are all taught to check and check again. But how much is that process assisted by the store of background knowledge we carry that tells us what seems feasible or that an element of a story as told doesn’t add up. Miqdaad Versi, of the Muslim Council of Britain, says the media’s lack of knowledge – and perhaps of care – results in the publication of stories about British Muslims that are often overheated and frequently wrong. Assiduous in flagging them up, he has secured more than 30 corrections already this year. Think hard on that: why would anyone buy a product that regularly misrepresents them? What we see from the inside as mistaken or sloppy presents from the outside as malicious. I recall standing outside the home of Mark Duggan, the young black man shot by police whose death led to the 2011 riots, as a minister urged loved ones to stretch their hands towards his coffin and say goodbye. The accounts in the Express and Mail Online suggest their reporters did not hear the minister. The Mail headline said: “Gangsta Salute for A Fallen Soldier”. The Express said: “Gang culture was all too visible again on the streets of London.” Who of those present would rely on those publications again? The penny is dropping. Many media groups – Associated Newspapers, Sky, Reuters, Bloomberg, the Press Association and the Financial Times – sponsor the Journalism Diversity Fund. Others have their own schemes to attract a broader mix of entrants. Among the initiatives at the Guardian are Scott Trust bursaries and a long-running positive action scheme. The Evening Standard is also being proactive with its own apprenticeships programme – hoping to broaden its pool of journalists by class and race. Rupert Murdoch’s News UK, which invited 21 students to a summer school during the holidays, is also seeking talented apprentices. But how much are we willing to change? I debated this point with Neil Wallis, a former editor of the People and ex-deputy editor of the Sun and the News of the World. We agreed on the need for diversity. But while he said all that was needed was to make opportunities available, I argued that if a diverse workforce was essential rather than desirable, the press needed to create it, proactively seeking out talent if need be. His fear was quotas and anything that smacked of affirmative action. I understand that. Only the best, of whatever background, should make it to national newsrooms. But surely – if we conclude that diversity is important, both morally and commercially – we can seek out or mould the best; deploying the skill and ingenuity for which British journalism is famous. It’s no more daunting than an old milkman learning Gujarati.

He did not record his first single until 2002, and made his debut album only in 2011. Nonetheless he seized his opportunity, and in the last years of his life was able to build a devoted audience while basking in belated critical acclaim. “If I’d gotten that break when I was 25, the world wouldn’t have known what to do with me,” he said in 2014. “I know so much more now and I know how to deal with things better … I can dig into a lot of my memories. I can do things I was afraid to do before.” Bradley’s first album, No Time for Dreaming (2011), on Daptone Records, sounded like a throwback to the classic soulmen of the 1960s and 70s, but his impassioned delivery and ability to embody the torrid emotions he was singing about rendered the music timeless. Most of the songs were newly written by Bradley and his bandleader and producer, Tom Brenneck. The opening track, The World (Is Going Up in Flames), was as stark and raw as anything by Sam Cooke or Bradley’s idol, James Brown, and the track received a boost in the UK when it was featured in Channel 4’s Hackney gangland drama Top Boy (other Bradley tracks have subsequently been used in TV shows such as Suits and Ray Donovan). Rolling Stone magazine made No Time for Dreaming one of their 50 Best Albums of the Year. Bradley released two further albums, Victim of Love (2013) and Changes (2016). Once again the Bradley/Brenneck partnership had written most of the material. Brenneck had discovered that the best way to tap into the singer’s creativity was to play a guitar riff with a drumbeat and then get Bradley to tell stories about his painful and star-crossed life over the top of it. “You have to tape it right then and there, because that’s when it comes out natural,” Bradley observed. “When I have the blues and I have things bothering me deeply, that’s the best time to write a song.” In 2012, Bradley’s story was told in Poull Brien’s documentary film Charles Bradley: Soul of America, Brien having met the singer when he directed the video for The World (Is Going Up in Flames). Brien realised that Bradley’s life story was something a fiction writer would barely have dared to invent. Born in Gainesville, Florida, Bradley was raised by his maternal grandmother until he was eight, when he moved to Brooklyn, New York, to rejoin his mother, Inez, who had left him when he was eight months old, and his older brother, Joseph. He never met his father. At 14 Bradley left his mother’s home, where he had only a basement to sleep in – “I was afraid that she was going to hurt me,” he said in Brien’s film – and for a time survived by sleeping on subway trains or sheltering in old cars. But at about the same time, in 1962, his sister took him to a James Brown concert at the Apollo theatre in Harlem, and this proved to be a pivotal moment in the boy’s life. “When I first saw him, it was like the resurrection,” said Bradley. “I’d seen entertainers, but nothing like James Brown on stage.” Bradley practised Brown-style microphone moves using a broom with string attached, but was initially shy about performing in front of an audience. He finally managed it when he was 18 and working at the Jobs Corp, a government training centre, in Maine, when his workmates persuaded him to sing in the girls’ dormitory. Fortified with gin, he thrilled the crowd with a James Brown impersonation. For 10 years Bradley worked as a chef at a Maine hospital, then in 1977 decided to travel across North America. He arrived in California via Canada, Alaska and Seattle. For nearly two decades he took a variety of jobs while picking up extra money doing his James Brown performances, where he used such stage names as the Screaming Eagle of Soul, Black Velvet and even James Brown Jr. In 1994 he moved back to Brooklyn after receiving a call from his mother (“She said, ‘Son, give me a chance to know you. Come back home.’”) In New York he struggled to shake off a fever, then almost died in hospital when he was treated with penicillin, to which he was allergic. “I had a fever of 104.7F [40.4C],” he remembered. “They … put ice all over my body to break the fever. They would stick this big needle in my back four times a day.” Even worse followed when his brother was shot and killed by one of Bradley’s nephews. Bradley remained haunted by the sight of Joseph’s murdered body, but also recalled his brother telling him to “follow your dreams” and pursue a musical career. The song Heartaches and Pain, from No Time for Dreaming, is a vivid depiction of Joseph’s death. Bradley had been persevering with his James Brown shows in New York as Black Velvet, but when he heard that another New York club singer, Sharon Jones, had been enjoying some success with Daptone Records, Bradley approached the label’s co-founder Gabe Roth. After some unsuccessful recording attempts, the label paired Bradley with Brenneck, who was the songwriter and guitarist for the Bullets and then later with the Menahan Street Band, who would become Bradley’s regular accompanists. His first single release was Take It As It Come, Pts 1 and 2 (2002), and he released several more singles over the next few years, which would reappear on his debut album. His second, critically acclaimed album, Victim of Love, sealed Bradley’s reputation, and spawned the hit Strictly Reserved for You. The third and final long-player, Changes, took its title from a cover of the 1972 Black Sabbath song, the lyrics of which struck a chord with Bradley following his mother’s recent death. He performed at festivals including Coachella, Lollapalooza and, in 2014, Glastonbury as part of the Daptone Super Soul Revue alongside Jones. Bradley was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2016. He had apparently recovered and returned to touring, but the cancer then spread to his liver. • Charles Edward Bradley, singer and songwriter, born 5 November 1948; died 23 September 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2017/sep/29/trump-policy-set-to-hinder-war-on-polio-in-pakistan","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T16:22:05Z","webTitle":"Trump policy set to hinder war on polio in Pakistan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/sep/29/trump-policy-set-to-hinder-war-on-polio-in-pakistan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/sep/29/trump-policy-set-to-hinder-war-on-polio-in-pakistan","fields":{"headline":"Trump policy set to hinder war on polio in Pakistan","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For decades, polio was one of the world’s most feared diseases, disabling and crippling millions. Its near eradication has been one of the great achievements of modern medical science. But polio stubbornly holds on in three countries – Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria – where communities, alongside local and international authorities, are making concerted efforts to stamp out the last pockets of the virus. In Pakistan and Afghanistan, the big obstacle, experts say, is not lack of money to fight it, but mistrust of the western governments who bankroll the vaccines. Now Donald Trump could be about to deepen that mistrust. If the US president makes good on his bellicose threats to take a harder line on Pakistan, he will undoubtedly incite anti-US sentiments, which in the past have led to attacks on polio workers and prompted tribal leaders to ban vaccination campaigns. It would not be the first time the US has got in the way of the war on polio. The fight against polio suffered its biggest blow in 2011 when the CIA concocted a fake hepatitis vaccination campaign as part of its efforts to find Osama bin Laden. The ruse, exposed in the Guardian, only confirmed Taliban claims that inoculation campaigns were smokescreens for espionage. The Taliban issued fatwas and murdered dozens of health workers. In 2014, Pakistan recorded more than 300 polio cases. But even before the vaccination ploy, polio was gaining ground, coinciding with an intensified US drone campaign. As attacks spiked in 2008, so did polio cases. When drone strikes hit a high of 128 in 2010, the number of polio cases reached 198 the following year. Drone strikes in Pakistan have now become rare and since 2014, the fight against polio has bounced back. In 2016, only 37 cases were recorded worldwide, 20 of them in Pakistan. Meanwhile, in his recently announced South Asia strategy, Trump signalled a tougher line on Pakistan: “We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. But that will have to change, and that will change immediately,” he said. Trump has shown a penchant for airpower. In Afghanistan, the US is dropping more bombs than at any point since 2012. “It is hard to predict how local communities will respond to health workers if bombings pick up,” said Monica Martinez-Bravo, a researcher at CEMFI and co-author of a new paper on mistrust of vaccines in Pakistan. But she has documented a clear correlation between support for Islamist groups, at times a result of air campaigns, and decline in immunisation rates. “Everything the US does that reduces trust will damage the vaccination campaigns,” Martinez-Bravo said. Bombings complicate access for immunisers, and insurgents have used polio to demand a halt to airstrikes in return for allowing vaccinations. This year, in Kunduz in northern Afghanistan, the Taliban banned inoculators for 15 months, relenting only when a 14-month-old girl contracted polio. Polio primarily affects children under five, and is incurable. The virus causes paralysis, sometimes within hours of infection. It often hits the legs and spine, but can also kill victims by immobilising breathing muscles. Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched in 1988, an estimated 16 million people have been saved from paralysis, and 1.5 million children from death. Yet, without sustained efforts, polio could flourish and spread. For every known case, about 200 people carry the disease without symptoms. The virus loiters in the environment. Last week, standing above a river in Rawalpindi overflowing with sewage after the monsoon rains, Sarwat Boobak, area coordinator for WHO, said her team had detected wild polio, a sign that people were still shedding the virus, even in the capital Islamabad. A long-time polio worker, Boobak fled her home town of Karachi in 2012 after the CIA vaccination scheme was revealed. “Our work suffered so much after that,” she said. The backlash predominantly hit female health workers who make up the backbone of vaccination teams. Since then, at least 41 polio workers have been killed in Pakistan, as have several polio workers in Afghanistan. However, WHO in Afghanistan did not provide statistics, and said it was not clear whether the workers were killed because of their polio work. Although an overwhelming majority of Pakistanis welcome vaccination workers, a few refusals can keep the disease alive. “Polio vaccines are produced in western countries, and are made out of pig fat or contain alcohol, the two things that are forbidden in Islam,” said Akbar Wazir, a tribal elder from North Waziristan. Equally false are beliefs that vaccines transmit HIV or cause sterilisation. Tahir, 43, from Karachi, who has four children under five, said he does not allow vaccinators into his house after reading local newspaper reports about vaccines killing children. Such misconceptions grew stronger after the CIA ruse, said Martinez-Bravo. “Once people found credible evidence for one claim, it lent credibility to the others,” she said. This year, 250,000 Pakistani polio workers will target 38 million children who require a course of 10-15 vaccinations. A campaign of that magnitude requires goodwill from communities. “Certain elements don’t want the Pakistani government to succeed, including in polio campaigns,” said Rana Muhammad Safdar, emergency coordinator for polio eradication in Pakistan. He would not rule out that military operations could endanger vaccination campaigns. “By now we have been able to prevent 500,000 paralysis cases in Pakistan alone,” he said. “We all must be extra careful.” Additional reporting by Haroon Janjua"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/24/oumar-niasse-everton-ronald-koeman-bournemouth","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T21:29:04Z","webTitle":"Oumar Niasse finally measures up for Ronald Koeman’s underachievers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/24/oumar-niasse-everton-ronald-koeman-bournemouth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/24/oumar-niasse-everton-ronald-koeman-bournemouth","fields":{"headline":"Oumar Niasse finally measures up for Ronald Koeman’s underachievers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Oumar Niasse collected his man-of-the-match award and left Goodison Park wearing an Everton tracksuit on Saturday. Nothing remarkable there – he is, despite Ronald Koeman’s best efforts, still an Everton player after all – although the striker’s attire underlined the speed of his transformation from outcast to saviour. Unlike his team-mates, Niasse does not have a club suit to wear. The Senegal international was not part of Koeman’s squad when they were fitted for suits in the summer but Everton have ordered one for their £13.5m signing in time for Burnley’s visit on Sunday. It is the least they can do. The manager should ensure it is tailored to perfection, and leave a thank you note in the pocket. Goodison was an uncomfortable place for Koeman until around 4.30pm on Saturday, its anger rising over another disjointed team selection and another laboured performance that sailed close to a damaging defeat by Bournemouth. Jordan Pickford’s save from Jermain Defoe, minutes after Josh King had driven the visitors ahead, proved a pivotal moment. To the manager’s credit he took decisive action and introduced Niasse, Tom Davies and Jonjoe Kenny. All three contributed more than the players they replaced and Everton were repaid with a first win in five Premier League games. Niasse was rewarded for his attitude and application in the face of the manager’s cold shoulder with two invaluable goals and a hero’s ovation. He also had an open goal to respond to Koeman’s treatment of him last season. He chose to miss. “Honestly, I don’t want to go over the past with him,” the 27-year-old said. “There is nothing to say about that. He just said this was a new opportunity for me and he wanted to look at me again. “Last year he said I wasn’t ready and maybe I wasn’t ready. I went to the under-23s and learned more and learned I have to work hard. Maybe that has helped me get to this position now because football is hard, it is very difficult. I went away, I learned and I have come back stronger. I tried just to keep my head on me, to not lose it, and the best way to do that is to just keep working hard. Even if I wasn’t on the pitch for every game or was with the under-23s, I was running on the pitch like a dog.” The Everton striker was told to leave the club after a 45‑minute appearance in Koeman’s first pre‑season friendly in the summer of 2016 and ostracised to the under-23s when he did not, before a successful loan spell at Hull City. “It is not only football – life is like that,” he said. “You have to have a strong mind and a strong mentality. I know where I am from and where I want to go. It is not a case of something bad happening and so I give up. I kept saying to myself: ‘Anything can happen.’ It was a hard time with the under-23s and seeing my team-mates enjoying the games here without me. I was with the under-23s instead, travelling and playing at empty stadiums, but that’s life. “You have to keep working hard and keep in your mind that anything can happen. That’s what I did. Today is good but you don’t know what will happen tomorrow. I just have to stay strong and get stronger.” Koeman may have been indebted to Niasse’s contribution against Bournemouth – one that left Eddie Howe visibly devastated as the chairman, Jeff Mostyn, tried to console him afterwards – but he refused to accept he may have erred in his treatment of the forward last season. “He did have a locker,” the Everton manager claimed. “There are a lot of stories. “At that time I preferred to play with other strikers and we had other players in that position. The situation for him was really difficult. That is the past now. I try to be honest and try to be straight and if someone deserves the opportunity he will get it. That is not just for Oumar but all the players. I don’t have any problem with Oumar because I spoke with him before the transfer window ended and said: ‘OK, you will get your chance with the first team. Work hard and get your chance.’ That is what he did, his attitude was perfect.” Niasse, however, will not get the opportunity to score in a third consecutive game for Everton when Apollon Limassol arrive in the Europa League on Thursday. He was not included in Koeman’s squad list when it was submitted to Uefa on 5 September. Like the suit, Niasse must wait for that one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"fashion/2017/sep/24/dolce-gabbana-brand-heritage-third-milan-show","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T16:34:43Z","webTitle":"Dolce & Gabbana show off brand's heritage at third Milan show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/sep/24/dolce-gabbana-brand-heritage-third-milan-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/sep/24/dolce-gabbana-brand-heritage-third-milan-show","fields":{"headline":"Dolce & Gabbana show off brand's heritage at third Milan show","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sunday afternoon in Milan hosted Dolce &amp; Gabbana’s spring/summer 2018 show. But this wasn’t the first show for the brand during the city’s fashion week – it was the third. A pop-up show happened at the city’s La Rinascente department store on Thursday and at 10pm on Saturday night there was a “secret show” for its wealthy clientele. The cast included socialites and celebrity offspring, such as Kitty Spencer, Ella Richards and Christian Combs, the son of Sean Combs. The collection consisted of eveningwear designs including floor-length tulle dresses, lacy gowns and brightly coloured suiting. It demanded the lifestyle – and the budget – of the 1%. The rest of the world could enjoy watching it on Instagram. Sunday’s collection, meanwhile, was called Queen of Hearts and featured a backdrop of giant playing cards. It was based partly on the Italian resorts that those with a yacht would be familiar with – Portofino and the like – and partly on the brand’s heritage. The duo have been the purveyors of clothes to seduce since the brand was founded in 1985. Thirteen black corset outfits – of the kind worn by Madonna and Linda Evangelista in the 90s – opened the show. They were followed by designs more from the school of fashion wit – ballgowns covered in cabbages, shoes with Andy Warhol-like soup cans for heels, sunglasses worthy of Timmy Mallett. Across 106 looks, food was a theme – but these were clothes for women who like to wear their biscuits rather than eat them. The finale underlined the heritage message. All the models re-entered the catwalk wearing corsets and Beyoncé-like big briefs. Appropriately, the singer’s 2003 hit Crazy in Love was playing. Before the show, Stefano Gabbana said they had decided to go back to the roots of the brand because it was now relevant for a new generation. “All the new girls ask: ‘Why don’t you do corsets again?’” he said. “But we play with everything … We need to go forward. The embellishment and everything is a fashion. Black is a style.” The constant dripfeed of new, ever more glamorous, shows from Dolce &amp; Gabbana means the brand is an almost constant presence on fashionable Instagram feeds. This serves as a distraction from controversies such as dressing Melania Trump earlier this year, which saw Twitter users call for consumers to boycott the brand. The most recent financial year saw revenues of around £1.15bn. The Marni show earlier in the day saw Francesco Risso’s second womenswear collection for the brand, following the departure of the founder, Consuelo Castiglioni, in 2016. The 33-year-old’s first – after only three months at Marni – was met with mixed reviews. This collection was an infinite mix of styles, colours, prints and textures. The first few models wore short dresses made from panels of heavy satin in poster paint colours, with beading on the front, over long skirts. Ivanka Trump-favoured mismatched earrings were the norm. The silhouettes would conventionally be worn close-fitting, but these were worn two sizes too big. An arty awkwardness – a quality that Marni could claim as intellectual property – prevailed. Sometimes this worked – as with the pastel tulle slip-style dresses with sparkling beads or the longline plaid polo shirts and cargo pants. Other looks – a floral mac worn over a floral camisole and checked midiskirt, for example – strayed a bit too close to bait for street style photographers outside fashion shows to be seen as relevant to most women’s lives. Backstage, Risso, who was wearing a necklace made of what appeared to be cracker toys and string, said the collection was inspired partly by a doodle he did of a “20s woman on a skateboard”. He called the collection a treasure hunt. “You have to imagine this archaeologist diving into a trunk full of objects,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/24/eliud-kipchoge-marathon-big-boss-world-record","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T14:49:12Z","webTitle":"Eliud Kipchoge remains marathon’s big boss despite missing world record | Sean Ingle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/24/eliud-kipchoge-marathon-big-boss-world-record","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/24/eliud-kipchoge-marathon-big-boss-world-record","fields":{"headline":"Eliud Kipchoge remains marathon’s big boss despite missing world record","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One by one his biggest rivals slipped away, lost in the murk and the mist of an autumnal Berlin morning, until the only opponent Eliud Kipchoge had left was an unheralded Ethiopian, Guye Adola, running his first marathon – and a ticking clock. Then the unthinkable happened. With five miles to go and the official world record of 2hr 2min 57sec still in his grasp, the greatest marathon runner in history began to wobble. A gap of a metre to Adola became five, then 20. The world-record attempt was gone, and so – it seemed – was an unbeaten record stretching back three years. It was the athletics’ equivalent of a celebrated heavyweight champion being dumped on his pants in the 10th round by an unheralded no-hoper. But that was merely the first act of the drama. Over the next two miles Kipchoge slowly clawed himself back, only for Adola to blast off again. The Kenyan smiled, although it looked suspiciously like a grimace, and stubbornly went again. Finally, in the 25th of the 26 miles he drew alongside his rival before scooting clear to win in 2:03.32. At his training camp in Kenya, where Kipchoge takes his turn to clean out the toilets and draw water from the nearby well, his fellow runners call him “the boss man”. Once again he lived up to his billing. Fourteen seconds back was Adola, who at least had the consolation of knowing he had run the fastest time by a marathon debutant. Meanwhile, those of us watching were again reminded of athletics’ most essential truth: it is not times, or world records, that really matter but the thrill and unpredictability of the race and chase; of seeing athletes fire up or combust when thrown into the bunsen flame of competition. Scientists talk about Kipchoge’s high lactate threshold and exceptional VO2 max, which allows his body to more easily transfer oxygen into energy. His pedigree, too, is indisputable: a 2003 world championship gold over 5,000m as an 18-year-old and a full selection of Olympic medals from 2004, 2008 and 2016. Yet he repeatedly stresses the power of his mind too. “Marathon is life,” he says. “It’s not about the legs, but it’s about the heart and mind.” Even when his muscles started to scream and break down in the final miles, Kipchoge’s demeanour was that of a running monk, deep in concentration, his head apparently in a different place. Kipchoge could teach Amarillo Slim a thing or two about maintaining a poker face. His stoicism under fire also brought to mind the Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami describing the intense pain of marathons in his memoir-meditation, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running – of feeling “like a piece of beef being run, slowly, through a meat grinder – my body felt like it was falling apart and would soon come completely undone”. Murakami believes that “muscles really are like animals, and they want to take it as easy as possible” and so you have to show them who is boss by challenging them and ignoring their screams of discomfort. Utilising the power of the mind might sound a bit hokey – if that was all it took we would all be simultaneously rich, world-beaters in our chosen field, and contenders for the Nobel peace prize. However, in a fine piece in the New York Times, Alex Hutchinson, a scientist and writer, suggested that while he had “sneered at the bromides of self‑help for as long as I’ve known them”, watching Kipchoge up close had made him think differently. As Hutchinson explained, some physiologists now believe “that your subjective sense of effort, rather than the metabolic state of your muscles, is the final arbiter of your limits”. “When you feel that it’s impossible to continue, it is,” he wrote. “And consequently, anything that changes your sense of effort alters your limits.” So telling yourself that everything is fine, rather than you are dying mid-race, can extend endurance – as long as you believe it. Such thinking helped Kipchoge run a marathon in 2:00.25 in the Nike-sponsored Breaking2 project in May, an attempt not deemed legal because an arrowhead of pacers substituted in and out to help him, and again during his darkest moments in Berlin. However, no amount of self-talk was enough to push him to a world record in Germany. It was not for a want of trying, mind. With Kenya’s Wilson Kipsang and the Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele in the field, along with a lightning-fast course, the bookies made the chances of it being broken as high as 66%. But that was before the elements spat in the athletes’ faces. It is impossible to know how much the rain, wet roads, 90% humidity and warmer than ideal temperatures cost Kipchoge, but it is not unreasonable to suspect it was more than the 36sec he needed to surpass Dennis Kimetto’s best. There will be other attempts, of course, most likely starting with the London marathon in April. Then again, having won eight of nine marathons in his career and with an Olympic title to his name too, Kipchoge does not need a record to prove he is the greatest 26.2‑miler in history. His performances tell you that already."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/24/john-jack-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T15:28:28Z","webTitle":"John Jack obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/24/john-jack-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/24/john-jack-obituary","fields":{"headline":"John Jack obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jazz is often a noisy music, but some of the most quietly diffident people make it happen. John Jack, who has died aged 84, was one of British jazz’s most influential backroom visionaries. A fascinating source of oral jazz history, as well as a producer, promoter and enabler, John was appositely dubbed “the Zelig of British music” by his friend Mike Gavin for the nous that seemed unerringly to put him in the right place at the right time. From his 20s to his 80s, John had his finger on the pulse of contemporary music, and of many of Britain’s wider cultural changes too. He was a trombone-playing participant in the birth of Britain’s “trad-jazz” revivalist scene as a teenager, an adventure that began with the purchase of Jelly Roll Morton’s Dr Jazz and Pinetop Smith’s Jumpsteady Blues records in Shepherd’s Bush market, west London, around 1947. Following national service in the army, he became a bohemian habitué of the Soho nightlife that threw the ethnically diverse practitioners of jazz, African and Caribbean music together, an autodidactic British beatnik living in Paris bedsits amid the cafe intellectuals of the left bank in the 50s, an aficionado of anarchist politics in the Basque country, and later a student at the Slade School of Fine Art, London, who became an enthusiastic Gauguinesque painter of primitive art. By the 60s, he had been a travelling salesman for early indie labels including Carlo Krahmer’s Esquire and Emil Shallit’s Melodisc, the former promoting emerging British jazz stars such as Humphrey Lyttelton, Acker Bilk and Ronnie Scott, the latter a variety of world folk forms, and calypso and mento styles from the Caribbean. He was a roadie for the Vipers skiffle band, and the sharp-eared promoter who in 1963 booked a rising young R&amp;B quintet called the Rolling Stones to play the Manor House jazz pub in north London for a split of the door money. From 1965 to 1968, John managed the original Ronnie Scott’s club in Gerrard Street, Chinatown, as an all-comers jamming haunt after the main venue had moved upmarket to Frith Street. The “Old Place” became a hothouse where bebop, R&amp;B, jazz-and-poetry and South African townships jive joined hands. In 1973, with the bandleader Mike Westbrook (who he was also managing), John set up the Cadillac record label, and also the distribution company of the same name he would run for most of his remaining years with his friend Hazel Miller, who also steered the South African-oriented Ogun label. For the next three decades, his habitats changed to grubby London basements and warehouses rammed with bulging cardboard boxes. The goatee-bearded, coolly dapper and constantly preoccupied proprietor could prove an unexpectedly badtempered recipient of unscheduled phonecalls or visitors to his workplace. But the stormclouds of muttered expletives would quickly lift with peacemaking offers of tea, and murmured salutations of “What can I do for you, dear boy?” A shy man with a big heart and profound empathy for the trials and insights of creative players, he used the role of producer/distributor to make a real difference to the accessibility of artists from many corners of contemporary music. The work of UK postbop originals such as Westbrook, Stan Tracey and Mike Osborne, the Jamaican free-jazz pioneer Joe Harriott, post-Coltrane American adventurers including the violinist Billy Bang and the saxophone virtuoso David Murray – they all found their way into the Cadillac catalogue, and they became artists who could count on John as friends. He never found it strange to be a simultaneous fan of the 1960s Jamaican reggae-inspiration Prince Buster, the New Orleans revivalist trumpeter Bunk Johnson, and the free-improv saxophone master Evan Parker – they all chimed with his conviction that life was most usefully about seat-of-the-pants improvisation, not grand philosophical designs. He was born and raised in Barnes, south-west London, the elder son of Don Jack, a motor engineer, and his wife, Joan, an occasional nightclub singer in her youth. As John’s youthful sociability on the music scene expanded, enthusiastic posses of guests would often find their way back to the parental home – his brother Roger recalled a 21st birthday party that lasted a week, with stray musicians, instruments and stocks of booze eventually even displacing the long-suffering Don and Joan from their own bedroom. John was a private man who followed his own muse, but that self-effacing sociability remained. John is survived by his partner of 38 years, Shirley Thompson, and by Roger. • John Michael Jack, jazz producer and promoter, born 25 May 1933; died 7 September 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/25/robots-taken-over-work-jobs-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T05:00:05Z","webTitle":"Robots have already taken over our work, but they’re made of flesh and bone | Brett Frischmann and Evan Selinger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/25/robots-taken-over-work-jobs-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/25/robots-taken-over-work-jobs-economy","fields":{"headline":"Robots have already taken over our work, but they’re made of flesh and bone","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Most of the headlines about technology in the workplace relate to robots rendering people unemployed. But what if this threat is distracting us from another of the distorting effects of automation? To what extent are we being turned into workers that resemble robots? Take taxi drivers. The prevailing wisdom is they will be replaced by Uber drivers, who in turn will ultimately be replaced by self-driving cars. Those lauding Transport for London’s refusal to renew Uber’s licence might like to consider how, long before that company “disrupted” the industry, turn-by-turn GPS route management and dispatch control systems were de-skilling taxi drivers: instead of building up navigational knowledge, they increasingly rely on satnavs. Fears about humans becoming like machines go back longer than you might think. The sort of algorithmic management we see in the modern gig economy – in which drivers and riders for digital platforms such as Uber and Deliveroo are dispatched and managed not by human beings, but by sophisticated computer systems – has its roots in a management theory developed by Frederick Taylor in the early 20th century. As a young man, Taylor worked as a shop foreman for a steel-making corporation in Philadelphia, where he diagnosed inefficiencies he saw as being products of poorly structured incentives, unmotivated and sometimes shirking workers, and a huge knowledge gap that rendered management ineffective. Managers, he proclaimed, knew too little about the workforce, their tasks, capabilities and motivations. Taylor and his disciples extolled the virtues of breaking down tasks into inputs, outputs, processes and procedures that can be mathematically analysed and transformed into recipes for efficient production. Over decades, and across different industries, his theories have been used to apply time-and-motion studies to workplaces, workers and what they produce. The assembly line is the most recognised example of Taylorism: unskilled workers engage in repetitive, mindless tasks, attending to semi-finished parts that, in the end, are combined into a whole product. Over time, Taylorism became synonymous with the evils of extracting maximum value from workers while treating them as programmable cogs in machines. An early case in point: in 1917, at the height of wartime, approximately 100,000 Australian workers took part in a general strike. The action was sparked by the introduction of time cards, which recorded every minute spent at jobs and breaks. Today, it’s hard to think of time cards, even digital ones, as innovation. They have faded into the background of office life, business-as-usual for many workers. But back then they were seen as a new tool of oppression. Managers could use the information to learn how fast everyone worked and demand a quicker pace. This demeaning model was decried as “robotism”. Taylor’s approach jump-started debates about data-driven innovation and surveillance that continue today. The modern, digital version of Taylorism is more powerful than he could have ever imagined, and more dehumanising than his early critics could have predicted. Technological innovations have made it increasingly easy for managers to quickly and cheaply collect, process, evaluate and act upon massive amounts of information. In our age of big data, Taylorism has spread far beyond the factory floor. The algorithmic management of the gig economy is like time cards on steroids. And it’s not just taxi drivers who are being de-skilled. The logistics and trucking industries utilise even more extensive and intensive data-driven systems that control fleets and employees. Employers utilise an array of sensors to track location, timing, driving and other aspects of performance. Complex algorithms, analytics software and other hidden components of management systems generate intelligence which is then used to instruct truck drivers. Cornell University professor Karen Levy has documented how these intense management systems reduce workers’ autonomy and can incentivise sleep deprivation and speeding. Technology also allows much more sophisticated performance management of employees than during Taylor’s lifetime. Back then, employee reviews were costly in resource terms. They required face-to-face meetings or documents that took time to pull together. Today small businesses as well as giants such as Amazon are using digital tools to create continuous streams of data for employee appraisal. Constant monitoring, and the addition of peer review to supervisor feedback, can create overly competitive, and sometimes hostile, dynamics between employees. It’s not just the intensity of the monitoring that is different. Surveillance is increasingly hidden. In Taylor’s analogue era, workers were acutely aware when they were being observed by management with stopwatches and notebooks. Today management tools are much less visible. A cashier at a fast-food franchise who rings up purchases with a virtual cash register app on her tablet might be unaware of the programs running surreptitiously in the background, logging keystrokes, recording audio or video, transmitting data and continuously rating performance. Workers who might know that their boss monitors calls, texts, and browsing on their employer-issued smartphones might be surprised to learn that the device also communicates geolocation data, allowing tracking of their movement 24/7. The first line of defence against digital Taylorism is to resist its relentless creep within and outside the workplace. Taylor’s logic has become embedded in our everyday lives through our always-on digital environment. There is no easy solution to this. To find remedies, we’ll need to experiment with regulation and strengthened workers’ rights through institutions – such as unions – which have become weakened. France’s effort to promote the “right to disconnect” by banning workplaces with 50 or more employees from sending emails on weekends or holidays might not be perfect, but it is a step in the right direction. We also need a shift in perspective. Taylorism starts from the assumption that employees are innate shirkers. While there will always be some who want to game the system and put in as little effort as possible, there are plenty who don’t. When the guiding assumption of management is that employees won’t be productive unless forced to be by constant observation, it engineers low morale and pushes people to act like resources that need to be micromanaged. Too often, we become what we’re expected to be. On paper, making human beings behave like simple machines might deliver greater efficiency. But modern-day Taylorism threatens something that those kinds of market analyses fail to capture: the value of being human. • Brett Frischmann is a professor in law, business and economics at Villanova University, Pennsylvania; Evan Selinger is a philosophy professor at Rochester Institute of Technology, New York state"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/24/uber-popularity-petition-ryanair-staff","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T18:27:33Z","webTitle":"Uber is not as popular as you might think | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/24/uber-popularity-petition-ryanair-staff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/24/uber-popularity-petition-ryanair-staff","fields":{"headline":"Uber is not as popular as you might think","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On Friday Uber was stripped of its licence to operate in London due to repeated infractions of regulations around safety (Uber loses licence to operate in London, 23 September). This follows the long-standing concerns about how Uber operates – its dubious taxation arrangements, its corporate model (loss-making, then raising costs and reducing driver pay) and its non-recognition of any worker benefits (sick pay, contracts, holiday etc). The company will appeal anyway, meaning the service will continue potentially for months or potentially even years, irrespective of outcome. The firm immediately took to the public petitions site Change.org, reproducing its own press release in the form of a petition to “Save your Uber in London”. Have I misunderstood the meaning of a public petition, or is a company producing a petition to protect its own profits something of a confused perversion of this long-standing mode of political participation? Change.org allows advertisements by companies as long as they are “about public causes”, so they often take the form of petitions. The advertising revenue also allows them to “give the Change.org community an opportunity to provide grassroots support to a petition through promoted petitions”. If I understand this rightly, it means that if you offer them enough money, they’ll use email addresses gathered from genuine grassroots initiatives and will advertise Uber’s petition to as many of their 100 million users as you’d like them to. Does it still make sense to talk about “public opinion”, a “public outcry” or the “grassroots” in a context where modes of political participation are manufactured as public relations exercises for companies seeking political and legislative advantage? Luke Samuel Manchester • Are there really 40,000 registered drivers on the Uber books in London and, if so, how many of them are full-time (Editorial, 23 September)? I very much doubt that anywhere near this figure could be achieved unless a very large number of people abandon buses and stop using their cars and fares rise to satisfy the drivers need for enough money to make it worthwhile. You suggest that Uber has been a “lifeline” to people travelling long distances to work unsocial hours for low pay. Even at an “affordable” Uber fare of £15 I would suggest that Uber is unaffordable for such people – it is the equivalent of two hours’ work at minimum wage rates. The main user group will be more affluent people who resent paying black cab rates. Those who can afford neither black cabs nor Uber will be reliant primarily on public transport, mainly buses. If a large group of people use more expensive services, it will have the twin effect of causing more congestion and depleting the existing user base (hence the economic viability) of public transport in London. Jo Lynch Liskeard, Cornwall • US tech firms often proudly boast of their aim and ability to “disrupt” the existing order, as if this were automatically a good thing. Regrettably, their disruption is all too frequently thoughtless of any consequence other than to make a fast buck for themselves. Uber offers a dystopian vision of an unregulated, unsafe, unfair, unstable and uncaring future in which the vast majority of us scrape a living through low-paid work with zero employment rights. Its myopic and selfish users need to recognise this. TfL is right to remove Uber’s licence. Steve Rouse Gee Cross, Cheshire • Employees can be a company’s biggest asset in a crisis – but only if the employer has done enough to gain their support long before things go wrong. If accounts like James Atkinson’s are reflective of wider industry and employee opinion, airlines will have to move quickly to find a solution to this deep-rooted problem (Unless Ryanair treats pilots like me better, this crisis will be a long haul, 20 September). This starts with an honest look at whether current scheduling practices are fair, sustainable and effective. A single delay affects not only the passengers booked on that service but subsequent ones too. Airlines can’t afford to let one mistake ripple across their network. Customer loyalty is one of the most important currencies and one cancellation can make it impossible to win back a passenger’s trust. The right solution won’t just help management. It will also help employees achieve a better work-life balance. Data-driven scheduling gives control to employees with the ability to mark their preferences and availability. At the same time, data analytics can match supply with demand and anticipate any liabilities, such as an overwhelming build-up of leave. Empowering staff in this way will help create a positive work culture where employers and their staff work hand-in-hand to pre-empt and solve company issues.

They displayed a callous efficiency and a charming stubbornness in an unforgiving and occasionally ugly performance that earned United victory and a fifth clean sheet in six Premier League matches. Romelu Lukaku, though, was still stationed inside in doping control, and, such is the ruthlessness of this United team at present, they left for Southampton airport without him. Lukaku was ultimately the match‑winner but this was a result built upon steely foundations. Chris Smalling and Daley Blind offered late reinforcements and by the end United had six defenders on the pitch and sometimes eight, nine or even 10 men behind the ball. Lukaku was left estranged for large parts of the second half as a rejuvenated Southampton penned in the visitors. After hoofing the ball out of play and away from danger for a throw-in, Eric Bailly was triumphantly applauded by his manager. Marcus Rashford showed willing in both boxes while Phil Jones took an age to dust himself down after desperately – almost drunkenly – trying to shield the ball from Nathan Redmond, the Southampton winger. For Mourinho, this felt like the sweetest of victories and reminiscent of those that helped him to the title with Chelsea in 2005. Ashley Young, the Manchester United full-back, insisted this “was not a United performance” – but his manager was delighted and not ashamed by it. As for the shift from stereotype, it would do United no harm whatsoever to have this sort of art up their sleeve. As Mourinho was keen to emphasise afterwards, the prize for United was the same as after the 4-0 wins against Everton and West Ham United, regardless of the style in which they were achieved. United were plagued by 15 league draws last term, while they eked out only two 1-0 wins in the league last year (one of which was away, at Hull City in August) and Mourinho, more than anybody, knows the true weight of an ugly win or two. “Not always can you play really well,” Mauricio Pellegrino, the Southampton manager, said. “The best teams in the world adapt their players to every single situation.” Indeed, Rashford and Juan Mata both had to do some dirty work. United are four points better off than this time last year but more pertinently appear to have rediscovered the swagger and the look of champions, an aura that has eluded them since Sir Alex Ferguson’s departure in 2013. Finding a way to win at Southampton on Saturday is further evidence of their marked progress, having been forced to settle for a draw at St Mary’s five months ago. United rode their luck a little this time around, typified by Marouane Fellaini’s clearance from Oriol Romeu’s goal-bound header, but there seems to be a belief that they will not shrink into their shells or go under, as they might have last season. Such an underwhelming performance has inspired such overwhelming noise about United’s prospects this term. Mourinho, though, was reluctant to indulge in superlatives or to amplify talk of a title tilt but rather acknowledged the testing October period, during which they face Liverpool, Benfica and Tottenham Hotspur. Beneath the surface, however, Mourinho must be feeling smug. At the heart of any title hopes are his go-to men, his trusty yet unfashionable players, such as Jones, Fellaini, Young and the captain Antonio Valencia, a couple of whom were ridiculed not so long ago. Then there is the industry of Nemanja Matic and the once again impressive Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who was busy even if not at his best. Plus, it must be said, they missed Paul Pogba’s drive in midfield. And while Southampton deserve credit for putting the opposition on the back foot for most of the second half, on another day United could have ran away with it. Ander Herrera scooped harmlessly over while Lukaku should have doubled his tally, but for Fraser Forster. Lukaku has certainly played his part, too. He has scored eight goals in as many matches and in doing so has reached that tally quicker than Eric Cantona, Ruud van Nistelrooy or Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Belgian has slotted in so seamlessly that even Mourinho has expressed his surprise at the striker’s impact. “I knew he would score goals, more for us than he did for Everton or West Brom, that is logical,” Mourinho said, “but I was not expecting him match after match to put the ball in the net.” A trip to CSKA Moscow on Wednesday beckons and while it would usually be seen as a potential upset, this bruising, businesslike United are simply in no mood for slip-ups."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/25/scotlands-greenhouse-emissions-strategy-criticised","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T07:23:42Z","webTitle":"Climate experts criticise Scotland's greenhouse emissions cuts strategy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/25/scotlands-greenhouse-emissions-strategy-criticised","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/25/scotlands-greenhouse-emissions-strategy-criticised","fields":{"headline":"Climate experts criticise Scotland's greenhouse emissions cuts strategy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Climate experts have warned the Scottish government its ambitious plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions lack credibility and risk stalling unless its strategies improve dramatically. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) said the devolved government had so far led the UK in its efforts to cut emissions, reducing its actual CO2 emissions by 38% by 2015 compared with 35% at UK level. Scotland is now on the brink of meeting its 2020 target to cut emissions by 42% several years early. Nicola Sturgeon’s government is consulting on plans to set a fresh target of cutting emissions by 90% by 2050 but faces heavy criticism from anti-poverty charities and the Scottish Green party, who have urged the first minister to take faster, tougher action. The CCC, the UK’s government-funded advisory committee, said the policies needed to hit that target were too weak and ill thought out, singling out proposals in a draft plan to heavily cut emissions by sharply increasing low carbon home heating to 80% by 2032. Those were “very unlikely to be feasible”, it warned. The committee said ministers needed instead to put far greater emphasis on cutting the country’s rising transport emissions – an area largely neglected by the Scottish government until now. So Sturgeon’s proposals to dramatically increase the use of electric and ultra low emission vehicles by helping phase out sales of new petrol and diesel-powers vans and cars by 2032, outlined in her new programme for government earlier this month, were a significant step forward, it added. In an unusually critical progress report for the Scottish parliament, the CCC said: “Without firm new policies, reductions in Scottish emissions are unlikely to continue in the 2020s. The final version of Scotland’s plan should also build as fully as possible on the UK government’s clean growth plan, which will set out how UK emissions targets to 2032 will be met. “Greater ambition will be required to reduce emissions in the transport sector, as announced in the recent programme for government, with less reliance on rapid deployment of low-carbon heating. The plan as it stands lacks credibility in meeting the emissions targets to 2032 and fails to prepare properly for deeper decarbonisation in the longer term.” Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment secretary, said her government was now putting action on climate at the heart of its policymaking. Its final plan, due to be published in 2018, would reflect the committee’s advice. “We acknowledge that there are areas where more needs to be done in order to continue meeting our ambitious targets and to prepare for even greater future ambition under our proposed climate change bill,” she said. Scotland’s emissions reduction had been driven largely by sharp increases in renewable electricity, funded by UK consumers, and deep cuts in coal-fired power, bolstered by forestry acting as a carbon sink. Scotland’s last coal powered station, Longannet, closed down in 2016 and electrification of the country’s rail network is increasing, but the committee said Scottish ministers could no longer rely on renewable electricity investment to hit future targets. That switch to renewables was driven by Alex Salmond, Sturgeon’s predecessor as first minister, but the Scottish government has been accused of pursuing contradictory policies on climate. Salmond championed North Sea oil exports to fund Scottish independence, while investing billions on new road projects, and Sturgeon plans to phase out air passenger duty to boost aviation. While the Scottish government has no direct say over vehicle emissions standards and little influence over manufacturers, committee officials said it could boost electric vehicle use by greatly increasing charging infrastructure and having tougher planning and parking policies. The committee said the 2032 policy would lead to the complete phasing out of all petrol and diesel powered cars by 2050. Ministers are also introducing new low emission zones in Scotland’s four largest cities, to control pollution and inefficient vehicles. Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Greens’ co-convenor and parliamentary leader, accused Sturgeon of lacking ambition. He said that cutting emissions by 90% by 2050 represented a slowing down of action. If Scotland continued to cutting annual emissions at the present rate, it could reach zero net emissions by 2040. “Other countries have already set net-zero targets before the year 2050, including Norway and Sweden”, Harvie said last Friday. “Scotland has a chance to continue showing leadership and adopt a net-zero target and I’m glad the first minister has at least committed to ‘proper consideration’ of consultation responses.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/sep/27/right-wing-media-could-not-be-more-wrong-about-the-15c-carbon-budget-paper","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T10:00:31Z","webTitle":"Right-wing media could not be more wrong about the 1.5°C carbon budget paper | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/sep/27/right-wing-media-could-not-be-more-wrong-about-the-15c-carbon-budget-paper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/sep/27/right-wing-media-could-not-be-more-wrong-about-the-15c-carbon-budget-paper","fields":{"headline":"Right-wing media could not be more wrong about the 1.5°C carbon budget paper","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last week, Nature Geoscience published a study suggesting that we have a bigger remaining carbon budget than previously thought to keep global warming below the 1.5°C aggressive Paris climate target. Many scientists quickly commented that the paper’s conclusion was based on some questionable assumptions, and this single study shouldn’t be blindly accepted as gospel truth. Conservative media outlets did even worse than that. They took one part of the paper’s analysis out of context and grossly distorted its conclusions to advance their anti-climate agenda. 1.5°C might indeed be a geophysical impossibility The study used the UK Met Office and Hadley Centre’s HadCRUT4 global temperature data set to conclude that so far we’ve warmed 0.93°C from the mid-1800s to 2015, compared to the Paris target of 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures. Several climate scientists immediately noted a problem here – HadCRUT4 excludes the Arctic region, which is the fastest-warming part of the planet. Hence it’s one of the least globally-representative temperature datasets. According to more globally-complete data sets like Berkeley Earth, the warming we’ve seen is closer to 1.1°C. Defining “pre-industrial temperatures” is another issue. Humans caused some global warming prior to the mid-1800s; as one recent study showed, as much as 0.2°C. A third problem discussed by climate scientists Stefan Rahmstorf at RealClimate involves the way the study authors defined the budget itself. They looked at how much carbon will be emitted at the time we reach 1.5°C warming, but because of what’s known as the ‘thermal inertia’ of the oceans, and because sunlight-reflecting pollutants will fall out of the atmosphere as we shift away from dirty coal power, the planet will keep warming after that time. If we take all these factors together, depending on how we decide to define “pre-industrial” in the Paris target, we may in fact already be committed to 1.5°C warming, and the headline conclusion that “the 1.5C warming limit is not yet a geophysical impossibility” may be incorrect. But ultimately that’s a relatively unimportant point. Even if limiting global warming to 1.5°C is still technically feasible, it will take immense global action to achieve it. If it’s infeasible, we still need immense global action to try and stay below 2°C, or 2.5°C, or to slow global warming as much as possible to avoid catastrophic consequences. From a real-world policy perspective, we need all hands on deck whether the conclusions of this paper are right or wrong. Biased right-wing media turns on the spin cycle Of course, many conservatives who want to maintain the status quo object to that reality. As we saw with the recent Ipso ruling, many right-wing media outlets will jump at any opportunity to misrepresent climate research in order to advance the climate denial agenda. Unfortunately, Ben Webster of the London Times appears to have misunderstood co-author Myles Allen’s explanation of their study, and quoted him as saying: We haven’t seen that rapid acceleration in warming after 2000 that we see in the models. We haven’t seen that in the observations. Many climate scientists immediately pointed out this assertion is false. The UK Met Office noted, “The observations lie comfortably within the modelled range.” The Daily Mail (reliable only for its unreliable climate reporting) subsequently claimed that the paper showed climate models had overestimated temperatures by ‘at least’ 0.3°C, and quoted Allen calling this “a big deal,” although the context of that quote was conveniently omitted. In a subsequent fact check at Carbon Brief, Zeke Hausfather detailed the many misunderstandings that led to this false conclusion. As fellow study co-author Piers Forster told Carbon Brief: I think some press reporting is misleading as our paper did not assess climate impacts or climate model performance. Rather, our paper confirms the need for much increased urgent action from around the world if society stands a chance of limiting warming to 1.5C. Myles Allen and study lead author Richard Millar took to The Guardian to criticize the conservative media outlets that had misrepresented their research. I spoke to Allen, who clarified that he was trying to explain that temperatures didn’t seem to be responding to carbon emissions as fast as the models used in the last IPCC report anticipated. Except the reasons for that have already been identified - the actual global energy imbalance hasn’t been as large as in the scenarios input into the climate models, and we have to compare apples-to-apples temperatures. As Allen and Millar wrote in The Guardian: the IPCC specifically assessed that temperatures in the 2020s would be 0.9-1.3C warmer than pre-industrial, the lower end of which is already looking conservative. Anyone who had troubled to read our paper would have found this “IPCC AR5 Ch11 projection” helpfully labelled on two of our figures, and clearly consistent with our new results. It appears that Ben Webster didn’t understand Allen’s explanation, and Allen was perhaps a bit careless with some of his words. As a result, Webster quoted Allen saying the models were running too hot. Conservative ‘journalists’ and opinion writers saw that seemingly juicy quote and without speaking to Allen or any other climate scientists, ran with it, completely distorting the actual findings of the paper in the process. It’s been clear for years that conservative media outlets thrive on any comments from climate scientists that can be construed as supporting climate denial myths (model reliability being among the most popular myths). It’s unfortunate that climate scientists have to be so careful about what they say, but that’s the reality we live in. Biased conservative media outlets aren’t interested in accurately reporting scientific findings; they’re interested in advancing the climate denial agenda of manufacturing doubt in order to erode public support for climate policies. And so the grossly misleading ‘alarmist scientists admit they were wrong’ story was echoed by Breitbart, the Daily Mail, the Sun, the Herald Sun, Fox News, the Daily Caller, and many more. We’re running out of time to curtail climate damages The primary conclusion of the study was that if the international community acts extremely aggressively to cut carbon pollution, it might still be possible to meet the Paris 1.5°C target. That conclusion may or may not be true, but if we listen to the conservative media and continue on our current path, there’s no chance we’ll stay below 1.5 or 2°C. Even with the current international climate pledges we’re on a path toward 3°C or more global warming. While it’s nice to know if the most hopeful targets are still a geophysical possibility, we need much more aggressive climate policies if they’re to become a practical and political possibility. And biased media outlets will always happily distort the science in order to obstruct those policies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/23/corbyn-faces-calls-permanent-membership-single-market","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T20:00:25Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn urged to make Labour the pro single market party","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/23/corbyn-faces-calls-permanent-membership-single-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/23/corbyn-faces-calls-permanent-membership-single-market","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn urged to make Labour the pro single market party","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn today faces calls from across the Labour movement to commit to full and permanent membership of the EU single market and customs union – so the party can offer a clear alternative to the Tories over Brexit. As Labour’s annual conference opens in Brighton, more than 30 MPs, together with MEPs, Labour peers, trade union leaders and mayors, publish an open letter demanding that Labour shows “the courage of its convictions” and toughens its pro-EU message. Brexit looks certain to provoke the most heated debate in Brighton as delegates gather in buoyant mood following the party’s performance in June’s snap general election. Writing for the Observer, Corbyn says his party is now “a government in waiting”. He urges all Labour members “to use our new strength inside and outside parliament to challenge the Conservatives at every step – and prepare to form a new government to change Britain whenever the next election is called”. He adds: “Our mission must be to work with the people of Britain to transfer wealth, power and opportunity to the many from the few. For the first time in a long time we can provide a politics of hope and a politics for the people.” But divisions over Brexit were already surfacing on Saturday night as pro-EU delegates demanded that they be given the chance to vote on a change to official Brexit policy on the conference floor. In their open letter the MPs and senior figures in the Labour movement, including former shadow cabinet members Heidi Alexander and Chuka Umunna, as well as one of Corbyn’s closest allies in his early days as leader, Clive Lewis, say it is “unsustainable to say we are an anti-austerity party” while being in favour of leaving the single market and customs union. The letter, also signed by the TSSA union’s general secretary, Manuel Cortes, former Northern Ireland secretary Peter Hain and Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson, says Labour should stand up for the principle of free movement of workers and reject totally the Tories’ “destructive Brexit”. They say: “So at our conference this week, Labour should commit to staying in the single market and customs union – ruling out no options for how to achieve this – and to working with sister parties and others across Europe to improve workers’ rights, boost trade union membership and put an end to the exploitation of workers, not freedom of movement. “This would send a powerful message of solidarity to the rest of Europe, and to the millions of EU and UK nationals living in limbo here and across the continent.” Only five weeks ago, Labour’s Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, rewrote Labour’s policy, committing the party to remaining in the single market and customs union during a transitional period of between two and four years, and keeping open the possibility of long-term membership if a new deal could be negotiated to reform free-movement rules. But signatories to the letter, organised by Open Britain and the Labour Campaign for the Single Market, while welcoming Starmer’s move, say the party remains insufficiently distinct from the Tories on Brexit. Pressure for Labour to go further has mounted since Theresa May used a speech in Florence on Friday to propose a two-year transition after 2019 during which the UK would in effect stay inside the single market and customs union. After the prime minister’s speech, Starmer accepted that the Tories had adopted Labour’s plans. Calls for the party to back single market and customs union membership could potentially put Corbyn, who has in the past been lukewarm in his support for the EU, at loggerheads with much of the party’s mass membership, which backed Remain in the referendum last June. More than 40 motions on Brexit have been submitted for debate at the conference. A decision on the wording of a motion to be debated on Monday will be discussed behind closed doors by party officials and MPs on Sunday night. Corbyn is under pressure from some of his own supporters to back the EU’s free movement of labour rules, which the party vowed to tear up in its last election manifesto. Among those pushing for a vote on the issue at Labour’s conference is Michael Chessum, formerly a senior figure in the Corbyn-supporting Momentum group. On Saturday the Tories’ fragile truce over Brexit was already fracturing as allies of Boris Johnson declared that the foreign secretary had dramatically altered the prime minister’s keynote speech on Europe and forced the cabinet to accept a shorter transition period. They said that before his 4,000-word essay setting out the need for a hard Brexit, the government had been heading for a future in which it would have been out of the EU “in name only”. Friends of the foreign secretary also took aim at Philip Hammond, accusing the chancellor of pushing a plan for a transition period lasting four or five years, rather than the two-year period announced by the prime minister. Allies of the chancellor were adamant that Hammond had been pushing no such plan, pointing out that he had been publicly advocating a transition period of two or three years. Downing Street sources also denied May’s speech had been rewritten as a result of Johnson’s intervention. Meanwhile, there are increasing concerns in the Tory ranks that not enough work is being done to prepare for the possibility of crashing out of Europe with no deal. Sir Oliver Letwin, the former cabinet minister who was in charge of the Whitehall unit charged with preparing to leave the European Union under David Cameron, told the Observer: “My sense talking around is that the work is beginning inside HMG now, but I don’t believe it has yet reached anything like the level of intensity that it needs to reach. “That is OK – there is still time , but it will have to be done in the next few months. It requires clear thinking and administrative competence.” Despite the concessions made by May, several government insiders said they believed that the EU would not agree to sanction talks over a future trade deal next month, Instead, insiders now hope the talks will being before Christmas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
