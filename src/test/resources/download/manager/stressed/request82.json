An essential ingredient in many classic cocktails, vermouth is a fortified wine flavoured with botanicals. Long tarred by the brush of 1970s naffness, it’s now being recognised as a fine aperitif in its own right, ticking the lower-alcohol trend box and being bloody delicious to boot. Italian and French vermouths are familiar acquaintances, but those from Spain are less well known, although the Spanish (the Catalans, in particular) have been enthusiastic makers and drinkers of what they call vermut (verr-moot) since the mid-19th century. The traditional way of drinking it is to be a man and knock it back with a few tapas in the local bar at “la hora del vermut” after mass on Sunday while the wife cooks lunch. Well, Spanish vermut is now on the lips of fashionista drinkers everywhere – even women! – and not just on Sundays. Traditional producers in Spain are ramping up production – Lacuesta (£12.90 Basco; 15% abv), made in La Rioja since 1936, has seen a 70% rise in sales in three years and will be London’s first vermut served on tap at Nieves Barragan’s upcoming new restaurant, Sabor – and recent years have seen a flurry of new vermuts, and not just from Catalunya. Even venerable sherry houses, not generally known for hipster cred, are getting in on the act down in Jerez. Try Lustau’s luscious Vermut Rojo (£12.99 Waitrose; 15% abv) or Gonzalez Byass’s spicy La Copa (£13.06 The Drink Shop, £15 Oddbins; 15.5% abv). Casa Mariol’s super-smart vermuts are some of the best of the newer kids from the Catalan heartlands – try its Vermut Blanc (£15 Master of Malt; 16% abv) – while the star of the Ribera del Duero region is the tempranillo-based Golfo (£19.95 Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, £18.55 Master of Malt; 15% abv). Other nations are joining the vermouth craze, too. Regal Rogue is made using botanicals from the Australian outback: its Daring Dry (£16.68 Master of Malt, £17.99 Amazon; 18% abv) will appeal to those with a savoury palate. And if you prefer something fruity and floral, try Belsazar Rosé (£16.95 for 375ml 31 Dover; 17.5% abv). The Spanish serve vermut slugged neat over ice and garnished with a twist of orange peel and maybe a green olive, or long with ice and lemonade (use a mix of lemonade and soda to hold back on sweetness). I love it with tonic, too, and choose lemon over orange to serve if my vermouth’s white rather than red. Any time, any place, anywhere: welcome back, vermouth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/26/lancashire-council-to-vote-on-non-stunned-halal-meat-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T17:26:42Z","webTitle":"Lancashire council votes to ban schools from serving non-stunned halal meat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/26/lancashire-council-to-vote-on-non-stunned-halal-meat-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/26/lancashire-council-to-vote-on-non-stunned-halal-meat-ban","fields":{"headline":"Lancashire council votes to ban schools from serving non-stunned halal meat","bodyText":"An English council has voted to ban schools from serving halal meat from animals that are not stunned before slaughter. The proposal to ban the practice was brought by Geoff Driver, the Conservative leader of Lancashire county council, who argues it is “abhorrent” and “really, really cruel” to slaughter animals without stunning them first. Lancashire currently supplies 27 schools with “unstunned” halal meat, catering for up to 12,000 children who are served 1.2m meals a year. Councillors voted 41 to 24 to ban the meat from county-run schools. Fifteen councillors abstained. During a heated debate on Thursday night, Labour councillor Lorraine Beavers said 12,000 children in Lancashire were being used as a “political football”. She said the motion sent a message to children of a particular faith that they were not being respected by the Conservative-led council. Conservative councillor Andrew Snowden said the issue was about “the minimum treatment we expect animals to receive”. He said he would support a ban on the “inhumane” practice of not stunning animals before slaughter “because my moral compass obliges me to”. Concluding the debate, Driver denied that the vote was antisemitic or islamophobic, and insisted it was instead about animal welfare. He accused Beavers of hypocrisy, saying she had a sticker promoting a ban on the fur trade on her car. Lancashire Council of Mosques (LCM) has accused Driver of leading a “crusade” on the issue. Abdul Qureshi, the LCM’s chair, said any decision to ban unstunned halal meat would create a huge difficulty. “People will pull out of school meals and people who should eat properly will be deprived of that. For us it’s a matter of faith. For Geoff Driver it is his feelings,” he told the BBC last month. There is no demand for stunned halal meat from any school within the authority’s catering service, the council admitted in a report produced before Thursday’s full council meeting. The report’s unnamed author(s) conceded they had not contacted LCM directly “to avoid any unnecessary upset”, but said the LCM was likely to boycott school meals if the council implemented the ban on non-stunned meat. The council estimates it could lose about £285,000 if the current school catering contracts are lost after any policy change. The debate around the provision of stunned and unstunned halal meat to schools has already “resulted in community tensions and fed the agenda of the far right”, the report said. Paul Golding, head of the far-right group Britain First, has tweeted about the Lancashire council vote. Schools may seek alternative suppliers of halal meat who may not be accredited suppliers and therefore less accountable, the report warned. “We currently offer meat accredited by the Halal Monitoring Committee, which is a trusted quality brand amongst Lancashire’s Muslim communities,” the report said. UK law requires farm animals to be stunned before slaughter, but provides a religious exemption for Jews and Muslims. There is no single defined standard for halal in the UK. Instead, there are a range of halal accreditation agencies which inspect and accredit firms involved in the production and handling of meat in order for that meat to be described as halal. Some significant meat-producing countries such as Denmark and New Zealand legally mandate pre-stunning even for halal slaughter. English councils have the powers to ban non-stunned halal meat, though any decision may be subject to challenge under equality laws. The ability of the animal to feel pain after being stunned is hotly contested. The exemptions to stunning are opposed by animal rights organisations such as the RSPCA, which is opposed to the slaughter of any animal without first ensuring it is rendered insensible to pain and distress. The Lancashire council report warned that a move away from the current policy to supply both stunned and unstunned halal meat may have adverse effects such as: “fewer young people accessing their free entitlement of free school meals; risk of quality assurance within the supply chain; high uptake of packed lunches that don’t meet the school food regulations; and longer-term effects on attainment and achievement of young people, from high-risk social economic backgrounds”. The halal battle between Driver and Lancashire’s Muslim community is long running. In 2013 the LCM urged parents to boycott school meals in Lancashire in a row over food preparation, when Driver first tried to ban non-stunned meat. According to the council report, the effect was particularly damaging in the east of the county and the central Preston area, where school meal uptake fell by more than 7%. The LCM said at the time it found a non-Muslim man slaughtering birds, which were then termed as being halal during an inspection. The Qur’an does not expressly forbid stunning, saying only that the animal must be alive at the point of slaughter. But it does stipulate that only a Muslim using a sharp knife of adequate size can slaughter. The Food Standards Agency carried out an animal welfare survey in abattoirs across Britain during one week in September 2013 which found about 84% of animals slaughtered by the halal method were stunned before being killed. Driver was arrested earlier this year on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and witness intimidation. He and three others are being investigated amid claims of impropriety concerning a deal between the council and BT. He has denied all claims of illegality and is scheduled to answer bail on 22 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/26/kaspersky-russia-nsa-contractor-leaked-us-hacking-tools-by-mistake-pirating-microsoft-office","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T09:50:46Z","webTitle":"NSA contractor leaked US hacking tools by mistake, Kaspersky says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/26/kaspersky-russia-nsa-contractor-leaked-us-hacking-tools-by-mistake-pirating-microsoft-office","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/26/kaspersky-russia-nsa-contractor-leaked-us-hacking-tools-by-mistake-pirating-microsoft-office","fields":{"headline":"NSA contractor leaked US hacking tools by mistake, Kaspersky says","bodyText":"An incredible sequence of security mistakes led to a US National Security Agency contractor leaking his own confidential hacking tools to Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, the Moscow-based company has alleged. The claim comes as part of an internal investigation into allegations that the company helped Russian spies discover and steal the NSA files, by locating and flagging the contractor. Kaspersky Lab does not dispute that it discovered hacking tools on the computer of a user of one of its consumer antivirus products. But the timeline it lays out is one of multiple serious security errors on the part of the user, believed to be an NSA contractor. According to Kaspersky’s report, the contractor was using the company’s home antivirus software when it detected a piece of malware attributed to the “Equation Group” (the security firm’s internal codename for what is believed to be the NSA’s hacking team) on 11 September 2014. Some time after that, the contractor apparently disabled the Kaspersky antivirus software, the company says, but is unable to pinpoint the exact date as that information is not logged. On 4 October 2014, it appears that the contractor turned the antivirus software back on – because he had downloaded and installed some malware while trying to pirate Microsoft Office. “The user appears to have downloaded and installed pirated software on his machines, as indicated by an illegal Microsoft Office activation key generator,” Kaspersky says. “The malware dropped from the trojanised keygen was a full blown backdoor, which may have allowed third parties access to the user’s machine.” When the user turned his antivirus software back on, and “scanned the computer multiple times”, it correctly detected and blocked the malware. But it also detected some NSA hacking tools, again flagging them as malware. This time, because the hacking tools were “new variants”, the antivirus made use of a second security feature that the contractor had enabled, uploading the file to Kaspersky Lab for analysis. Speaking to the Guardian, Eugene Kaspersky, the company’s founder and chief executive, said that from there, the issue was elevated directly to him. “The analyst who received the archive reported it to me and the decision was made to delete the archive from all the company’s systems. Nothing was shared with anyone and no further detections from this user have been received.” Kaspersky Lab’s narrative matches with the initial allegations in a number of ways, but leaves some puzzling discrepancies. For one, the initial report by the Wall Street Journal alleged the events occurred in 2015; Kaspersky describes a the series of events as happening in late 2014. But the bigger unknown is whether and how Kaspersky’s acknowledged discovery and acquisition of NSA hacking tools resulted in Russian intelligence agencies discovering the NSA contractor, and targeting him for further, apparently successful, attacks. Mr Kaspersky vehemently denies the allegation. “No credible evidence has been presented to substantiate the claim of the company’s involvement in the alleged incident,” he said. In an earlier statement, Mr Kaspersky had implied that a successful hack of Kaspersky Lab’s systems by Russian spies might have resulted in the breach; now, he has gone back on that theory too. “If there is any indication that the company’s systems may have been exploited, we respectfully request relevant parties to responsibly provide the company with verifiable information,” he said. Kaspersky Lab has acknowledged being hacked by a nation state once before: in 2015, it discovered that dozens of machines in its networks had been infected by the Duqu 2.0 spyware, which is believed to be linked to Israel. “We are confident that we have identified and removed all the infections that happened during that incident,” Eugene Kaspersky now says. “Furthermore, Kaspersky Lab publicly reported the attack, and the company offered its assistance to affected or interested organisations to help mitigate this threat.” On Monday, Kaspersky Lab announced a new initiative to try and win back some of the trust lost as a result of the allegations. The “global transparency initiative” sees it opening up the source code to its software to a panel of independent experts, as well as submitting to a full audit of its internal security practices. “Trust is essential in cybersecurity,” said Mr Kaspersky, “which depends on collaboration between vendors, researchers, clients.” That trust is also crucial because of the nature of antivirus programs, which must be given total access to the user’s computer, and the ability to check back with a central server to update definitions, to do their job effectively. That efficacy is what Kaspersky hopes to renew focus on. “I always choose the best. With cybersecurity any trade-offs in favour of origin, price or any other feature may lead to unpredictable and sad consequences. “As a result of a single successful cyber-attack a person may lose all data, a critical infrastructure may stop working and even lead to human casualties. In my opinion cybersecurity tolerates no compromises.” Government called on to let data breach victims force compensation"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/26/world-failing-myanmars-rohingya-muslims-top-red-cross-official-says","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T09:37:58Z","webTitle":"World failing Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims, top Red Cross official says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/26/world-failing-myanmars-rohingya-muslims-top-red-cross-official-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/26/world-failing-myanmars-rohingya-muslims-top-red-cross-official-says","fields":{"headline":"World failing Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims, top Red Cross official says","bodyText":"A top Red Cross official has described the humanitarian crisis affecting Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims as unprecedented and said the world was failing in its response. Speaking to the Guardian on a visit to the rapidly expanding refugee camps in the Bangladeshi port town of Cox’s Bazar, the head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Elhadj As Sy, said a political solution was needed and called for all leaders “without exception” to take the situation seriously. Myanmar has blocked most international agencies, including the UN, from parts of northern Rakhine state, where security forces are accused of raping and massacring Rohingya Muslims. The Red Cross has been allowed to provide emergency assistance to tens of thousands of people inside the country since 25 August, when the violence began, but the exodus of hungry and exhausted Rohingya has overwhelmed staff. The organisation is appealing for $33m (£25m) to fund operations in Bangladesh. “We are facing here a crisis that is quite unprecedented not only in scale, but in the depths of the multiple deprivations that people are facing,” Sy said. “The Red Cross has greater access than anybody else [but] the whole response cannot be shifted to the shoulders of Red Cross alone. There should be access for other humanitarian actors. As proud as we are of what we do as a movement, I don’t think we’re responding to the scale and magnitude of the problem.” More than 603,000 Rohingya Muslims are estimated to have crossed into Bangladesh, where they are living in dire conditions under tarpaulins and in tents in muddy camps. More than half are children, Unicef said on Wednesday. “Never have I seen so many children in a crisis,” Sy said. “Children who’ve seen things that a child should never witness. Children who are losing their childhood.” He said he was shocked and saddened to see the state of the refugees arriving after days of walking to reach the border. “A state of deprivation. It’s hunger, fear, exhaustion. I hesitate to put a word on it. A horrible state. You see almost the unbearable look of a total destitute person in need. It is almost unbearable,” he said. “We have seen terrible refugee situations …but this is very different.” The Rohingya have endured decades of persecution in Myanmar, which refuses to acknowledge them as a distinct ethnic group, saying they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Authorities there have denied accusations of ethnic cleansing. Myanmar’s de factor leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, said in September she did not know why people were fleeing. As international pressure has intensified – the US said this week it was considering economic sanctions – Myanmar and Bangladesh have begun talks on repatriation. Many Rohingya want to return home, but only if their safety is ensured. Thousands of Rohingya continue to arrive in Bangladesh each day, but Sy said there was still hope for a political solution to the crisis. “Ideally political solutions should have been found to the problem so that we minimise the factors that are really pushing people on the road of exodus because home is no longer safe,” he said. “We are calling always for humanity to prevail, but of course it’s a political debate that is in the hands of political leaders to have the responsibility and we hope that they will take it seriously. All of them. And I mean all of them. At the national level as well as international level.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/26/monitor-social-media-of-young-offenders-to-prevent-says-watchdog","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T11:20:12Z","webTitle":"Monitor social media of young offenders to prevent crime, says watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/26/monitor-social-media-of-young-offenders-to-prevent-says-watchdog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/26/monitor-social-media-of-young-offenders-to-prevent-says-watchdog","fields":{"headline":"Monitor social media of young offenders to prevent crime, says watchdog","bodyText":"The social media of young offenders who pose a risk to others should be monitored to prevent crime, the probation watchdog has suggested. In a report published on Thursday, HM Inspectorate of Probation found that in one in four cases examined by its staff, the young person’s use of social media was directly related to the offence they committed. It said crimes were now “planned in bedrooms rather than on street corners”. Dame Glenys Stacey, the chief inspector of probation, said youth offending teams needed help to address this shift in methodology. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday: “Many of the young people actually shun Facebook and other media that we’re all familiar with in favour of lesser-known, more private media and we found offence scenarios inconceivable even a few years ago, with social media used both to incite and plan crime. “And our case is that youth justice workers are doing a very good job but they really need some help to catch up and they need to know whether or not they can monitor this social media use and to what extent and how do they do that.” Asked whether that could involve monitoring of private, encrypted messages on platforms such as WhatsApp and Snapchat, Stacey said lawyers needed to decide “what the line would be”. However, they had already advised the inspectorate that “proportionate monitoring” was allowed, she added. Some youth offending teams were already monitoring the social media of the young people under their care but were unclear where they stood legally, Stacey said. A privacy campaign group has expressed concerns about the proposal. Griff Ferris, researcher at Big Brother Watch, said: “We support the view that youth offending teams need to have more support in dealing with harmful uses of social media. However, monitoring young people’s social media in some sort of ‘pre-crime’ approach is entirely disproportionate and potentially an extreme intrusion into their privacy. Any attempt to monitor private communications on encrypted apps such as WhatsApp would require breaking encryption, which as we know would involve breaking encryption for all and making us all vulnerable to cybercrime.” The inspectors’ report, The Work of Youth Offending Teams to Protect the Public, examined 115 files on cases where youths had committed violent, sexual or other offences. It found there had been a generational shift, with young people now living increasingly in an online world which many adults barely understand. It also described social media as the catalyst for some of the most serious and violent crimes offences its staff encountered. Among the examples it highlighted were arguments and personal abuse starting on social media leading to physical assaults in the street or on public transport; young people being blackmailed online using indecent images; and gangs posting videos to appeal for members, stake their territory or issue challenges to other gangs. The report suggested that youth offending managers in London were “more in tune” with the link between social media and gangs due to strategies to tackle gang violence in the capital. It said that social media offered clues about what was happening in people’s lives and so should be used by youth offending teams, which were otherwise doing a good job, according to the report. “There is also a strong case for monitoring the social media output of young people who pose a risk to others so as to protect others sufficiently well,” writes Stacey. The report also concluded that the public could be better protected from dangerous and violent young offenders if adults working with them were trained to understand the often extreme trauma in their childhoods. Mental health experts told inspectors that many young people under supervision had experienced post-traumatic stress (PTSD)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/26/uk-gender-pay-gap-narrows-to-lowest-for-20-years-but-is-still-91","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T12:25:56Z","webTitle":"UK gender pay gap narrows to lowest for 20 years – but is still 9.1%","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/26/uk-gender-pay-gap-narrows-to-lowest-for-20-years-but-is-still-91","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/26/uk-gender-pay-gap-narrows-to-lowest-for-20-years-but-is-still-91","fields":{"headline":"UK gender pay gap narrows to lowest for 20 years – but is still 9.1%","bodyText":"Britain’s gender pay gap among full-time workers has fallen to the lowest level since records began 20 years ago, but the TUC warned the UK was still “decades away” from equal pay for men and women. The gap between what male and female workers earn – based on median hourly earnings – fell to 9.1% in April, from 9.4% a year earlier, according to the annual snapshot of hours and earnings from the Office for National Statistics. It was 17.4% in 1997 when the ONS first collected the data. But Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said progress was too slow and urged the government to put more pressure on firms to close the gap. “The full-time gender pay gap has inched a bit smaller. But there is still a chasm between men and women’s earnings. At this rate it’ll take decades for women to get paid the same as men,” she said. “The government needs to crank up the pressure on employers. Companies shouldn’t just be made to publish their gender pay gaps. They should be forced to explain how they’ll close them. And those bosses who flout the law should be fined.” Men working full-time earned an average of £592 a week in April compared with £494 for women. At 34%, the occupations with the biggest pay gap among full-time workers were town planners, musicians, and assemblers of vehicles and metal goods. Real pay fell for the first time since 2014, according to the ONS survey, as prices rose at a faster pace than wages. Weekly earnings adjusted for inflation were 0.4% lower in April compared with a year earlier. Lack of pay growth has left workers £38 a week worse off than they were before the financial crash, O’Grady said. “Most families still haven’t recovered from the financial crash, yet their pay packets are now taking another hammering. It’s leaving millions of working people facing hardship and getting deeper into debt,” she said. It is the latest evidence of the incomes squeeze suffered by UK households in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, which triggered a sharp fall in the value of the pound, pushing up the costs of goods imported from abroad and feeding through to higher UK inflation and shop prices. Inflation was 2.6% in April, compared with just 0.7% in April 2016. It has since risen to 3% in September, the highest in almost five and a half years. Carole Easton, chief executive of Young Women’s Trust, said young people were being hit hard by the fall in real wages. “With wages falling and interest rates set to rise, young people – many of whom are not earning enough to cover the basics and are falling into debt – are at the sharp end,” she said. “It’s even harder for young women, who still face a significant gender pay gap. At the current rate of progress, the pay gap will still exist by the time today’s young women are retired.” Average gross weekly earnings for full-time workers, before adjusting for inflation, were £550 in April, up 2.2% from £539 in 2016. Pay rose 2.8% to £532 a week for private-sectors workers, and 0.9% to £599 for those working in the public sector."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/26/catalonia-crisis-deepens-president-carles-puigdemont-rules-out-snap-election","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T06:28:05Z","webTitle":"Spain poised to strip Catalan government of powers over independence push","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/26/catalonia-crisis-deepens-president-carles-puigdemont-rules-out-snap-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/26/catalonia-crisis-deepens-president-carles-puigdemont-rules-out-snap-election","fields":{"headline":"Spain poised to strip Catalan government of powers over independence push","bodyText":"Spanish lawmakers are poised to adopt extraordinary measures to seize control of some of Catalonia’s autonomous powers in an attempt to frustrate the region’s bid for independence, which has plunged the country into one of its worst political crises since Spain’s return to democracy four decades ago. The senate, where the prime minister Mariano Rajoy’s People’s party (PP) holds a majority, is scheduled to meet from 10am local time on Friday to vote on steps to depose Catalonia’s secessionist government before the week is out, after the region held a disputed independence referendum on 1 October. The Catalan parliament, where pro-secession parties hold sway, will also meet on Friday, in Barcelona, where it will consider a declaration of independence. Hopes of a possible solution to the Catalan independence crisis were dashed on Thursday evening after the regional president, Carles Puigdemont, ruled out a snap election, saying he could not offer fresh polls without a guarantee that the Spanish government would suspend its threat to impose direct rule. Despite intense speculation that he was planning to defuse the situation by announcing elections in return for a similar show of good faith from the PP, Puigdemont said it now would be up to the Catalan parliament to decide how to respond to Madrid’s unprecedented actions. “We have not received the necessary guarantees to justify holding elections,” he said in an address at the regional government palace in Barcelona on Thursday afternoon. “We have tried to get them but we have not had a responsible response from the PP and they have chosen to increase the tension. I have run out of options.” Puigdemont said that although Catalan society had done its best to remain calm in the face of the Spanish government’s threats, he would not tolerate its efforts to take control of the region. “The measures under 155 [the article of the constitution Spain is invoking against Catalonia] are illegal and unjust and I am not prepared to accept them,” he said. “No one can accuse me of not being willing to make sacrifices.” In a letter to the senate earlier on Thursday, Puigdemont argued that 155 did not give the central government a “blank cheque”, adding that its use would create “an even more serious, extraordinary situation” if Madrid seized Catalonia’s political autonomy. The Catalan leader has been under pressure from different factions within the region. Some had been urging him to cool tempers by announcing elections, while the main independence civil society groups and some of his coalition partners have called for an unambiguous declaration of independence. Reports earlier on Thursday that he was preparing to hold elections and abandon his pledge to declare independence brought a swift and angry response from many of his allies. The Catalan Republican Left (ERC) party, part of Puigdemont’s ruling coalition, said it would abandon the government if the president called elections. Gabriel Rufián, an ERC MP in Madrid, implied that Puigdemont had betrayed the independence movement, tweeting: “155 pieces of silver.” Adrià Alsina, the press secretary of the grassroots Catalan National Assembly, tweeted: “Frau, Fraude, Fraud.” Meanwhile, the far-left CUP party said it would not support elections, adding that the unilateral independence referendum held on 1 October had yielded a popular mandate. The uncertainty brought thousands of people, many of them students, into Plaça de Sant Jaume in central Barcelona to protest outside the government palace. Manel Llado, a 56-year-old administrator, had come to the rally after work as he was concerned that a unilateral declaration of independence was no longer a done deal. “A lot of people said Puigdemont betrayed us,” he said. “But it seems to me like a perfect government. I think this is a strategy to see what the central government will do: if they stop 155, they’ll call an election.” Marta Homs, 19, a student who was attending her first demonstration, said she wanted to ensure her voice was heard. “It’s a bit confusing,” she said. “I like to think Puigdemont knows what he’s doing. It’s the first time I’ve tried to believe a politician; usually I don’t trust them.” Another student, 18-year-old Jaume Cortasa, said the Madrid government and other opponents of independence had a clear strategy when it came to dealing with the Catalan question: “Whatever arguments you present them with, they’re going to continue rejecting them until they have something that suits them; until the independence-supporting parties are shut down.” Miquel Berga, a professor of English literature at Barcelona’s Pompeu Fabra University, said images of Catalans being beaten by Spanish police as they tried to vote in the unilateral independence referendum held on 1 October had been “a great asset for the fight to obtain a legal referendum on the issue”. But he added: “A unilateral declaration of independence, although it would bring an emotional release for many supporters, would supersede those powerful images, cause them to fade, and create more uncertainties and division in Catalonia.” On Thursday Spain’s economy minister, Luis de Guindos, said officials dispatched from Madrid to oversee the implementation of 155 could face resistance. He told Spanish radio: “I hope that [Catalan] civil servants, who are highly professional … will be conscious that any act against Catalan society will be negative.” Tensions between the governments in Madrid and Barcelona have risen to new heights following Puigdemont’s decision to defy Spain’s constitutional court by holding the referendum this month. Although Puigdemont signed a declaration of independence two weeks ago, he has proposed that its effects be suspended for two months to allow for talks. Rajoy has refused to engage in dialogue with Puigdemont until he abandons his independence plans and has said there can be no international mediation on a domestic, constitutional issue. On Wednesday, Rajoy said Puigdemont’s disregard for the constitution had left him with no choice but to invoke article 155. According to the regional government, 43% of Catalonia’s 5.3 million registered voters took part in the referendum on 1 October, but a further 770,000 votes were lost after Spanish police tried to halt the vote.

The CBI’s closely watched survey recorded a “steep drop” in retail sales in October. The slump sent shockwaves through the high street, with the CBI’s chief economist, Rain Newton-Smith, warning of a “softening” of demand as inflation ate into Britons’ spending power. Department stores and specialist food and drink outlets bore the brunt of the spending slowdown. “It’s clear retailers are beginning to really feel the pinch from higher inflation,” said Newton-Smith. “While retail sales can be volatile from month to month, the steep drop in sales in October echoes other recent data pointing to a marked softening in consumer demand.” The bleak snapshot of high street trading provided by the CBI – which also reported that orders placed with suppliers had dropped at the fastest rate since the spring of 2009 – came as Asda’s income tracker documented a slump in the spending power of average households. Kay Neufeld, an economist at the Cebr consultancy, which conducted the supermarket study, said: “We have seen family spending power decline in five out of the last six months, underlining the mounting pressures on households’ budgets.” London was the winner in the race for higher disposable incomes, Neufeld said, after household income in the capital rose by 2.4% compared with a national fall of 0.5%. But in all regions, incomes failed to rise by more than the current inflation rate of 3%. The findings chimed with official figures for the year to April 2017 that showed London’s income growth outstripping other regions, although the biggest gains were in inner London boroughs. Wages in outer London suburbs increased by 1.2%, compared with 4.4% in the centre of the city, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. The east Midlands and East Anglia were the only other regions where wages increased by more than the inflation rate in April, which stood at 2.6%. Further evidence of an income squeeze was provided by new research from Lloyds Bank, which found that women and families across the UK were “feeling the strain” of rising living costs. Based on a sample of its current account data, Lloyds said consumers’ essential spend – a figure that includes rent, bills, food and fuel costs – had increased by 2% in September versus a year ago. This was the 16th consecutive month of year-on-year growth. “When paying more for everyday items like food and fuel, people are faced with tricky decisions on where to cut back in other areas,” said Robin Bulloch, the managing director of Lloyds Bank, who said there was evidence of Britons staying away from the shops to avoid impulse purchases and cutting down on nights out. Almost two-thirds of the 2,000 people polled by Lloyds felt worried about current levels of inflation. The research found 56% of women felt under pressure to reduce their spending, compared with 47% of men. Families in particular were feeling the pinch, according to the survey, with 60% of those with children saying they felt under pressure to cut back, versus just 47% of those without children. The CBI said 50% of retailers polled for its survey suffered declining sales in October, while only 15% benefited from an increase, leaving a rounded balance of -36%, the lowest since March 2009. The CBI survey adds to the mixed economic signals to be considered by the Bank of England next week when it decides whether to increase interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. A rise could help keep inflation in check and strengthen the pound, but household borrowing costs would also grow. Uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the UK’s Brexit negotiations has also preyed on consumer confidence, which has declined sharply over the past 18 months and depressed spending. Figures estimating GDP growth in the third quarter showed the services sector holding up despite recent declines in wages adjusted for inflation. However, the retail sector recorded its slowest rate of growth in four years. Christmas has already begun on the high street, with novelty jumpers, crackers and mince pies decking the aisles. Many chains bank the lion’s share of annual profits in November and December, and retail bosses are battling for business after a tough year in which the weakness of sterling pushed up the cost of importing goods, squeezing profit margins. On Thursday, Debenhams said the pattern of trading was “volatile” as it reported a 44% dive in profits. The department store confirmed the closure of two stores, in Eltham, south London, and Farnborough, Hampshire, affecting about 80 jobs. They are the first of up to 10 UK branches that Debenhams has earmarked for closure. Retailers are all trimming back their high street presence as shoppers shift from flicking through the rails in stores to perusing their phones and tablet computers at home or on the bus. The likes of Marks &amp; Spencer, Mothercare and all the major supermarkets have closed stores while investing in their online operations. The retail sector employs around 3 million people, but store groups are slashing jobs and working hours as shoppers batten down the hatches and sales move online. There was a “record” reduction in retail jobs in the last quarter, according to the British Retail Consortium, with the number of hours worked in retail down by 4.2% and the total number of store workers falling by 3%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/26/bt-to-slash-landline-charges-for-1m-customers","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T08:30:31Z","webTitle":"BT to slash landline charges for 1 million customers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/26/bt-to-slash-landline-charges-for-1m-customers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/26/bt-to-slash-landline-charges-for-1m-customers","fields":{"headline":"BT to slash landline charges for 1 million customers","bodyText":"BT is to slash the amount it charges a million landline-only customers by more than a third, saving them £84 a year, after Ofcom criticised telecom providers for overcharging those - mostly the elderly - who do not have broadband or TV packages. The company will slash the monthly cost of line rental for its landline-only customers by £7 a month to £11.99 from April next year, following a scathing review by the regulator, which highlighted the “poor value” for money subscribers get compared with those who buy bundles including TV and broadband. Ofcom said it stepped in because bills for landline-only customers – nearly two-thirds of whom are over 65 – have “soared” in recent years despite BT and other landline providers benefiting from significant cuts in the cost of providing the service. “For many people, their landline is their lifeline,” said Jonathan Oxley, Ofcom’s competition group director. “But households who only have a landline – and no broadband – have seen their phone bills soar. Many are elderly, and have been with BT for decades. We’ve been clear that they must get a better deal.” Ofcom has focused on BT because it accounts for two-thirds of the UK’s 1.5m landline-only customers, but it expects rivals who similarly overcharge their customers to follow suit. “This position [of dominance] has allowed BT to increase prices without much risk of losing customers, and other providers have followed BT’s pricing lead,” said Ofcom. “We expect BT’s £7 price cut to mean other providers can follow suit.” Ofcom said that over three-quarters of BT’s landline-only customers have never switched provider, which has left them a prime target for price rises. The regulator said that all major landline providers have increased their line rental charges by between 23% and 47% in recent years, while their own costs for providing the service have fallen about 27%. Ofcom said it is also looking at measures to help people shop around for better deals with more confidence. “We will continue to keep a close eye on the market, to ensure BT’s actions address the problems we have identified,” said Ofcom. “If we have any concerns about consumers or competition, we will consider the need for further intervention.” The price cut, which will automatically be appiled to the accounts of 800,000 BT customers, will apply for three years from April. A further 200,000 customers on BT’s “Home Phone Saver” package will also be eligible but will have to apply. “We welcome a balanced voluntary agreement with Ofcom,” said BT. “We have listened to the concerns of our line-only customers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/26/young-marx-review-the-bridge-theatre-london-rory-kinnear","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T21:00:11Z","webTitle":"Young Marx review – farce, family and finances but not quite the full Marx","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/26/young-marx-review-the-bridge-theatre-london-rory-kinnear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/26/young-marx-review-the-bridge-theatre-london-rory-kinnear","fields":{"headline":"Young Marx review – farce, family and finances but not quite the full Marx","bodyText":"Given the abundance of theatre in London, is the opening of this new playhouse a Bridge too far? Not at all. As the first wholly commercial theatre to be built in the capital in 80 years, it makes an instantly good impression. Costing £12.5m, it occupies a prime site on the south bank of the Thames, and has a large, welcoming foyer and a flexible 900-seat auditorium with excellent sightlines. Even the ticket prices, ranging from £15 to £65, are reasonable by today’s standards. The declared policy of the theatre’s founders, Nicholas Hytner and Nick Starr, is to focus primarily on new plays. That inevitably carries an element of risk, but they kick off with a pugnacious comedy by Richard Bean and Clive Coleman that, invoking the name of Marx, attempts to synthesise the spirits of Karl and Groucho. Mention Karl Marx and most of us think of Das Kapital and that massive leonine bust in Highgate cemetery. But Bean and Coleman focus on Marx as he was in 1850: a 32-year-old German Jew living in penurious exile on Soho’s Dean Street with his wife, Jenny, their children and a devoted maid. Hounded by creditors, harried by the police and at odds with many of his fellow revolutionaries, Marx largely survives through the beneficence of his friend, Friedrich Engels. The play is out to demystify Marx, and in this it is largely successful. The Marx we meet is devious, quick-witted and funny. Describing his wedding to the aristocratic Jenny von Westphalen, he says: “It was a traditional Prussian affair – military uniforms, guard of honour, firing squad.” He and Engels also suggest their complicity by falling into the rhythmic patterns of a music-hall double act. For all his acts of casual cruelty to a wife he deeply loves, Marx emerges as a boisterous father, a natural life-enhancer and a bit of a piss artist, whose aim is to have a pint in every pub in Tottenham Court Road. At one point, however, Engels reproachfully says to Marx: “I write down what I see. I’m a beta-plus. You’re an alpha, a bona fide genius, you prick.” I wish the play gave us more evidence of that genius. There’s a powerful scene when Marx passionately argues that revolution in Britain will come through an economic crash rather than through acts of random violence. When Marx finds metonymic meaning in a breakfast sausage and goes on to claim there will come a time when Christmas is “a week-long festival of commodification”, the audience is roused to sympathetic applause. But while the play is clearly designed to humanise Marx, it undersells his ferocious activism which, even in 1850, included giving courses of lectures on “What is bourgeois property?”, assisting German political refugees and beavering away in the British Museum reading back numbers of the Economist. Hytner’s production and Mark Thompson’s design are faithful to the play’s farcical structure, with much hiding in cupboards and chasing over rooftops. Rory Kinnear also catches very well the ambivalence of Marx, the political visionary who is also a shameless sponger and the radical dreamer haunted by self-doubt. Engels is actually the more sympathetic figure, and Oliver Chris plays him as an obliging cash cow with a genuine rage against poverty. Nancy Carroll as the put-upon Jenny, Laura Elphinstone as the tragically devoted maid and Tony Jayawardena as a bumptious quack give excellent support. But while I enjoyed the evening, I felt that Bean and Coleman, in underplaying the hero’s piercing analysis of capitalist contradiction, had not quite given us the full Marx. • At the Bridge, London, until 31 December.

Here’s a quick recap of the main events. The European Central Bank has halved its asset purchase stimulus programme, to €30bn per month, for another nine months. But the ECB also left little doubt that it intends to keep buying bonds for even longer than announced today, in an attempt to get inflation. The euro has fallen following the announcement. In the UK, a gloomy retail report has raised new fears over the strength of the recovery. The CBI reported that retail sales were falling at the fastest pace since 2009 this month. Economists say the survey shows that consumers are being forced to cut back, due to rising inflation and economic uncertainty. Britain’s car industry is also struggling. Production fell by 4% in September, mainly due to a sharp decline in domestic demand. Barclays is having its worst day since the day after the EU referendum. Shares are down by 7.5% today, after it reported a decline in earnings at its investment banking arm. And Britain’s pay gap has also narrowed, to 9.1%. But it’s not shrinking fast enough, with experts warning it will take ‘decades’ to eliminate at the current rate... That’s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, has a good take on Mario Draghi’s comments: “This is softly, softly tapering. William McChesney Martin, a previous Fed Chairman, once said that the job of the Fed was ‘to take away the punchbowl just as the party gets going.’ The ECB certainly isn’t taking away the punchbowl, Mr Draghi is saying that so long everyone keeps having a good time they plan to put less punch in.” Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says: “Ten years on from the financial crash, the era of quantitative easing is yet to run its course in Europe. Draghi confirmed that the bond buying programme would be tapered, but it has hardly come to an end. This slow, steady and widely predicted approach hopes to rein in the Euro from rising further, which is limiting the earnings capacity of European exporters, at the same time as avoiding a European taper tantrum in the markets. Whether one can be achieved without the other remains to be seen. Paul Rayner, Head of Government Bonds at Royal London Asset Management, agrees that the European Central Bank’s QE programme will continue for some time: In our view, the tightening of European monetary policy will continue be a very gradual process, with further comments made today that there are no plans for a cliff-edge end to the bond purchase programme. As Mario Draghi himself put it during today’s press conference, the reinvestment of principal payments will be ‘massive’, and it’s worth remembering that despite the squeeze on liquidity entering the markets, the ECB will still be buying €30 billion per month. Viktor Nossek, Director of Research at asset management firm WisdomTree, predicts that bond prices could suffer from the ECB’s decision: “Investors in Europe should consider hedging their fixed income exposures, now that the ECB is cutting back asset purchases from the start of 2018. “German bunds could now be in the firing line, as the cut back could spark a taper tantrum in Europe. Mario Draghi has done a good job of talking down the euro too. The single currency has now shed one cent against the US dollar to $1.172, a three-week low. Traders have clearly got the message that the ECB’s bond-buying programme remains ‘open-ended’, and that it has not intention of raising interest rates any time soon. That was a pretty dovish performance from Mario Draghi. An effective performance too, as the ECB president makes it clear that he expects maintain loose monetary policy for some time, despite the economic recovery. Here are the key points: 1) The European Central Bank has halved the pace of its bond-buying asset purchase programme. From January, it will only buy €30bn of government and corporate bonds each month, down from €60bn, for at least the next nine months. 2) But..... this doesn’t mean that the ECB’s QE programme is on borrowed time. President Draghi has insisted that today’s decision is not ‘tapering’, meaning the Bank expects to keep buying bonds beyond September 2018. This was perhaps the key quote: The decision today is for an open-ended programme ... it’s not going to stop suddenly. The large majority of the Governing Council expresses a preference for keeping it open-ended. There is still a large amount of uncertainty, so it was only prudent. So while the ECB has taken a step towards ending its ultra-loose monetary stance, we’re not there yet.... 3) Draghi was upbeat about the recovery in the eurozone recovery, pointing out (twice) that seven million jobs have been created in the last four years. He declared that: “The latest data and survey results point to unabated growth momentum in the second half of this year.” Today’s governing council was held in a positive atmosphere, he added. All the members mentioned growth momentum, improving employment ...investment is actually picking up. The earning capacity of households is picking up, so disposable income is increasing. 4) But the ECB still sees ‘muted’ inflation pressures. That’s why it intends to keep pumping euros into the economy through its asset purchase scheme. “Domestic price pressures are still muted overall and theeconomic outlook and the path of inflation remain conditional oncontinued support from monetary policy. Therefore, an ampledegree of monetary stimulus remains necessary.” 5) On geopolitics, Draghi said the ECB was watching developments in Catalonia very closely. “It is very difficult to comment on developments that change every day. We are following what is happening ... to conclude now that there will be instability is premature.” Q: Last year, when the ECB cut QE from €80bn to €60bn per month, you insisted that you weren’t ‘tapering’ your bond buying programme. So is today’s announcement tapering? No, Draghi replies. That underlines how the programme is likely to keep running beyond next September (but possibly at a lower rate than €30bn per month). And that’s the end of the press conference. Draghi’s insistence that QE is ‘open-ended’ is fuelling speculation that the ECB could keep buying government bonds until 2019. And that would mean interest rates could remain at their current record lows until 2020! Q: If the eurozone recovery turns out to be stronger than you expect, might you reduce the pace of the asset purchase scheme? This is today’s decision, Draghi shoots back, adding “This is our commitment, we don’t foresee changes now.” Q: The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates 15 months after ending its bond-purchase programme - might the ECB take a similar approach? We don’t have a fixed timeframe, Draghi replies. Comparisons with other jurisdictions aren’t really appropriate. Q: What might happen to the ECB’s stimulus programme after September 2018? Mario Draghi says the programme is “open-ended”, meaning it won’t suddenly stop buying bonds next October. That will probably reassure the markets, who have developed a taste for very loose monetary policy and don’t want the ECB’s punch bowl to run dry. Q: Is political uncertainty in Catalonia a risk to financial stability in Spain, and in the euro area at a whole? Mario Draghi says the ECB is following developments with “great attention”, but it is “very difficult to comment on developments that change every day”. To conclude now that there will be financial stability risks would be premature. We have to see what will happen.... Q: Why has the ECB decided to keep expanding its asset purchase programme, at a time when the US Federal Reserve is cutting its own QE scheme? Draghi doesn’t accept the suggestion that the ECB is wrong to keep buying bonds. The US recovery is “way more advanced” than in the eurozone, meaning Europe’s inflation outlook is “way behind”, he says firmly. Some reaction to Draghi’s comments: Q: Was today’s decision unanimous? No, there were different viewpoints, Draghi replies. He says there was a “broad consensus on several issues, and a large majority on other issues.” Q: How did the ECB go about preparing the public for today’s changes? My understanding is that the market reaction was pretty muted, Draghi replies, even though the policy announcement was fairly important. That shows that our communication was pretty effective. Draghi says there are global factors influencing inflation...but the ECB is focused on the factors closer to home, which it can influence. He points out that the eurozone has created more than seven million jobs in the last four years - a sign that his policies are bearing fruit. Draghi is hammering home that the ECB will continue to reinvest the stock of existing assets bought under QE since 2015. This has become “more and more important” as we’ve bought “a lot of bonds” smiles Draghi: The ECB has bought something like two trillion euros of bonds since it plunged into QE in 2015. Draghi’s point is that the programme will still have a major impact on the economy, as the ECB plans to buy new bonds when its existing holdings mature. So there are no plans to start cutting the size of the programme - something the US Federal Reserve is just starting to do. Q: Did you discuss alternative courses of action, before deciding to cut the pace of the APP to €30bn per month? No, says Draghi. The “atmosphere was pretty positive” at today’s meeting, thanks to the increase in employment across the eurozone and rising wages. The discussion thus ‘converged’ on the idea of halving the pace of the QE programme, and running for at least another nine months, although there were “some differences” about the details. Onto questions. Q: Did the ECB discuss changing the composition of the assets bought under your stimulus programme? No, Draghi replies. But the press get more details later today on how the asset purchase programme will evolve, and re-invest its assets (as bonds mature) Mario Draghi then issues his tradition call on eurozone politicians to do better. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy, other parties must also act, he says. That includes “substantially” speeding up the implementation of structural reforms in “all eurozone countries”. Draghi also calls for “more growth-friendly” fiscal politics across the eurozone. Economic growth in the eurozone continued “unabated”, declares Draghi proudly. He says there has been an upswing in business investment. Construction investment has also improved, and eurozone exports are benefitting from the improved picture in the global economy. But.... there are also downside risks, Draghi continues, including ‘global factors’ and ‘foreign exchange’ effects (ie, the recent strengthening of the euro). Draghi is talking about how the ECB has ‘recalibrated’ its bond-purchase programme. Turning to the economic picture, Draghi says that domestic prices pressures are still muted. Thus, “continued monetary policy support” is needed to underpin the economic outlook and keep inflation on track. Mario Draghi begins by telling reporters that his governing council conducted a “thorough” analysis of the outlook for inflation in the eurozone today. Draghi confirms that the ECB decided to leave interest rates at their current record low, and expects to leave borrowing costs at these levels for an extended period. He also confirms that the ECB will maintain its QE programme for another nine months, at a pace of €30bn per month, “or beyond if necessary”. The ECB stands ready to increase the asset purchase programme in terms of size and or duration if needed, he adds. Speaking particularly crisply, Draghi concludes: Today’s monetary policy decisions were taken to preserve the very favourable financing conditions that are still needed for a sustained return of inflation to levels that are close to, but below 2%. Over in Frankfurt, ECB president Mario Draghi is explaining today’s decisions to the press pack. You can watch it live here: Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, reckons the ECB was right to maintain its QE programme for another nine months. She writes: “The Euro area recovery is certainly becoming more entrenched, with broad-based growth across countries and sectors of the economy. The euro strength seen so far is unlikely to derail the growth story or pave way for a return of deflationary worries. At the same time, however, given the remaining slack in the labour market, inflation is far below the target and is likely to rise only at a very sluggish pace. Stupnytska adds that the ECB will be concerned that the Catalan independence crissi could have a “non-negligible” impact on growth. German conservative MEP Markus Ferber has heavily criticised the ECB’s decision to extend its stimulus programme. Ferber argues that there’s no justification for buying tens of billions of government and corporate bonds each month, with newly created money. Ferber says: “The Eurozone is growing strongly, inflation is picking up, and downside risks are minimal. It seems like the textbook case for the right time to phase out quantitative easing and start a normalisation of monetary policy. Instead the ECB locks in their flawed monetary policy approach for the months to come and defers normalisation indefinitely. I am disappointed that the ECB missed yet another chance to initialise a normalisation of monetary policy. The asset purchasing program will keep distorting the market and lays the foundations for the next crisis.” The euro has dropped by half a cent against the US dollar since the ECB announcement, to $1.176. That suggests that some traders had expected a more dramatic cut to the Bank’s stimulus programme. In theory, the ECB could have decided to buy even fewer bonds per month, or only extended the QE programme by another six months, rather than nine. My colleague Richard Partington tweets: Danske Bank have helpfully summarised today’s ECB statement: BREAKING: The European Central Bank has slowed the pace of its stimulus programme. From January 2018, the ECB will buy €30bn of new bonds each month -- that’s down from €60bn per month at present. The ECB’s governing council has decided to continue this quantitative easing programme for at least another nine months - or longer if needed. That means the ECB has taken another step towards ending the era of ultra-loose monetary policy. The ECB says: From January 2018 the net asset purchases are intended to continue at a monthly pace of €30 billion until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the APP [Asset Purchase Programme] in terms of size and/or duration. The ECB has also left borrowing costs unchanged. That means the headline eurozone interest rate remains at 0.0%, and banks face a negative interest rate of -0.4% for leaving money in the central bank’s vaults. Details and reaction to follow! After a busy morning, City traders are now turning their attention to Frankfurt. The European Central Bank is poised to announce the decisions taken at today’s governing council meeting. We’re expecting the ECB to leave interest rates at their record lows, but also outline how it could slow its bond-buying programme (our opening blogpost has more details). The decision comes at 12.45pm BST, followed by a press conference with president Mario Draghi at 1.30pm. Labour MP Anneliese Dodds, who represents Oxford East, tweets: In other bad news...the Unite union in Northern Ireland has warned that aerospace company Bombardier is planning to cut 280 jobs at its Belfast plant. Bombardier faces legal action in the United States from rival Boeing over the development of the C-Series jet. Boeing alleges its Canadian competitor has been receiving unfair state subsidies to build the new plane. Unite point out however that only last month Bombardier announced a new business partnership with Airbus. Davy Thompson, Unite’s regional co-ordinating officer said today: “The jobs to be lost are functional as opposed to operational meaning losses will be concentrated outside the main production lines but this will be devastating news for the workers concerned and their families in the run-up to the end of the year. Unite is calling on management to review this decision. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says UK retailers will be hoping the Bank of England doesn’t raise interest rates at its November meeting: These latest numbers from the CBI will only add to the mixed economic signals to be digested by the Bank of England next week when it decides whether to increase interest rates for the first time in over a decade. Retailers will breathe a sigh of relief if the bank chooses not to increase rates and further burden consumers with additional mortgage costs, at a time when they are already feeling a bit of a pinch. As we enter the key Christmas trading period, the retail industry is desperately in need of some festive cheer. If you’re just tuning in, here’s our news story on the retail sales figures: The fastest monthly fall in high street sales since the height of the recession in 2009 has raised fears for the retail sector ahead of the crucial Christmas trading period. A survey by the the CBI found that 50% of retailers suffered declining sales in September while only 15% benefited from an increase, leaving a rounded balance of -36%, the lowest since March 2009. The business lobby group said the survey showed retailers were “feeling the pinch” from rising inflation, which has eaten into consumer incomes and squeezed profit margins. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI chief economist, said: “While retail sales can be volatile from month to month, the steep drop in sales in October echoes other recent data pointing to a marked softening in consumer demand.” The gloomy CBI survey came as Debenhams warned of an “uncertain” environment on the high street in the run up to Christmas after suffering a 44% dive in profits. The department store confirmed the closure of two stores, in Eltham, south London, and at Farnborough, Hampshire, affecting about 80 jobs, as sales on the high street continue to fall. They are the first of up to 10 UK branches that Debenhams has earmarked for closure.... More here: Debenhams, the UK department store chain, has added to the uncertainty in the UK retail sector today. It reported a 44% slide in pre-tax profits at the company over the last 12 months, and warned that the retail environment is challenging. Sergio Bucher, CEO, says: The environment remains uncertain and we face tough comparatives over the key Christmas weeks. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, says Britain’s cost of living squeeze is hurting the retail sector: “These results are definitely worrying for retailers as they are clearly starting to feel the impact of inflation. “This survey doesn’t cover the whole market, however it could be a good indication that consumers are being more wary in the run up to Christmas and aren’t willing to part with the shiny new pounds in their pocket quite as quickly as before. Wages aren’t rising in line with the inflation which could be one reason why sales are down. “In the run up to Christmas it’s important people don’t overspend and stick to a tight budget, however after the results of this survey businesses will be counting on us splashing out at Christmas.” The news that UK retailers suffered an October sales slide could weigh on sterling. The pound has lost almost half a cent today, to $1.322. It’s also down 0.3% against the euro at €1.119. Consumer spending has been a key driver of UK growth this year. Thus, today’s retail slowdown may worry Bank of England policymakers, who must decide whether to raise interest rates next week. ‘Non-specialist’ goods shops, such as department stores, suffered the brunt of the spending slowdown this month. Britons also cut back on furniture and carpets, in another sign that consumers are reining in their spending. Here’s the details: The CBI says: Sales volumes expanded in other normal goods (74%), recreational goods (+64%) and hardware &amp; DIY (43%). Meanwhile, sales volumes decreased in specialist food &amp; drink (-32%) and non-specialised goods (i.e. department stores (-45%). Economist Sam Tombs of Pantheon has been forced to redraw his graph to capture the tumble in retail sales this month! The decline in UK retail sales shows that consumers are cutting back, says Howard Archer of the EY Item Club. It’s a bad sign for growth.... Today’s CBI retail sales report is much weaker than the City expected. Analysts had expected a majority of firms to report rising sales. So the news that only 15% of retailers are seeing a pick-up in demand, while 50% are suffering a decline, is a worry. Here’s the details of the retail sales slump: BREAKING: UK retail sales have suffered their sharpest monthly decline since the financial crisis. That’s according to the CBI’s monthly survey of the UK retail sector. It found that just 15% of retailers reported that sales volumes were up in October on a year ago, whilst 50% said they were down. That gives a rounded balance of -36%, the worst reading since March 2009 - when Britain had fallen into recession after the financial crisis. Firms reported that sales were below average for the time of year. Suppliers have also been hit -- with orders dropping at the fastest rate since March 2009. Here are the key findings from the report: 15% of retailers said that sales volumes were up in October on a year ago, whilst 50% said they were down, giving a rounded balance of -36%. This significantly undershot expectations (+23%), and was the steepest fall in sales volumes since March 2009 (-44%), during the financial crisis 14% of respondents expect sales volumes to increase next month, with 12% expecting a decrease, giving a rounded balance of +3% 14% of retailers placed more orders with suppliers than they did a year ago, whilst 57% placed fewer orders, giving a balance of -43%. This was the fastest decline since March 2009 (-47%) Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, blames the cost of living squeeze, due to the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote. “It’s clear retailers are beginning to really feel the pinch from higher inflation. While retail sales can be volatile from month to month, the steep drop in sales in October echoes other recent data pointing to a marked softening in consumer demand. The survey only covers 106 firms, including 49 retailers, so it needs treating with some caution. But such a sharp decline is certainly worth noting... Deep cuts in inward migration from other EU countries after Brexit would seriously hit Scotland’s economy, the Scottish government has warned, after new projections showed it would lead to a fall in the country’s working age population. New data from the National Records of Scotland published on Thursday shows all future population growth depends on continued inward migration from the rest of the UK and overseas, because birthrates are projected to fall while numbers of pensionable adults to increase by 25% by 2041. Based on existing trends, the NRS, a government agency that monitors population figures, said Scotland’s population will rise from 5.40 million in 2016 to 5.58 million in 2026 – an increase entirely due to net inwards migration. By 2041, Scotland will have 1.32m pensioners, it said, but the number of working Scots would rise by just 1%. In a separate paper, the NRS also modelled the impact of a 50% cut in EU inwards migration, and said that would cut a population rise to 4%, while an end to EU migration would see Scotland’s population peak in 2032 and decline afterwards. Under that scenario, Scotland’s wage-earning population would fall by 3%. The NRS made clear these figures were illustrative and not official data (a distinction the Scottish government’s press release did not highlight) but Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish culture and external affairs secretary, said they underlined “the critical importance of maintaining inward migration to Scotland.” Hyslop said: “The stark reality outlined in today’s figures is that projected growth in Scotland’s population will slow significantly if levels of EU migration are reduced. And in that scenario the population is also predicted to start declining again within the next 25 years. “That would have a significant negative impact on Scotland’s economy and our ability to fund the public services we will need for an ageing population.” Britain’s gender pay gap remains too high, and is falling too slowly, says TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady. Here’s her take on today’s pay figures: “The full-time gender pay gap has inched a bit smaller. But there is still a chasm between men and women’s earnings. “At this rate it’ll take decades for women to get paid the same as men. “The government needs to crank up the pressure on employers. Companies shouldn’t just be made to publish their gender pay gaps. They should be forced to explain how they’ll close them. “And those bosses who flout the law should be fined.” Good news! Britain’s gender pay gap has hit its lowest level in at least two decades. Bad news! Women are still being paid over 9% less than men. That’s according to the latest Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings from the Office for National Statistics. It found that the gender pay gap for full-time staff dropped to 9.1% in the year to April, down from 9.4%. That’s the lowest level since the survey began in 1997, as this chart shows: It’s illegal to pay a woman less than a man for doing the same job. But still, the gender pay gap persists. The ONS says there are several reasons, including: more women work in lower-paid jobs or sectors women are more likely to work part-time, which can mean a lower rate of pay women are under-represented in senior roles -this may be due to attitudes about gender roles, lack of flexible working or women taking time to look after their family It also varies widely between different industries and jobs. Assemblers and metal workers see the biggest pay gap, and there’s also a sharp difference for senior roles like financial managers, directors, and CEOs. Brexit is a particular worry to the UK auto industry because components typically cross the channel several times before a car finally rolls off the production line. The Financial Times did a good piece on this last year, pointing out that the bumper for a new Bentley could be made in Europe, checked in Crewe, painted in Germany, and then assembled in Britain. A fuel injector built by US component maker Delphi, used in diesel lorries, takes a similarly long trip.... The FT’s Peter Campbell explained: This part uses steel from Europe which is machined in the UK before going to Germany for special heat treatment. The injector is then assembled at Delphi’s UK plant in Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, before being sold on to truckmakers based in Sweden, France or Germany. If the resulting truck is sold into the UK market, the component or materials used in it will have crossed the Channel five times before the lorry is ever driven by the customer. If tariffs are applied at each stage, the cost could be substantial. Getting back to cars, here’s a table showing how Britain’s factories churned out 4% fewer vehicles in September. Barclays CEO Jes Staley won’t enjoy today’s share price fall.... and he won’t get much relief from browsing through today’s analyst notes either. Investment bank Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods are particularly cutting, following the drop in Barclay’s investment bank income. Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown agrees that Q3 ‘wasn’t a pretty quarter’ for Barclays International, adding: Litigation still remains a risk for Barclays, with more than 20 separate investigations ongoing, not least one relating to CEO Jes Staley’s attempt to uncover a whisteblower in his own ranks..... After making some good progress, Barclays appears to be stalling somewhat and it’s now touch and go whether the bank will break even in 2017.

Barclays have fallen by 7%, on track for their worst daily fall since the EU referendum in June 2016. Barclay’s investment bank is going through a bad time - income from trading bonds, foreign exchange and commodities shrank by 14%, partly down to the decline in market volatility. CEO Jes Staley says: The third quarter was clearly a difficult one for our Markets business within Barclays International. A lack of volume and volatility in FICC [Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities] hit Markets revenues hard across the industry, and we were no exception to this trend. Overall, Barclays grew its pre-tax profits by 19% over the last nine months, to £3.44bn. Staley says he has now turned Barclays into a “Transatlantic Consumer and Wholesale Bank”. It’s made up of Barclays UK and Barclays International (mainly the investment bank), following the sale of various international assets including Barclay’s Africa division. The City, though, doesn’t seem impressed.... Today’s drop in UK car production is the fourth blow to the auto industry in recent weeks. We’ve also seen that: Car sales have fallen for six months running, including a 9% drop in September Vauxhall is cutting 400 jobs at its Ellesmere Port plant, after seeing falling demand for the Astra Pendragon, the leading car dealership group, issued a profits warning after suffering a sharp fall in demand and falling prices. Inchcape, the new and used car dealer, has also warned that Britain’s car sector is deteriorating. In its latest financial results, released this morning, it says: UK market slowing, as expected, resulting in continuing margin pressure on vehicles. In other words, we’re buying fewer cars, forcing dealers to cut prices to get a sale. The storm clouds gathering over Britain’s car industry have darkened this morning, after manufacturers suffered a sharp fall in production. Output shrank by 4.1% in September, new figures from the motor industry show. Alarmingly, domestic demand tumbled by 14.2%, while there was also a 1.1% decline in production for exports. In total, 6,500 fewer cars were produced last month than in September 2016. That has helped to drag production during 2017 down by 2.2%: Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, says the industry is suffering from falling confidence - and a government clampdown on diesel cars. Hawes says the industry’s big fear is that Britain leaves the EU without a deal, which would disrupt the car industry’s ability to buy and sell cars and components across the channel. “With UK car manufacturing falling for a fifth month this year, it’s clear that declining consumer and business confidence is affecting domestic demand and hence production volumes. Uncertainty regarding the national air quality plans also didn’t help the domestic market for diesel cars, despite the fact that these new vehicles will face no extra charges or restrictions across theUK. Brexit is the greatest challenge of our times and yet we still don’t have any clarity on what our future relationship with our biggest trading partner will look like, nor detail of the transitional deal being sought. Leaving the EU with no deal would be the worst outcome for our sector so we urge government to deliver on its commitments and safeguard the competitiveness of the industry.” These disappointing figures come a day after Japanese manufacturer Toyota urged the government to raise the ‘fog’ of Brexit uncertainty. City analyst Simon French of Panmure Gordon points out that car production has gone into reverse in other countries too...... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. All eyes will be on the European Central Bank today, as the eurozone’s top central bankers meet to set monetary policy. And it could be a red letter day, with the ECB likely to turn down the gas on its money-printing programme. With Europe’s economy firing on all cylinders, the ECB is likely to decide to cut the pace of its bond-buying stimulus scheme, which is currently creating €60bn of new money each month. But, inflation is still below target, so the ECB won’t feel under pressure to slam the brakes. Instead, it will probably cut the pace of quantitative easing...but by how much? No-one’s really sure, so prepare for drama when ECB chief Mario Draghi reveals how he plans to slow, or ‘taper’, the stimulus plan. Financial group PNC predicts that the ECB will lop €15bn off its QE programme, and keep buying government and corporate bonds until next autumn. They say: We expect a reduction in monthly asset purchases to perhaps €45 billion euros in January from the current €60 billion. The ECB will probably refrain from a firm commitment to an end-date for its program at tomorrow’s decision; we expect purchases to continue until at least the third quarter of 2018. Draghi’s challenge is to avoid alarming the markets, sparking a crash in bond prices or a surge in the euro. Capital Economics say he must strike a delicate balance: Following the numerous signals from President Draghi and colleagues over recent months, the market is well primed for some form of taper announcement. But there is still a delicate balance to strike. Taper too quickly and the markets might worry that the ECB’s historically hawkish instincts – typified by the premature (and subsequently reversed) interest rate hikes of 2011 – may be resurfacing. One obvious consequence could be an undesirable rise in the euro. But too tentative a move could fuel concerns that the ECB has little confidence in the economic outlook and the effectiveness of its previous policy measures. European stock markets are expected to rise a little, while traders wait for the ECB’s announcement at lunchtime. Also today....

Frances Adamson, the secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, told senators on Thursday that Adani may have requested the letter to help it secure funding from the Chinese. Adamson said the letter was signed by the minister for trade, Steve Ciobo, and the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce. It was addressed to the National Development and Reform Commission in China. Australia’s big four banks have all ruled out lending to the Carmichael coalmine project. Last week, the Adani Group promoted a bizarre video advertisement on Facebook in which it responded to revelations its Australian coal operations faced growing financial risks. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, asked if the letter was sent at Adani’s request, and the attorney general, George Brandis, said he didn’t know. But he admitted the government had made the representation to China “to dispel the misinformation campaign of those from the radical left”. “The Australian government continues to welcome foreign investment that is in our national interest, including the Adani investment in the Carmichael mine project,” Brandis said. Adamson said the letter was probably generated from a request from the Indian mining giant but she’d have to confirm later. “My interpretation of what would have happened is the Adani company will have themselves been assessing how they can fund the project [and] in the course of that assessment they’ve looked at a range of different sources and I think what they did was request a statement of fact, if you like, from the Australian government which the Australian government, given its support for the project, ministers were happy to provide,” she told the Senate estimates hearing. “It was a statement of fact, where the project is up to, and a statement of endorsement, or support, by the Australian government.” She said the letter had not been written by anyone in her department. She denied claims Australian diplomats had been masquerading as financial brokers seeking foreign backing for the project. “It’s not Dfat’s role to seek finance for the project,” she said. The progressive thinktank The Australia Institute had used freedom of information laws to seek documents from Dfat and was told Dfat had “several hundreds of pages” relating to formal representations to foreign financiers. Adamson said on Thursday the volume of documents to be reviewed did not imply a significant amount of departmental activity. Senator Nick Xenophon asked if it was unusual for Australia’s deputy PM and trade minister to write letters to a foreign government agency, rather than to their equivalent ministers, of the kind in question. Adamson said she did not think it was unusual. Adani claims the project will create 10,000 direct and indirect jobs in central Queensland, but that figure has been pilloried by the Australia Institute. The mine’s fate is also resting on a $1bn government loan for a rail line to the Carmichael mine, a decision that is in the hands of the independent Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund (Naif). Brandis said he understood that the Naif had not yet decided to lend money to Adani.

The Democratic party has instead been relegated to watching from the sidelines as Donald Trump continues to flout institutional norms, often choosing to govern in 140 characters or less. In an ordinary political climate, Democrats would seem well positioned to make Trump a one-term president. And yet one year after the election, the party remains in search of a leader. But that’s not to say Democrats are without options as they look ahead to 2020. While there’s no clear frontrunner to claim the mantle – and responsibility – of the next presidential nominee, a long list of potential contenders is emerging as the Democratic party seeks to dethrone Trump. John Delaney Title US representative of Maryland’s sixth congressional district Age 54 The only Democrat formally running is the one you’ve never heard of. The low-key congressman from Maryland announced his candidacy in July in a Washington Post op-ed, complete with the campaign slogan “Focus on the Future”. Delaney is a long shot, to say the least: an early New Hampshire poll focused on possible hopefuls found Delaney with less than 1% support – proving he’ll have to rise a long way from political obscurity. Bernie Sanders Title US senator from Vermont (an independent who has caucused with the Democrats) Age 76 Hillary Clinton confessed to underestimating Sanders’ insurgent candidacy during the 2016 Democratic primary. Now party operatives believe the Vermont senator may be gearing up for another run. Sanders remains broadly popular with the American public, and his Medicare-for-All bill has been widely endorsed by Democrats, including potential challengers. Joe Biden Title Former vice-president Age 74 Biden’s regret over not running in 2016 is well known, even though his two past bids, in 1987 and 2007, failed. But while the party could rely on the former vice-president’s appeal to white, working class voters, a Biden candidacy would reinforce the notion that Democrats lack new blood. He nonetheless said: “I haven’t decided to run. But I’ve decided I’m not going to decide not to run. We’ll see what happens.” Elizabeth Warren Title US senator from Massachusetts Age 68 Arguably the most prominent progressive apart from Sanders, Warren has made moves signaling a possible run. She has met with donors, rallied activists and published a book this year about saving America’s middle class. Warren is also a vocal Trump critic who gets under the president’s skin – a preview of what could be if she runs in three years. Cory Booker Title US senator from New Jersey Age 48 A top contender for Hillary Clinton’s running mate, Booker has held a national profile since serving as the mayor of Newark, New Jersey, often arriving at the scene of a problem to help constituents on the ground. Since his arrival in the Senate, he has made criminal justice reform a core tenet of his agenda and is known for his soaring oratory. Martin O’Malley Title Former governor of Maryland Age 54 In the 2016 presidential race, O’Malley struggled to break through amid a Democratic primary waged primarily between Clinton and Sanders. The former Maryland governor nonetheless said he “just might” run again in 2020 and even returned to must-win New Hampshire this year. Supporters believe O’Malley’s reliably progressive record speaks for itself. Mitch Landrieu Title Mayor of New Orleans Age 57 Seen by many as a dark horse candidate, Mitch Landrieu was relatively unknown on the national stage until the aftermath of the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August. After a white supremacist drove his car into counter-protesters, killing one and leaving several injured, a moving speech about the removal of Confederate monuments from New Orleans that Landrieu delivered in May went viral. Some liberals nonetheless warn the mayor is insufficiently progressive, often toeing the line to appease the center-right. Mark Zuckerberg Title Co-founder, chairman and CEO of Facebook Age 33 Those close to the Facebook founder insist he has no presidential aspirations. But Zuckerberg’s swing through the battleground state of Iowa and hiring of former Clinton aides fueled speculation over his intentions. What remains unclear is if he would run as an independent, as well as the toll of Facebook’s role in Russian interference in the 2016 election. Kamala Harris Title US senator from California Age 53 Few contenders have attracted buzz comparable with that of Kamala Harris, the former attorney general of California who was elected to the Senate in 2016. She wouldn’t be alone in making the jump as a first-term senator (remember Barack Obama?) and has already staked out ground on criminal justice reform and immigration as key priorities. Although viewed with skepticism by some progressives, Harris was first to embrace Sanders’ Medicare-for-All proposal. Tim Ryan Title US representative for Ohio’s 13th congressional district Age 44 Although relatively unknown on the national stage, Tim Ryan made waves in Washington by mounting a challenge to Nancy Pelosi as the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives. Ryan, who hails from a state won decisively by Trump, has declined to rule out a 2020 bid and recently told Ohio workers Trump’s policies would “gut” them. Amy Klobuchar Title US senator from Minnesota Age 57 While not boasting the same profile as some other Senate contenders, Klobuchar is building her name recognition with swings through Iowa, where she declared: “Those of us in the middle of this country will not be forgotten.” Though she must first clear re-election in 2018 in her home state of Minnesota, Democratic operatives says Klobuchar is a sleeper candidate with potential. Kirsten Gillibrand Title US senator from New York Age 50 Gillibrand says she isn’t running, but the senator has kept close relations with top fundraisers and participated in more than one profile piece portraying herself as ready for battle. Though once branded a moderate, Gillibrand endorsed Sanders’ Medicare-for-All and has dropped more than one F-bomb while conveying passionate opposition to Trump. Ties to Wall Street could nonetheless pose problems for the New York Democrat. Andrew Cuomo Title Governor of New York Age 59 Though poised to win a third term as New York’s governor, Cuomo is often viewed as harboring national ambitions. He recently argued Democrats must “win back the middle class while pushing progressive values”, even as he faces scrutiny from the left for belonging to the “neoliberal” class of politicians. Cuomo is also known for his blunt, take-no-prisoners attitude, which could be his biggest strength or greatest liability. Jerry Brown Title Governor of California Age 79 A veteran of Democratic politics, Brown first made a run for the presidency in 1976. He would be one of the oldest contenders in the race – but as Trump and Sanders demonstrated in 2016, age is not by any measure disqualifying. Last month, he signed a bill moving California’s primary elections to the beginning of March, meaning his home state could prove decisive by allocating its daunting number of delegates after Iowa and New Hampshire. Tim Kaine Title US senator from Virginia Age 59 As Clinton’s running mate, Kaine was praised even by Republican opponents for his mild-mannered demeanor and centrist record. His previous roles include serving as the governor of Virginia, the state’s lieutenant governor and mayor of Richmond. Kaine has spent his time in the Senate building a résumé in both foreign and domestic affairs, notably as a leading proponent of voting on a new war authorization against Islamic State. Sherrod Brown Title US senator from Ohio Age 64 A popular voice among progressives with strong ties to blue collar voters, Brown was branded in a recent profile as “the Democrat who’s making Trump Country Republicans nervous”. He has opposed free trade deals, citing concerns over worker protections, and pushed for stronger collective bargaining rights. But Brown must first win Senate re-election in 2018 in the all-important state of Ohio. Oprah Winfrey Title Talk show host and entrepreneur Age 63 A billionaire celebrity and TV host eying the White House sounds eerily familiar. There was a time when the prospect an Oprah Winfrey presidential campaign was somewhat of a joke. But what can’t she achieve? As one of the most successful and influential public figures in the world, Winfrey could well be the unexpected foil to Trump. Chris Murphy Title US senator from Connecticut Age 44 Though not a household name, Murphy has elevated himself to the forefront of key issues that range from gun control to foreign affairs. Having represented those affected by the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, Murphy has placed a personal stake in the fight over gun laws and last year mounted a 15-hour filibuster after the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida. He is also one of Trump’s fiercest critics. Eric Garcetti Title Mayor of Los Angeles Age 46 Although mayors have not traditionally proved to be successful presidential contenders, Garcetti ranks among the more popular figures on the Democratic bench. But even as his name routinely makes lists – and he was somewhat vague when asked about 2020 – Democrats believe Garcetti might first seek California’s governorship in 2018. Jason Kander Title Former Missouri secretary of state Age 36 It isn’t often Democrats insist a candidate whose political career began with a loss is one to watch. But Kander, a military veteran, came painfully close in 2016 to unseating Republican Roy Blunt in the Missouri Senate race. Pitching an economic message rooted in progressivism, Kander is a rising star among grassroots activists who demonstrated rare crossover appeal in a staunchly red state. This article was amended on 9 November 2017 to correct the month when Mitch Landrieu gave his speech – it was given in May before going viral in August."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/26/turnbulls-uluru-statement-rejection-mean-spirited-bastardry-legal-expert","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T02:33:19Z","webTitle":"Turnbull's Uluru statement rejection is 'mean-spirited bastardry' – legal expert","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/26/turnbulls-uluru-statement-rejection-mean-spirited-bastardry-legal-expert","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/26/turnbulls-uluru-statement-rejection-mean-spirited-bastardry-legal-expert","fields":{"headline":"Turnbull's Uluru statement rejection is 'mean-spirited bastardry' – legal expert","bodyText":"Senior Indigenous and legal voices have criticised Malcolm Turnbull for reportedly rejecting the Uluru statement in favour of a symbolic model of constitutional recognition, calling it “a despicable act of mean-spirited bastardry”. News Corp has reported that Turnbull voted against a submission in favour of the Uluru statement recommendations, which include embedding an Indigenous voice to parliament in the constitution, at a cabinet meeting this week, saying a referendum proposing that change was “too ambitious” and would not get majority support. He instead reportedly suggested a return to a symbolic recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia’s founding document. News Corp said Turnbull was drawing on recommendations made by a parliamentary joint select committee on constitutional recognition in 2015 but it is not clear whether he supported the other changes proposed in that report, which include a new constitutional provision prohibiting racial discrimination. The cabinet submission was co-sponsored by the Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, and the attorney general, George Brandis. A spokesperson for Scullion said he did not comment on cabinet discussions. Turnbull is expected to make a formal statement on his government’s position soon. The Uluru statement was drafted following a three-day summit of more than 300 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community leaders and legal experts in May, following a year of consultation. The process was conducted by the Referendum Council, which was funded by the federal government to develop a model for constitutional recognition that had support from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, following opposition to the process being led by the Recognise campaign. The overwhelming message of the summit was a rejection of symbolic constitutional reform in favour of a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament, which would sit outside the parliamentary structure but provide advice and consultation on issues and legislation affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Uluru statement also proposed establishing a Makarrata commission with a view to establishing a treaty, or treaties, between Indigenous people and Australian governments. Sean Gordon, the chief executive of the Darkinjung Aboriginal Land Council and one of the main spokespeople in support of the Uluru statement proposals, said he was “extremely disappointed” by cabinet’s rejection of the reforms. “At a time when Indigenous people need governments and cabinet to lead, we end up with a bunch of followers,” he said on Twitter. Dylan Lino, a law lecturer from the University of Western Australia and one of the legal experts who worked on the Referendum Council’s proposals, said it was “a despicable act of mean-spirited bastardry”. Suzanne Thompson and Josie Crawshaw, the co-chairs of the Uluru Statement Working Group, which was formed after the dialogues to flesh out the proposals and continue gathering grassroots support, said they were surprised and disappointed by cabinet’s reported rejection of the statement. “The people have spoken,” Thompson told Guardian Australia. “That is one of the things that is quite frustrating … I am confident that it would get up through referendum. I think it’s just fear-mongering.” Thompson said the working group was holding consultations next month to flesh out what the proposed voice to parliament might look like and said cabinet’s reported rejection of the proposal was premature. “He is making a decision on something that hasn’t even been put up, it’s just an idea,” she said. Crawshaw said the working group would continue the process it had begun in speaking to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and trying to get through to Turnbull. “We are a patient people,” Thompson said. “We have been waiting for over 200 years to be seen and heard in this country and wanting to be part of a document that was written for this country.” She said she and other Indigenous people “will be no voters” if Australia has a referendum on a symbolic form of constitutional recognition. Symbolic recognition has already failed at referendum once, in 1999, when 60% of Australians voted against a preamble proposed by the Howard government. That was the same referendum that proposed a republic, an argument that Turnbull, who was then outside parliament and leading the pro-republican movement, lost. One of the key opponents of the 1999 reforms, the constitutional conservative Julian Leeser, supports the Uluru statement proposal. Leeser, now a backbench Liberal party MP, spoke in parliament in support of the proposed Uluru statement reforms, saying: “What [Indigenous people] are giving us instead is a direction, an important direction. They are telling us that they want to be consulted and have a voice in the way in which policy is developed, and consultation is good.” Leading legal organisations, including the Law Council of Australia and the New South Wales Bar Association, also support the Uluru statement reforms. In a statement this week, the Law Council gave its “full and unqualified support” to the proposal of a voice to parliament, which its president, Fiona McLeod SC, said was “a necessary and important step towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ self-determination”. Jane Needham SC, the former president of the NSW Bar, was among those who voiced their disappointment at cabinet’s reported rejection on social media on Thursday, saying: “Again, we are telling the Indigenous community ‘we know what’s best for you’. We don’t.” The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, who spoke in support of the Uluru statement reforms at the Garma festival, and the Western Australian senator Pat Dodson, released a joint statement saying the Turnbull government was “walking away from Indigenous recognition”. “All of this indicates that Malcolm Turnbull is seeking to impose his own view of what recognition of First Nations people should be and does not seem willing to listen to First Australians about what recognition and reconciliation means to them,” the statement said. The Greens’ Indigenous affairs spokeswoman, Rachel Siewert, said cabinet’s reported rejection of the proposal was “deeply distressing and disappointing”. “This is a callous rejection of the Referendum Council’s recommendations, that was so unanimously supported by the First Nations’ delegates that met at Uluru and produced the Uluru Statement from the Heart,” Siewert said. “The Uluru Statement from the Heart was unanimous – a strong, clear voice – and it should not be ignored.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/25/puerto-rico-power-whitefish-energy-carmen-yulin-cruz","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T00:26:30Z","webTitle":"Firm restoring Puerto Rico's power threatened to quit, mayor says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/25/puerto-rico-power-whitefish-energy-carmen-yulin-cruz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/25/puerto-rico-power-whitefish-energy-carmen-yulin-cruz","fields":{"headline":"Firm restoring Puerto Rico's power threatened to quit, mayor says","bodyText":"The mayor of San Juan on Wednesday accused the company restoring power to Puerto Rico of threatening to withdraw its services after she drew attention to its controversial contract. Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz had demanded greater transparency over the $300m deal secured by Whitefish Energy, a tiny two-year-old firm based in the Montana home town of the US interior secretary, Ryan Zinke. Whitefish hit back in a tweet: “We’ve got 44 linemen rebuilding power lines in your city &amp; 40 more men just arrived. Do you want us to send them back or keep working?” Cruz then responded on Twitter: “They are threatening not to do their job which frankly is quite irregular for a company hired to work for the public sector.” Whitefish had only two full-time employees when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on 20 September, killing more than 50 people and knocking out power to the whole island. The company has since contracted more than 300 workers, but three-quarters of the US territory remains without electricity. Members of Congress from both parties are demanding an investigation into the contract awarded to the company in Whitefish, Montana. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House minority leader, said she was “deeply concerned” about why and how “a small, inexperienced firm” had been tasked with such a huge job. Raúl Grijalva of Arizona, senior Democrat on the House natural resources committee, said Congress “needs to understand why the Whitefish contract was awarded and whether other, more cost-effective options were available”. Ricardo Rosselló, the governor of Puerto Rico, has said his administration would soon audit the contract awarded to Whitefish. But it is Cruz who has clashed with Whitefish most publicly. She told Yahoo News on Wednesday that she found the deal “alarming” and said it “should be voided right away”. She added: “A proper process which is clear, transparent, legal, moral and ethical should take place. What we need is somebody that can get the job done and that has the expertise to get the job done.” Whitefish tweeted in response: “We share frustration with Mayor Cruz on the situation in Puerto Rico, but her comments are misplaced.” Cruz, who had a spat with Donald Trump in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, tweeted back: “You would think I am the only one in the world that has commented on this. What is it about women having an opinion that irritates some?” According to the Associated Press, a Whitefish spokesman has said the company arrived in Puerto Rico ahead of everyone, and the director of Puerto Rico’s power company, Ricardo Ramos, has praised its work and said the company was the only one that did not require a down payment. Zinke’s son had a summer job at a Whitefish construction site but the interior department denied that Zinke, a former Montana congressman, played any role in the contract award. “Neither the secretary nor anyone in his office have taken any meetings or action on behalf of this company,” the department said. Later on Wednesday, Noel Zamot, a retired air force colonel, was appointed to oversee Whitefish’s operations and reconstruction of 100 miles of power transmission lines across the island’s smashed electric grid. Zamot said: “I am fully committed to bringing the resources necessary to restore electricity to the people of Puerto Rico as quickly as possible, and to reactivate the economy and bring normalcy to the island.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/24/twitter-transparency-political-ads-russia-us-election-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T22:04:22Z","webTitle":"Twitter plans to make political ads more transparent amid Russia revelations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/24/twitter-transparency-political-ads-russia-us-election-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/24/twitter-transparency-political-ads-russia-us-election-trump","fields":{"headline":"Twitter plans to make political ads more transparent amid Russia revelations","bodyText":"Twitter has announced the launch of an advertising “transparency center” with stricter rules for political ads in the wake of revelations that social media sites were used to spread Russian propaganda during the 2016 US presidential election. “In the coming weeks, we will launch an industry-leading transparency center that will offer everyone visibility into who is advertising on Twitter, details behind those ads, and tools to share your feedback with us,” said Twitter’s Bruce Falck in a blogpost. The transparency center will allow people to find out how long ads have been running, what wording and images are being used throughout the campaign and information on how those ads are being targeted at users based on their demographic details. For political ads that refer to a specific candidate (electioneering ads), users will be able to discover the identity of the organisation funding the campaign, the total campaign ad spend, the targeting demographics they have chosen and historical data. When electioneering ads appear on Twitter they will also be marked out as such with the messaging “promoted by political account”. The changes would not affect political issue-based ads that do not name a specific candidate, although Falck said Twitter was working on this. This means that the anti-refugee messaging that insisted France was operating under Sharia law used by Secure America Now to target swing states would not be subject to the same scrutiny. “There is currently no clear industry definition for issue-based ads but we will work with our peer companies, other industry leaders, policymakers, and ad partners to clearly define them quickly and integrate them into the new approach mentioned above,” Falck said. The changes come part-way through a Senate intelligence committee investigation into the Kremlin’s potential meddling in US politics in which Twitter is implicated. Following revelations that Facebook had sold more than 3,000 election ads linked to a Russian agency, Twitter cross-referenced those advertisers with its own to discover similar political advertising on its own network. Twitter subsequently suspended 201 accounts, the company told the committee at the end of September. Senator Mark Warner described Twitter’s internal investigation as revealed in a presentation to the committee as “frankly inadequate”. The Democrat accused Twitter of failing to grasp “how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions and again begs many more questions than they offered”. “There is a lot more work they have to do,” he told reporters on 28 September. Last week Warner, along with senators Amy Klobuchar and John McCain, introduced legislation dubbed the Honesty Act requiring online platforms with at least 50 million monthly users to make a public record of advertisers who spend at least $500 on political ads regarding campaigns or significant legislative issues. Twitter appears to be pre-empting such legislation. Warner described Tuesday’s announcement as “a good first step”. The changes will be made to the US before rolling out globally."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/25/linda-burney-takes-leave-from-parliament-after-son-found-dead-at-family-home","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T21:31:02Z","webTitle":"Linda Burney takes leave from parliament after son found dead at family home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/25/linda-burney-takes-leave-from-parliament-after-son-found-dead-at-family-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/25/linda-burney-takes-leave-from-parliament-after-son-found-dead-at-family-home","fields":{"headline":"Linda Burney takes leave from parliament after son found dead at family home","bodyText":"Linda Burney, the shadow minister for human services, has taken leave from parliament after the sudden death of her son. The Labor MP released a statement on Wednesday saying her 33-year-old son, who had struggled with mental health and addiction, had died in Sydney overnight. “I wish to advise that my beloved son, Binni Kirkbright-Burney was found dead last night at our family home in Sydney,” Burney said in a statement. “The NSW police advise that there appears to be no suspicious circumstances but the cause of death is yet to be determined. “I returned to Sydney last night to be with him this one last time. Binni is 33 years old. He is a caring and loving man. He has struggled with mental health and with addiction. “He tried so hard to conquer his demons, as I and my family have tried so hard to support him in every way we could. I don’t want to pre-empt subsequent inquiry but we all thought we were getting somewhere. I don’t know what life will be like without him. “I understand I am a public figure but in this dire, grief-stricken time for me, I ask that you respect my and my family’s privacy in all respects. When I can, I will speak about this.” Burney was elected to the House of Representatives in 2016, winning the federal seat of Barton. She was the first Indigenous woman to be elected to the House. The NSW Aboriginal Land Council (NSWALC) has sent its condolences to Burney and her family, with NSWALC chair Roy Ah-See saying the Land Rights network would be in shock today and would be grieving her loss. “Our thoughts are with Linda Burney and her family during this extremely difficult time. “When the terrible news broke this morning, I was in Canberra with Aunty Matilda House who also sends her condolences.” Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie in 2015 revealed her own son’s struggle with drug addiction. During a debate about welfare payments, Lambie said her then 21-year-old son was addicted to ice, and she would be opposing the government’s social services legislation amendment bill which would have removed welfare payments for people in psychiatric institutions.

So he didn’t miss Thursday’s gala fundraiser at the Kuwaiti embassy for the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), held at a time when his administration is barring a record number of refugees from entering the US. Since 1980, presidents have set a ceiling on how many refugees the US may admit each year. That cap ranged from over 100,000 under Bush Sr and Clinton to around 80,000 for most of Bush Jr and Obama’s administrations. Trump recently lowered the ceiling to 45,000, the lowest it’s ever been, over the objections of the Pentagon, joint chiefs of staff, state department, and Vice-President Pence, all of whom wanted it higher. Trump is also seeking to enact new rules designed to block refugees from reuniting with family members and grind the resettlement process to a halt. Why is the US turning its back on refugees who are fleeing humanitarian disaster and a group we consider a mortal enemy? As a recent New Yorker report details, this is largely the doing of Stephen Miller, Trump’s hardline anti-immigration immigration adviser. In a White House characterized by organizational chaos, paranoia and general incompetence, a 32-year-old ex-Hill staffer with basic knowledge of the policy process can emerge as a one-eyed king in an administration of the blind. Thus Miller has usurped the power of the National Security Council, state and defense departments to set refugee policy by himself, beyond the bounds of his formal authority, which is domestic, not foreign policy. Out of his depth as he is, his arguments are also unbounded by things like evidence and reason. Miller’s, and thus Trump’s, fears are threefold: refugees are an economic, security, and cultural threat to the US. His Domestic Policy Council cherry-picks research which paints this dark picture and discards that which contradicts it, even research commissioned by the White House itself: when Trump ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to calculate the cost of refugee resettlement, the department found that the tax revenue refugees produce is $63bn more than what they cost US taxpayers. The New York Times reported that Miller then had this document squashed. This shouldn’t have been a surprise: the results are in line with academic research that also shows refugees having a net positive impact on public budgets. A National Bureau of Economic Research working paper finds that on average, refugees to the US pay $20,000 more per person in taxes than they receive in benefits. And after being established in the country, they more likely than equally educated US-born citizens to be employed, and less likely to be on welfare. The security threat narrative is based on a misunderstanding or willful misrepresentation of the refugee screening process. “Extreme vetting” already exists: potential refugees to the US go through a 20-step process that includes three fingerprint screenings, two to three background checks, and three extensive interviews, first by the UN Refugee Agency – the same agency for which Trump attended that nice dinner – then the state department, then Department of Homeland Security. This would explain why, of the more than 3 million refugees admitted to the US from 1975 to 2015, only three committed terrorist acts, killing three people total, all by Cubans in the 1970s before our current refugee screening process was established. None of the major mass shootings or terrorist acts in the US in recent years – San Bernardino, Boston, Orlando, Las Vegas, or 9/11 – were carried out by refugees. This brings us to the final objection, culture, which gets us closest to the truth: Miller and Trump simply don’t think refugees look like how they imagine Americans should look. In its annual refugee report to Congress, the White House announced potential refugees will now be screened based on their “likelihood of successful assimilation”. This is new language, Anne Richard, former assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration under Obama, tells me, and the most troubling because it’s the most arbitrary. “How do you test that?” she asks. Trump has raised the issue of treatment of women in his executive orders banning travel from Muslim countries, which is ironic coming from Trump. “They’re not worried about how women are treated,” says Richard. “It’s all hogwash. In reality, they just don’t want Muslims to come here.” Strip away the policy excuses about budgets and public safety and you’re left with the cultural ones. This is what Miller is getting at when he lashes out at journalists for “cosmopolitan bias”, an epithet once reserved for Jews. This is an administration which considers religion a valid test for un-American-ness. Coincidentally or not, the amount by which Trump is lowering the cap on refugees is roughly equal to the proportion of those refugees in recent years who were Muslim, 45%. Going forward, it’s not hard to imagine who is most likely not to meet the “assimilation” bar."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/24/leicester-city-leeds-united-carabao-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T20:46:27Z","webTitle":"Leicester’s Kelechi Iheanacho and Islam Slimani hit form to sink Leeds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/24/leicester-city-leeds-united-carabao-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/24/leicester-city-leeds-united-carabao-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Leicester’s Kelechi Iheanacho and Islam Slimani hit form to sink Leeds","bodyText":"Leicester City’s players may have been sorry to see Craig Shakespeare sacked last week but there was no trace of self pity here as they came from behind to earn a place in the quarter-finals. Leeds United took the lead thanks to a lovely goal by Pablo Hernández but that proved to be the catalyst for a commanding fightback by the host side, who responded with fine goals from Kelechi Iheanacho, Islam Slimani and Riyad Mahrez. The result, following on from the victory at Swansea City on Saturday, brought Michael Appleton’s tally to two wins from his two matches in temporary charge but the caretaker manager is likely to step down soon as Leicester prepare to make a full-time appointment. Claude Puel, the Frenchman let go by Southampton in June, has emerged as a surprising candidate for the role. “It’s been a difficult week,” Appleton said. “It certainly would have been a lot worse and tougher had we not won the last two games. We’ve tried to stay in a positive frame of mind and stay professional and prepare properly, and I think the two performances suggest that’s been the case. “ When I first spoke to the powers that be it was a matter of taking every game as it comes and making sure the lads are prepared as best as they can be. I’m sure I’ll have more information over the coming days and weeks.” Leeds know all too well how hard it can be to function amid turmoil but they arrived at the King Power as a relatively stable club, perched fourth in the Championship and exuding optimism under new leadership. But because they face a duel on Friday at home to Sheffield United, the team one place above them in the table, Thomas Christiansen deployed a weakened side, Kalvin Phillips the only survivor from the lineup that started Saturday’s win at Bristol City. Leeds fans travelled in force as always and helped generate an atmosphere that made this feel like more than a contest between a pair of second-string teams. The early exchanges on the pitch were tame but that changed in the 12th minute when Jay-Roy Grot swapped a nifty one-two with Kemar Roofe before a save from Ben Hamer. Roofe tested Hamer again moments later and in the 26th minute he embarked on another run infield from the right before offloading to Hernández five yards outside the Leicester box. The Spaniard wriggled away from Marc Albrighton before curling a delicious shot from 20 yards into the net via the underside of the crossbar. It was a deserved lead for the visitors, who had controlled most of the match until that point. But they relinquished it within four minutes when their goalkeeper, Felix Wiedwald, rushed off his line to clear a pass over the top before Islam Slimani could collect it. Wiedwald would have been better off pouncing on the ball, as his weak kick went straight to Kelechi Iheanacho, who placed a fine shot into the bottom corner of the unguarded net from 20 yards. It was the Nigerian’s first goal for the club since his £25m transfer from Manchester City. “He grew in confidence after that,” Appleton said accurately. Leicester dominated the second period. Gray missed the target after Slimani teed him up following a slip by Pontus Jansson. Then Wiedwald got lucky when he was marooned by a bad back pass that Slimani intercepted. The Algerian pulled the ball back to Andy King, who ballooned a shot over the bar. If that was fortunate, the escape on the hour was barely believable, Slimani sparing the visiting side by heading over an empty net from three yards after a fine cross by Albrighton. The reprieve was temporary. Slimani redeemed himself by side-footing into the net from close range after an incisive move involving Iheanacho and Vicente Iborra. Mahrez rounded off the scoring in style, topping off a 30-yard dash by curling into the bottom corner from the edge of the area."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/24/jeff-flake-retire-republican-senate-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T08:01:09Z","webTitle":"GOP Senator Jeff Flake attacks 'reckless, outrageous and undignified' Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/24/jeff-flake-retire-republican-senate-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/24/jeff-flake-retire-republican-senate-trump","fields":{"headline":"GOP Senator Jeff Flake attacks 'reckless, outrageous and undignified' Trump","bodyText":"Arizona senator Jeff Flake has launched an extraordinary attack against Donald Trump and the “complicity” of the Republican party as he announced his decision to leave the Senate. Flake, a key Republican critic of Trump, said he was retiring at the end of his term in 2018 because there was no room for him in the party under the current president’s stewardship. He then delivered an emotional appeal from the Senate floor against the state of affairs under Trump, bemoaning that his Republican colleagues had “given in or given up on core principles in favor of a more viscerally satisfying anger and resentment”. “It is time for our complicity and our accommodation for the unacceptable to end,” Flake said. “There are times when we must risk our careers in favor of our principles. Now is such a time. “We must never allow ourselves to lapse into thinking that that is just the way things are now,” he added. “We must stop pretending that the degradation of our politics and the conduct of some in our executive branch are normal.” “Reckless, outrageous, and undignified behavior has become excused and countenanced as ‘telling it like it is’ when it is actually just reckless, outrageous, and undignified.” He said such behavior was “dangerous to our democracy” and projected not strength but a “corruption of the spirit”. He then asked his colleagues: “When the next generation asks us: ‘Why didn’t you do something? Why didn’t you speak up? What are we going to say?’” Flake joins a list of high-profile Republicans who have jumped ship in recent months amid the turmoil of Trump’s presidency. Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, declared his retirement last month and has since been locked in a bitter feud with Trump that reached new heights on Tuesday. Hours before Flake’s announcement, Trump’s war of words with Corker escalated in unprecedented fashion ahead of a meeting between the president and Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill. Prior to the closed-door luncheon, Corker branded Trump as an “utterly untruthful president” on NBC’s Today Show. In a separate interview with CNN, Corker went even further, stating of the president: “I don’t know why he lowers himself to such a low, low standard and debases our country in that way but he does.” Coupled with Flake’s scathing remarks on the Senate floor, the growing list of Republicans sounding the alarm over Trump’s presidency marked a potential watershed moment within the party. Several prominent Republicans have spoken out, albeit in veiled terms, against so-called “Trumpism” in recent weeks. John McCain, who represents Arizona alongside Flake in the Senate, denounced “half-baked, spurious nationalism” in a speech last week that also decried the abdication of US leadership on the global stage. Days later, George W Bush condemned bigotry while declaring American politics “more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication”. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, played into the intra-party rift by dubbing Flake’s decision as “a good move” while telling reporters his remarks were not “befitting of the Senate floor”. Speaking at the daily White House briefing, Sanders dismissed the criticisms made by Flake and Corker. “Look, I think the voters of these individual senators’ states are speaking in pretty loud volumes,” she said. “I think they were not likely to be re-elected and I think that shows the support is more behind this president than it is those two individuals.” Sebastian Gorka, a Trump ally and former adviser at the White House, attacked the two senators for what he called “disgraceful behaviour”. The fringe rightwing figure, who has drawn fierce criticism for his views on Islam, told the BBC that Flake was one of many politicians “living in their elite bubbles” and a “prime example” of why Trump won the presidency. Gorka called Corker a “disgrace”, adding: “I can’t remember in modern history a serving senator casting such aspersions about the current commander-in-chief, who is from the same party as himself … They have realised that winds of change are blowing through the body politic, so they’ve bowed out rather disgracefully.” In his Senate floor speech, Flake implored Republicans to do away with the political considerations that have enabled Trump to challenge to norms of governance and basic decorum. “The alliances and agreements that ensure the stability of the entire world are routinely threatened by the level of thought that goes into 140 characters,” Flake said. “Would we Republicans meekly accept such behavior on display from dominant Democrats? Of course we wouldn’t. And we would be wrong if we did.” “When we remain silent and fail to act ... because of political considerations, because we might make enemies, because we might alienate the base,” he added, “we dishonor our principles and forsake our obligations.” Flake was one of the few Republican senators who declined to endorse Trump during the 2016 presidential election. Earlier this year, he published a book framing the rise of Trump as a moment of reckoning for the Republican party. Flake’s candor highlighted the discord within the Republican party in the aftermath of Trump’s successful insurgent campaign. Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist, declared war on the Republican establishment after leaving the White House in August to take down incumbents perceived by the base as insufficient in their support of the president’s agenda. A Bannon ally celebrated the news of Flake’s retirement, texting the Guardian: “Another scalp!” Although Flake had raised millions for his re-election campaign, his criticism of Trump loomed over what was poised to be a tough primary against rightwing challengers that included Kelli Ward, the former Arizona state senator who failed to unseat John McCain in November. Ward had dubbed Flake’s refusal to endorse Trump in the 2016 campaign “treacherous”. Amplifying pressure from the right, Trump met with some of Flake’s potential challengers ahead of a rally in Phoenix in August and subsequently attacked the senator on Twitter, writing: “Not a fan of Jeff Flake, weak on crime &amp; border!” Flake was a co-author of a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013 that would have provided a pathway to citizenship for roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US. He also differed from Trump on trade, but ultimately told the Arizona Republic newspaper his decision to leave the Senate was a moral choice. Corker and Flake’s decisions to step aside leave room for Republicans to run new candidates who might be less tarnished by the toxicity of Trump’s tenure. Senate Leadership Fund, the Super Pac dedicated to preserving the Republican majority in the upper chamber, said Flake’s decision would ultimately help to thwart Bannon’s crusade against incumbent Republicans. “The one political upshot of Sen Flake’s decision today is that Steve Bannon’s hand-picked candidate, conspiracy-theorist Kelli Ward, will not be the Republican nominee for this Senate seat in 2018,” the group’s president and CEO, Steven Law, said in a statement. The move nonetheless removed yet another strong, household name from a seat being eyed as a potential pickup by Democrats, who are seeking to regain control of a Republican-led Congress. Democrats are rallying behind the Arizona congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema, known as a rare centrist voice in the increasingly polarized country’s capital. Political operatives in Washington were surprised by Flake’s announcement, which followed a slew of similar decisions from Republicans in swing states. Several Republicans serving in the House of Representatives have announced plans to retire, including David Trott of Michigan, David Reichert of Washington, Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, leaving an opening for Democrats in competitive districts. By contrast, moderate Republican Susan Collins said earlier this month she would stay in the Senate rather than leave to run for governor of Maine. Alex Conant, a partner at Firehouse Strategies who worked on Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign, said it was a “troubling trend” for reliable conservatives like Flake to feel as though they no longer had a place in the Republican party. “It’s no secret that there’s a lot of divisions within the Republican party right now. A lot of Republican leaders are uncomfortable with the direction that Trump is leading us,” Conant said.

Khelaifi, who denies wrongdoing, will face an interview at the Bern office of Switzerland’s attorney general, Michael Lauber, who accuses Khelaifi of bribing Valcke to acquire the TV rights to the 2026 and 2030 World Cups for beIN. Fifa has confirmed that beIN, the Qatar-owned sports broadcaster formerly part of al-Jazeera, has already bought from it the rights to show those tournaments on television in the Middle East and several countries in Africa. The attorney general’s office announced on 12 October that criminal proceedings had been opened, in effect a formal investigation, into Khelaifi and Valcke for suspected bribery, fraud, criminal mismanagement and forgery of a document. A third man, so far unnamed, faces similar criminal allegations over the purchase of the TV rights from Fifa for the 2018, 2022, 2026 and 2030 World Cups. Legal authorities in France, Greece, Italy and Spain have cooperated with the criminal investigation, searching properties including beIN’s headquarters in Paris. Italian police have said that they seized a €7m villa on the Porto Cervo coast in Sardinia, alleged to have been provided by Khelaifi for Valcke to use. BeIN, which has bought the TV rights to the French Ligue 1 jointly with Canal+ for a record €726.5m from 2016-20, said its Paris staff had “cooperated with the authorities until the search was over”. However a dispute arose over the level of cooperation, with the Parquet National Financier, France’s financial crimes investigatory authority, accusing beIN of refusing access to data held on its computers, because the servers were based in Doha. BeIN argues that company permission for the authorities to access the servers had to be signed off by Khelaifi or the chief executive of beIN Sports, Yousef al-Obaidly, who were not in Paris at the time. A beIN spokesman told the Guardian the company and Khelaifi maintain their stance to reject all the allegations, and said Khelaifi himself requested an early interview with the attorney general. Lauber is expected to make a statement about the investigation after interviewing Khelaifi."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/24/carabao-cup-round-up-bristol-city-crystal-palace","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T20:44:09Z","webTitle":"Carabao Cup roundup: Bristol City thrash Palace to reach quarter-finals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/24/carabao-cup-round-up-bristol-city-crystal-palace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/24/carabao-cup-round-up-bristol-city-crystal-palace","fields":{"headline":"Carabao Cup roundup: Bristol City thrash Palace to reach quarter-finals","bodyText":"Bristol City reached the last eight for the first time since 1989 as Lee Johnson’s side came from behind to thrash Crystal Palace 4-1 at Ashton Gate. Having already knocked out Watford and Stoke in previous rounds, City fell behind to Bakary Sako’s goal before responses from Matt Taylor, Milan Djuric, Joe Bryan and Callum O’Dowda sent them through. Palace, bottom of the Premier League with just one win from nine games, did not help themselves in defence, but City’s greater finesse in front of goal deservedly reaped its reward as the Robins romped home. Palace boss Roy Hodgson made 10 changes from the side beaten by Newcastle last weekend, with only Patrick van Aanholt remaining. Jason Puncheon returned as captain, while Wales goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey also featured, in addition to the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Jairo Riedewald and Timothy Fosu-Mensah. City, beaten 3-0 at home by Leeds last time out, showed five changes, including starts for record signing Famara Diedhiou, while Taylor was involved after having a red card collected last Saturday rescinded. Palace, despite their league struggles, settled impressively, and they twice had chances during the opening 10 minutes. Lee Chung-yong was unlucky not to open the scoring when he volleyed against the upright of post and crossbar, then Sako had a shot smothered by City goalkeeper Luke Steele as Palace probed for an opener. The home side initially looked disjointed in comparison, offering little in the way of a threat on Hennessey’s goal, and it was Steele who was called into action again, this time to block a Sullay Kaikai effort at his near post. Palace’s opener arrived in the 21st minute when Loftus-Cheek found Sako, who finished in style, driving a low shot past Steele to underline the visitors’ dominance. City, though, could have equalised within four minutes of Sako’s strike after Diedhiou and Taylor linked well, before Diedhiou arrowed a cross deep into Palace’s penalty area and Taylor just failed to get a touch on it with only Hennessey in front of him. Diedhiou was then forced off after being on the receiving end of a hefty collision, which meant a first appearance of the season for his replacement Djuric, and City equalised followed a 32nd-minute blunder by Van Aanholt. He looked to cushion a header back towards Hennessey, but succeeded only in finding a grateful Taylor, who easily guided the ball past the goalkeeper and left Palace duly punished for a poor error that undid so much of their early promise, while City never looked back. And it got worse for Hodgson’s men just seven minutes later after more defensive hesitancy played into City’s hands and Djuric smashed the ball past Hennessey for a 2-1 lead as the interval approached. Steele was forced into a sharp save as Palace dominated early second-half territory, but City quickly reasserted themselves and they opened up a two-goal cushion when Bryan shot high into Hennessey’s net. And before Palace could recover, O’Dowda sent the City fans into party mood, rifling home a right-footed shot that Hennessey was once again powerless to keep out. In the night’s other match, Callum Wilson scored on his return from injury to help Bournemouth beat Middlesbrough 3-1. Making his first appearance since suffering knee ligament damage in January, Wilson rolled home the Cherries’ second goal from the penalty spot before teeing up substitute Benik Afobe for the clincher. Debutant defender Jack Simpson had earlier volleyed the hosts into the lead at the Vitality Stadium, before they were pegged back by a first senior goal from Boro teenager Marcus Tavernier."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2017/oct/25/labor-calls-australian-workers-union-raids-an-abuse-of-power-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T07:51:47Z","webTitle":"AFP won't hand over seized documents until at least Friday – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2017/oct/25/labor-calls-australian-workers-union-raids-an-abuse-of-power-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2017/oct/25/labor-calls-australian-workers-union-raids-an-abuse-of-power-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"AFP won't hand over seized documents until at least Friday – as it happened","bodyText":"And it is on that note that we leave you. What. A. Day. What did we learn? The AWU raids have the government in the hot seat, which I am not sure they were entirely prepared for. Labor batted away allegations they were attacking the integrity of the Australian Federal Police quite early, and their targeted question time strategy finished up turning the tables. Combine that with the revelations from Buzzfeed as the day was coming to a close and the government has just ensured this will roll into another day. And we’ll be there. You can expect myself, the Guardian Australia brains trust and Mike Bowers to be back with you around 8am, after a few strong coffees and maybe a vodka chaser. Because on Friday, we don’t only have the next instalment of the AWU federal court hearing, but we also get the high court judgement on the seven MPs with citizenship concerns. So what happens tomorrow? Your guess is as good as mine. At this stage, I am not sure anything would surprise me! Have a great night, make sure you get some rest, and if you need to reach me or Mr Bowers in the meantime, you can get us at @amyremeikis or @mpbowers or @mikepbowers. The estimates hearing is devolving into chaos. “You’ll do anything to hide this, won’t you?” Murray Watt calls out. Linda Reynolds suspends for the dinner break and Watt tells Michaelia Cash she can “read the Buzzfeed article” on the break. This is going to go on all night. Cameron: “Minister, on five occasions you have denied that any notice of the press came from your office ... Do you still deny that your office has had no involvement in notifying the press and do you still deny that you are not involved in that, and can you then give me any reason for why we should believe what you say, because it was either your office, the AFP or ROC, there is not much left. Cash: I am not going to comment on stories from Buzzfeed that I have not yet read, but yes, I stand by previous evidence and I have said it to you on previous occasions. Doug Cameron gets his way after Michaelia Cash says she is happy to answer the question. Doug Cameron is attempting to ask Michaelia Cash about the Buzzfeed story, and is being blocked by James Paterson, as not being part of the Fair Work portfolio. Linda Reynolds is telling Cameron and Labor senator Murray Watt they can wait until they get to the Registered Organisations Commission part of the evening. Which is being held up. New from Alice Workman at Buzzfeed: BuzzFeed News has spoken to journalists from two news outlets who say they received a tip-off from employment minister Michaelia Cash’s office ahead of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) raids on the Australian Workers’ Union (AWU). You can read her story here Government MPs on the employment estimates hearing committing are asking Fair Work officials if they understand what certain legislation does, (literally their job to know that), reading legislation sections out to them and talking about submissions to an inquiry which are publicly available. Filibuster? What filibuster? The government is still filibustering in the employment estimates hearing. “If I came back as soon as the news started, that should be OK?” Labor senator Murray Watt asks. He’s implying that the government members of the committee are attempting to push the Registered Organisations Commission hearing until after the 6pm news. There are suggestions they are trying to push it out to the dinner break, which would mean the committee wouldn’t get to it until after 9pm. Everyone is waiting on the Registered Organisations Commission to front the employment estimates. They were scheduled to appear at 4.50pm, but it looks like the government is filibustering. We haven’t spent a lot of time in the House today, outside question time, but the firearms trafficking bill is being discussed. Labor objects to the mandatory minimum sentences. So does Kennedy MP Bob Katter, who got quite incensed when justice minister Michael Keenan implied opposing mandatory sentencing was a “leftie” move. And then there is also this one: We end the day with this alert, because of course we do Oh, and he ends with a little warning to the NSW Liberals, regarding the Roseville ‘one member, one vote’ resolutions, interrupting host Ben Fordham to make sure he can get it in. “This is make or break time for the NSW Liberal party ... early December ... and you know, there was the Roseville resolutions overwhelmingly carried by the biggest meeting of NSW Liberals in many, many years and it would just be, I think, appalling if those resolutions were thwarted by some machinations and exploitation of the rules. But let’s talk about it next time.” Should the PM be able to live in Point Piper, given the security costs, Mr Abbott? “This is I think a reasonable question to pose and yes I got advice back in late 2013 that it would be quite costly for Margie, me and the Abbotts to stay in suburban Forestville in the end, I don’t know what advice [Turnbull] got, but where he lives is a matter for him.” Tony Abbott is on 2GB for his regular chat. Grab your popcorn. And we are straight into it. “Bill Shorten’s problem is he is always making excuses for unions ... and if he got to be our prime minister, he would effectively be the PM for the CFMEU, the CFMEU PM.” Who told the media about the AWU raids? I can’t tell you. But I can tell you, that despite handing the government the votes it needed to make the Registered Organisations Commission a reality, which he does not say he regrets, Nick Xenophon believes there needs to be an investigation into how the cameras made it to the AWU offices, before the police. It taints the whole process, it should be rule of law, not a media circus, particularly with serious allegations. That is what I am interested in at the moment. People of integrity in government have said to me ‘there is no way we were involved in this in any way and any suggestion that we were is completely wrong and offensive’ but someone leaked this to the media. It shouldn’t have been leaked because I think it casts a cloud over the whole process in terms of the investigation and the process that now needs to take place. Nick Xenophon says the leak to the media “cast a shadow over the whole process” and needs to be investigated. Meanwhile, in Brisbane, the ABC offices are being raided with police apparently looking for state cabinet documents in relation to LNP government cuts to the environmental department. Back in the community affairs estimates hearing, and it looks as though the government’s proposed drug testing trial will be delayed. The department says no contract has gone out to tender as yet, and doesn’t seem overly confident it would begin on January 1 as the government had wanted (that’s when it wants it reforms to kick in). Still no idea of the cost though Labor have joined Nick Xenophon’s call into an inquiry into how the media found out about the raids on the AWU offices. Here is what Brendan O’Connor had to say in a statement: Labor backs Senator Nick Xenophon’s call for an independent inquiry to establish who tipped off the media prior to the AFP raids on the Australian Workers Union (AWU). Turnbull and the minister have failed to answer simple yet serious questions about who tipped off the media before the raids actually occurred. If Turnbull and his Liberals have nothing to hide, then they must support this inquiry. Turnbull and his Liberals need to immediately answer what they knew, when they knew it and who they told. On the same day parliament was told that Turnbull’s cuts to the AFP have meant serious crimes like drug smuggling could not be properly investigated, we saw more than 25 AFP officers used to execute these extraordinary raids. Turnbull and his Liberals will stop at nothing to attack workers and their representatives. Australians will see this for the desperate tactic that it is. *end statement* Maurice Blackburn principal Josh Bornstein has just left the federal court. He confirms that the AFP will not hand over any documents that it seized and the regulator will not accept any seized documents until the court hears the case. That probably won’t be for a few days. The union is very pleased at the moment that we at least got to this point, but the case, is going to go back for a hearing on Friday, where we expect a further set of direction, leading up to a full hearing of the case. We continue to believe that this warrant and the use of 32 federal police was a disgraceful overreach. We are talking here about an argument about paperwork. We don’t see 32 federal police with a tip off to the media with major criminal matters, let alone a debate over the internal paperwork of unions. Unions are labouring under some of the most oppressive legislation in the OECD at the moment, they are under constant and relentless attack and the media stunt that was pulled yesterday is another dimension in the ongoing attack that is designed to de-legitimise and paint the trade union in the worst possible light. I wanted a little bit of space in between the mess of question time and the condolences that both Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten offered Linda Burney and her family ahead of the official opening of questions. The prime minister: This morning, I spoke with the member for Barton and expressed Lucy and my deep sadness on the loss of her son at their home last night. As parents, our worst dread is the loss of a child. Linda’s loss is unspeakably sad. She’s not with us today, she has leave. But we are with her, we are all with her in love and in heartfelt sympathy. She is cast deep in grief but she does not grieve alone. She is a strong woman. Stronger because of the love that all of us, the sympathy that all of us, the friendship that all of us share with her at this tragic time for her and for her family. The leader of the opposition: As honourable members are aware, the member for Barton has taken leave from this parliament following the tragic death of her 33-year-old son Binni. As she said in her touching and sad statement this morning, she “returned to Sydney last night to be with him this one last time.” On behalf of Chloe and I, and on behalf of the whole Labor family, I want to offer our deepest condolences to Linda and her family. This is just so sad. As Jenny Macklin and I were speaking to her last night, the grief, the grief is terrible. Losing a child is every parent’s nightmare. It is, as Shakespeare once said, a grief that ‘fills up the room’. We know how much Linda loved her son – and we know how much her son loved Linda. In this time of deep sadness, can I please request that the media respect her family’s privacy, and I know that they will. And – I should add – that the family have asked that instead of flowers, if people are so inclined could they please contribute to Central Coast Drug Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre. All of us send our love and our solidarity to our friend and colleague and her family at this time. There was, as you could imagine, a lot of emotion in the House. Bit more from Mr Bowers Question time officially ends. Update on the federal court hearing At least the latest gag motion gives me a chance to show you some of Mike Bowers’ great work Justice Susan Kenny is due to hear the AWU’s challenge of the AFP raids in the federal court at 3pm. The originating application states the AWU is seeking a declaration the search warrant for Tuesday’s raid is invalid and an order quashing the Registered Organisations Commission investigation. The AWU has asked for an interlocutory injunction to prevent the AFP giving the ROC the information they took in the raids, and that is the aspect of the case we expect will be heard and decided this afternoon. Tony Burke is calling for a suspension of standing orders to move this motion: That the House notes, one: yesterday it was revealed the Australian Federal Police did not have the resources to investigate the importation of 1.6 tonnes of cocaine; two: on the very same day, the prime minister’s Registered Organisations Commission sent at least 25 of the officers – 25 AFP officers to look at a 10-year-old donation to GetUp. Three: in doing so, this government diverted police resources needed to fight drug syndicates to protect his own political interests. For this is just the latest example of this prime minister’s willingness to abuse his power and debase the office of prime minister. And, therefore: condemns this born-to-rule prime minister for his grubby attacks and blatant abuses of power designed to protect his own political interests instead of protecting Australians. The government seeks to gag him and the House divides. Greg Hunt gets a dixer on energy from Wide Bay MP Llew O’Brien, whom he calls “a policeman’s policeman”. Bill Shorten: My question is to the prime minister. Why hasn’t the prime minister asked government agencies to undertake any investigations into Australians caught up in the Panama Papers scandal? Why does the prime minister continue to protect the banks from a royal commission despite reports that the Commonwealth Bank allowed money to be laundered by terrorists? Why won’t this or the rule power to do something about misconduct at the top end of town, and stop abusing his power to attack people and organisations who highlight his failings? Malcolm Turnbull: I am so glad, Mr Speaker, that Melbourne’s greatest sycophant has raised the top end of town. One enterprise bargain after another, sold out. Sold out to big business. One deal after another. One set of penalty rates after another. One sweetheart deal after another. And all the time, as he postured as the great friend, the great friend of big business, here he was, Mr Speaker. We know how much time he has spent there sucking up to Dick Pratt and all the other billionaires. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. There is nothing more sycophantic than a Labor politician in the presence of a billionaire. Believe me, I’ve seen quite a few of both. And I know these are the great sucker-uppers of all time. And he talks about business, Mr Speaker. What was the party, what was the party? Let me remember, the party that voted against our bill to tackle multinational tax avoidance. It was the Labor party. That’s right, Mr Speaker. That’s how committed they were, Mr Speaker. The grovelling, the compromises, the special deals. We have seen them all. Their members have seen them all. But nothing takes the cake quite so much, quite so much, as paying members’ money to GetUp, which after all, wants to put the AWU members out of work. We move on to Peter Dutton letting us know just how protected and safe our borders and communities are. Again. We are very safe. And very protected. There is another dixer to Josh Frydenberg, who starts quoting figures on how much families have saved by taking the government’s advice and shopping around for their power provider. Back to the opposition questions, for the prime minister. Tony Burke: Can he confirm that his government has sent in the AFP to break into parliamentary offices during a [election] campaign due to the failings of his second NBN being exposed, referred people [from Queensland Labor] over upsetting text messages, and sent the AFP to investigate a 10-year-old donation to GetUp. Why is he diverting money towards projects of political interest to a born to rule prime minister? Christopher Pyne makes a point of order on what he says are inaccuracies. Tony Smith says if that is the case there are three minutes for the prime minister to correct them. Malcolm Turnbull: It was bad enough to see John Setka attacking the integrity of the AFP. Bad enough to see that. The way in which he flaunted his and his union’s defiance of the law, and then it was even worse, when we saw the member for Gorton echoing that this respect, that contempt for the law last night – that disrespect. But now we see the member for Watson standing up here in the parliament and stating what he knows to be utterly untrue, alleging that the federal police does the political bidding of the government. That is a shocking allegation against the federal police. It is a shocking allegation against the government. Above all, above all, it’s impugns the integrity and the professionalism of the men and women of the federal police who work so hard to keep us safe. Labor should be ashamed of themselves. Brendan O’Connor: “Can the prime minister confirm that the prime minister went to a double dissolution election to establish is registered organisation commission. The commission was hand-picked by the employment minister, and [whether] the commission is looking into a 10-year-old donation to GetUp is because their employment minister told them to do so?” Malcolm Turnbull: (with papers in hand) What we know about this matter is that we, the registered organisation commission, received information which they say raise reasonable grounds for suspecting that relevant documents were maybe being interfered with by being concealed or destroyed. Now, we know, we know that there have been examples of documents being concealed and – and – and that tends to destroy them with respect to other union investigations. This is a concern that is a fact. Now, Mr Speaker, what the honourable member is suggesting is that a regulatory agency designed to ensure that unionists, and members funds, not being dealt with unlawfully. And investigating that. And believing that relevant documents were at risk of being destroyed. But they should do nothing. How very convenient. How very convenient that would be for union officials who miss-use union members’ money. And Mr Speaker, when the member for Barton, when the member for Barton gave his extraordinary interview yesterday, he said (he is corrected for naming the wrong member), the member for Gorton, Mr Speaker. When he gave that, when he gave that extraordinary interview yesterday, in which he made claims that, substantially, the claims on the AFP, oh, he did ... he said that the government uses the police for police purposes, and that is precisely what the member for Gorton said yesterday. What he also did was to follow the same line as the member for Sydney, which said, let me just say this, ‘I do know of allegations made against the AWU 10 years ago. None of the allegations, were they true, warrant this sort of conduct’. Is he seriously suggesting that if a regulator charged under law to investigate wrongdoing believes that evidence is about to be destroyed, that they should do nothing? That would be very convenient for those who misuse union member’s money ... misuse ... union members. Queensland Michelle Landry asks the next dixer to Barnaby Joyce, who nods along with it. It’s on “affordable and reliable” energy policies and any alternative approaches. As she sits down, the microphone picks up someone saying “great member, great member”. Tony Burke asks about the relevance to the member’s portfolio. Tony Smith hears it again. He says it is “very line ball”, adding “I will rule it in order on the basis that it talked about businesses and the deputy prime minister is responsible, certainly, for agricultural businesses. But I do question, I do say the member, I do say to the member that it is very important questions relate to ministerial responsibility.” Barnaby Joyce gives a very Barnaby Joyce answer. Tony Burke: “In his previous answer the prime minister said that Senator Cash had assured him that she did not advise the press gallery of the raids. Did Senator Cash assure the prime minister that her office did not advise the press gallery of the raids?” Malcolm Turnbull: “The honourable member can attempt to cross-examine Senator Cash by proxy here in the House. He should make sure that his friends in the Senate can address all the questions to first hand.” Adam Bandt has the crossbench question and he uses it to ask about the Adani coalmine planned for Queensland: As former environment minister Peter Garrett pointed out this week, the Queensland Labor government is strongly backing the Adani coal mega-mine which will mean more deaths from heatwaves and bushfires. Prime minister, will you take steps to step in and override this rogue state government like Bob Hawke did with the Franklin dam? Or is the only way of stopping the Adani mine for the people of Brisbane to elect the Greens [he names three MPs, but I missed that]* to hold the balance of power in the Queensland parliament? We get the shortest answer of the week from Malcolm Turnbull: “as I said to the honourable member once before, I can only conclude from his question that he believes that Queenslanders should go without jobs and Indians should go without electricity. Then Julie Bishop gets a dixer. It is on energy. *I’ve just been informed of the names I missed: Amy McMahon, Michael Berkman Kirsten Lovejoy Scott Morrison gets the next dixer. It is on energy. Tony Burke has the next opposition question: “Given TV cameras turned up at the site of AFP raids yesterday, can the prime minister guarantee that his employment minister or her office didn’t notify anyone in the press gallery before the raid? Malcolm Turnbull: The employment minister is in estimates as we speak so I’m sure will be dealing with that, but I can assure – well, Mr Speaker, that can be addressed. But I can assure honourable members opposite that the real question here is what was, what happened to that $100,000. That’s the real issue, Mr Speaker. The whole chamber erupts. Burke has a point of order, saying he had no preamble and a very specific question. Speaker Tony Smith, after warning the chamber, says the prime minister was talking about the substance of the question, under the standing orders. Turnbull: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, the minister, the minister for employment, has assured me that she did not advise any journalists about the raid and, Mr Speaker, but she will be in estimates, she’s in estimates I believe this afternoon and will no doubt have the opportunity to go into this in great deal. But Mr Speaker, the issue, the real issue, is this: why did the AWU give $100,000 of its hardworking members’ union dues to GetUp? Was it authorised under the rules? Now, that is the matter the Registered Organisations Commission is investigating and that enquiry was the subject or the context of the search warrants that were exercised yesterday. And, as honourable members would know, the register Registered Organisations Commission said yesterday in a statement, since the investigation commenced, the ROC received information which raised reasonable grounds for suspecting documents relevant to this investigation may be on the premises of the AWU ... They went to a magistrate, they secured a warrant and the warrant was executed and now I see that their lawyers are in court, the AWU’s lawyers are in court trying to stop the police having access to the documents. Tanya Plibersek is next on the Labor question roster: The federal police did not have the resources to fully investigate a 1.6 tonne cocaine importation; when the federal police already don’t have enough resources to do the important work they do, why is this born-to-rule prime minister diverting the limited resources of the federal police so that he can attack his political opponents? Christopher Pyne makes a point of order about a reference to the prime minister in the question – it doesn’t take a genius to know that it is ‘born to rule’ he is taking umbrage at. Tony Smith allows the question, saying he doesn’t like the term but terms like that have been used in the past. Malcolm Turnbull gets to his feet, but doesn’t answer the question: I thank the honourable member for her question and, Mr Speaker, I accept the rather snide barb in her question. Let me say this to the honourable member. Throughout my life, throughout my life, my wife and I have started one business after another. We created jobs. We’ve invested. We know what creates enterprise and jobs. And we know that families like Nick and Louise, who get on with investment, create jobs. And all of those hereditary union princelings opposite, all of those people, regardless of the donations that they, the contributions they get from union members, giving them away, giving them to political organisations that want to put their members out of work, that, MrSpeaker, on this side of the House we know what enterprise and jobs are about. We know it’s investment. Every one of our policies, every one, is focused on creating more investment and more employment. That’s why we are resolute in our determination to deliver lower electricity prices, affordable power, reliable power, that’s our commitment. And we’re already reducing the burden of tax on thousands of small and medium businesses and, Mr Speaker, the members on the other side can mock and scoff as much as they like... Not everybody has a privileged ride to power through a union job. No, they don’t. No, they don’t. The reality is, Mr Speaker, hard work, enterprise, investment – that’s what delivers the jobs, that’s what’s delivered 371,000 jobs over the last year. And so I say, Mr Speaker, for those who have done so well from the union movement and ridden on the backs of the workers into parliament, think a little about how the jobs those workers have were created. Not by you, but by hardworking businessmen and women like Nick and Louise. And Tim Watts just became the first MP to be asked to leave. Craig Kelly has the dixer and he all but yells it across the chamber. You get the feeling that he wishes he could be fighting Labor on unions, but instead, he’s being made to ask a question about lower energy prices and whether there are any alternative approaches. You know what an actual alternative approach might be? Using your alloted question time to ask a question that is actually on the behalf of your constituents, instead of what your political party wants to prosecute. I hate dixers. I hate them. Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten offer their condolences to Linda Burney. The whole chamber is silent. I’ll bring those to you shortly. Then it’s into the questions, and the first one is on the AWU raid. Shorten: Yesterday, it was revealed that the federal police did not have the resources to investigate the importation of 1.6 tonnes of cocaine. But on the very same day, the prime minister’s Registered Organisations Commission sent at least 25 AFP officers to look at a donation to GetUp. How can the prime minister find the resources to investigate the political … He runs out of time, but Turnbull knows what the question is. He practically has written answers. Turnbull: The leader of the opposition talked about a 10-year-old donation. Is he suggesting that breaches of the law, breaches of union rules, should not be investigated because they’re 10 years old? That would be very convenient for the leader of the opposition. That would, indeed, be very convenient for the Leader of the Opposition ... what we have seen from the Labor party since that search warrant was executed is an attack on the integrity of the Australian Federal Police. This is what they know as well as we do, as we all do, that the Australian Federal Police is absolutely independent in its operations. They decide who to investigate, how to investigate, that is a matter for them and so it should be. But what we saw yesterday was the member for Gorton say the government is using the power of the state to attack its political opponents. The prime minister is willing to use the police like his plaything, they are accusing the Federal Police of acting on political direction. That’s what they’re doing. And, Mr Speaker, it is very, very familiar rhetoric because this is exactly what John Setka said in that notorious speech in Melbourne when he accused the Federal Police of being a political police force and of being political henchmen of the government. Mr Speaker, the reality is this: the Labor party does not respect the integrity of the Federal Police. They are all too ready to accuse them of being a political police force and, Mr Speaker, there is nothing in substance that differs from what the member for Gorton said yesterday and what John Setka said on his platform in Melbourne. The same denial of the rule of law, the same contempt for the rule of law, the same contempt for the independence of the police and, Mr Speaker, the question for the leader of the opposition is not just why the AWU gave $100,000 to an organisation whose principle objective seems to be shutting down industries in which members of the AWU work, but also why he has not apologised for and disowned the outrageous attacks on the independence, the integrity of the men and women that keep us safe. The Greens have come together as a united front to condemn the AWU raids. Following on from Adam Bandt this morning, leader Richard Di Natale says it “was part of a broader crackdown on people speaking out against this government”. This is a government that sought to remove the charitable status of environment organisations; it is a government that seeks to silence whistleblowers and people speaking out against detention through the imposition of harsh laws. What we have is a government that is using every tool it has to silence dissent, to crack down on civil society and effectively say to its opponents ‘we are not going to tolerate you’. That is what we see in a police state, not in a democracy like Australia. Utterly shameful from a prime minister who doesn’t like being held to account, who doesn’t like criticism and will do everything he can to silence his opponents. We are extremely disappointed and angry that in a country like Australia we are seeing the police force being used in this way.” Di Natale says the Greens will be taking advantage of the ROC’s appearance in front of an estimates committee this afternoon. We are getting very close to question time, so what do we know? Michaelia Cash referred a historical donation matter involving the AWU and GetUp while Bill Shorten was union secretary to the Registered Organisations Commission. The AFP, directed by the ROC, carried out raids on the AWU Sydney and Melbourne offices yesterday afternoon. The media were tipped off, arriving before the AFP. Labor has accused the government of misusing its power to target political rivals. The government has denied that and accused Labor of questioning the integrity of the AFP. Everyone is angry. We all caught up? Other than the AWU raids, what else is on your QT bingo card? Anyone predicting what time I’ll fall over? So many surprises await us! Maurice Blackburn, who are representing the AWU, have filed an application with the federal court, challenging the validity of the AFP raids. Josh Bornstein, the firm’s principal, said the raids were “an outrageous abuse of power” and the Registered Organisations Commission could have written to the union, or produced a summons, for the documents. “None of these actions were taken. Instead, a highly orchestrated media strategy was implemented so that television cameras arrived before the AFP to capture the raid and thereby seek to paint the union in the worst possible light,” he said in a statement. “This is an outrageous abuse of power and a farcical misuse of police resources that raises serious questions about the conduct of both the ROC and federal minister Michaelia Cash, who instigated the investigation. “Prior to the raid, we wrote to the ROC, expressing our concern about possible political interference by the federal government in this matter. “We sought copies of all communications it has had with minister Cash and her staff but the ROC has declined to provide us with those documents. We will continue to press for that crucial information to be provided to the AWU.” The hearing has been set down for 2.15pm in Melbourne in the federal court. Labor’s Nick Champion told Sky News he has some concerns about the AWU raids: I am concerned for our country. I am concerned for the type of politics that are now becoming normalised by this government. What we had yesterday was a Kafkaesque show trial, where the media was notified before the union was aware. The union, as I understand it, was informed by the media subsequently appearing out the front of their offices. What this was was a government initiated show trial, it was designed for one purpose and this is to do damage to the leader of the opposition and do damage to the union movement and really there is no substance behind it other than that. It should be noted that Michaelia Cash has denied that she or her office tipped off the media (in estimates). Champion says he is not accusing any individual of letting the media know, but says: “it’s a strange consequence that a government initiated, you know, investigation and the reference was provided by the government, after, you know, some toing and froing, the government admitted to that this morning on Sky. Those facts weren’t forthcoming in the prime minister’s interview but they were by the justice minister, who said Michaelia Cash provided the reference to the Registered Organisations Commission.” He reiterated that Labor “has no beef” with the AFP for doing their job. Josh Frydenberg is still trying to talk energy, but keeps hitting the roadblocks of, you know, no modelling to back up the claims. “... Everyone has said this is a practical, workable, credible, way forward and that is why the Labor party should get on board, that is why we are getting further modelling undertaken.” Further modelling? The analysis by the energy security board has given us a sense of where the savings will be, that is put in writing of $100 to $115, that was analysis that they undertook, based on a series of modelling that they had done previously on a whole range of relevant areas. So we need to get more modelling done, I have written to the energy security board, and when that modelling is done, it will be provided to the states through the Coag process so that we can have a constructive debate at the meeting at the end of the November. So far, the Labor states don’t seem inclined to go along. Yesterday (was it only yesterday?) Malcolm Turnbull made the somewhat extraordinary admission that the states are saying one thing to him privately and another thing publicly. Keep in mind that Queensland is expected to head to the polls (the chatter will not stop that the election is being called within days) and potentially could have another government by that Coag meeting – and One Nation could be part of it. Ken Wyatt is today’s guest at the National Press Club. He’s giving a speech on “Australia’s New Age of Opportunity”. It’s focussing on aged care and the health, both physical and mental, of older Australians. Here’s a taste: The challenge for all of us is that longevity has been rising at a remarkable rate and people have a lot more time as workers, consumers and family members to influence society and the economy. Its 85 years since the phrase “Life begins at 40” became famous as a self-help book title. It’s time we helped ourselves again – our challenge is to change attitudes to ageing and, just as globalisation and technology have shaped the way we live and work, so will living longer impact on individuals, the private and public sector, and almost all aspects of society. Lynda Gratton and Andrew Scott from the London Business School cite, in their publication The 100 Year Life, state ‘If the child you are thinking about was born in the US, Canada, Italy or France there is a 50% chance that they will live until at least 104. If the child you had in mind was born in Japan, then they can reasonably be expected to live to a staggering 107 years’. These projections are the real deal. Therefore, we need to seriously refocus our attention on living longer and living better. This brings challenges, even for forward-thinking governments. The reality is that in most developed countries fertility rates are falling below the population replacement line, creating a conundrum for future workforce needs that will also impact on how we deliver services to older Australians. Remember how I said Labor was angry? Here is some of Chris Bowen, speaking to Laura Jayes on Sky a little bit ago: Now let me be very clear. Our beef isn’t with the AFP here. They are doing their job, they have no choice as to how they go about these things, but the government, a cabinet minister, a senior member of the government, Michaelia Cash, is responsible for this. She sent the reference to the Registered Organisations Commission. She asked for this witch-hunt, and if this witch-hunt is designed by the government to damage Bill Shorten, which it clearly is, then they must account for the abuse of power, taxpayers’ money, which is going on here. Is this an outrage? Yes it is. Are we angry about it? Yes we are. Should the Australian taxpayers be angry about it? They have every right to be. I expect ‘who tipped off the media’ will be a question time issue, as well. Bowen goes on: Point one. Point two: the reference was sent by this cabinet minister. Not a day goes by Laura when I don’t open a newspaper and find some piece of dodgy analysis which Michaelia Cash has instigated, initiated, got her department or her office to do. I don’t know what this cabinet minister does apart from run a smear campaign against Bill Shorten and the Labor party. I mean she is a cabinet minister with a serious job to do. She should be concerned about wages growth in Australia. She should be concerned about actually improving the productivity and economy of the nation. All she is interested in is this witchhunt. I mean she is operating a political smear campaign as a cabinet minister and we’ve had enough of it and the Australian people have had enough of it. On the other point, there is a serious question. You say the process will work Laura, the media were outside the AWU’s office 15 minutes before the AWU even knew there was a raid. Now there are very serious … Jayes: We’ve seen media outside other grades, for example when the AFP raided the Channel 7 offices … Bowen replies: If we are told that this is a serious investigation it would be a potential breach of the efficacy of that investigation if the media were tipped off. Now we all know the media were tipped off. The media did not, with all due respect you are all very fine journalists but you didn’t just wander down to the AWU thinking ‘I don’t know something about me tells me there’s a raid on’... so there were tip-offs. So they have very serious questions to answer by this government about how the media knew about this. The fact that the media were there indicates to me this is a political stunt and a smear campaign by this Liberal government and it is an abuse of power. Jayes: But Chris Bowen, I question how are you can call this a political stunt without at the same time questioning the integrity of the AFP. Bowen: We’re not asserting that the AFP told the media ... what I’m saying is the government has serious questions to answer as to how the media found out about it. Now I don’t think it’s acceptable to say the media was at Channel 7 or elsewhere, just because it’s happened once before doesn’t make it right. The AFP has got a job to do. Now if they have to go in and get these documents because they had no choice about it, if that’s the case, then their ability to do that was undermined by the media leak. So what I’m saying to you is there are very, very serious questions to answer as to how the media found out about this. If the media was tipped off by people who weren’t in the AFP it is a very serious abuse of power for political purposes by this government I have seen a lot of commentators have mentioned they are donating to GetUp on the back of these raids. The ACTU have launched their own fundraising campaign I should clarify from my earlier post – the Registered Organisations Commission is investigating the AWU Victoria branch over financial obligations and record-keeping as stated but the AFP raid was specifically investigating the AWU’s donation to GetUp and other political donations to Labor candidates, including then national secretary Bill Shorten’s election in 2007 in Maribyrnong. GetUp received $100k from the AWU in 2005 and Guardian Australia has confirmed the AWU made a total of $130,500 in donations to Labor candidates before the 2007 election, including $25,000 for Shorten’s election. The AWU national secretary, Daniel Walton, said:“The AWU national executive met to determine and approve the donations to GetUp and the ALP ... Those donations were made to further the interests of AWU members, we stood by them then and stand by them today.” Walton said the donations were disclosed to the Australian Electoral Commission at the time. The AWU Vic secretary, Ben Davis, said: “We believe the [GetUp] donation was made in accordance with rules and objectives of the AWU. It’s a matter for the Registered Organisations Commission, they’re investigating it, but instead of issuing us with a notice produce they came yesterday with the AFP.” Davis said the donations were disclosed and the AWU had even “bragged in [its] journal” about supporting GetUp at the time. “It’s a matter of public record, the fact that we’d give a donation is hardly a shock, especially to Labor candidates including our [then] national secretary [Bill Shorten].” The education minister, Simon Birmingham, after also giving his condolences to Linda Burney, had a few things to say about the Productivity Commission report. (It seems like that was handed down a lifetime ago. It was about this time yesterday, but I have aged about 40 years in that time.) As it pertains to higher education, and the government’s proposed cuts, this is what Birmingham had to say: Well, I would hope that people will see the merit in delivering sustainability in higher education across the country. Universities have seen vast growth in their funding – some 70 plus per cent of growth in funding since 2009, a rate that’s twice the rate of economic growth – we’re proposing to simply slow the rate of funding growth. Under our reforms universities would still see funding growth of around 23% over the next four years. There are many small businesses around the country who would love that type of funding growth and I call upon the parliament, particularly the crossbenches but also the Labor party, to recognise the commonsense in simply slowing that rate of growth to make university funding more sustainable for the long term. He still wants to get there by the end of the year, but first he has to convince the Nick Xenophon Team, which so far, have said no. Look, I remain hopeful and committed to working for solutions and, of course though, as we’ve indicated with the Xenophon Team stance they took last week, if those solutions cannot be found then we will have to consider the implications, not only for higher education policy, but also to make sure, as we always do, that those budget issues are addressed. And given the rate of spending growth in universities over the last few years and its contribution to the budget deficit to date, it is entirely reasonable to continue to expect that universities make some contribution to budget repair with a slightly lower rate of growth in their funding. Before estimates this morning, Labor senator Doug Cameron was doorstopped and said it was time to go to an election. He said he didn’t see the need to further scrutinise the connection between Labor and GetUp: Why would there be need for any scrutiny? I mean GetUp is an organisation that has got similar views to Labor in some issues, it has got different views to Labor on other issues. It’s an organisation that is part of the democratic process in this country and all we see now is attacks by this divided rabble of a government, a government that’s in almost terminal decline, can’t get on with each other, can’t provide decent policy in this country and set out to attack the trade union movement. This is an absolute disgrace. We are now turning into one of those countries where ordinary workers can’t organise effectively, the democratic rights of workers at work are being taken away by the attacks of this government and it’s about time that this government actually concentrated on the real issues for government. The public understand what’s been happening here yesterday. It’s nothing more than a political attack on Bill Shorten, a political attack on the Labor Party and a political attack on the AWU and the trade union movement generally. This government is an absolute disgrace, the public have had enough of them. We have had poll after poll saying they are not delivering and it’s about time to let them go to an election and let’s resolve this quickly. The inflation report helps work out how the RBA reacts on a number of things, including interest rates, and it has had a fairly long-held inflation target band of between 2 and 3%. Well, CPI rose by 0.6% in the September quarter, the ABS reports, which is short of the 0.8% expectation. That brings the year on year inflation rate to 1.8%, short of that 2% target. Here are some of the ABS’s headline figures: OVERVIEW OF CPI MOVEMENTS The most significant price rises this quarter are electricity (+8.9%), tobacco (+4.1%), international holiday travel and accommodation (+4.1%) and new dwelling purchase by owner-occupiers (+0.8%). The most significant offsetting price falls this quarter are vegetables (-10.9%), automotive fuel (-2.3%) and telecommunication equipment and services (-1.5%). As for the government argument that the Registered Organisations Commission was about making sure union members’ money was being spent correctly, Ed Husic had this to say: Yeah and they go through all the internal processes of making sure that unions and their decision-making bodies tick them off properly and they have to account for them when they get their books looked at by again, the workplace relations authorities that you have to submit your financial reports to and the way that decisions get made and the way that you can get audited. As I said, the Coalition has form on this, they set up a royal commission into pink bats, they set up a royal commission into trade unions. In fact they’ve set up a royal commission into pink bat safety – why can’t we get a report out of this government that says what they have done to improve safety on job programs like work for the dole, where people have lost their lives, Kieran, and we still can’t get the minister to front up and say this is what we’re doing to make our job programs safer. While all eyes in Canberra are on the AWU controversy, parliament’s joint committee of public accounts and audit has this morning given two major government agencies – the ATO, and immigration and border protection – a public blast for not being compliant with mandatory mitigation strategies for cybersecurity, and for not being “cyber resilient”. The committee has given the two agencies a deadline of June 2018 to report back on actions they are taking to improve their cyber security “including advice as to barriers and timelines to complete outstanding actions.” The ATO told the committee they intended to be compliant with the government’s mitigation strategies by November 2017, but the Department of Immigration and Border Protection “could not provide a date for when full compliance with all of the top four mitigation strategies would be achieved, despite previously advising the committee that full compliance would be achieved by December 2016”. The chair of the committee is the Liberal senator Dean Smith. He says cybersecurity needs to be a top priority for all government entities. He says there needs to be a strong culture of prioritising cybersecurity “within the context of entity-wide strategic objectives”. The Greens MP Adam Bandt also had a few things to say about the raid this morning: This is a dark day for democracy and the rule of law. When there are claims that 7/11 were stealing money from their workers, the government didn’t lift a finger. When there’s claims that casino bosses are rigging machines and breaking the law, the government doesn’t lift a finger. But when a union donates money to a citizens’ group, to speak up and hold the government to account, the government sends in the police in the full view of the nightly news. This isn’t to do with the AFP – the AFP were doing the job that was asked of them. This is squarely at the foot of the government, who established a little while ago, the Registered Organisations Commission, an organisation people may not have heard of, but is turning out to be for unions what the ABCC was for the construction industry. The ROC has shown it is not a watchdog, it is an attack dog. And it beggars belief, it beggars belief that the first port of call when you want to get documents from someone in a case that is before the court, is to send in the police. This organisation, well, let’s look at the chronology – the government said ‘let’s look at the organisations commission, we want you to start an investigation into a union and a claims it might have given money to a political organisation, a campaigning organisation called GetUp’, the next thing we know, they start that investigation and before they even ask the union to hand over the documents, they send in the police. Now, I don’t have any particular connection with the AWU, the AWU have publicly criticised the Greens for moving too quickly towards renewables. But that is not the point, that is not the point. In Australia, you don’t send in the police against your political opponents. You don’t have raids on organisations for documents, that they would have been willing to hand over, and indeed, properly did hand over, in the royal commission a couple of years ago. Malcolm Turnbull is becoming more like Donald Trump every day. We are back now in the Joh Bjelke-Petersen era, where if you dare to speak up in this country, the government will crack down on you. We are seeing it with environmental groups and we are seeing it with unions – if you’ve got a white collar, the government turns a blind eye, but if you have a blue collar, the government throws the book at you. Back in employment estimates for a moment and Michaelia Cash said she learned of the raids on the Australian Workers’ Union offices from the television. Another official, whose name I missed, said when she spoke to Cash’s office, to alert them to the raids (that’s what I believe the context to be, I was watching three things at once), they said they knew because they were watching it on the television. The Registered Organisation Commission’s 2016/17 annual report has just been released and gives news details of what it is investigating the Australian Workers’ Union for – possible breaches of financial obligations and record keeping. According to the report, there are 10 referrals regarding the Victorian branch of the AWU from the Trade Union Royal Commission that are subject of investigation. The referrals relate to section 331 of the Registered Organisations Act which “enables the commissioner ... to conduct an investigation if there are reasonable grounds to believe financial obligations or civil penalty provisions have been contravened”. “The 10 referrals were accompanied by more than 23,000 pages of supporting materials across a broad range of potential contraventions, including failing to maintain proper records. The ROC is continuing this investigation.” The report also says that the ROC started an investigation in November 2016 “regarding alleged breaches of the requirements to maintain proper records by the Vic branch of the AWU”. The investigation is listed as ongoing, and estimated to be completed on 30 November, 2017. It specifies two sections it is investigating: The obligation to keep a register of members; and The obligation for financial reports to “give a true and fair view of the financial position and performance” of the union. The treasury secretary John Fraser has given his opening statement in treasury estimates, painting quite the rosy picture: [There are] positive outlooks for both the domestic and global economy, we remain on track to return to budget balance in 2020-21, as expected in the May budget. Since the budget, we released the final budget outcome for 2016-17 which showed that the outcome for the underlying cash balance and net operating balance were better than expected in May and significantly so. I might add, that some very, very preliminary data for the first quarter of this financial year was very encouraging on the receipt side. But he said Australia still needed to “get its own house in order” We can lead by example by remaining open to pursuing structural reforms that make our economy stronger and more flexible and ensuring our fiscal policy is credible. But it’s also not great news for wage growth. As the cyclical constraints that have weighed on the economy recede, wages growth will accelerate. This will be assisted by inflation and inflationary expectations moving higher. In other news, it will take some time. This also happened. And the answer? I didn’t get a chance to transcribe Tanya Plibersek’s interview with Fran Kelly this morning, but the transcript has just dropped from Bill Shorten’s office (this is normal and both leaders’ usually do it, but there is no timeframe on when a transcript may arrive). Here’s a taste of what I heard this morning from Plibersek: What they’re doing is they’ve set up a royal commission, which found nothing. That didn’t work, so they’ve now set up the Registered Organisations Commission and then the government is using that commission to try and get the Australian federal police to launch these raids. And this is not the fault of the Australian federal police – we support them and support their work. But on the very day when the police commissioner is giving evidence that they are under-resourced, that the $185m budget cuts to the Australian federal police have meant this year alone, 151 staff will be lost from the Australian federal police, and they are not investigating serious crimes, like drug trafficking, like gun trafficking, international organised crime, because they don’t have the resources to do it. The Registered Organisations Commission sending them out on these goose hunts, wild goose chases, because it can. Now, does any Australian really think that it is unusual or surprising that the Australian Workers’ Union has backed Labor candidates in the federal election context? I mean, they’ve done it campaign after campaign. You heard the national secretary on Sabra Lane this morning explaining very coherently that in its over 100-year history, the Australian Workers’ Union has tried to get Labor members into parliament because they know that Labor members of parliament will always stand up for the pay and conditions of working people. Big surprise there Fran. Is anybody honestly surprised? Community services estimates is on today. Alan Tudge’s office have released a statement, the headline figures of which are: An almost eightfold increase in departure prohibition orders over the least two years has netted almost $10m in outstanding child support debts. In 2016/17 more than 1,800 departure prohibition orders (DPOs) were issued to parents with significant outstanding child support debts, up from just 218 in 2014-15. The value of debts recovered has almost doubled to $9.9m. I’m at the Australian Council of Social Services Conference in Melbourne, where Bill Shorten’s standard address to the annual conference was replaced with a prerecorded video message to account for the sitting week. The video featured the opposition leader affecting a casual pose alongside Jenny Macklin, with the two taking turns summarising Labor policy for four minutes. The most interesting part of the presentation was its introduction by the Victorian Council of Social Services chief executive, Emma King, who took a moment to reflect on the the “astonishing” Australian federal police raids on Australian Workers’ Union offices in Melbourne and Sydney last night. Said King: “I think we are powerfully reminded about how important it is that we as a community stand and act in solidarity to demand the kind of democracy that we deserve.” The national secretary of the Australian Workers’ Union, Daniel Walton, has told Sky that once all the court issues are worked through, he would be happy to release the documents in question. He has also made it clear that the union has no criticism of the Australian federal police: On Friday they decided to commence an investigation, yesterday we were meeting with our lawyers to work out how to prepare and respond to that in a proper matter. What we then later found out during that meeting, was a whole lot of media had started to gather out the front of our offices in Sydney and Melbourne and the media informed our staff that there was about to be a warrant served by the AFP. That draws significant concerns as to the integrity of the investigation from the registered organisations commission ... Some 15 minutes later, we then get a phone call come through from the Registered Organisations Commission, saying ‘heads up we are about issue a warrant and raid your office’ and shortly thereafter, the AFP turned up. We certainly have no issues in terms of the AFP, in fact they were incredibly nice people who were in the office yesterday. They are who we want police to be, they are extremely smart and diligent people, they were there under the orders of the registered organisations commission, the ROC which was set up by the Turnbull government to investigate trade unions. We are concerned it is a misuse of police power at a time when the commissioner is talking about the inability, due to a lack of resources at the AFP to investigate ... “ Walton said today’s court action, aimed at having the documents returned, was due to the union’s concerns about how the investigation was commenced. Labor’s Stephen Jones also pointed the finger at the government for the raids: Labor has got absolutely nothing to hide. The union has absolutely nothing to hide. They have already produced the documents. This is what is most ridiculous about what occurred yesterday. The union has already produced the documents. They produced them to the government’s $46m royal commission which produced diddly squat, by the way. So the union has already produced the documents and now, the government has been involved in this massive charade clearly to distract attention from its own political problems. They are rightly condemned for an improper use of the agencies of government.” The government is painting Labor’s response as an attack on the integrity of the Australian federal police. Labor says it is criticising the government’s use of the AFP. Question time is going to be a free for all. Michaelia Cash is facing employment estimates and has faced questioning from Doug Cameron about Nigel Hadgkiss – the former ABCC boss who was made to step down after being found guilty of breaching the Fair Work Act. She has been asked to clarify when she first learned of the allegations (22 August 2016) against Hadgkiss and why she did not step him down. She said she did not act, because at the time, they were unproven allegations and she gave Hadgkiss the presumption of innocence. “I assume you’ll be doing a press conference after this, asking Mr Shorten to stand aside, in relation to the allegations, that have been made against him, that donations were not properly authorised when he was in charge of the AWU. Or is it that they are merely allegations at this stage and he should be afforded due process.” And then it turned a little nasty. Cameron: “Did you simply accept Mr Hadgkiss’s denial as a fact?” Cash: “Mr Hadgkiss denied the allegations. It would not have been appropriate for me to prejudge the allegations against Mr Hadgkiss before the court process had concluded. If you want to start prejudging, I am very happy though to sit here and have questions asked about every CFMEU official that has alleged that they will rape children, happy to talk about that. Happy to talk about Luke Collier, your very, very good friend, and yes, we will be getting to him later on today, not only has he been found to have committed domestic violence, he is now on an assault charge in my home state of Western Australia. Very happy to talk about his criminal record. Happy to talk about the criminal record of John Setka, who actually said, what was it, that they would hunt down the families of ABCC inspectors happy to talk about all of that and whether or not you have verified whether or not that was true or false.” Cameron denied he was a “very, very good friend” of Collier, adding he didn’t think he had met him. Doors were busy this morning. Mike Bowers was out catching the arrivals Labor MP Matt Thistlethwaite (a name, as someone who has a lisp, that will haunt me in my sleep) has also had a few things to say this morning, and he brought a prop: This is the statement of claim that’s been filed against the Commonwealth Bank by Austrac, 53,000 alleged breaches of Australia’s anti-money laundering and terrorism financing laws, in 1,640 allegations of money laundering used for drug trafficking and other terrorism financing purposes by the Australian federal police and Austrac against the Commonwealth Bank. Do you think that the AFP raided the Commonwealth Bank offices when these allegations were made? Of course they didn’t, of course they didn’t. The Commonwealth Bank’s been involved in the CommInsure scandal, in the wealth management scandal, ANZ, the NAB and Westpac have been alleged to rig the bank bill swap rate, do you think the AFP raided any of those banks offices when those allegations were made? Of course they did not. Yet a union is alleged to have made a donation to an organisation 10 years ago and the AFP turn up with 26 officers with the media waiting outside in what appears to be a politically motivated raid on a union and a witch-hunt aimed at smearing the reputation of the opposition leader. Now the government have some very, very serious questions to answer in respect to what occurred yesterday, most notably, did the minister Michaelia Cash, anyone in her office or anyone in this Turnbull government, request the Registered Organisations Commission seek warrants to raid the AWU officers? And did anyone in the minister’s, prime minister’s or anyone in the Turnbull government tip the media off to ensure they were there to film these raids? The government’s seeking to turn the AFP into an episode of CSI for political purposes, if that is the case it’s a new low in Australian politics and the Turnbull government have some serious questions to answer. Labor is angry. Properly angry about these raids. I hope the government wasn’t planning on talking about anything else today, because I don’t think they will get the chance. Alan Tudge has just released a statement in support of Linda Burney and her family: I would like to offer my deepest condolences to the shadow minister for human services, Linda Burney, and her family on the passing of her son, Binni Kirkbright-Burney. It is a terrible tragedy for any family to lose a cherished child. My thoughts and prayers are with her and her family at this extremely sad time. Michael Keenan has had a few things to say about Brendan O’Connor’s statement yesterday. For a refresher, here is some of what O’Connor said: Well it is unusual to see the police involved in what is a civil regulator’s coercive powers. I mean, it may well be the case that the police could be used as authorised officers of the Registered Organisations Commission. That may well be the case. But it’s a very good question in the sense that at the very – this is a civil regulator, and yet we’ve got crime fighters raiding offices because of the role of a civil regulator. And that again, I think, highlights that the priority of this government is to deploy federal police for civil matters, because it’s about attacking its political opponents, rather than fighting crime. And that should not be the priority of the police. And as someone who was the minister for justice, and I have a very high regard for the Australian federal police, having worked with them as their minister for three years, I have to say they must feel compromised in having to deal with this matter in this way. Let me just say this. Raiding two offices because of, at the very best, an administrative or civil breach that may have happened or may not have happened 10 years ago, using federal police in such a manner, having the media called in to make sure it was all broadcast, is a remarkable thing to happen. Ten years after the alleged event, which is a civil matter. It is quite extraordinary. And it only points to this. That this grubby prime minister is willing to use the police like his plaything, his own personal asset, to go after his political opponents. This prime minister has got a glass jaw. We saw it on election night. We saw it when he wanted to call the police because he didn’t like the Medicare campaign Labor ran. And they’ve called the police today. And the prime minister and the minister for employment have a lot of questions to answer. So does the regulator, by the way. But the correlation must be this government has used its agencies in a manner that is unreasonable, unconscionable and deserves censure. Keenan responded: [Brendan O’Connor] went out there and said we are using the Australian federal police as a political tool. Now that is an outrageous slur on the federal police and it needs to be repudiated by Bill Shorten and others who lead the Labor party. The referral was made by Minister Cash. Now many people make referrals to members of our law enforcement and others in the law enforcement community all of the time. The Labor party makes referrals all of the time. Then the agency that has got the referral makes a judgment about whether they are going to investigate and how that investigation may proceed. We have professionals working for us, whose role is to uphold the law, and they go about their job upholding the law in a way that they deem necessary and they deem fit. Now these search warrants yesterday, like all search warrants, were granted by a magistrate. Is the Labor party accusing us of also interfering with the judiciary? This is a remarkable thing, particularly for a former home affairs minister to say, it is really up to Bill Shorten to stand up and say does he agree that the AFP is a political police force, like others in the union movement have been accusing, or will he repudiate it and stand with the men and women in our law enforcement community and allow them to do their job? Michael Keenan and Craig Laundy have been defending the raids this morning. But before we get to them, here is a little more of what Malcolm Turnbull said this morning: The AFP are completely independent as Labor knows, as indeed as Mr Shorten has said on previous occasions. He knows that as well as all of us. This is just the desperation of a Labor party that is a wholly owned subsidiary, a wholly owned subsidiary of the CFMEU, a trade union that treats the law as nothing to be concerned about. Look at Sally McManus, the head of ACTU, she goes on television and says unions should be entitled to break the law – you know what, they are not. Everyone has to comply with the law, that is what the rule of law means, the rule of law means that everyone is bound by the law and that includes unions and it is about time that Labor and Mr Shorten recognise that Australians will not accept their continued defence and complicit support of the CFMEU, a union which has, whose rap sheet is as long as your arm, have got dozens of union officials up before the courts, and of course you have seen the appalling language and threats in Queensland that they have made against workers at North Oakey. I have got no comment other than to say the royal commission did a very, had a very long inquiry, made some valuable recommendations, many of which we have now been able to legislate through the parliament. These are again, we set up ... institutions like this [registered organisations commission] are set up to uphold the law and they are conducting an investigation and they should be allowed to do that and the political abuse that we’ve seen heaped on the police, by the Labor party is a disgrace. The only smear is the smear Labor is trying to conduct against the Australian federal police. They are accusing the Australian federal police of being politically motivated. That is a disgrace. Bill Shorten knows that is a lie and he should apologise for it. The police arrangements in respect of our home are the same as have been the case for previous prime ministers, including Kevin Rudd, who of course, his home was in Brisbane, that is the fact and our track record on keeping Australians safe, whether it is providing the police, our intelligence agencies or the ADF with the financial, legal, technological tools they need to keep us safe speak for themselves. Thirteen, 13 terrorist plots disrupted since 2014. That is a record of the persistence, the professionalism, the commitment of our agencies. They are the best in the world and I call on the Labor party to support them and to stop this continued denigration. The rule of law applies to everybody and what happens is when there is an investigation, that affects the union, immediately the Labor party attacks the police. Just consider what [CFMEU boss] John Setka said about the Australian federal police in that speech at the rally in Melbourne to which Bill Shorten sent a greeting message. Setka’s attack on the Australian federal police was abusive, vile, disgusting; has Bill Shorten disassociated himself from that? When is Bill Shorten going to stand up for the rule of law? When is he going to say to Australia the Labor party will disassociate itself from the CFMEU and its thugs and criminals? When is he going to have the courage to do what Bob Hawke did with the Builders Labourers’ Federation? The reason he won’t is money. The CFMEU is the biggest donor to the Labor party. Labor is a wholly owned subsidiary of a trade union that regards the law as something of no account. The matter is ... the ROC matters, matters are referred to the ROC, but as to what they investigate and how they investigate it, is entirely a matter for them. This is a matter that the ROC is investigating independently and they should be allowed to do their work. Full stop. And it is about time that the Labor party stopped interfering and trying to use, you know, their threats in the media, to intimidate the agencies, including the AFP, whose job it is to enforce and maintain the rule of law. The matter is being referred to the ROC, they are entitled to inves ... look, ah, police, ah, agencies, ah, you know, various regulatory agencies have many matters referred to them. You know, Mark Dreyfus is always referring things to the Australian federal police, he is, he is, he is always doing that. And ... they look at all of these things, all of this information, ah, and it is their duty to consider them independently and objectively and then take such action as they believe is appropriate. Let me be very clear. I stand for the rule of law. I stand for defending and respecting the agencies that enforce it and uphold it and keep us safe and the question for Bill Shorten is, where does he stand? Does he only support the Australian federal police and the rule of law when it doesn’t impact on him? Is he like Sally McManus who thinks the law should apply to everybody except big trade unions? The rule of law applies to everyone, unions, business, governments. Everybody. It is about time Bill Shorten told us where he stands. Does he stand for the law, for the rule of law and the agencies that uphold it, or is he going to just continue to be apologist for unions that break, defy and hold the law in contempt. He moves on to what he calls “the extraordinary events of late yesterday”. I am proud of having spent my adult life working and standing up for working people and the less disadvantaged of our society and I am frankly appalled at the Turnbull government hitting a new low yesterday, with their attempts to smear myself, Labor and unions. This is an increasingly desperate government who stands for nothing and their last resort is to smear their opponents. And this is not the first time the desperate Liberals have tried to smear me. A whole royal commission was set up in no small part to attack my reputation. $80m of taxpayer money wasted. I answered and attended that royal commission over two days and I answered nearly 1,000 questions and at the end of that massive waste of money, that political smear fest, there were no adverse findings made and yet again, yesterday, the government is wasting taxpayer money in an increasingly grubby effort, by a grubby government and quite frankly a grubby prime minister, who have been exposed for standing for nothing and all they have left is to try and damage the reputation of their opponents. I want to make this pledge to the Australian people: Turnbull can be as focused as he wants on smearing me, I am focused on serving you.” He said the use of “30 AFP officers to collect documents, which the union has said all they had to do is ring up, was an amazing waste of money”. But we understand what this is about – and I have the greatest respect for the Australian federal police and its serving officers. What I don’t respect is that the regulator, at the behest of the government, is conducting a political witch hunt designed to throw mud in the hope that some will stick. Now I know that this government can keep digging and digging and digging and they can keep wasting taxpayer money right up to the next election, there is nothing of substance or foundation and the royal commission established that. The royal commission had many more resources than this latest pitiful attempt. But the fact of the matter is, this is a government that has run out of anything positive to say, so all they can do is attack their opponents. The AFP just didn’t work this out on their own, no doubt they were directed by the Registered Organisations Committee. This is a little-known organisation which was set up in the last few months by the government to do exactly what we predicted they would do – hunt down and smear the reputation of the opponents of the government. I do think the government has serious questions to answer. I think Turnbull and his minister have serious questions to answer. How is it possible that journalists were able to be there in advance of the police visit and how on earth did the journalists know about the raid? I don’t think the AFP told the media, I am sure it was the government. The AFP have got a job to do. My criticism is with the government of Australia. They are using the Registered Organisations Commission and through them, the federal police to carry out the political dirty work of the government. I think it is a low use of high office. We all know why the police were there yesterday. They are looking at matters which the government want them to look at through through the Registered Organisations Committee. Does anyone think, that if I wasn’t leader of the opposition, any of this farce would have happened yesterday? I have the greatest of respect for the AFP, I don’t question the integrity of the AFP, I question the integrity of Turnbull and the government. Is this really the best use of scarce police resources, is this really the best use of the AFP, when we need them out there catching the drug criminals, going after the crime syndicates. Only yesterday morning, the commissioner of the Australian federal police made it clear that anti-crime operations were going wanting because there weren’t enough resources. I think the government should hang their head in shame in this matter. It is not about the AFP as far as I am concerned. Let’s really get to the heart of this matter – the government doesn’t like the fact that unions make donations to progressive causes promoted by Labor candidates and the government don’t like me, but they shouldn’t be using taxpayer resources on this nonsense. We didn’t get a chance to ask any questions on this, as we did not receive an alert for the press conference. It doesn’t look like a lot of media organisations did. Bill Shorten has extended his condolences to Linda Burney and her family. Yesterday, her son passed away. A dearly loved, 33-year-old son, of Linda Burney. I can’t imagine what it is like as a parent to lose your child. I know how much her son loved Linda and how much Linda loved her son. At this time, on behalf of Linda and her family, we would request that the media respect her privacy. It doesn’t feel right to jump straight back into politics after learning of such heartache, but that is the job. Malcolm Turnbull has just finished his press conference. He tried to make it about energy, and continued what has become his latest press conference gimmick–holding his own question and answer session with a business owner. But as you would expect, it was all about the AWU raids. Here is some of what he had to say: The AWU has questions to answer, Bill Shorten has questions to answer, why his union was making $100,000 donation to GetUp, an organisation which I might say, is opposed to most of the industries which employ members of the AWU. But they are questions for Mr Shorten to answer and I just want to say that the hysterical attack by Brendan O’Connor on the integrity of the Australian federal police is a disgrace and Bill Shorten should disown that and apologise for that immediately. The police keep us safe. They keep us safe from crime, they keep us safe from terrorism and they uphold the rule of law. And the AWU should comply with the law and when they have spokesman like Mr O’Connor, that would prefer to defend the thugs and the criminals in the CFMEU then stand up for the police that keep us safe, that shows you a lot of the values of the Labor party of Bill Shorten. Our thoughts are obviously with Linda Burney and her family. Linda Burney has made a statement, following the death of her son Binni overnight. I will be taking leave from the parliament. I wish to advise that my beloved son, Binni Kirkbright-Burney was found dead last night at our family home in Sydney. The NSW police advise that there appears to be no suspicious circumstances but the cause of death is yet to be determined. I returned to Sydney last night to be with him this one last time. Binni is 33 years old. He is a caring and loving man. He has struggled with mental health and with addiction. He tried so hard to conquer his demons, as I and my family have tried so hard to support him in every way we could. I don’t want to pre-empt subsequent inquiry but we all thought we were getting somewhere. I don’t know what life will be like without him. I understand I am a public figure but in this dire, grief-stricken time for me, I ask that you respect my and my family’s privacy in all respects. When I can, I will speak about this. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. Hotlines in other countries can be found here We left you yesterday as the Australian Workers’ Union offices in Melbourne and Sydney had been raided by the Australian federal police, at the direction of the Registered Commissions Organisation, which is looking into some historical donations under Bill Shorten’s stewardship. The fallout continues today. Labor have labelled the raids “an abuse of ministerial power” and have pointed the finger squarely at Malcolm Turnbull. The prime minister returned fire this morning, calling the Labor response an “hysterical attack” and said Shorten and the AWU had questions to answer. He accused Brendan O’Connor of smearing the AFP, by claiming the raid was politically motivated and called on Shorten to apologise. He and Josh Frydenberg tried to take back the agenda this morning, heading to Sutton to carry out another Q&amp;A in front of the cameras with a business owner about power prices. It didn’t work. All questions were about the raid. That’s going to continue all day. Estimates continues, with community affairs, Treasury and Defence under the spotlight today. That includes the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. So that should also keep us busy.

The storm mauled a cherished home that Willis and her family are still unable to return to, five years since it ravaged New York City. “I’d seen nothing like it in my life, the water was surging above the cars. It was like an out of body experience,” Willis, now a 20-year-old student, said. She lived with her mother, brother and dog in far Rockaway, part of a jawbone-like peninsula that juts out near JFK airport in Queens. The stricken home was boarded up, with repairs still not done, as the family was shunted between hotels and relatives. “It’s incredibly frustrating,” Willis said. “I can’t believe it has been five years. It’s like no one was ready for what happened after the storm.” The lingering anguish of Sandy is shared by several hundred others in New York and New Jersey who have been unable to return home since the storm hit. Their houses lie derelict or in an ossified state of repair, with residents plagued by a confusing tangle of bureaucracy, delays, contractor fraud and the fear that any rebuilding in vulnerable areas will be nullified by another storm. A program called Build It Back was meant to have restored damaged New York City homes – such as the Willis’s – by the end of 2016, but one in five eligible people still haven’t had their dwellings repaired. The city’s public housing is in a particularly parlous stasis – of the 33 apartment towers that required repair work on crippled heating and lighting systems, only one property has completed work. Protestors will march on Sandy’s fifth anniversary to highlight those still struggling with the storm’s aftermath. “There have definitely been problems along the way, it hasn’t gone smoothly,” said Amy Peterson, the city-appointed head of Build it Back. Peterson predicts the final repairs will take place in 2018. Around 300 homes were demolished and more than 1,400 homes have been elevated, by as much as 9ft, which has proved complex work in tightly-packed neighborhoods. “It hasn’t been easy, it’s been incredibly complicated,” Peterson said. “No one anticipated this level of damage.” Unnervingly, as New York and New Jersey continue to mop up from Sandy, far stronger hurricanes have recently pummeled Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. Donald Trump’s administration has also taken an axe to measures that address climate change – which is known to amplify hurricanes – as well as tear up federal rules requiring adaption to sea level rise. The skyline of Manhattan went dark after a power outage caused by the storm “It’s such ridiculous theater, it’s shameful,” said Klaus Jacob, a geophysicist who works on climate change adaptation at Columbia University. “New York has made some progress since Sandy but it’s hard to know if we will recover from the step backwards with the current administration. It will not cost this nation not only in billions, it will cost it trillions of dollars if we don’t turn things around.” After forming as a tropical depression off the coast off Nicaragua, Sandy mustered enough strength to become a category 1 hurricane, triggering mudslides that killed more than 50 people in Haiti as it roiled the Caribbean. Sandy then turned north, heading parallel to the US east coast before crunching into New Jersey, near Atlantic City, on the evening of 29 October 2012. By now the hurricane is no longer; Sandy becomes a tropical storm. But it is still strong enough to obliterate parts of the Jersey shore and trigger a record storm surge in New York harbor. Bolstered by a high tide, around 14ft of water careens into the southern tip of Manhattan, flooding subway stations and the foundations of the under-construction 9/11 memorial. The electricity in the world’s financial powerhouse flickers and dies. In parts of New York and New Jersey, power isn’t restored for several weeks. More than 100 people lose their lives, with economic damage of around $75bn. Rachel Riveria was watching the progress of the storm on TV in her top floor apartment in Brooklyn when she heard a cracking noise. As she checked on her sleeping six-year-old daughter, Riveria witnessed the ceiling caving in on her, only narrowly escaping the room with the child in her arms. “My daughter was terrified, she still cries to this day when it rains,” Riveria, who is now 38-years-old. “They say time heals wounds but this 11-year-old is still hurting. She hasn’t healed.” Barefoot, the duo fled into the storm and found their way to a shelter. They spent nearly two years being moved to various hotels by charities as Riveria’s landlord gave up on repairing the building. Finally, stable accommodation was found for them but not in the same area of Brooklyn. Disaster still looms large – Riveria’s mother was rescued when Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico in September, although her sister is still missing. A family friend was found crushed to death under a car. Back in New York, Riveria frets a storm will revisit her, too. “People need to open their eyes,” she said. “Wherever there’s disaster, there needs to be help. The working class are the backbone of this country, we aren’t expendable. And we need to do something about climate change. All this drilling for fossil fuels, all those bad fumes. We need to change that.” ‘No fundamental change’ Damage in the Rockaway neighborhood of Queens during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 In Staten Island, houses remained boarded up five years later New York’s anti-flooding bulkheads have been strengthened, the subway system has a new mechanism to prevent inundation and new safeguards are in place to ensure the city’s lights stay on and the running water remains clean. Streets have been raised in some places and Rockaway’s five-mile boardwalk, left warped and crumpled by Sandy, has reopened. A rezoning process has altered rules for buildings in vulnerable areas, such as the southern edge of Brooklyn, the east side of Staten Island and the East Village area of Manhattan. But no areas have been completely barred from development and hard decisions over the viability of increasingly soggy parts of the city have been largely deferred. “If Sandy happened again this year I think New York would be operationally better prepared, people would follow evacuation orders better,” said Jacob. “But the water would still go in the same places, streets and houses would be flooded, there would be havoc in the Rockaways and Coney Island. It’s still the same set up. There’s been fiddling around the margins but no fundamental change.” The biggest lurch from the status quo has occurred in Staten Island, where residents in the low-lying east shore neighborhoods of Oakwood Beach, Graham Beach and Ocean Breeze have been offered money to sell up and leave. The $200m relocation, overseen by New York State, has seen 495 out of 659 eligible households take the voluntary buy-outs. The area was ravaged by Sandy and several people perished. A lesser blow was struck a year before by Hurricane Irene. Still, Joe Tirone, a local real estate broker, said it was a surprise when he asked who was interested in buy-outs at a community meeting and was faced with a forest of raised hands. “Irene put these people back on their heels and Sandy was the knockout punch,” he said. “Sandy hit and it was like ‘boom, we are out.’” The east shore of Staten Island is marshy land and most residents – many of them police and fire fighters – have multi-generational roots in the area. But the community-led effort to get buy-outs came after it dawned on householders that climate change would eventually outpace them. “I drove around after the storm, houses were gone and it was just swamp,” said Tirone, who advocated on behalf of the community. “The city was still issuing building permits and I just thought ‘how did these houses ever get built?’” Jan Nuzzo, now a 37-year-old medical assistant, was recuperating at her Oakwood Beach house in Staten Island following the cesarean section delivery of her son, who arrived a month before Sandy struck. For five hours her house filled with water, forcing her to clamber atop furniture with her infant son and dog. At one point she had to change his diaper while lying him on a sofa that had just floated past. “I was waiting to either die or be rescued,” said Nuzzo. The national guard reached Nuzzo at 2am and from that moment she vowed never to return. She got a buy-out, moving elsewhere in the borough, and now a vacant lot stands where her house once did. Large chunks of the eastern part of Staten Island has been effectively handed back to nature - tall reeds sprout from empty plots of land, deer roam and opossums scurry around the houses that remain. A surge in turkey numbers prompted a cull. “We all know the water is rising now,” Nuzzo said. “People absolutely should not have lived in the area we were. It’s a marsh. Everyone loves an ocean view, but it shouldn’t cost you your life. We just wanted to get out and get on with our lives.” Tricia Campbell McAvoy at her home in Brick, New Jersey, which was hit badly by the storm. Five years later, she is still unable to move back ‘The storm is the easy part. Restoring your life is the challenge’ A recent survey of 500 New Jersey families affected by Sandy found one in five still have not returned home, with a third admitting it’s now a struggle to meet bills and afford food and fuel. A separate Monmouth University poll revealed than more than half of affected New Jersey residents are unhappy with the state’s recovery effort. Tricia Campbell McAvoy, 67, has sunk her life savings into repairing her house in Brick, New Jersey, a town riven by waterways near the coast, about 60 miles south of New York City. Sandy brought 3ft of water into her house, forcing McAvoy and her son to flee in a truck and her husband to be rescued by kayak. McAvoy planted a sign reading “looters will be shot and thrown into the river” outside her house and set about trying to make it habitable again. But a series of misfortunes, bureaucratic dawdling by local, state and federal officials and a botched elevation of the house by a rogue contractor mean she still lives with her 100-year-old father in his small, box-filled apartment. Her husband passed away shortly after the storm. “The storm is the easy part – restoring your home and your life is the challenge,” she said, surveying the detritus inside a house that has been unhabitable since 2012. McAvoy has had two stokes, takes around a dozen pills a day and, like Willis, doesn’t like returning to her wrecked home. She shakes and weeps as she surveys it. “Life was good before this,” she said. “I had a beautiful life, I had a husband. So many people around here have become sick and died because of the stress of this storm.” Brick’s wealthier neighbor of the east, the town of Mantoloking, is attempting to make nature bend to its will. Sandy caused damage to almost every one of the 524 houses in the seaside town, perched on a narrow barrier island that has a bay on one side and the Atlantic on the other. Around 60 homes were utterly destroyed. In order to get flood insurance and to avoid a similar fate, multi-million dollar homes have been elevated by up to 14ft. Visitors have to scan upwards to find vertiginous front doors. Diggers are working to mould sand dredged from the seabed into protective beach dunes that will reach 22ft. To the south, in Seaside Heights, a rollercoaster that was washed out into the sea by Sandy has a gleaming new replacement, also placed on a short pier overhanging the waves. “We are at risk, there’s no doubt about it, but people hope they will lift their home and survive it, for now,” said Lance White, president of New Jersey’s Mantoloking council. “People here love the ocean, they love the beach. This is where they want to stay. But at some point we will be underwater.” A new home being built in Mantoloking, New Jersey Left, a new rollercoaster in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, on the same site where another washed away. Right, an artificial barrier now surrounds the beach in the Midland neighborhood of Staten Island ‘The threats are out there and growing’ Climate change’s hand in Sandy was identified in a 2013 study that found sea level rise, driven by the melting of glaciers and thermal expansion of a warming ocean, extended the reach of the storm by 27 sq miles, affecting 83,000 additional people. Heavy blows like Sandy may soon become quotidian – research released this week by Rutgers University estimated that 8ft floods, which used to occur once every 500 years, will batter New York every five years within the next three decades. Such scenarios are invoked by Bill de Blasio, New York’s mayor, in his push to cut the city’s greenhouse gas emissions and in his excoriation of Trump for aiming a “dagger straight at the heart of New York City” by pulling the US from the Paris climate agreement. City Hall has thrown its weight behind a coastal defence system, nicknamed the big U, that would hug lower Manhattan in a 10-mile perimeter. Work on the $750m project is set to begin in early 2019 and will take several years to complete. The big U is vying with other ideas such as a huge barrier that would stretch from New Jersey to the Rockaways and envelop New York harbor, closing it off during a storm. Ostensibly supported by New York governor Andrew Cuomo, the initiative would cost around $25bn. Neither of these huge projects would be infallible. The big U would provide a buffer from storm surge but should New York suffer the sort of downpour experienced recently by Houston – when the Texan city was drenched in 25 trillion gallons of water during Hurricane Harvey – lower Manhattan would fill like a bathtub. An illustration of the big U, a flood-mitigation design for Manhattan A barrier is more ambitious but the continual onslaught of sea level rise – New York City is likely to get a 1-2ft increase by mid century that could balloon to as much as 6ft by 2100 – means the barrier could spend more time closed than open, causing flooding behind it as water piles up from the East and Hudson rivers. “When we are finished (with the big U) it would be absurd to say everything will be safe but we are reducing vulnerabilities,” said Daniel Zarrilli, New York City’s climate change and resiliencechief. “We know the threats are out there and growing. Things haven’t been perfect but we are moving as fast as we can. We will be at this the rest of our lives.” At some point, New York may be forced into what Columbia’s Jacob diplomatically calls “sustainable relocation” – parts of the city are allowed to flood, creating a sort of Venice in places like lower Manhattan where bridges and boats connect skyscrapers. “Let Canal Street be a canal, let Water Street be water,” Jacob said. “People may feel temporarily safe behind the big U but it’s like declaring war and then not having a strategy on how to extract yourself from that war. It’s a purely defensive strategy. “We should move critical assets such as hospitals and schools to higher ground and reduce density at lower ground. With the storms and flooding, some corporations will start to think about it. We will probably make it to mid century but beyond that – it’s all up for grabs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/24/arsenal-norwich-city-carabao-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T21:28:57Z","webTitle":"Eddie Nketiah’s fairytale arrival for Arsenal crushes Norwich hope of upset","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/24/arsenal-norwich-city-carabao-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/24/arsenal-norwich-city-carabao-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Eddie Nketiah’s fairytale arrival for Arsenal crushes Norwich hope of upset","bodyText":"As cameos go, making your bow at your home stadium by scoring inside 15 seconds and then adding an extra-time matchwinner with a soaring header takes some beating. Eddie Nketiah earned instant cult status at Arsenal after the teenager stole a show that had for a large part of the evening belonged to the ambitious visitors from Norwich. Come the final whistle the only word on everybody’s lips was simply “Eddie”. Arsène Wenger has for decades used English football’s secondary cup competition to give youngsters a taste of first-team experience. Not many have seized the moment quite like Nketiah. He became the first player born after Wenger became manager here to score a goal for the club, a statistic that only adds to the sense of surreal wonder the new kid conjured up. “I am impressed by that to think he was not even conceived when I was already here,” said Wenger. “Life gives a chance to young people. Hopefully he will make a long career at Arsenal football club.” The Carabao Cup may not naturally lend itself to fairy stories but this topsy-turvy evening was rich with opportunity. For the majority of an earnestly contested match the romance belonged to Norwich as they headed towards what would have been a well-deserved scalp. Late into the game they were winning 1-0 thanks to Josh Murphy’s audacious goal and the scoreline really could have been extended through a handful of golden chances. Wenger fielded the second string and when it was not working a quick scan of a bench filled with inexperienced kids did not look too encouraging. But then came the extraordinary twist in the tale. Nketiah scuttled on for his home debut and within seconds the 18-year-old from south London was in the right place at the right time to pounce on a corner, prodding in the equaliser with his first touch for a moment he will always cherish. The chant of “Eddie, Eddie,” coursed round the stadium, which was remarkable considering how few of the crowd had probably heard of Nketiah before kick-off. Almost single-handedly he brought his club an almighty lift. If the first goal was all about predatory instinct, the second was about nerve and heart. “I like especially the header he scored,” said Wenger. “He is not tall. He has a determined attitude. When the team needs you and you can deliver, that is a quality that you don’t know until you put the player on. “I don’t regret not putting experienced players on the bench. Eddie is a good example of why. If I had experienced players on the bench I would certainly have put them on instead of Eddie.” An electric run offered the opportunity for a hat-trick but Angus Gunn – another youngster showing ready promise – was equal to it in the City goal. The little flashes Nketiah produced were reminiscent of Ian Wright’s dynamic and goal-hungry style but Wenger urged people to give the teenager time to develop in his own way. He left Chelsea to join Arsenal aged 14 and has never looked back, banging in goals throughout the youth levels. With better finishing, better luck and better decisions from the officials Norwich could have been out of sight before Nketiah’s grand entrance. Mohamed Elneny was on the fortunate side to avoid a dismissal earlier in the game for taking down Nélson Oliveira. Later James Husband was bought down in the penalty box, caught by Mathieu Debuchy’s flailing arm. It was harsh on Norwich, especially as they contributed so much. Daniel Farke was candid enough to mix praise for his team with disappointment that the referee called key incidents against his team. “I wondered why he could have all these decisions in favour of Arsenal,” the Norwich manager said. “I am pretty sure the referee and linesman want to give their best and we have to accept these mistakes. To be honest it’s really annoying.” The red card for Arsenal was “obvious”, in Farke’s view, and “several players of Arsenal said, ‘sorry for you, it was a clear penalty’”. Farke also took issue with the award of the corner which decided the game. Norwich’s mission to hustle Arsenal, closing down in numbers to limit the home team from finding an easy groove, gave them a promising platform. On another day it might have been different. But this particular day belonged to Nketiah."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/oct/21/australia-v-new-zealand-third-bledisloe-cup-test-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T11:25:27Z","webTitle":"Australia 23-18 New Zealand: third Bledisloe Cup Test – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/oct/21/australia-v-new-zealand-third-bledisloe-cup-test-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/oct/21/australia-v-new-zealand-third-bledisloe-cup-test-live","fields":{"headline":"Australia 23-18 New Zealand: third Bledisloe Cup Test – as it happened","bodyText":"The last time the Wallabies beat the All Blacks, Tony Abbott and John Key were the prime ministers of Australia and New Zealand respectively. Several political changes later on both sides of the Tasman, Australia has again defeated their arch rivals following a thrilling finale to the 2017 Bledisloe Cup in Brisbane. Tries to Reece Hodge, Israel Folau and Marika Koroibete gave the Wallabies’ momentum throughout the night, but it would be two late penalties converted by Hodge that would prove the difference. While electric attacking play from Sonny Bill Williams and Rieko Ioane gave the home side plenty of frights, Michael Cheika’s side showed great composure to see out the game and end the Southern Hemisphere test season on a high. Both teams now head to Europe for a string of tough matches. Australia will face Wales in mid-November after a brief stop-off encounter against Japan, while the All Blacks have a forthcoming clash with the Barbarians in London. Thanks for your company and contributions throughout the match tonight. I’m on live blog duty again tomorrow for the Sunday sportswatch - until then! No amount of rain will dampen the spirit of Australian fans at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, after the Wallabies secured their first victory over New Zealand since August 2015. 80 min: Peeepppp! A sweeter whistle Australian fans have not heard for a long time. Victory to the Wallabies - the first over New Zealand in two years. 80 min: New Zealand with one last throw of the dice, taking a line-out on the 22 metre mark. 79 min: That was a monster kick from Adam Hodge, about 55 metres from the goalposts. Australia take the ball from the kick and hold on for dear life. 78 min: And Hodge hits it! The All Blacks will need a converted try to win this with two minutes remaining. 77 min: Miserly defence from the Wallabies culimates with a turn-over after some threatening New Zealand attack. Australia awarded a penalty on the half-way line, and Reece Hodge elects to kick. Two points in it heading into the final four minutes at Suncorp, and four minutes of injury time for either sided to break the deadlock in the A-League’s Sydney derby. How good is sport! Here’s rugby league convert Marika Koroibete crossing the line earlier for the Wallabies’ third try of the night. 70 min: Rieko Ioane is just too fast for the Wallabies, taking the ball wide after some quick passing and outpacing the Australian defenders. Try New Zealand! Damian McKenzie kicks the attempt conversion wide and Australia hang on to a two point lead. An email from Martin Turnbull (who, if I recall correctly from a previous Bledisloe match, is not related to the Australian prime minister). “My kingdom for a reliable [Wallabies] goal kicker,” Turnbull offers. Any takers? 69 min: Huge bust from the Wallabies to move out of danger and into the New Zealand half. The ball is turned over and Rieko Ioane is almost away on the wing. Thrilling stuff - and it’s a dead-rubber! 67 min: Australia leading the Kiwis on several fronts on the statistics spreadsheet: 423 attacking metres to 189, 116 carries to 63, 150 passes to 76, 88 rucks won to 43. But as we all know, there is only one stat that matters. Currently it’s 20-13 to Australia, but still over a dozen minutes to go. 64 min: Reece Hodge is given kicking duties for the penalty, and adds three points without difficulty. Australia now with a converted try advantage. 62 min: Australia with another piercing set of phases. Tevita Kuridrani almost finds the gap but can’t slide through. Phase number 11 and counting, before the referee blows for an Australian penalty. Owen McArdle speaking the truth via Twitter. I wouldn’t normally post Twitter content from a betting company, but... Nice pic from an agency snapper at Suncorp. 56 min: And the gamble pays off! Marika Koroibete with a try in the corner after some delicious cross-field movement - advantage Australia! Bernard Foley misses again - time to take the kicking duties away? Just over 20 minutes remaining and the Wallabies lead by four. 55 min: Australia are on the Kiwi 40 metre line and gradually moving their way forward. Will Genia takes a quick tap from a penalty, and finds some space. Advantage to Australia for an offside, but the Wallabies swing wide with Tevita Kuridrani. He puts the ball down, and proceedings are called back for the penalty. The green and gold kick for touch, a bold call given they are right in front and one point down. A one point difference here and 2-2 midway through the second half in the A-League Sydney derby. It’s all happening in Australian sport tonight. 50 min: Australia are awarded a penalty on the 40 metre mark, and elect to kick for goal. Bernard Foley shanks wide - that’s one from three this evening for him. If the Wallabies ultimately lose by a couple of points, Foley won’t sleep well tonight. The pitch at Suncorp Stadium is in average form tonight. Let’s hope referee Barnes isn’t on Twitter. As if to make the point, some obvious offsides from the All Blacks go uncalled by the British whistleblower. The troubling element of rugby. 46 min: The Wallabies cross the line after stealing from an All Blacks scrum, but the referee has already blown for a penalty. Good scrum from Australia, although a disappointing outcome for the home fans with that try chalked off. 44 min: We’re back underway following a lengthy injury time-out with Rob Simmons stretchered from the ground. The Wallabies attack down the left-hand flank, and some quick-hands passing leads to a dangerous opportunity. Some consensus on Twitter. And some haircut chat: While we’re waiting for the action to resume, let’s take a moment to appreciate tonight’s great Wallabies jersey. Israel Folau doing a good job modelling it here. Australian lock Rob Simmons is down and getting treatment, with the game stopped. Looks nasty - he’s prone on the grass and not moving. 43 min: Relentless pressure from New Zealand as the All Blacks search for the Australian line, but the tension is eventually eased by a penalty to the Wallabies. Whoever runs the All Blacks Twitter account is far more creative than their Wallabies counterpart. 40 min: We’re back in action at Suncorp Stadium. An important half of rugby here for the Wallabies, which could set the tone for their forthcoming European campaign. Just one point in it as we prepare for the final 40 minutes of the 2017 Bledisloe Cup. Who’s going to clinch game three? Let me know: email or Twitter. Israel Folau in action earlier. His 39th minute try could prove crucial to the Wallabies if they are to stay in this contest. While you’re waiting for the second-half, pop over to the Saturday sportswatch for the latest from the A-League’s Sydney derby and more. 40 min: Phew! What a half of rugby. A very important try in the dying seconds of the first stanza from Israel Folau to keep the Wallabies within striking distance of New Zealand. Stay tuned - I’ll be back shortly. 39 min: Folau! The NRL convert finds a gap on the Kiwi flank to cross in the corner. Bernard Foley misses the conversion, and New Zealand head into the break with a one point lead. 39 min: The Wallabies desperately searching for a line-break before the half - a converted try would give Australia the lead. Tevita Kuridrani makes a busting run but is eventually brought down. 36 min: Kurtley Beale with a nice break, and the momentum swings towards Australia. A try before half-time would be very useful. It’s not to be, with Beale knocking-on. The All Blacks have also brought their Twitter game tonight. Nice action snap. Imagine seeing these chaps bearing down on you - a troubling sight indeed. 30 min: An easy three points for Kiwi Lima Sopoaga, and that’s his third successful kick of the evening. 28 min: Sonny Bill Williams space with a dangerous intercept, but is dragged down by valiant Australian defenders. The All Blacks work their way towards the try line, but Jack Dempsey steals for the Wallabies. Referee Barnes calls it back though, and it’ll be a New Zealand penalty - they elect to kick. Some correspondence trickling through: Elliot Williams on Twitter was convinced of a New Zealand victory, but his mind has been swayed by the early action. Jordan Bradfield is also tipping a Wallabies win, although thinks the rain may play a factor. Robert Allen via email promises not to brag about the impending Kiwi victory to his Australian friends (Robert, they’re probably used to it). Your thoughts? Let me know: email or Twitter. 24 min: New Zealand’s Lima Sopoaga converts a penalty. It’s in off the post, but they still count! The All Blacks take the lead. 22 min: Wallabies building pressure with several tackles around the 22 metre mark. The ball ends up on the ground and it’s a New Zealand scrum. 19 min: Aggressive Australian defence becomes overly ambitious and the All Blacks make a line-break. But the Wallabies’ Will Genia snatches a loose ball and charges forward. Exciting end to end stuff at the moment. The Wallabies celebrating earlier following Reece Hodge’s opening try. They’ll need a few more tries if they are to still be cheering after the final whistle. 14 min: Desperate defence from the Wallabies denies the All Blacks on several occasion, but it can’t last - Waisake Naholo with a try in the corner following an overlap. Lima Sopoaga converts from the sideline to level proceedings. Not much love on Twitter for tonight’s whistleblower. Here’s the absolutely ace Wallabies jersey for tonight, designed by university student (and Kamilario/Gamilaraay person) Dennis Golding. It has the Aboriginal flag on one sleeve and the Torres Strait Islander flag on the other. 7 min: Reece Hodge! The winger intercepts and runs 70 metres to open the scoring. Australia convert. 4 min: New Zealand with the first real chance of the game, finding a big gap in the Australian defence on the run. The Wallabies recover, not before some nervous moments, and end up with a line-out. 2 min: First scrum goes to New Zealand on their 40 metre mark. Wayne Barnes is a British barrister specialising in corruption, who moonlights as an international rugby union referee. Overachievers, hey... The All Blacks find touch on Australia’s 40, and it’ll be a line-out for the Wallabies. 1 min: Referee Wayne Barnes commences proceedings with his shrill whistle, the Wallabies kicking and New Zealand collect easily. My preferred rugby oracle, Kevin Flood from Griffith, has tipped an Australian victory. If you disagree, let me know via email or Twitter. Bernard Foley is wearing some fancy boots tonight with an Indigenous dot pattern. Let’s hope they help him kick straight, after a fairly wayward performance in Argentina earlier this month. They’ve just had a minute’s silence at Suncorp Stadium for some of the former Wallabies to pass away over the past 12 months. Now a welcome to country - Australia are wearing special jerseys tonight with an indigenous pattern. The anthems and Haka will be next and then we’ll be ready for the opening whistle. John McEnerney‏ has been in touch via Twitter with some words of wisdom: “Optimism is a great thing, but realism is what it’s all about and the reality is the All Blacks are streets ahead.” You’re probably right, John, but I have a good feeling about the Wallabies tonight. We’ll be underway shortly - stay tuned for kick-off. In the meantime, here’s Sonny Bill Williams being SBW. Some early highlights from Twitter. How can the Wallabies end New Zealand’s reign as the dominant force in world rugby union? It’s no easy question, but ABC have an interesting reflection on what might need to change. Do write in with your two cents: email or Twitter. It’s been 16 years since the Wallabies last lifted the Bledisloe Cup. There’s no chance of that changing tonight, but Australia’s first win against New Zealand in two years would be warmly welcomed by this Brisbane crowd. It’s been raining in Brisbane. The weather could affect tonight’s play - expect more turnovers and less silky attacking rugby if the rain returns. Wallabies: Israel Folau, Marika Koroibete, Tevita Kuridrani, Kurtley Beale, Reece Hodge, Bernard Foley, Will Genia, Sean McMahon, Michael Hooper (captain), Jack Dempsey, Adam Coleman, Rob Simmons, Sekope Kepu, Tatafu Polota-Nau, Scott Sio. Reserves: Stephen Moore, Tom Robertson, Allan Alaalatoa, Lukhan Tui, Ned Hanigan, Nick Phipps, Samu Kerevi, Henry Speight. All Blacks: Damian McKenzie, Waisake Naholo, Ryan Crotty, Sonny Bill Williams, Rieko Ioane, Lima Sopoaga, Aaron Smith, Kieran Read (captain), Sam Cane, Liam Squire, Scott Barrett, Sam Whitelock, Nepo Laulala, Dane Coles, Kane Hames. Reserves: Codie Taylor, Wyatt Crockett, Ofa Tu’ungafasi, Patrick Tuipulotu, Matt Todd, TJ Perenara, Anton Lienert-Brown, David Havili. The paradox of Saturday’s 2017 Bledisloe Cup finale is this: the game is simultaneously irrelevant and vitally important. On one hand, New Zealand has already lifted the hallowed trophy and the Rugby Championship has concluded, leaving the third Wallabies v All Blacks tie of the season no more than a dead rubber. On the other, the Suncorp Stadium showdown provides a prime opportunity for Australia to demonstrate progress under coach Michael Cheika, while a win for the Kiwis would underscore their superiority following a tough-fought encounter in Dunedin two months ago. Cheika has made just one change from the Australian side that defeated Argentina in Mendoza, Rob Simmons replacing the injured Izack Rodda. Multi-sport sensation Karmichael Hunt has not returned to the squad despite recovering from an ankle issue, while Stephen Moore - set to make his 125th appearance for the Wallabies (and last on home soil) - is on the bench. For New Zealand, the main team news concerned the absences of flyhalf Beauden Barrett due to concussion and winger Nehe Milner-Skudder with a dislocated shoulder. Lima Sopoaga has been named as Barrett’s replacement, in only the second test start for the 26-year-old. In the back-line, dangerous duo Sonny Bill Williams and Rieko Ioane will be looking to repeat the efforts that saw both star last time the All Blacks were in Australia. Will the Wallabies secure a much needed win ahead of their European tour, and send off former captain Stephen Moore in style? Or will the all-conquering New Zealand machine roll on? We’ll find out shortly. Wherever you are in the world, thanks for joining me during this morning/afternoon/evening’s clash, and do get in touch throughout the game via email, Twitter or smoke signal. Kieran will be here shortly.

Are they split from fighting? Just how big is your hand, anyway? “I’m friendly but I’ll want to have my back to the wall,” he explains. “I know where all the exits are and I’ll know who I have to hit if I want to get out.” Don’t get him wrong; Barnes is known for his geniality. He’s light on his feet (like a boxer, like his dad), ready to smile, and has a patience with journalists quite unbecoming to a rock singer. But that hyper-vigilance he learned in childhood has never left him. Barnes was the household name no one expected to get real about domestic violence. His first memoir, Working Class Boy, shocked even his own bandmates when it was published last year. It’s a graphic account of a childhood steeped in neglect, abuse and abject poverty. In the 1950s, his family migrated from Glasgow to a close-knit Scottish community in Adelaide’s Elizabeth. Close-knit, because no matter how many mums had black eyes, you didn’t embarrass each other by talking about it. Working Class Boy sold more than 150,000 copies – not bad for a book that the publishers had originally envisaged as a rock’n’roll romp. Its follow-up, Working Class Man, tears along with the anticipated on-the-road hijinks but, really, it’s a study of the havoc such a childhood wreaks on an adult. It’s also, surely, the tougher book to write. It moves at the velocity of shame. “For 40 years, in front of the public, I was drinking myself to death,” Barnes tells Guardian Australia. “If you did that in any other job, people would say, ‘You’ve got problems, mate.’ But people didn’t see it like that because they were living vicariously through me.” The 17-year-old who joined Cold Chisel was an incendiary hothead, wired to take offence. He never paused to consider the childhood he was escaping. In fact, he was running full tilt, leading with his fists. “I’m homicidal, not suicidal,” he’d joke to himself. As he observes now: “If anything hurt me emotionally, I’d want to belt someone. That was my take on life in general: I’m not wounded, I’m the aggressor.” Harnessed on stage, this fury made Chisel a live band to be reckoned with. It’s unsurprising Barnes made them his new family, having had his blood family shattered when his mother left. “The best times in Cold Chisel were when we were all in the back of the car together, us against the world,” he says of his contentment playing the roughest pubs in the country. “It wasn’t about ambition. It was about having a sense of belonging and freedom.” It fell to songwriter and keys man Don Walker – who was in the middle of an honours degree in quantum mechanics – to play big brother and manager, and he’s the voice of reason throughout Working Class Man; the third-party conscience, even. “Poor Don,” Barnes says sincerely. “Whenever it fell apart he’d be the guy who had to pick up the pieces. He’s still the big brother; that’s been the dynamic of the family. These days we all pull our weight more but we look to Don for the final decision making.” It was on the road that Barnes first met his wife, Jane Mahoney, and, make no mistake, Working Class Man is also a love story. “I can remember the minute that I seen Jane,” he says. “Four in the afternoon, the 29th of November, 1979. She was so beautiful, I literally had to walk out of the room and regroup. Throughout all the highs and lows over 38 years, I still pinch myself and think I lucked out big time.” The scenes in which Barnes journeys to Japan to impress the affluent expat in-laws are as howlingly well-described as his later collaborations with Spandex-wearing, latte-chugging LA songwriters. Once he’d established a young family (who all, he says, inherited his impulsivity), Barnes broke away from Chisel at the height of their popularity. He was furious at not seeing enough of the profits for his liking. Some band members might have derived a sense of romance from living in dilapidated hotels but, as he says: “I’d seen enough filth and desperation.” Barnes is frank in his admission that much of his ensuing 35-year solo career was fuelled by his desire to live up to Chisel. “For a long time, it was all about chart position,” he admits. “‘If my record doesn’t come in at No 1, I’m a failure.’ I cared too much about what people thought of me, and that was symptomatic of the trauma from my childhood.” He’s since had to reassess his definition of success, with the painful knowledge that it’s possible to have five No 1 albums in a row and also face bankruptcy. “Success isn’t about reaching your goals, it’s about striving for things, like the joy of trying to raise a family, trying to be a successful singer, trying to write good songs, trying to be a better person,” he says. “It’s that old thing about life being about the journey, not the destination.” Such wisdom is hard-earned, from decades of chasing peace. In 2000, at a time he was snorting 10 grams of coke a day and relying on whisky for sustenance, he would jump in a limo and get dropped off at the new age guru Deepak Chopra’s clinic in San Diego. “He’d pump me full of vitamins and have people standing me up and stretching me,” he recalls. “He’d talk to me about ‘why are you doing this to yourself?’ Then they’d put me back in the limo and I’d go back to the studio and do it all again.” Then there was the time spent at the Wat Pa Tham Wua monastery in northern Thailand, where he cooked vegetarian pasta for 1,000 monks, straining it in mosquito nets. “Nah, it didn’t help me,” he says, laughing, “but I learned stuff and it probably kept me alive.” Themes of self-sabotage and feeling undeserving run through the book; it’s just taken years of rehab visits and psychologist appointments to get to the point of admitting it. “When it came down to the crunch and I thought I was going to die, all the information I’d gathered from Deepak and from the monks and meditation, and Jane, and friends all through my life who have offered information to me, all that came into play, and that’s when I realised it wasn’t a waste of time,” he says. Even so, a vocabulary of words such as “trauma” must be quite new to him. “Yeah ... I tended to use ‘blunt-force trauma’,” he fires back. “I wouldn’t have used these words because people would think I was crazy … but now people know I am and that’s OK.” Barnes has a history of supporting the LGBT community and speaking out against racism, so it’s perhaps not so surprising that he has used his memoirs to highlight Australia’s ongoing problems with poverty and domestic violence. He’s careful to point out that his only qualification is lived experience – he mentions the Luke Batty Foundation as a worthier source of help – but he’s also an advocate of opening up the conversation. And, of course, he’s acknowledged people whose experiences are usually silenced by shame. As such, his last book tour was a place in which people felt they could share. “I didn’t know whether people would accept the subject matter – domestic violence, sexual abuse and bloody alcoholism – but when it came out people were ready to look at this stuff,” he says. “I did 40 shows and every night I would realise something new about myself as I was telling the stories on stage. I would see someone in the audience break down, every night. There’s a lot of people struggling below the poverty line, trying to deal with the issues that come with poverty, and a lot of that is frustration and drinking.” Then there are the bandmates he always wanted to impress. When Chisel first reformed in 1997, the prodigal son Barnesy received a lukewarm response to his solo career from the other members – something he recalls in a typically dry-humoured, conciliatory tone in Working Class Man. “I think they like the books,” he says now. “They said, ‘We wish we’d known, we could have ... ’ but I didn’t even speak to my wife and kids about my childhood; I just said it was normal, because I thought it was.” Barnes tours Working Class Man: An Evening of Stories and Songs in March and April, and there are Chisel dates in Hobart and Newcastle this November. Playing live provides a further, almost spiritual sense of connection, he says. “It feels like an out-of-body experience. There’s something about the energy and the expectations that an audience projects at you. I get up on stage and work and work, and there’s chaos all around me, then I’ll shut my eyes and boom! I slot into the zone. It’s like the eye of the hurricane. Everything is easy, and I’m capable of doing things I didn’t know I was. That’s what you chase. You want to be in there all the time.” These days, that comes with a bonus: “I haven’t had to fight anybody for years.” • Working Class Man by Jimmy Barnes is out now through HarperCollins"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/19/everton-uefa-disciplinary-action-brawl-lyon-defeat","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T08:40:34Z","webTitle":"Everton likely to face Uefa disciplinary action after brawl in Lyon defeat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/19/everton-uefa-disciplinary-action-brawl-lyon-defeat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/19/everton-uefa-disciplinary-action-brawl-lyon-defeat","fields":{"headline":"Everton likely to face Uefa disciplinary action after brawl in Lyon defeat","bodyText":"Everton look likely to face Uefa disciplinary action after their Europa League match with Lyon descended into a melee, with a few of the home crowd involved in an ugly brawl sparked by the captain Ashley Williams. Ronald Koeman’s side went down 2-1 in the Group E game – a result which left them bottom of the table – but it was the second-half flashpoint which could see Everton and Williams facing punishment. The captain’s shove on the Lyon goalkeeper, Anthony Lopes, sparked heated confrontations between players in front of the Gwladys Street end. As the group surged to the advertising hoardings, a supporter holding a child in one arm aimed a punch in the direction of the keeper. Koeman later suggested the Dutch referee, Bas Nijhuis, was partly to blame for the Goodison fireworks. “I couldn’t see exactly what happened behind the goal, a lot of players were involved, but I can fully understand my players being frustrated,” he said. “I told the officials what I thought at the end of the game. I know the referee was Dutch, but he failed to do anything about Nabil Fekir diving about 10 times. “Kenny Tete too, it was happening all the time, and he allowed their physio to come on to the pitch.Then he only added on five minutes at the end, and that’s after six substitutions, two goals and a fight. I think the players were mainly acting out of frustration, and I can understand why.” Regarding the match, Koeman said: “We made too many mistakes, it was thanks to Jordan Pickford that the score was only 2-1. We started well but made a really stupid fault after just five minutes. I have no complaints, it was the right decision from the referee to give a penalty, but there were a lot more mistakes and bad decisions after that. That’s what we are looking at the moment: doubts, errors, and players without confidence. I know from my playing days what that does to you. “When you are short of confidence you make poor decisions, as Davy Klaassen did when going for a shot instead of putting in Dominic Calvert-Lewin. We are in a difficult situation now because you only get confidence from winning and we have an important game [with Arsenal] at the weekend. I think it is going to be very difficult for us now in Europe too, you normally win most of your points at home and we only have one from two games.” Bruno Génésio, the Lyon coach, said he enjoyed a “typically English night” and atmosphere, and praised the Everton fans for the support they gave their side throughout. He even agreed that the melee, or “incident” as he called it, did the home team a favour. “Right up to the incident we were in control, then things changed,” he said. “To me it seemed it woke Everton up and drove them forward.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/19/quentin-tarantino-on-weinstein-i-knew-enough-to-do-more-than-i-did","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T09:21:39Z","webTitle":"Quentin Tarantino on Harvey Weinstein: 'I knew enough to do more than I did'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/19/quentin-tarantino-on-weinstein-i-knew-enough-to-do-more-than-i-did","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/19/quentin-tarantino-on-weinstein-i-knew-enough-to-do-more-than-i-did","fields":{"headline":"Quentin Tarantino on Harvey Weinstein: 'I knew enough to do more than I did'","bodyText":"Quentin Tarantino says he knew about instances of sexual assault by Harvey Weinstein for decades but failed to act in order to protect women, adding: “I knew enough to do more than I did.” In an interview the director, who worked with Weinstein on some of his most successful films, including Pulp Fiction, said that he regretted not taking responsibility and assisting alleged victims of the producer, who is accused of sexually harassing and assaulting more than 50 women. “There was more to it than just the normal rumors, the normal gossip,” he said in the interview with the New York Times. “It wasn’t secondhand. I knew he did a couple of these things. “I wish I had taken responsibility for what I heard. If I had done the work I should have done then, I would have had to not work with him.” Tarantino said that he had been aware of the settlement between Rose McGowan and Weinstein and that his then girlfriend Mira Sorvino had told him about an incident involving Weinstein making unwelcome advances and touching. “I couldn’t believe he would do that so openly. I was like: ‘Really? Really?’ But the thing I thought then, at the time, was that he was particularly hung up on Mira,” said Tarantino. “I thought Harvey was hung up on her in this Svengali kind of way. Because he was infatuated with her, he horribly crossed the line.” Weinstein distributed Tarantino’s films from his debut Reservoir Dogs to his most recent, The Hateful Eight, and the director said his attitude to the rumours was initially dismissive. “I chalked it up to a 50s-60s era image of a boss chasing a secretary around the desk,” he said. “As if that’s OK. That’s the egg on my face right now.” On Thursday the Los Angeles police department announced it was opening an investigation into whether Weinstein raped an Italian model in 2013. The unnamed model claims the mogul bullied his way into her hotel room and raped her. “The Los Angeles police department’s robbery homicide division has interviewed a potential sexual assault victim involving Harvey Weinstein which allegedly occurred in 2013,” an LAPD spokesman told the Los Angeles Times. “The case is under investigation.” In an earlier statement to the New Yorker, Weinstein’s spokesperson Sallie Hofmeister said: “Mr Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but he unequivocally denies allegations of non-consensual sex.” Earlier in the day, workers at the Weinstein Company released a statement to the New Yorker saying they had asked to be let out of their non-disclosure agreements in order to shed more light on the producer’s actions. “We have nothing to hide, and are as angry and baffled as you are at how Harvey’s behavior could continue for so long,” it read. “We ask that the company let us out of our NDAs immediately – and do the same for all former Weinstein Company employees – so we may speak openly, and get to the origins of what happened here, and how.” Tarantino’s comments follow the news that Weinstein’s prestigious fellowship from the British Film Institute – described as its “highest honour” – had been withdrawn. The BFI said “the serious and widespread allegations about Harvey Weinstein’s appalling conduct are in direct opposition to the BFI’s values.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/19/british-airways-issues-apology-for-bedbug-infestation","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T22:10:55Z","webTitle":"British Airways apologises for bed bug infestation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/19/british-airways-issues-apology-for-bedbug-infestation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/19/british-airways-issues-apology-for-bedbug-infestation","fields":{"headline":"British Airways apologises for bed bug infestation","bodyText":"British Airways has apologised to a Canadian family after they were bitten by bed bugs on a transatlantic flight between Vancouver and London. Heather Szilagyi, her seven-year-old daughter, Molly, and her fiance, Eric Neilson, were left covered with painful insect bites while travelling from Canada to Slovakia this month. British Airways offered an apology to the family and upgraded their return flights to business class. Szilagyi said she had first noticed the bed bugs on the seat in front of her, then spotted another crawling out from behind a TV monitor. “I wanted to grab it but they’re quick and it crawled back inside, behind the screen,” she told the Canadian broadcaster CTV. Szilagyi says she alerted a flight attendant but was told the flight was full and nothing could be done. “It was nine hours of knowing that I was probably going to get bit, but not being sure,” she said. “But there wasn’t really anything I could do about it. I was surprised I was able to relax – but what can you do? Me and my daughter are both really sensitive to insect bites, so she was just covered all over. I’ve still got a really infected one.“We were not asking for a refund. All we were asking for was a flight on a different plane, to make sure it was a different plane, to make sure that the plane that was infested with bed bugs was taken care of.” A BA spokesperson said: “We have been in touch with our customer to apologise and investigate further. British Airways operates more than 280,000 flights every year and reports of bed bugs onboard are extremely rare. Nevertheless, we are vigilant and continually monitor our aircraft.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/23/colin-kaepernick-muhammad-ali-summit-sports-activism","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T11:00:16Z","webTitle":"The 'Ali summit': a turning point in sports' fight against injustice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/23/colin-kaepernick-muhammad-ali-summit-sports-activism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/23/colin-kaepernick-muhammad-ali-summit-sports-activism","fields":{"headline":"The 'Ali summit': a turning point in sports' fight against injustice","bodyText":"In 1962, as a cornerback for the American Football League’s Boston Patriots, Walter Beach rallied his fellow black players – there were about five – for a discussion. The topic was what to do about a forthcoming exhibition game against the Houston Oilers that was scheduled to be played in New Orleans. As was custom and law in most of the south at the time, the team accommodations were to be segregated. Promoters planned to house the black players from both teams at a black-owned motel, and white players from both teams at a hotel two miles away. “We were all in agreement that we didn’t want to participate in it,” Beach said. The players, led by Beach, asked the team to simply allow them to fly down and fly back the day of the match rather than submit to the indignities of Jim Crow – the name given to the laws enacted by southern states to legally enforce segregation after the civil war. The team did buy Beach a plane ticket, he recalled: a ticket home. He was cut. Five years later, retired, he found himself back at the intersection of activism and athletics. The boxing heavyweight champion of the world, Muhammad Ali, was facing intense public backlash, not to mention the possibility of jail time and having his titles stripped, over his refusal to be drafted for the Vietnam war. In the midst of that uproar, the Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown, who had just retired as the NFL’s leading rusher, decided to call Ali and other prominent, vocal black athletes to a meeting. Beach, who had become close with Brown during their time together on the Browns, was invited to attend. “None of us had any idea of trying to change Ali’s mind. The meeting was there to support his position,” Beach said. The meeting was held at the offices of the Negro Industrial Economic Union, a black empowerment organization that Brown himself had founded and had branches in other major US black hubs. After the meeting, which included a number of prominent athletes – such as the Boston Celtics’ Bill Russell, the UCLA center Lewis Alcindor (who would later change his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and the Washington running back Bobby Mitchell – a celebrated picture (at top) was snapped by journalists, as the stars put their weight behind Ali. Also invited, and pictured, was the Cleveland attorney Carl Stokes, who later that year would become mayor of the city – the first black man to be elected to that office any major US city. “I felt with Ali taking the position he was taking, and with him losing the crown, and with the government coming at him with everything they had, that we as a body of prominent athletes could get the truth and stand behind Ali and give him the necessary support,” Brown told the Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2012. Now, just over 50 years after the meeting, which came to be known as the “Muhammad Ali summit”, it’s hard to ignore the parallels with the sudden resurgence of solidarity over social issues among black athletes. After a long chill from the 1980s through the 2000s, a number of factors, including Black Lives Matter and the protest movement authored by Colin Kaepernick, have brought that attitude roaring back. Shut up and play football Not all the athletes gathered necessarily shared Ali’s feelings about Vietnam or would have done the same in his shoes. In fact, reports from the meeting suggest the discussion several times became heated and emotional. What they all wanted to reinforce when it was over, though, was that black athletes had the right to use their profile to speak up and speak out, and shouldn’t be limited to their exploits on the court or the field or in the ring. “It was very important that you let people understand that you’re more than a football player. Football is what I did, it wasn’t who I was. Muhammad Ali was a boxer. That’s what he did. That wasn’t who he was,” Beach said. Cue up to the present, and athletes are rejecting that compartmentalizing from fans all over again. “People told me to shut up and play football,” the Cleveland Browns wide receiver Andrew Hawkins told Slate in 2016. “But what they don’t realize is [these issues are] more important to me than what anybody’s public perception of me is when I give my opinion.” Hawkins was one of the players who triggered the new wave of athlete protests, which predated Kaepernick’s campaign, by wearing a shirt over his game jersey in 2014 that demanded “justice” for Tamir Rice and John Crawford, both black males shot by police while holding toy guns. Even before that, in 2012, the Miami Heat took a team photo in black hoodies as a tribute to the Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, an unprecedented move at the time. But none of these Black Lives Matter inspired-efforts by athletes carried quite the same impact as what Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, started in August 2016 when he began sitting, and then kneeling, for the national anthem in protest against police violence. Kaepernick’s actions spurred the same type of vitriol and the same wave of solidarity that Ali generated all those years ago. “There hasn’t been a moment where you’ve had a photo op that came to that, where you have had a photo of Colin Kaepernick surrounded by LeBron James and Michael and Martellus Bennett, Gregg Popovich and so on, but de facto you’ve had the same thing,” said the Columbia Journalism School professor Samuel Freedman. “There’s really been a rallying around [Kaepernick].” The rallying, timid at first, peaked after Kaepernick became the object of Donald Trump’s abuse late last month, when Trump, without naming him, suggested the quarterback was a “son of a bitch” at an Alabama rally for his refusal to stand for the national anthem. It was a popular sentiment with the Trump supporters in attendance, and with white Americans in general, according to polling. But Trump’s ire only managed to make the protests more popular. Increasingly, the kneeling protests have become adopted not just in the NFL, but among various soccer clubs, the WNBA, and youth sports teams, all while Kaepernick remains apparently toxic to NFL owners and the GMs who decide which players make the roster. Thus, the once (briefly) best-paid QB in the NFL has become equal parts folk hero and pariah in much the same way Ali polarized Americans during the 1960s. Kaepernick is the only player currently, and maybe ever, to have jersey sales in the league’s top 40 while not even signed to a team. Indeed, his jersey has come to be more associated with black consciousness and activism than football, with many non-fans of his former team, or even the game, seeking it out, mirroring a broader trend among his overall fanbase. A courageous, prophetic, self-sacrificial act In 1962, the season after his unceremonious dismissal from the Patriots, Beach caught on with the Cleveland Browns – where he met Brown – and he said his experience was much the same. He said the team held him for years in a sort of roster limbo: placing him on waivers, which would allow another team to sign him, and then retracting the waivers when another team tried to. Beach is convinced this roster trickery was intended to achieve one purpose alone. “I was a liability. I was one of those individuals that struggled against racism all the time. They wanted to blackball me and that’s precisely what they doing to Kaepernick.” Kaepernick filed suit against the NFL earlier this week, accusing the league’s owners of colluding to deny him employment due to his polarizing demonstration. Beach also sued. And won. He had years of service added to his pension on the grounds that, had the team allowed him to sign on elsewhere, he could have played longer. But what remains to be seen is whether the energy that players have collected in the Trump era can translate into something as unified in message as the Ali Summit, or even more. If it does, players like Kaepernick may never have to worry about whether their vocal stances on social issues will leave them unemployed. “I think the symbolic point’s been made, and I think the open question is what the players do with the social power that they’ve achieved,” said Freedman, who wrote the book Breaking the Line, about the intersection of college football and the civil rights movement. Last week, the Los Angeles Chargers tackle Russell Okung proposed essentially a 21st-century summit, allowing players to unite behind a single narrative. “I am convinced that we will never make progress if we do not find a way to come together and take action that represents the will of the players,” he wrote in an open letter to his colleagues. “As Kap’s message has now been distorted, co-opted and used to further divide us along the very racial lines he was highlighting, we as players have a responsibility to come together and respond collectively.” Okung said he had initially been skeptical of Kaepernick’s tactics but wrote: “There is now no doubt in my mind that what he did last season was a courageous, prophetic, self-sacrificial act that has captivated a nation and inspired a powerful movement. “If I had his cellphone number, I would tell him that.” If what he’s proposing comes to fruition, and if history is any guide, maybe he’ll get to tell him in person instead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/oct/20/chinatown-omer-fast-art-poverty-porn","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T13:00:08Z","webTitle":"New York's Chinatown hits back at Omer Fast's 'poverty porn' art exhibition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/20/chinatown-omer-fast-art-poverty-porn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/20/chinatown-omer-fast-art-poverty-porn","fields":{"headline":"New York's Chinatown hits back at Omer Fast's 'poverty porn' art exhibition","bodyText":"On Sunday, a group of protesters stormed an art gallery in New York’s Chinatown with signs that read “Chinatown lives are not poverty porn” and “Racist art has no business here”. They stood together to hold up a large, yellow banner that said “Racism Disguised as Art” written in English, Spanish and Mandarin. The group was led by the Chinatown Art Brigade (CAB), a group of art activists targeting the James Cohan Gallery, where the Israeli artist Omer Fast has changed the outside to look like an old Chinatown storefront. Meant to look like a dirty waiting room, the gallery features two broken cash machines, graffiti, shabby red lanterns, cheap plants and fold-up chairs. The installation is meant to have “an eclectic aesthetic”, according to the gallery website, as the artwork “speaks about community, citizenship and identity”. But the protest group says the work maintains “racist narratives of uncleanliness, otherness and blight that have historically been projected onto Chinatown”. “We cannot underscore enough how offensive this is to the people who live and work here,” the CAB said in a statement. “The artist’s choice to ignore the presence of a thriving community filled with families and businesses reduces their existence to poverty porn.” Betty Yu, one of the organizers of Sunday’s protest, said the exhibition had upset local residents since it opened last month. The community of low-income immigrant tenants came and spoke about how disappointed they were at the exhibition. “Chinatown is a 150-year-old thriving community that people built on their own,” said Yu. “When an artist equates our culture as garbage, it’s really insulting to the community.” More than a hundred art galleries have opened in Chinatown over the past 10 years and are pushing out the locals. “We’ve mapped 40 new art galleries over the past two years and it’s accelerating,” said Yu. “Galleries are part of the system of gentrification.” The protest aims to show the conditions that low-income tenants are facing in Chinatown. “They’re being threatened with evictions and harassments, as landlords relocate low-income tenants to raise rents and rent spaces to businesses like James Cohan gallery,” said Yu. The gallery said in an email that the artist’s work was meant to be “an intentionally uncomfortable look inward – both at himself, an immigrant to the US, and at the gallery, a new arrival to an established neighborhood”. The gallery argued that the response proved the artwork’s effectiveness. “That this work would generate such a variety of strong reactions, positive and negative, reinforces the paradox it is trying to capture. People are free to draw their own conclusions about art, but they should also be given the opportunity to do so without censorship, barriers or intimidation.” After the recent protest, the artist apologized in a statement on the gallery’s website. Fast, who was born in Jerusalem and immigrated to New York City before relocating to Berlin, said the artwork was about tension and was a reflection of his own experience as an immigrant. “The actual gallery is being used as an immigrant surrogate: a transplant that tries to affect an appearance and blend in, even while its essence is undeniably foreign,” he wrote. Fast called the installation an act of “erasure”. He explained: “I wanted to erase the passage of time and to recreate what the space looked like before the gallery moved in almost two years ago.” He also addressed the protesters and drew comparisons with the Charlottesville protests. “A group of protestors hanged a large poster outside the show, which accuses the gallery of representing ‘a non-US and non-New York artist.’ I expect this sort of characterization from right-wing trolls carrying Tiki-torches and howling for walls to be built, I don’t expect it from left-wing activists in lower Manhattan.” This Chinatown show has divided the international art community, but especially the New York galleries that represent Asian art. “It’s a shame that people felt it was racist. The intention is to challenge stereotypes and bring awareness of immigrant issues,” said Ethan Cohen, the director of Ethan Cohen Fine Arts, which specializes in Asian art in SoHo. “I hope that the artist and Chinatown groups can create a conversation for better understanding, Omer Fast should be able to show his work. The idea of art is to create a dialogue, to address issues. Good or bad, this is what art is.” One art collector and former art gallery owner disagreed with Fast’s aims in the exhibition. “It’s the same tired, recycled bullshit that Asian Americans have been dealing with for over a century in this country,” said Big Brigman. “Trying to capitalize on a marginalized community with bogus stereotypes is trash, and to do it with a complete erasure of the people whose world you now inhabit is the worst of the worst.” The Klein Sun Gallery in Chelsea, which specializes in Chinese art, thinks the artwork taps into larger issues. “While I would never promote racist art, it’s sometimes hard to draw a fine line between promoting discrimination and fighting against it,” said Phil Kai, the Klein Sun Gallery’s assistant director. “One piece of art can be interpreted and marketed into either these directions; I support all kinds of art that generates debates or discussions such as this one.” This article was amended on 20 October.

But minutes after he began to talk, the majority of the crowd of hundreds in the auditorium stood together, raised their fists, and started chanting “Go home, Spencer! Go home, Spencer!” For the next hour, most of the crowd stayed standing, booing and chanting over Spencer’s remarks as he angrily compared the crowd to a mob and to “immature preschoolers who aren’t ready for ideas that might get a bit challenging”. “You can’t hide,” the audience chanted back at him, “You support genocide!” Over the screams and boos, Spencer answered a series of audience questions but spent much of his time berating the crowd, many of them University of Florida students, for heckling him. “You are trying to shut down a dissident intellectual,” Spencer told the roaring crowd. He reproached them for not appreciating “the most important free speech event of your lifetime”. At one point, Spencer did a quick little caper onstage, dancing along to the chants against him and waving his arms sardonically. While Spencer praised university leaders for respecting his freedom of speech, protesters repeatedly invoked the specter of the violent white supremacist rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August. One questioner asked Spencer if he felt responsible for violence carried out in the name of his movement, including death of a counter-protester after the rally in Charlottesville. When Spencer mentioned the name of Heather Heyer, the 32-year-old woman who died when a car plowed into a crowd of protesters in Charlottesville, the audience began to chant: “It’s your fault! It’s your fault!” Law enforcement officials wearing riot gear and helmets watched the raucous auditorium from balconies on either side of the stage. The event was overwhelmingly peaceful, with what appeared to be only a handful of arrests related to the event, though local law enforcement had yet to release full details by the time Spencer finished speaking. More than 500 protesters had amassed outside the event, chanting and waving anti-Nazi and anti-racist signs. One teacher from Gainesville held a large piece of paper that read “Remember Heather Heyer”. Two students held a sign that said “Get out of my swamp”. Many protesters carried signs or wore stickers that showed the Nazi swastika crossed out. The university’s president said that providing security for Spencer to speak had cost more than $600,000, and long lines of state and local law enforcement officers surrounded the Phillips Center, which was cordoned off behind elaborate barricades. A long list of items that could be used as weapons, from firearms to sporting equipment, posters with sticks to water bottles, were forbidden from being brought into the protest. There was one report of pepper spray being used after the speech concluded, and a white man in a white shirt seen outside the venue after the event had the flushed, dripping face of someone who had been pepper-sprayed and then doused himself with water. Spencer did have supporters in the auditorium he rented from the University of Florida for his speech. The front two rows of the auditorium were filled with two lines of white men in white shirts, some with Nazi-era “fashy” haircuts that are popular among the “alt-right”. Along with this group of about 20 supporters, who repeatedly stood to give Spencer a standing ovation, there were a few other scattered pockets of Spencer backers in the crowd. But these dozens of supporters were probably outnumbered by the media in the room to cover the event, and far outnumbered by hundreds protesting inside and outside the auditorium. The university president, W Kent Fuchs, had urged the student body to ignore Spencer’s event and stay far away. Some students who ignored this advice said they were curious, and many said that they wanted to show that Spencer’s beliefs were not welcome, and that they would not go unopposed. “I think his end goal is to convert people to his way of thought, and there are people who are vulnerable to that,” said Nafisa Choudhury, a 19-year-old student at the university. “If they don’t see a voice of opposition, they think that’s normal. “We can provide to them an image of who they’re hurting,” she said. Jackson Harris, 21, came to the protest before the speech, and though he did not carry a sign, said that he thought it was important for him, as a white man, to be protesting against the white nationalists. “White guys started this problem, so it makes sense that white guys help fix it,” he said. During the event, Spencer and his supporters onstage repeatedly told the loudly protesting audience that their behavior was bringing shame on their university, and would only help the white supremacists recruit more supporters, by proving that their ideas were dangerous and relevant. “You think you shut me down, but you didn’t,” Spencer told them before he left the stage. “The world is not going to be proud of you.” Some students in the auditorium, including John Della Costa, 20, said they were annoyed at the chanting and booing, and wished they could have heard Spencer without disruption, even if they did not support his ideas. In a phone interview after his speech, Spencer called the event “certainly frustrating”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/oct/21/f1-america-liberty-us-grand-prix","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T14:20:50Z","webTitle":"Can Formula One's American takeover fuel a long-awaited US expansion?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/21/f1-america-liberty-us-grand-prix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/21/f1-america-liberty-us-grand-prix","fields":{"headline":"Can Formula One's American takeover fuel a long-awaited US expansion?","bodyText":"About an hour’s drive from where I live, in the coastal hinterlands of South Carolina, lies the city of Savannah, Georgia. And every so often I’ll cross the border for a taste of the big city. On one such excursion a few months back, while walking through a neighborhood on the fringe of Savannah’s tourist district, I found myself doubling back to examine a historical marker for something called the American Grand Prize. What’s its connection to Sunday’s United States Grand Prix in Austin, Texas? Well, it’s the granddaddy, an early milepost on the way to Formula One as we know it today. Savannah, as it happens, is the birthplace of Grand Prix racing in America. The inaugural GP – held on Thanksgiving Day, 1908 – predates prohibition, which gave rise to Nascar, by 12 years. For the course, organizers cropped out a 25.3-mile swath around the city and hired prison workers to resurface its streets with oiled gravel. Among the bigwigs who descended on Savannah that Thursday were no less than president-elect William H Taft (maybe the US president least associated with speed until the Washington Nationals reimagined him as a keen mascot racer, and even then his stay in the Majors was brief) as well as Horace Dodge, Henry Ford and the head of Firestone tires – who overnighted at the city jail when he couldn’t get a hotel room anywhere in town. The final spectator count ran well north of 250,000, a single-day draw neither baseball or college football could approach then or now. To ease the congestion, grandstands were erected on both sides of a single boulevard. When the checkered flag flew, a Frenchman named Louis Wagner flew past in a Fiat, 58 seconds ahead of a mostly foreign pack. In that triumphant moment, grand prize racing seemed as if it had arrived, too. Taft thought it was the future of sports in America. The grand prize seemed here to stay. Repeat successes in ’10 and ’11 – with banking in some turns! – soon had other cities lining up to steal the grand prize away from Savannah. So it hopscotched on to New York’s Long Island, to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and to Santa Monica, California, drawing throngs at every stop. But then just as the grand prize race was well on its way to sweeping the nation and laying a foundation for Formula One to become America’s premier racing series, maybe even its national pastime, World War I broke out. And this complicated transatlantic travel for the grand prize’s mostly European competitors. For a few decades the Indianapolis 500 feigned for the dropped baton, but a narrowing focus on oval circuits made it into an entirely different style of racing and a bespoke series. And then of course Nascar improved on that template on the way to becoming America most popular sport besides football in this millennium. Just think for a moment of the racing world we might’ve inhabited if the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne had rescheduled his trip to Sarajevo. Maybe Savannah isn’t Nascar country; it’s an F1 mecca to rival Monaco. Maybe the enduring images of Richard Petty or Dale Earnhardt Sr are of their wheel-to-wheel battles with Jackie Stewart or Ayrton Senna. Maybe the baseball playoffs, the NBA tip-off and the NFL regular season are all afterthoughts this weekend because Lewis Hamilton has a shot to clinch a second world championship on adopted home soil. (In 2015, he celebrated title No3 with a Union Jack over his shoulders and American flag under his cap bill.) These are the kinds of thoughts you imagine flying around the inboxes at Liberty Media. Their $8bn acquisition of F1 in January has given rise to fresh questions about the series’ intentions in America. Where Bernie Ecclestone, F1’s old boss, did not hide his contempt for America – “a big island,” he once called it – Chase Carey, F1’s new boss, wants to put a race in New York or Miami in the next five years. Before you laugh consider that Formula E – F1’s smaller, electric-only powered cousin – has already ticked both those boxes. (Meanwhile, Austin’s race organizers hope to remain on the schedule; a potential second US date and the recently rebooted Mexican Grand Prix, which has given local F1 patrons less reason to travel north for their fix, greatly threaten those prospects.) What’s more, earlier this month F1 announced that it would be shifting its US television rights deal from NBC Sports – an arrangement that Liberty CEO Greg Maffei memorably dismissed as a “popcorn fart” – to ESPN, the self-styled worldwide leader in sports. This not only figures to help efforts to raise the sport’s profile in America. It could also do for F1 what it did for European soccer: grow it from a niche watch into the kind of major television happening that gets people talking around the water cooler on Monday. Especially if the ratings for all sports, not least the NFL and Nascar, stay in freefall. There’s no lack of native angles into the conversation, either. Besides Liberty, whose leadership will surely be second-guessed at every turn, you have machining magnate Gene Haas two years into an expensive F1 pilot program, running his own team out of a shop based in Charlotte – the heart of Nascar country. Farther up the standings there’s the racing team of Red Bull, the official drink of young-minded Americans with a thirst for live action and personalities; on that score Red Bull’s drivers Daniel Ricciardo of Australia and Belgium’s Max Verstappen more than satisfy. For those looking for something a bit stronger there’s Fernando Alonso, a real mensch. Earlier this week the Spaniard signed an extension to remain with his team of the last three seasons, McLaren, in spite of said team’s inability to put him in equipment commensurate with his credentials as a two-time world champion. The new deal, which likely never happens if McLaren doesn’t first abandon a star-crossed technical collaboration with Honda to partner instead with Renault, probably elicited as much celebration in Woking as Indianapolis. His maiden appearance in last May’s Indy 500, which saw him lead 27 laps led before a mechanical failure doomed him to a 24th-place finish, left throngs of stateside race fans wanting more. And given McLaren chief Zak Brown’s stated commitment to maintaining a presence at the 500 there’s little reason to think Alonso, who blew off Monaco to race at Indy, would leave them hanging. The potential for crossover, after all, is what makes racing great. It harks to a simpler time, when the sport was freewheeling and revving with potential. Certainly that’s how F1 looked in its infancy on these shores on Thanksgiving in 1908. Granted, things didn’t work out as envisioned. And yet the park sign I saw in Savannah, easy enough to miss while admiring all the dapper homes and Spanish-moss covered oaks trees, doesn’t strike me as a blatant reminder of that. In retrospect, it seems more like a sign that those better days could still circle back around."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/19/the-guardian-view-on-eni-aluko-a-well-deserved-victory","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T19:01:28Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Eni Aluko: a well-deserved victory | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/19/the-guardian-view-on-eni-aluko-a-well-deserved-victory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/19/the-guardian-view-on-eni-aluko-a-well-deserved-victory","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Eni Aluko: a well-deserved victory","bodyText":"The Football Association’s senior management were left floundering on Wednesday, as they were forced to realise that their handling of Eni Aluko’s complaint of racism had, from beginning to end, been entirely inadequate. It was as if they had been shaken awake from a dream in which a little racist banter, such as telling a player of Nigerian descent not to let her folk bring in Ebola when they came to watch her play for England, was greeted with backslapping chortles. In their world, only a very bad sport would not laugh along. Unluckily for the FA, but happily for the wider game, Ms Aluko is not readily intimidated by any anxiety about fitting in to a racist culture. She is both courageous and well qualified, and she has brought the FA to humiliating account with a measured determination that finally bore fruit in front of MPs on the digital, culture, media and sport committee on Wednesday afternoon. The complaint from Ms Aluko, who had won 102 caps but has not played for England since she first demanded action, has now been investigated three times. Only at the third time of asking were all the relevant witnesses, and Drew Spence, a second complainant, interviewed. And, the MPs learned on Wednesday, only in the third report did the QC conducting the inquiry conclude that the women’s coach, Mark Sampson (who was sacked in September after earlier allegations of inappropriate behaviour emerged), behaved towards Ms Aluko in a discriminatory way. Ms Spence had also been discriminated against. Later the FA apologised. But even in front of the MPs, its chief executive, Martin Glenn, refused to say whether or not he would pay the full £80,000 award that the organisation had agreed; it had been partially withheld, with Ms Aluko claiming that Mr Glenn had demanded that in return she issue a statement that the FA was not a racist institution. At the end, the committee chair, Damian Collins, concluded that it was “disappointing” that not a single one of those responsible was prepared to admit they had got it wrong: “You have to question whether they are the right people to take the organisation forward,” he said. The FA’s record is abysmal. In December last year, four former FA chairmen and executives wrote a blistering letter to the MPs concluding that it was beyond reforming itself and that parliament should legislate for an external regulator. Ministers muttered support. Earlier this year, MPs passed a vote of no confidence in its governance. In May, the FA put some modest changes in train, including pledging to add three women to the currently all-male board and more black and minority ethnic members to the much larger FA council. To get even these modest changes agreed, the chairman, Greg Clarke, had to threaten to resign. The FA remains a sclerotic, inward-looking organisation with barely a point of contact with the 21st century – though its chairman and chief executive have been introduced as reformers. This has been an extraordinary couple of weeks in which the unacceptable behaviour of men entrusted with power – and the unwillingness of people around them to challenge it – has been forced on to the public agenda by the devastating allegations about the behaviour of the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who is accused of exploiting his power to prey on women for 30 years. This could be a catharsis, a moment to establish a new norm for appropriate conduct and a more mature and nuanced understanding of discrimination and the abuse of power. Even if a quarter of Britons admit that they are racist, many more would be horrified by the notion that they could or do discriminate – yet last week’s audit of racial equality revealed how discrimination persists, in access to public services, in the courts, in education (nearly one in three Oxford colleges failed to admit any black British student in a single year, new figures show). The #MeToo social media movement, in which women have shared their accounts of sexual harassment, assault and abuses of power, has shocked many men who never realised how widespread such experiences were – or thought to question their own actions. People must be accountable. But focusing on the worst offenders can implicitly exceptionalise those cases, brush over lesser but more widespread behaviour and distract from the essential question: not whether someone is “good” or “bad” but whether what they have done is wrong . Focusing on actions is a step towards changing the broader culture and encouraging people to reflect and engage instead of dismissing those who dare speak up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/24/saw-too-much-why-the-horror-genre-doesnt-need-a-torture-porn-comeback","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T11:00:22Z","webTitle":"Saw too much: why the horror genre doesn't need a torture porn comeback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/24/saw-too-much-why-the-horror-genre-doesnt-need-a-torture-porn-comeback","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/24/saw-too-much-why-the-horror-genre-doesnt-need-a-torture-porn-comeback","fields":{"headline":"Saw too much: why the horror genre doesn't need a torture porn comeback","bodyText":"For seven years in a row, we came together on Halloween to share a sacred tradition with one another. In our millions, we united as a community for the sole purpose of watching unknown actors get cut, slashed, drilled, gutted and blown up in a variety of sadistically inventive contraptions. While we ate popcorn. From unlikely low-budget roots, the Saw franchise became one of Hollywood’s most financially successful horror series, making $873m worldwide from a combined budget of less than $70m. It was a strange, grim, humorless phenomenon, centered on a killer who constructed devious traps for his victims, that spawned video games, comics, theme park attractions and the advent of a new subgenre: torture porn. Naturally, horror films had always pushed our tolerance for violence but the hardest examples usually remained on the periphery. During the late 00s, they were on wide release, a date night staple every October and – thanks to three Hostel films, two Wolf Creeks and a trail of Human Centipedes – horribly visible elsewhere too. As with many a horror subgenre, fatigue set in and the cycle came to its end with Saw’s “final chapter” in 2010, a forgettable 3D installment that was met with worse-than-usual reviews. Seven years later and Lionsgate is back to its old traps with franchise-restarter Jigsaw, a flashy attempt to “own” the holiday once again (the trailer stridently states that ‘On October 27, he returns to take back Halloween’). Theoretically it’s arriving at an opportune time: 2017 has been a financially lucrative year for the horror genre, and with Paranormal Activity also giving up the ghost, Halloween has been franchise-free. But the film, ambitiously launching on Imax, is asking audiences to be clued up on a mythology that even Saw’s keenest fans would probably struggle to explain, as well as re-embrace a grubby brand of ultra-violence that’s long been pushed back to the realm of the video nasty. Torture porn was one of the least accessible horror subgenres, the casual cinemagoer less open to watching a woman’s insides fill with acid over, say, a ghost knock over a kitchen cabinet. It’s why, in just four interconnected chapters, the Conjuring franchise has already made around $300m more than all seven Saws. The niche nihilism was also off-putting to critics, with none of the sequels beating the first film’s middling 48% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Saw arrived in 2004, a time when horror films were dominated by demonic long-haired young women, either Japanese or based on Japanese characters, and a resurgence of zombies. The previous Halloween had also seen a gory remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre score well with audiences, and its success undoubtedly fed into Lionsgate’s decision to give their low-budget Sundance purchase a theatrical release over a less flashy direct-to-video slot. The UK marketing campaign led with the quote “Dare you see Saw?” which helped to create the childlike oneupmanship that bled through the entirety of the subgenre it helped to create. Each film would need to be crueler than the last, each punishment even nastier than before and eventually this became tiresome and also impossible. The first Saw was effective for its labyrinthine, Seven-aping plot but when stretched to breaking point and overwhelmed by an insufferable need to repulse, the series lost its appeal. We’re in a period where critical acclaim is correlating with box office like never before, a troubling fact for Lionsgate, who have decided to withhold the latest film from critics until opening day. The marketing campaign however, is tinged with an awareness of a cultural shift. The trailer, while teasing gory mayhem, is noticeably lighter (it’s soundtracked by Roy Orbison and even ends with something almost resembling a joke) and co-director Michael Spierig has already stated that it’s “not quite as vicious” and will be “more fun” than previous outings (he was also careful to point out that yes, there will be plenty of guts on display too though). While horror has been huge in 2017 (annual genre gross is set to top $1bn for only the second time ever), examples that have broken out have either had comic elements (Get Out, Happy Death Day) or been fantastical in nature (It, Annabelle: Creation). Cinema has been an escape for many in a troubling year (there’s an added reason why the optimistic, and inclusive, Wonder Woman has been such a big hit) and it’s difficult to understand the appeal of watching people suffer and scream their way through grotesque traps at the moment. There’s also a general franchise fatigue in the horror genre. Earlier this year, cursed-videotape reboot Rings made just $27m in the US, last month’s Flatliners remake hasn’t even crossed $20m, a Texas Chainsaw Massacre prequel went straight to DirecTV and a much-delayed new Amityville film was offered for free on Google Play earlier this month. Jigsaw is tracking to open to about $10m, a series worst and less than half of what the last film managed. Since Saw 3D was released in 2010, gruesome scares have also become readily available on the small screen. Shows like The Walking Dead and American Horror Story have pushed the limits of television violence and it’s not just the horror genre that’s undergone structural changes. Improved technology and an ongoing shift towards video within news reporting has meant that torture is all around us, tweeted, Facebooked and shared ad nauseum. Tragedy and acts of brutality have always been a part of life but they’ve never been so easily accessible. Do we want to spend money on more torture this Halloween? Lionsgate would like to think so but this weekend, there’s set to be a major piece missing from Jigsaw: the audience. Jigsaw is released in the UK on 26 October and in the US on 27 October"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/22/gunpowder-ganges-sue-perkins-chris-packham-aspergers","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T06:00:44Z","webTitle":"The Week in TV: Gunpowder; The Ganges with Sue Perkins; Chris Packham: Asperger’s and Me and more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/22/gunpowder-ganges-sue-perkins-chris-packham-aspergers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/22/gunpowder-ganges-sue-perkins-chris-packham-aspergers","fields":{"headline":"The Week in TV: Gunpowder; The Ganges with Sue Perkins; Chris Packham: Asperger’s and Me and more","bodyText":"Gunpowder (BBC1) | iPlayer The Ganges with Sue Perkins (BBC1) | iPlayer Chris Packham: Asperger’s and Me (BBC2) | iPlayer H is for Hawk: A New Chapter (BBC2) | iPlayer The Vietnam War (BBC4) | iPlayer It is the filthy England of 1603, than which there were few lands filthier, and you can practically smell the dung, both animal and human, on the streets, but the new king, James I and VI, encounters only sweet nosegays and daintily wafted hankies. There’s no doubting that Jamie Saxt, the “wisest fool in Christendom” did much to continue that era’s shining cultural age – Shakespeare, Donne, Bacon and the other lads, and then there was that Bible. One area, however, on which he’s generally agreed to have absolutely manked up, not knowing his VIs from his Is, dithering wildly and sweating like Boris on a polygraph, is Catholicism. He fervently sought peace with Spain, but was rather pamperedly weak-willed and in the end wholly outmanoeuvred by Robert Cecil, who wanted to hang, draw, quarter, burn or crush, though preferably all five, every papist in the land. Thus is the stage set for Gunpowder, the first episode of what looks to be a rather fine three-parter was rolled out last night, with Kit Harington, him off of Game of Thrones, taking (rightful) centre stage as Robert Catesby, the architect of the Catholic fightback. Guy Fawkes gets only a tiny look-in, as a knifey thug, which is pretty much as it should be historically. Harington dominates, smoulderingly, and Liv Tyler as his cousin Ann Vaux is tremendous. But the chief scene-stealer is Mark Gatiss as Cecil. He simpers, he wheedles, he has something wrong with his neck, he casually orders up unconscionable violence… he’s a tremendous villain. Be warned, though. It’s not an easy watch for those who might faint at the sight of blood, or heads being cut off and dipped in buckets of tar, or old women being stripped and tied under a barn door, on to which ton weights will be dumped: in short, it’s not an easy watch for those who get perhaps too easily confused between real life and “people doing acting”. Nasty, visceral and gutsy, as, I’m so sorry to say, is history, and truth. Moving to the more pleasant sunlit uplands of this century, I was immensely taken by The Ganges with Sue Perkins, despite my having thought I’d had my fill of famebots on overseas jollies. “I know everyone always says this on telly, but this really is an emotional journey,” she began with her sardonic raised eyebrow, and thus established herself very much as not a famebot, simply a tremendously accomplished lass who’d, incidentally, recently lost her dad. Journeying to the source of Mother Ganges, she got altitude sickness, threw up often and messily, panted heavily – she was all of us, Everylass, but with, as always, a smidgen more wit and empathy. She didn’t make overmuch of her “shit year so far” – though her voice did break, admittedly at nasty altitude and with trembling tiredness, when she vouchsafed: “You don’t know my dad, but he’s someone who’s worth grieving over”, rather a fine and understated epitaph I thought. And went on to meet, with her unique mix of caustic bubbliness, various yogi and shamans and dear sweet snotty children down the length of the Ganges, which, this being the BBC, was of course a visual treat. In terms of famebot travelogues, this is perhaps the best of 2017: subtle, elbow-nudging in a good way, never less than reflective, ultimately joyous. Sue could talk to anyone, tease out the fibres, tease out the tangles. The much-heralded H Is for Hawk: A New Chapter featured another much-mourned father in the shape of Helen Macdonald’s dad, photojournalist Alisdair, but was altogether a different proposition. It was elegaic, beautifully written, stuffed with the kind of poetic lines at which you might shiver when reading on the page… I think it should have stayed on the page rather than been transferred to TV. Helen bought another hawk, and was smitten, and it was all lovely, but ultimately a poetic 10-minute tale of woman buys bird, birds don’t understand people, isn’t that magical. Crammed into an hour. Chris Packham: Asperger’s and Me also had hawks, but was possibly the finest thing to have aired last week. Packham, who is “high-functioning autistic”, in the first half told us (reluctantly) how hard his life had been as such – horribly bullied, three suicide attempts – and in the second half went searching for “cures”. Packham, the enthusiastic wildlife presenter, loves animals more than humans. He is shruggingly happy to possess this knowledge. Doesn’t care. His enthusiasm shines out of everything he presents, though it anguishes him to even be in front of cameras, let alone people, yet he did people with Asperger’s a vaulting amount of good by agreeing to this brave programme. In the second half, among mad researching Americans trying to force-change the autistic brain, he concluded that there is no cure other than asking society, politely, to learn to better cope with Asperger’s in its midst. Silicon Valley has embraced this, and frankly so should you and I: faced with someone in a cafe or bar who knows everything about something, or some corporate drizztard who knows nothing about everything… your call. An amazing programme that should change outcomes. “The late 60s were a confluence of several rivulets… the whole movement towards racial equality, the environment, the role of women… anthems provided by the most brilliant rock’n’roll music I can imagine. I don’t know how we could exist today as a country without that experience, with all of its warts and ups and downs – that produced the America we have today. And we’re the better for it,” said Merrill McPeak (US air force), a wise and now old man, and, despite being undercut by the very Britishness of the music – Led Zep’s Dazed and Confused, the Beatles’ While My Guitar Gently Bores – I would have to concur: America would not be America without Vietnam. The wonderful BBC4 series The Vietnam War, rewatchable itchingly often, last week ran between two springtimes, those of 1969 and 1970, rather a crucial span in both that war and in America’s century. And reminded us of grim truths. The Nixon/Kissinger strategy of surrendering without being seen to do so. Sy Hersh’s breaking of the news of My Lai, which, along with Ronald Haeberle’s astonishing photos, convinced the world but most importantly America that the war didn’t require to be lost or won, but simply ended. Lt William Calley led the murder of hundreds of old men, children and women in four hours in My Lai: “throwing them in wells, machine gunning, taking a lunch break, doing it some more”. He is now a retired gemologist in Atlanta. The sweat on Nixon’s upper lip, lying on TV to the world, tells its own truth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/20/millennials-wary-free-speech-who-can-blame-them","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T05:00:45Z","webTitle":"If millennials are wary of free speech, who can blame them? | Gaby Hinsliff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/20/millennials-wary-free-speech-who-can-blame-them","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/20/millennials-wary-free-speech-who-can-blame-them","fields":{"headline":"If millennials are wary of free speech, who can blame them?","bodyText":"People who like banning things, should be banned from doing so. Discuss. And no, it’s not an A-level philosophy question. It is the essence of the argument the higher education minister Jo Johnson started this week, when he announced that universities who don’t protect freedom of speech on campus could be fined. It was preposterous, he said, that someone like Germaine Greer could be no-platformed when “she has every right, if invited, to give her views on difficult and awkward subjects”. (Greer’s invitation to give a guest lecture at Cardiff University was famously challenged by its women’s officer, who accused her of transphobia, although it eventually went ahead). Fostering “healthy disagreement” and challenging conversations was, Johnson insisted, what universities are all about. The idea of zero tolerance for liberal intolerance will be wildly popular with the sort of Tory who spontaneously combusts at the word “safe space”, and doubtless with the anonymous Cambridge don who told the Times his students seem determined to “exclude anyone who challenges them”. But the practicalities are baffling, and not just because of the fiendish difficulty universities face in making their student union activists fall into line. How does all this mesh with a Prevent anti-terrorist strategy requiring universities to keep out extremist speakers? Perhaps there will be a banned list for Prevent, and another list of those whom students are banned from banning. And it’s hard to see how fines would help with the kind of intense ethical dilemmas US universities are now facing, following increasingly violent clashes between far-right speakers and protesters on campus. Florida declared a state of emergency after white nationalist Richard Spencer was invited to speak at the University of Florida on Thursday, bearing in mind the recent death of a young woman who was protesting at a far-right rally in Charlottesville. But universities are caught between a philosophical rock and a hard place, between the right even of obnoxious individuals to freedom of speech and students’ right to freely protest. The university’s president, Kent Fuchs, admitted before the lecture that academia was still wrestling with its response, but hoped many of his students would simply stay away. Anyone is free to speak, but not everyone is entitled to be heard. Both British and American universities are now grappling with a fundamental clash of cultures, pitting an older generation of liberals who believe free speech should be protected at all costs against a younger generation that is both quicker to take offence and, crucially, much more anxious about giving it. Going back to speak to students at my old university last year, I was struck less by a zealous desire to police speech than by their desperation to avoid hurting other people’s feelings by displaying even inadvertent prejudice. They came across not as hysterical snowflakes, but as earnest and thoughtful. As ever with student politics, it’s the ridiculously self-important extremes – like Oxford’s Balliol College demanding the Christian Union be barred from a freshers’ fair because Christianity was “an excuse for homophobia” – that make headlines, even if that’s not how most students think. But it’s clear nonetheless that free speech now risks joining capitalism and democracy on the list of ideas older people absolutely take as gospel, and whose merits younger people increasingly don’t see. As with capitalism and democracy, bellowing that the kids are stupid and wrong is likely to be less successful than asking why students don’t value something that is precious to their parents for good reason. This generation of students grew up as guinea pigs in arguably the biggest experiment in untrammelled free speech in a century. The founding principle that anyone can say what they like on the internet has been both a force for good – giving dissidents in totalitarian regimes a voice, or most recently empowering women to expose the extent of sexual harassment using the #metoo hashtag – and a powerful force for ill. Bullies have so many new ways to silence, belittle and intimidate; so many thrilling opportunities to threaten violence against anyone whose opinion they don’t like. For every Arab spring nobly facilitated, there are thousands more toxic episodes of teenage bullying on Facebook, or Twitter pile-ons led by people old enough to know better. It’s exhausting for adults, never mind teenagers whose self-esteem is fragile. Teaching kids to have faith in the power of righteous argument to defeat evil, meanwhile, is vital to the functioning of a healthy democracy. But it’s a tough sell when they’ve seen Hillary Clinton lose after elegantly out-debating Donald Trump, or the remain campaign outwitted by a fib on a bus and some racially charged posters. They have grown up watching the far right systematically exploit online freedom of speech to organise, and then to achieve political breakthroughs which loom threateningly large over millennial lives. Mob rage on campus against speakers like the writer Charles Murray – the infamous proponent of the idea that IQ is closely linked to race and class, whose recent appearance at a college in Vermont ended in masked protesters clambering on his car and pounding on the windows – shocked even liberals who have loathed Murray’s views ever since his book The Bell Curve was published in the 1990s. And if they learned young that free speech has a dark side, crucially this generation has also learned that the advantages of it are not equally shared. It’s women, ethnic minorities and LGBT people who get the disproportionate share of abuse online, and anecdotal evidence suggests it’s men who do much of the trolling. The fact that women are twice as likely as men to support a regulated internet, according to a recent report from thinktank Policy Exchange, may well reflect the fact that they’re more often on the sharp end of behaviour that might need regulating. Meanwhile, the most zealous free speech advocates today aren’t kindly liberals fretting about the free exchange of ideas, but alt-right thugs from Breitbart. So in that sense, Johnson is right to make a case for open debate that for once doesn’t come from fans of Katie Hopkins. He’s right that this newly censorious mood on campus is potentially unhealthy and that the principle of free speech, subject always to not shouting “fire” in a crowded theatre, remains sacred – which is why universities have long had a statutory duty to uphold it, albeit mainly for the benefit of academics whose research leads to uncomfortable conclusions. The ideal is as important as it ever was. But it can be hard for millennials to see that, when their everyday experience is of the strong using online freedom of speech to bully the weak. What universities need from the outside world isn’t fines, but help in showing that censorship can be just as dangerously abused; that blocking arguments you don’t like doesn’t make them go away; and that debating issues face-to-face in a controlled environment is still the best way of thrashing them out. If we want students to crawl out of their safe spaces, their elders must think rather harder about what made them feel so unsafe in the first place. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/19/george-w-bush-trump-bigotry-lies-coded-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T18:16:40Z","webTitle":"George W Bush condemns bigotry and lies in coded attack on Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/19/george-w-bush-trump-bigotry-lies-coded-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/19/george-w-bush-trump-bigotry-lies-coded-attack","fields":{"headline":"George W Bush condemns bigotry and lies in coded attack on Trump","bodyText":"George W Bush sharply condemned bigotry, conspiracy theories and lies in American politics on Thursday, in what seemed to be a coded attack on the presidency of Donald Trump. Without mentioning Trump by name, the former US president urged Americans to reject white supremacy and embrace globalization in a speech organized by the institute that bears his name in New York. “Bigotry seems emboldened,” said Bush, who has seen controversy over his 2001-09 presidency among liberals and abroad eclipsed by the outrage surrounding Trump. “Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.” He added: “Bigotry in any form is blasphemy against the American creed and it means the very identity of our nation depends on the passing of civic ideals to the next generation. We need a renewed emphasis on civic learning in schools.” Bush took shots at the “governing class” while hinting at aspects of Trump’s presidency. “Our young people need positive role models,” he said. “Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone, provides permission for cruelty and bigotry, and compromises the moral education of children.” Although Bush has largely stayed out of politics since leaving office, his family’s disdain for Trump is well documented. While campaigning for his brother Jeb in the 2016 Republican primary, the former president took similarly veiled swipes at Trump. He and his father, the former president George HW Bush, skipped the Republican national convention where Trump was formally nominated last July, and declined to vote for Trump in the November election. Bush did, however, attend Trump’s inauguration and reportedly told those around him of the latter’s speech: “That was some weird shit.” It is nonetheless rare for former US presidents to publicly rebuke their successors in the White House. Trump has been the rare sitting president to draw routine criticism, even if subtle, from those who sat in the Oval Office before him. During his remarks on Thursday, Bush also condemned Russian interference in the US election, saying such foreign attacks “should never be downplayed or tolerated”, in what could be interpreted as another knock on Trump. The president has pointedly refused to accept the conclusion of the US intelligence agency that the Russians meddled in the 2016 election against the backdrop of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Bush’s comments came as Barack Obama was poised to make his return to the political stage on Thursday evening at a campaign rally in Richmond, Virginia, for the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Ralph Northam. Although Obama has issued a number of statements condemning Trump’s actions since leaving office in January, he has avoided mentioning his successor by name. The former president has nonetheless spoken out on a handful of major issues, such as the travel ban and Republican efforts to repeal and replace his healthcare law, as well as Trump’s decisions to withdraw from the Paris climate accord and rescind Daca, the Obama-era program to protect young, undocumented immigrants. Bush characterized the current era as a “unique moment” that threatened the pillars of US democracy. “We need to recall and recover our own identity,” he said. “Americans have a great advantage. To renew our country, we only need to remember our values.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/28/salt-creek-by-lucy-treloar-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-28T06:30:51Z","webTitle":"Salt Creek by Lucy Treloar review – a love song to a lost world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/28/salt-creek-by-lucy-treloar-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/28/salt-creek-by-lucy-treloar-review","fields":{"headline":"Salt Creek by Lucy Treloar review – a love song to a lost world","bodyText":"In the 1830s, when South Australia was formally established as a British province for the purposes of colonisation, a commitment was made to protect the traditional rights and lands of its indigenous people. An honourable undertaking, perhaps, but in the event little honoured. Even where they escaped genocide and forced dispossession, the creeping consequence of white settlement – the fencing and farming of land, the arrogation of fresh water sources, the dissemination of disease, the steady, stubborn erosion of language and culture – were to prove catastrophic to the Indigenous Australians. The shame and guilt of these injustices pervade Lucy Treloar’s debut novel, Salt Creek. Her English forebears were among the first white settlers in this remote region and they left behind them tantalising scraps of their ultimately unsuccessful enterprise: a letter describing a miserable journey, the discovery that a mixed-race Indigenous boy once lived on the family farm. From these fragments Treloar has conjured Stanton Finch and his family who, impoverished by a series of failed business ventures, travel to the Coorong, on the South Australian coast, to try their luck at cattle farming. Both Finch’s wife and his well-to-do parents-in-law advise against the move, but the proud, stubbornly optimistic Finch is determined to prove them wrong. As his eldest daughter Hester resignedly observes: “He has spent most of his life hoping, I think.” We know from the outset that the Finches’ venture is ill-fated. As the novel opens, Hester, rescued by a legacy from her grandparents, is living comfortably in England but she is not at peace. Amid “the blush of late winter woods and shadows as soft as blossom and sheep like clotted cream”, she finds herself yearning for “the salt bone bleached world of the Coorong”. This prefiguring of failure lends an elegiac quality to the story that then unfolds. The long and dusty journey from Adelaide to their new home, Hester tells us, “was like moving knowingly, dutifully, towards death”. Even their makeshift house, constructed from wood reclaimed from shipwrecks, carries tragedy in its walls. And yet at first it seems as though the farm might just succeed. Despite tensions with the indigenous Ngarrindjeri people, Stanton is convinced they can coexist peacefully: he encourages the education of Tully, a quick and curious Indigenous boy, and it is not long before Tully is living and working on the Finches’ farmstead. But as the setbacks pile up, Stanton’s hopefulness shrivels into something bitter and intractable, and his large, lively family begins inexorably to fall apart. Coexistence is only possible, it seems, on the white man’s terms. From its opening paragraphs, the failure of the colonial experiment, to civilise to improve, to bring reconciliation, haunts this novel. In a recent interview with the Guardian Treloar spoke of her anxieties in writing about Indigenous issues. She worried, she said, about “re-enacting that cultural thing which I was also critiquing, that idea I could just march in and do what I wanted”. By exploring her characters through Hester’s eyes, she has largely avoided that pitfall. Hester is a fine narrator, clever, thoughtful, strong-willed, caught always between her longing for freedom and the constraints of loyalty and responsibility, but she is very much of her time. As for Treloar, she is mostly too subtle a writer to be preachy. A darkening tone is lit with sparks of sharp-eyed humour; a visiting trooper drinks his tea from his saucer, “his magnificent whiskers resting on its rim like a hearth-rug”. Instead Treloar has fallen into a different trap. Like many first-time historical novelists she is head over heels in love not only with her characters but with her research. Too many of her large cast have speaking parts and not enough to say. The result, especially in the first half, is a narrative of uneven pace, weighed down by excessive detail and unnecessary repetition. At its best, Salt Creek is a love song to a lost world; the story is freighted throughout with the impossibility of changing the story or making amends. Hester’s life in the saltbush is isolated and harsh, the drudgery is unceasing, but from the start she is seduced by the wild beauty of the landscape: at dawn “the water glinted blue and the vapour lifting above the peninsula gave its sand hills and vegetation the appearance of a watercolour, as if it represented something real but was not real itself”.

Although matters appear to have accelerated since Monday when Mike Ashley publicly placed Newcastle on the market, no would-be purchaser has yet had access to the St James’ Park books. Ashley has been open to offers since the turn of the year but the formalisation of the owner’s intentions may have succeeded in smoking out prospective interest. Even so, it remains early days, with no concrete offers on the table and the signing of the non-disclosure agreements merely signalling a starting gun for the commencement of due diligence. Although Staveley’s interest has quickened pulses on Tyneside, Ashley is unlikely to get his wish of being rid of Newcastle by Christmas. “Since Monday, a number of additional parties have come forward which we believe to be credible,” said Andrew Henderson, Ashley’s lawyer, on Thursday. “We are [also] continuing to engage in conversation with a number of parties with whom we were engaged in negotiations prior to Monday’s announcement.” Staveley heads the Dubai-based financial advisory firm PCP Capital Partners – which has access to around £28bn of Middle Eastern wealth – and is a renowned deal-maker in football circles. The 44-year-old Yorkshirewoman helped broker the purchase of Manchester City by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan in 2009 and fronted Dubai International Capital’s £400m bid for Liverpool in 2008. She is believed to be keen to purchase a Premier League club herself and there are suggestions she could make a formal bid for control of Newcastle during the coming weeks. Although talks with Ashley’s representatives have been ongoing since Staveley attended the 1-1 draw with Liverpool at St James’ Park at the start of this month it is understood the key issue of price has still to be discussed. While Staveley is believed to value the club in the region of £300m, Ashley was thought to hoping for a sum closer to £400m."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/19/ritchie-cogan-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T17:25:58Z","webTitle":"Ritchie Cogan obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/19/ritchie-cogan-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/19/ritchie-cogan-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Ritchie Cogan obituary","bodyText":"My friend Ritchie Cogan, who has died aged 75, was a producer and pioneer of social action through broadcasting and, sometimes, a thorn in the side of the BBC. In 1984 he devised Crimewatch, inspired by a German format and presented by Nick Ross and Sue Cook. He enlisted the police to bring unsolved crimes to the studio. These were re-enacted on film, the public were asked to help and a battery of police officers manned the phones to take calls from the public, live on air. This year it is to be replaced by its spin-off, Crimewatch Roadshow. A year after Crimewatch he produced Drugwatch, presented by Ross and Esther Rantzen. This brought to air the biggest survey into drug abuse and led to the publication of the first national directory of help organisations. For the broadcast in July he arranged for Princess Diana to come to the studio and appear, with no advance publicity. In 1986 he continued the genre with another one-off, Childwatch, presented by Rantzen and Cook, campaigning against and supporting the victims of child abuse. This led to Childline, which still provides indispensable service. Born and raised in Dublin, the son of Erinna (nee O’Brien) and Patrick Cogan, a civil servant, Ritchie went to the Presentation Brothers school and then to Trinity College, Dublin, to study maths and physics. On graduating, in 1963 he joined the BBC in London as a studio manager. In 1972 he became a radio producer, first on Woman’s Hour, and then set up an investigative documentary unit where he worked with Roger Cook on series including Reel Evidence. In 1980 he moved to TV documentaries producing Out of Court. Ritchie was outspoken in the row over Real Lives: At the Edge of the Union (1985). A month after Margaret Thatcher’s appeal not to give terrorists “the oxygen of publicity”, the BBC made a television documentary about two Northern Irish paramilitaries (one Protestant, one Catholic – Martin McGuinness) who were also elected councillors – a fact often forgotten. The home secretary, Leon Brittan, hearing about it, declared that transmission would not be in the national interest. The BBC governors agreed and dropped the programme. Ritchie hid the programme tape under his girlfriend’s bed and arranged for it to be shown to a packed audience at the ICA. After a BBC-wide strike over the intervention, the programme was broadcast, with minor changes. In 1990, Ritchie persuaded William Nicholson to write The March, a prescient film about a multitude of African people who trek across the desert to the Moroccan coast, climb into boats, and are confronted by troops on crossing the water. Then the screen turns to black. It starred Malick Bowens and Juliet Stevenson, and was shown in 36 countries. When Ritchie left the BBC in 1991 he developed the One World Broadcasting Trust (now One World Media), a leading NPO that supports media productions concerned with the developing world. Its annual awards are prestigious and highly competitive. In 1994 he married Heike Wessels, a German translator, whom he met in 1990 when both were working on the Rio Earth summit. They settled in Cologne, where Ritchie became a freelance consultant on human rights media. Ritchie is survived by Heike and their son, Robin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/20/trump-mistakenly-links-uk-rise-with-spread-of-islamic-terror","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T13:40:36Z","webTitle":"Trump links UK crime rise to 'spread of Islamic terror'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/20/trump-mistakenly-links-uk-rise-with-spread-of-islamic-terror","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/20/trump-mistakenly-links-uk-rise-with-spread-of-islamic-terror","fields":{"headline":"Trump links UK crime rise to 'spread of Islamic terror'","bodyText":"Donald Trump has erroneously linked a rise in recorded crime in England and Wales to the “spread of radical Islamic terror” in his latest outburst on Twitter. “Just out report: ‘United Kingdom crime rises 13% annually amid spread of Radical Islamic terror.’ not good, we must keep America safe!” wrote the US president. The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS), in its quarterly update on crime on Thursday, reported a 13% increase in all police-recorded offences across England and Wales. The ONS said police had recorded 5.2m offences in the year to June, including gun crime, knife crime, robberies, sexual offences, stalking and harassment, burglary and car crime. The report barely mentions terrorism other than to refer on one occasion to the impact recent terrorist attacks in Britain had on the headline murder rate. Thirty-five people were killed in the incidents in London and Manchester. The president’s attention to the crime figures will not please Downing Street, as there were aspects of the ONS report that would have sounded political alarm bells, namely the acceleration in the rise in the number of police-recorded incidents of violent crime in the past two years. There were double-digit increases in certain types of violent crime, such as gun crime, knife crime and sexual offences. The tweet was immediately seized on by far-right groups and commentators. It was retweeted by the former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson. The newspaper columnist Katie Hopkins quoted Trump’s tweet with a reference to “child rape squads”, which was in turn retweeted by Paul Watson, the alt-right conspiracy theorist. Others criticised Trump for linking the crime statistics with a rise in Islamist extremism. Miqdaad Versi, assistant secretary general at the Muslim Council for Britain, who campaigns against misrepresentation of Muslims in the media, called the tweet “incompetent”. The Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson, likened the post to a hate crime. Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat MP, accused Trump of spreading fear. Caroline Lucas, the Green party co-leader, challenged the prime minister, Theresa May, to condemn Trump. Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and chair of the home affairs select committee, called the tweet “ignorant”. Trump’s concern to “keep America safe” comes at a time when gun control is once again on the political agenda after the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual on US soil. Stephen Paddock killed 58 people and injured hundreds at a music festival in Las Vegas with one of 23 legally purchased guns he had in his hotel room. Trump has previously exaggerated the impact of so-called radical Islamism on life in Britain. During his presidential campaign, he suggested that police in London feared for their lives because of the significant number of radicalised individuals in the capital. In remarks made shortly after he called for a “shutdown” of Muslims entering the US, he said: “Look at what happened in Paris, the horrible carnage, and frankly, if you look at Paris, and I hate to do this because the Chamber of Commerce is going to go crazy, but Paris is no longer the same city it was. “They have sections in Paris that are radicalised, where the police refuse to go there. They’re petrified. The police refuse to go in there. We have places in London and other places that are so radicalised that the police are afraid for their own lives. We have to be very smart and very vigilant.” The England and Wales data published on Thursday included a 27% rise in gun crime to 6,696 offences, a 26% increase in knife crime to 36,998 offences, robberies up 25% to 64,499, sexual offences up 19% to 129,700, and stalking and harassment up 36% to 243,086 reported incidents."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/20/theresa-may-says-uk-examining-brexit-divorce-bill-line-by-line","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T10:50:17Z","webTitle":"Theresa May says UK examining Brexit divorce bill 'line by line'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/20/theresa-may-says-uk-examining-brexit-divorce-bill-line-by-line","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/20/theresa-may-says-uk-examining-brexit-divorce-bill-line-by-line","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May says UK examining Brexit divorce bill 'line by line'","bodyText":"Theresa May has said the UK is examining “line by line” how much it will pay the EU when it leaves the union, which may involve handing over many more billions than the €20bn (£17.9bn) of budget contributions promised so far. Speaking on Friday, the prime minister did not deny that she had told EU leaders on Thursday night that her Florence speech was “not the final word” on what Britain was willing to pay as a financial settlement for Brexit. Asked whether it was conceivable that the total bill could reach €60bn, as demanded by the EU, she did not dismiss the sum out of hand, unlike Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who has said Brussels can “go whistle” for such an amount. “I’ve been very clear on where we are in relation to the financial settlement,” she said. “I’ve set out the reassurance to our European colleagues and we will go through that line by line in relation to the commitments that we’ve made in our membership. “And I’ve also said in the past, if there are particular programmes where we wish to continue to be a member then of course we would look at paying relevant costs in relation to that, programmes such as science and research, and perhaps some of the justice issues.” In her Florence speech, May promised to pay into the EU budget until 2021, at a cost of €20bn, but did not put a price tag on honouring further financial obligations or specify what these would be. Speaking in Brussels on the last day of the EU summit, she said: “What I’ve made clear in relation to financial contributions is what I set out in my Florence speech. What I’ve said is that [no EU member state] need be concerned about the current budget plan that they will have to pay for or receive less as a result of the UK leaving, and we will honour the commitments we have made during our membership. “As for the detailed work on those commitments, as David Davis has said, we are going through them line by line and we will continue to go through them line by line. The British taxpayer wouldn’t expect the government to do anything else.” There are growing suspicions that No 10 will avoid putting a hard figure on how much it will end up paying the EU, although May said the amount would be clear when a final deal was struck at the end of negotiations. Her remarks came as EU leaders decided that they would not open trade talks with the UK yet, but were prepared to talk about the issue among themselves. It took the 27 EU leaders just 90 seconds to agree on a statement in which they ruled that insufficient progress had been made over the three key withdrawal issues: citizens’ rights, the Irish border and the financial settlement. It had been clear for days, if not weeks, that the prime minister had not done enough on the issue of Britain’s divorce bill for trade talks to open, and her last-minute appeal over dinner on Thursday failed even to persuade the leaders that some engagement could be had on the terms of a transition period. The member states, along with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, will only discuss internally their vision for a transition period and future relationship, without engaging with the British. The next moment for leaders to decide whether sufficient progress has been made, allowing direct talks on trade and transition, is likely to be a European council summit on 14 December. The Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, told reporters May’s address over dinner was her “best performance yet” but that the UK’s failure to offer concrete proposals on the financial settlement continued to be the stumbling block. “I think it was quite a constructive speech that she delivered,” he said. “She made her case in a very eloquent manner but I think it hasn’t really changed anything from before that. “To be honest, I think it was her best performance yet in the sense that it conveyed a warm, candid and sincere appeal that she wants progress to be made that she has moved her position.” The Austrian chancellor, Christian Kern, said: “It is clear to see there is rhetorical progress, but we need to come to conclusions because uncertainty is not good for the continent and economies. It is up the to the British government to propose something that is the basis for progress.” Dalia Grybauskaitė, the president of Lithuania, echoed those comments, but also suggested the EU needed to stop posturing. “[We need to move] from words to real deeds. And probably we all – not only the UK, us also – it is time go for real negotiations and and not just negotiating in the media by rhetoric … It is time to go straight to the table.” Asked if she agreed with Muscat, that the speech was May’s best effort so far, she said: “If we talk about rhetorical abilities, maybe, but in negotiations you need concrete negotiation abilities, not only rhetoric.” The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said: “We have some details but we don’t have all the details we need. Work is going on.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/21/half-of-all-uk-broadband-users-get-a-bad-deal-says-which","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T06:01:15Z","webTitle":"Half of all UK broadband users get a bad deal, says Which?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/21/half-of-all-uk-broadband-users-get-a-bad-deal-says-which","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/21/half-of-all-uk-broadband-users-get-a-bad-deal-says-which","fields":{"headline":"Half of all UK broadband users get a bad deal, says Which?","bodyText":"Half of all broadband users in the UK are getting a raw deal from their supplier, with slow speeds, rising prices and router failures exasperating customers, according to a damning assessment of Britain’s internet services. Consumer group Which? found that 53% of households have had difficulties with their broadband, with customers of Virgin Media, TalkTalk, Sky and BT the most likely to experience an issue. As few as one in 10 households receive the super-fast broadband speeds promised in adverts, said Which?. One third of TalkTalk’s customers complained about “very slow” broadband speeds, as did 22% of BT internet users. Connection drop-outs were a frequent problem for 17% of broadband users, with 8% of households reporting that they suffered from no connection at all for hours or days at a time. Price hikes for landline rentals have spurred widespread customer dissatisfaction. BT introduced its third price rise in 18 months at the start of the year, forcing it to deny that it was squeezing customers after paying £1.2bn for Champions League football rights. Virgin customers’ top complaint was about price increases, said Which?, with 38% of users angry over increased line rental costs. Which? surveyed 1,709 telecoms customers between June and July. Alex Neill of Which? said: “Far too many people get a poor deal from their broadband provider, with problems ranging from very slow speeds to going days without any connection at all, which just isn’t good enough. “The regulator must now deliver on its plans to improve the information that customers get about speeds when they sign up to a provider, and allow them to easily exit a contract if they’re not getting what they’ve been promised.” Ofcom, which regulates broadband suppliers, said: “We completely agree that broadband providers must up their game.” It recently ordered suppliers to give more realistic information about speeds, and later this year will introduce a new compensation deal for households that suffer delayed repairs, late installations and missed engineer appointments. The UK lags behind countries including the US, the Netherlands and Japan for 4G and broadband speeds, according to a report last week by the National Infrastructure Commision. Andrew Adonis, chairman of the commission, said: “Today’s findings [from Which?] demonstrate the scale of the problems customers are having with the current level of broadband service, but also the challenge we face if we are to have the best possible connections in future. “The UK risks falling behind our international competitors if we don’t invest in the latest ultrafast and fibre technology – broadband providers must also step up to the plate and improve the services they currently deliver to our homes and businesses,” added Lord Adonis. A study published this month by the Social Market Foundation thinktank found that landline rental and broadband is among the least competitive of all consumer markets in the UK. “The lack of competitive pressures in the landline-only space means there have been few incentives for companies to compete on price … while wholesale costs of providing a landline service fell by 26% in real terms in recent years, line rental charges faced by consumers increased by 25-49%.” TalkTalk said it was disappointed by the Which? findings and that recent investment had led to fewer faults and quicker repair times. Virgin Media said it was one of the least-complained about broadband providers and the majority of customers got their advertised speed. There was support for the broadband suppliers from comparison site cable.co.uk. Its telecoms expert Dan Howdle said: “It’s easy to complain about broadband in the UK, but on international comparisons we are not doing that badly. We are 31st in the world out of 200 countries on speeds and in the cheapest third when it comes to the cost of broadband.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/20/storm-brian-south-coast-england-met-office","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T10:52:05Z","webTitle":"Storm Brian thunders towards south coast of England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/20/storm-brian-south-coast-england-met-office","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/20/storm-brian-south-coast-england-met-office","fields":{"headline":"Storm Brian thunders towards south coast of England","bodyText":"Britain is braced for Brian, the second named storm of the season, which is forecast to bring 70mph winds and heavy rain that could cause coastal flooding in the south of England on Saturday. The Met Office has issued yellow warnings for wind across the whole of the southern and western coast of England from 4am on Saturday, with south-western areas expected to be among the worst affected. The storm, which coincides with high tides, is expected to send waves thundering into coastal areas. The hazardous conditions come days after Storm Ophelia wreaked havoc in Ireland, killing three people, toppling trees and causing widespread damage that left thousands of homes without power. The Irish meteorological service, Met Éireann, has issued an orange warning for wind across the south of the country from 6am on Saturday. Alex Burkill, a Met Office meteorologist, said the risk of strong winds in England extended further north than first thought. “Gusts of 50-60mph inland seem fairly plausible, and around exposed coastal areas we can expect to see winds of between 60-70mph,” he said. “The worst-risk areas are along the south coast and the west coast, but even heading as far north as north-west England, such as the west coast of Cumbria and Lancashire, which are now in the yellow warning area.” Ben Lukey, the national flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said: “Strong winds across southern and western England on Friday and into Saturday will coincide with high tides. This is likely to cause large waves and spray which could lead to coastal flooding along the south and south-west coast.” He said agency staff were checking defences and taking precautionary measures, such as closing tidal gates and putting up temporary barriers. “We urge people to stay safe along the coast and warn against putting yourself in unnecessary danger by taking ‘storm selfies’ or driving through flood water – just 30cm is enough to move your car.” Highways England said drivers should check the latest weather and travel conditions before setting off on any journeys on Saturday. Richard Leonard, the head of road user safety, said: “In high winds, there’s a particular risk to lorries, caravans and motorbikes so we’d advise drivers of these vehicles to slow down and avoid using exposed sections of road if possible.” Brian is the result of an explosive cyclogenesis, or weather bomb, that took place over the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday. A weather bomb is considered to have occurred when pressure drops by 24 millibars in 24 hours. Such conditions are caused when a jet stream of strong winds high in the atmosphere interacts with a low pressure system. The jet stream removes air from the low pressure system, reducing its weight and causing the pressure to fall. As the pressure drops, air is sucked in from the surrounding area, which means the low pressure system spins faster and faster. The Met Office describes the phenomenon as working in the same way that an ice skater spins faster by drawing in their arms. It says on its website: “The resulting winds peak over a period of a few hours and can be strong enough to bring down trees and cause structural damage.” Storm Aileen, the first UK-named storm of the season, left thousands of homes without power last month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/20/tell-us-how-working-in-hospitality-has-changed-since-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T16:43:11Z","webTitle":"Tell us how working in hospitality has changed since Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/20/tell-us-how-working-in-hospitality-has-changed-since-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/20/tell-us-how-working-in-hospitality-has-changed-since-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Tell us how working in hospitality has changed since Brexit","bodyText":"A staffing crisis in the hospitality industry is inevitable as a result of the Brexit vote, according to an industry association.

Do not be alarmed, normal service will almost certainly be resumed by the end of the week. I sound this note of caution because Cambridge University has now taken to issuing “trigger warnings” to students in advance of lectures to help prevent distress. English students were recently advised that a seminar on Titus Andronicus would contain discussion of sexual violence and sexual assault. Not to mention 14 murders, including the ritual sacrifice of a son by his father. Although the advice stops short of saying “all persons in this play are entirely fictitious and resemblance to person or persons, either living or dead, is entirely coincidental so please do not ring the Crimewatch helpline that has been discontinued because the BBC has killed off the programme”, it does make you wonder how little prior knowledge Cambridge expects of those studying Shakespeare. Does Henry V come with the warning that it may feature battle scenes containing images of graphic violence? Tuesday In the past, a 6am flight to a foreign country to watch Spurs play in Europe has been the prelude to several days of questioning the sanity of forking out several hundred pounds to watch my team slide to defeat, prior to being kettled outside the ground by a police force dressed in riot gear that appears disappointed there have been no signs of violence. When I last went to the Bernabeu nearly seven years ago, we lost 4-0 as the whole team succumbed to stage fright and my feelings of profound existential futility were in full cry. My expectations weren’t much higher this time round as I climbed my way to the top of the vertiginously steep stand – aptly called the “vomitorio” – allocated to the away fans. Instead, Tottenham managed to more than hold their own and came away with a well-earned draw. Which felt as good as a win. All the money spent and discomfort endured was suddenly worthwhile. Though it did make me question the nature of my support. One of the reasons I’ve always felt a connection to Tottenham is because they can usually be relied on to let you down – they fail, so I don’t have to. Following a successful team requires a completely different mindset. Wednesday The Conservative MP Tim Loughton has told Radio 5 Live that he likes to spend at least an hour in the bath every day to help “compose his thoughts”. Keeping the hot water topped up to the required temperature has cost the taxpayer £662 in expense claims, according to reports, but I can’t say I’ve seen much sign of the bath’s restorative powers judging by Loughton’s recent contributions to political discourse. Loughton is chair of the all-party parliamentary group on mindfulness and he has much to be mindful of. Two years ago he was the campaign manager for Andrea Leadsom’s unsuccessful leadership bid and his crowning moment came after Leadsom had given a talk billed as “a major speech on the economy” that lasted well under 20 minutes and didn’t mention the economy once. When the speech ended, Loughton lead a protest march of 20 people to parliament, shouting: “Who do we want? Andrea Leadsom! When do we want her? Sometime around September!” We still have a #RALLY4LEADSOM T-shirt in the Guardian office in Westminster. It’s a collector’s item. Thursday As political sketch writer, I get to hear more speeches than most. And I can’t yet think of one that wouldn’t have been improved by being a bit shorter. Even those that go down a storm, such as Jeremy Corbyn’s speech at this year’s Labour party conference. Shortly after it ended, one of Corbyn’s senior advisers asked me what I had thought of it. “You honestly want to know?” I said. Apparently he did. So I told him it would make everyone’s life a lot easier if he could cut next year’s speech down from 75 to 45 minutes. “Noted, John,” said the adviser. I think he meant it, too. I’m not sure if I would have quite had the nerve to say the same thing to Xi Jinping’s team after the Chinese president marked his first term in office with a speech lasting three hours and 23 minutes. Mind you, delegates might have had a clue they were in for a marathon when they saw the title of the speech. “Secure a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and strive for the great success of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era” isn’t exactly punchy. Friday This morning I got a message from Facebook informing me it had kindly compiled a video highlights package to celebrate my nine years of friendship with Robbie and that, if I wanted to, I could share it with all my other friends. After giving this almost no thought whatsoever, I decided against it. For one thing, I rarely bother to post anything on Facebook as I find it hard to believe anyone on it is in the slightest bit interested in anything I am doing, since my life tends to follow a very ordered routine. A combination of wake up, go to work, come home, go to the gym, watch TV, go to the football. Anyone who really knows me well can pretty much guess what I’ll be doing at any given point of the week. I am that dull. But there is also another reason why I chose not to post the Facebook video: Robbie is my 21-year-old son, and I like to think we have been friends for rather longer than nine years.

Speaking after Theresa May called on EU leaders to help her strike a Brexit deal she could sell to British voters, the German chancellor gave an upbeat report on the state of talks, while noting the challenges ahead. “I don’t have any reason to believe we are not going to be successful,” she told reporters. The divorce talks, which are focused on the financial settlement, EU citizens’ rights and the Irish border, “may take a bit longer than we thought in the beginning, [but] it doesn’t mean, we are not working hard to reach the second stage, which is undeniably going to be more complicated than the first stage”. The EU would find it a bit more difficult to formulate a mandate to guide those talks, she said. The difficulty for the bloc is how to protect the integrity of its single market, while avoiding damage to its economic interests. “The ball is not only in Great Britain’s court, it is also in our court at the same time because we are about to enter the phase where we have to put into language, into words, what a non-sufficient adherence to the rules of the single market is,” Merkel said. “Great Britain has not been very clear about the details of that relationship. The European Union 27 may have certain ideas, but we haven’t put it down into clear terms.” EU negotiators have welcomed May’s concessions on the EU budget and European court of justice, but believe she has not moved beyond the “have your cake and eat it” philosophy on trade links. Senior officials say the British government has not recognised that leaving the web of EU rules and courts to “take back control”, will mean British firms have less access to the EU single market. One senior source told the Guardian: “To me it is very binary: the more sovereignty, the lower the market access and vice versa. The UK will want to match [current] market access but we will not want to offer it.” The debate on future trade ties will test the unity of the EU27, where economic interests diverge. Countries such as Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium risk a bigger hit to their economic growth in the event of a hard Brexit. EU leaders are expected to launch internal talks on trade at Friday’s meeting, with officials promising that the EU will be ready to negotiate with the UK after more progress has been made on the Brexit bill. Merkel said: “We have to say, what are the conclusions we are drawing [for] that kind of partnership or [another] kind of partnership?” May will leave the EU summit, allowing the other 27 leaders to discuss their Brexit plans without her. On Thursday night, the prime minister made her five-minute Brexit pitch to EU leaders over coffee, after a dinner dedicated to foreign policy issues, including Iran, North Korea and Turkey. Merkel revealed she had been talking about the Iran nuclear deal with May and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, when the three were photographed in the summit room deep in conversation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2017/oct/20/brexit-theresa-may-angela-merkel-hopeful-deal-europe-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T15:57:26Z","webTitle":"Merkel hopeful of Brexit deal after May's pleas - politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2017/oct/20/brexit-theresa-may-angela-merkel-hopeful-deal-europe-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2017/oct/20/brexit-theresa-may-angela-merkel-hopeful-deal-europe-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Brexit: Emmanuel Macron accuses Brexiters of 'bluffing' on no-deal scenario  - as it happened","bodyText":"Thanks for following the blog today and for all your comments. Here is a summary of the day’s events: Emmanuel Macron, has accused Brexiters of “bluffing” on a no-deal scenario. The French president said Theresa May had never mentioned such a possibility. Macron also said “a lot still needs to be done” before phase 2 talks - which will address trade and the transition to Brexit - begin. “We haven’t even got half way there yet,” he said. Earlier, it was confirmed that EU leaders have agreed to start internal discussions on their approach to the second phase. The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said reports of a deadlock between the EU and the UK have been exaggerated and insisted there has been progress. Theresa May said negotiators are going through how much Britain owes the EU in financial contributions line by line. The former Labour cabinet minister, Peter Mandelson, told BBC Radio 4’s Today no deal would be “disastrous for the county”. Mandelson also said Labour was in a strong position electorally but warned Jeremy Corbyn of the dangers of playing only to his base. The Labour MP Clive Lewis has “unreservedly” apologised after video emerged of him telling someone to “get on your knees bitch” at a fringe event at last month’s party conference. His comments, which appeared to be made in jest and aimed at a man, attracted widespread condemnation from politicians on all sides including prominent women in the Labour party. Here is the Guardian story on Macron’s comments accusing Brexiters of trying to “bluff” the EU into softening its negotiating stance. The SNP’s Mhairi Black has been talking in the Commons about Harvey Weinstein and the treatment of women more broadly, particularly in parliament. Her comments suggest that some MPs are stuck in the dark ages. She said: The Weinstein stuff shows you that when you get this culture of untouchable power that you can’t ask questions of, it shows you what goes on behind the scenes. That’s exactly what we’ve got in Westminster, so the more we can chip away at that the better it is for everybody. I’ve never been sexually assaulted or anything like that, but in terms of the sexism and the condescending attitudes, oh God yes. The first week I was down, one of the first conversations I had with with one of the Tory old guard. I’d asked when the summer holidays were and he said ‘I think you’ll find it’s called recess darling’. And I said ‘No I think you’ll find I’m called Mhairi sweetheart’. So I had to have loads of run-ins like that, some of them a lot uglier than that. Yesterday, I had the first I’ve had in ages, when someone I’m on a committee with walked by and he’s always very mannerly and said ‘It’s quite rich of you to have a go at Douglas Ross [Tory MP who skipped universal credit vote to referee] for not being here, when you’ve not been here’. And I said ‘There’s a difference between being unwell and being at a football match.’ Had I been a guy not a chance in hell he’s have said that to me, but that’s the world they live in. There’s plenty of creeps in politics but I steer well clear of them. Quite often I see conversations where I’m going: ‘see if I was her I’d have lamped him by now’ because there are guys in that place that are totally self- entitled. It’s a power thing. Even the way they speak, their body language, is awful. During debates some guys only take interventions from guys. Regarding the #metoo campaign, she said: Even on my personal Facebook, stories are coming up, and it’s ‘My God, I didn’t know that had happened’. It’s brilliant that women are coming forward and I’m sick to the back teeth especially of other women saying ‘you should have said something long ago’. Don’t dare put that on folk. The exact reason that they’re speaking out now is to make sure that the next generation don’t have to feel the way they did. I think it’s really harrowing reading through it. Taking another detour from Brussels, Labour MP Clive Lewis has “unreservedly” apologised after video emerged of him telling someone to “get on your knees bitch” at a fringe event at last month’s party conference. His language attracted widespread condemnation from politicians on all sides including prominent women in the Labour party, among them Harriet Harman, Jess Phillips and Stella Creasy. A Labour party spokeswoman also denounced the comments, although other panellists at the Novara media-hosted event said Lewis’s words had been mischaracterised. Guardian columnist Dawn Foster tweeted: “For context, I’m stood next to Clive in this video – he said it to a male audience member in jest, not me.” Senior Tory Brexiteer Bernard Jenkin has warned the prime minister she should not sign up to a deal at any price, suggesting that failure to strike a deal would not be as bad as feared. He told BBC News: “The cost of paying tariffs on our exports to the EU would be less than half our annual net contribution. It is cheaper to pay for access to the single market by paying the tariffs than for us to be continuing to pay our subscription as a member of the EU. “We are pulling out halfway through a budget process. It is only reasonable that we should consider helping the EU out as we leave the EU and withdraw our contributions but if this becomes much more expensive than envisaged it is simply not worth it.” Henry Newman, director of the Open Europe thinktank, believes those casting doubt about the progress of the Brexit talks are wrong. He writes for Comment is Free: Despite publicly saying that sufficient progress is not made, the European commission is privately telling politicians from EU member states that only “technical issues” remain to be resolved before settling on EU citizens’ rights. Meanwhile several of Open Europe’s contacts at the London embassies of EU member states have confirmed to us that they are pleased with developments in the talks. One embassy is even sending the message back to their capital that the UK had moved about as far as it could at this stage of the talks and there is a danger of backing the prime minister into a corner – precisely what May herself is now saying. Reaction to the prime minister’s comments in Brussels is starting to come in. The Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, said: The prime minister cannot say one thing in Brussels and another in Britain. She needs to face down the right-wing Brexiteers in her party in order to guarantee the talks actually move forward. Above all, she still needs to protect citizens’ rights to ensure they are not a casualty of a no deal Brexit, and the European Union must also do more to make this happen. Allie Renison, the head of EU and trade policy at the Institute of Directors, warned that “rigidity will cost both sides dearly” in the talks: No one should treat this as a simple game of brinkmanship; the livelihoods of too many businesses and employees are at stake. We hope EU member states will use the next two months to work constructively with the European commission and the UK, so that discussion on our future relationship and interim arrangements in particular starts before the end of the year. Finally, while we know there is a risk of all parties failing to reach a deal, it is important that this does not become an overriding fixation for the UK. Beyond the Brexit talks, the US president, Donald Trump, has been criticised for erroneously linking a rise in recorded crime in England and Wales - which he referred to as the United Kingdom - and the “spread of radical Islamic terror”. Labour’s deputy leader was among those to chastise Trump. Some more on Macron’s comments: asked by a journalist if he took “seriously the threat of no deal, raised by some Conservatives”, the French president said: “There is one negotiator on the British side under the political authority of Theresa May. At no moment has Theresa May ever raised a ‘no deal’ as an option.” He added that, if there were “noises, bluff, false information by secondary actors or spectators to this discussion or in the media” in the UK, it was just part and parcel of it. But he stressed the option of “no deal” had not been formally put on the table. In no case is it part of the discussions. The discussions are going forward. They are going forward at a better pace these past few weeks. But the objective of all the negotiators is to get to an agreement on the first phase. If there’s no agreement on the first phase, there can’t be a moving on to the second phase. And it’s principally the UK that has something to lose by that, given its very strong dependence on the European Union and its engagements taken as part of the European Union. Asked to put a figure on the divorce bill, Macron said: “It’s not up to me to put a figure on the remaining amount — it’s up to Michel Barnier to lead the detail on that — but it’s substantial.” The Confederation of British Industry’s director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, says the “warm words” at the European council summit are welcome and praised the prime minister for her Florence speech. “But, for firms across Europe, warm words are not enough”. She called for firms to be given more stability. A transition deal by year end is top of the list. We urge the EU to put people before process and take a pragmatic approach to recognising sufficient progress. And the UK must continue to seek to unblock discussions. Where agreement is within touching distance, make the final step. While all effort and goodwill must go into securing the new partnership, firms across the EU have no choice but to prepare for all outcomes, including ‘no deal’. Larger firms are already well advanced in their plans and the CBI will now support its small and medium sized members to do the same. Inevitably, as these plans are implemented there is a cost to communities, from Berlin to Brighton. Both sides must put the shared interests of UK and EU citizens first by providing a roadmap for the future, with transition agreed by Christmas so the shape of the final deal can be discussed early next year. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has given a press conference at the European council summit. He acknowledged the positive signals coming out of the European council summit on the Brexit negotiations. But he said: And Macron insisted that, even if some in Britain say it would be possible to walk away from the EU without any deal, May never mentioned the possibility. Macron called speculation about that option “bluffing”. Here are the morning’s main developments: The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said reports of a deadlock between the EU and the UK have been exaggerated and insisted there has been progress. EU leaders have agreed to start internal discussions on their approach to the “second phase” - talks on trade and the transition to Brexit. Theresa May said negotiators are going through how much Britain owes the EU in financial contributions line by line. The former Labour cabinet minister, Peter Mandelson, told BBC Radio 4’s Today no deal would be “disastrous for the county”. Mandelson also said Labour was in a strong position electorally but warned Jeremy Corbyn of the dangers of playing only to his base. Tusk said: My impression is that the reports of the deadlock between the EU and the UK have been exaggerated. While progress has not been sufficient, it doesn’t mean there has been no progress at all. The negotiations go on and we will continue to approach them positively and constructively. I hope that we will be able to move to the second phase of our talks in December... I want to be the positive motivator for the next five or six weeks because our ambition is to achieve this, the final of the first phase in December. And for this we need also, maybe, more positive narrative ... What was my feeling today, also during my meeting before our session, my tete-a-tete with Prime Minister Theresa May, I feel that, for sure, both sides present only goodwill, and this is why I, maybe, in my rhetoric, I’m, maybe, a little bit more optimistic than Michel Barnier, but we are also in a different role. Michel Barnier is responsible for the negotiations, I am more responsible, first of all for our unity, but also for a good atmosphere and positive mood. This is the only difference. And here is Juncker The press conference has concluded but here is Tusk in optimistic mood: Juncker says no-one from Britain has explained to him what a “no deal” looks like and he says no-one explained to the British people what Brexit would look like. Asked about European Chief Negotiator for Brexit Michele Barnier’s use of the expression “deadlock” last week, Tusk says this is not the best moment to discuss “rhetoric”. He wants to be positive, he says. Both sides present only goodwill, he insists, although he concedes that he is maybe more optimistic The European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, makes a reference to the British press being “superficial”. He jokes - I think - that he might have used the expression “deadlock” four times instead of three. He adds: I want to have a fair deal with Britain. Juncker said he would “hate no deal”. Tusk said he hopes to move into the second phase of Brexit talks in December. He said Theresa May’s Florence speech had given the talks some momentum. The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk is speaking in Brussels now. He says reports of a deadlock between the EU and the UK have been exaggerated and insists there has been progress. Video of the prime minister’s press conference can now be viewed online: Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, Debbie Abrahams, has responded to Iain Duncan Smith’s defence of Universal Credit on this morning’s edition of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. In particular, she has attacked his claim that 60% of people going on to Universal Credit were carrying debts accrued as a result of problems with the tax credit regime. Those struggling to keep their heads above water on the government’s disastrous Universal Credit full service won’t appreciate a history lesson from the man responsible for much of this mess. The former work and pensions secretary’s claims have been disproved by the DWP’s own statistics, which show that half of those in rent arrears under Universal Credit went into arrears after staring their claim. I would also like to gently remind him that Labour’s tax credits improved the lives of millions of families, making work pay and helping to lift over a million children out of poverty, rather than exacerbating the problem as the emaciated Universal Credit system is predicted to do. Regardless, the admission by Mr Duncan Smith that there are high levels of debt under Universal Credit is surely enough for him to back our calls for a pause and fix. A call supported by the House of Commons in a unanimous vote. Yet more on the presentational issues associated with Theresa May’s appearance in Brussels: It has been speculated that Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron’s decision to walk to the summit chamber with Theresa May yesterday was intended as a public show of support for her and an attempt to avoid the emergence of more damaging images that appear to cast the prime minister as a lonely figure in Brussels. Some are still left wondering if her team has quite mastered the optics, however. Perhaps this is more the shot they were hoping for: The final question from journalists is on Catalonia. What advice does May have for the region’s leadership? May sidesteps that, saying she has spoken to the Spanish prime minister and the country’s law and constitution must be respected. The Spanish courts had ruled Catalonia’s independence referendum unconstitutional prior to it being held. May is asked when she will be able to put a number on it. She says it will “come as part of the final agreement”, without putting a date on it. The prime minister is asked if the bill could go as high as €60bn. She responds that she has been very clear in saying the government will go through the financial contribution proposals “line by line”. The next question refers to the December talks: is May willing to give further detail in order to get talks moving? The prime minister rather sidesteps the question, saying she is “positive and optimistic about where we can get to”. May is asked about the money to be paid by the UK - has the quantity increased? She says nothing has changed from her Florence speech. On Brexit, May says the EU and UK “share the same objective” of protecting the rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU. May says the Belfast agreement must be at the heart of the approach, that the peace process must not be affected and that there must be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Theresa May is opening her delayed press conference. She says she looks forward to working with the EU in the future. The EU leaders also discussed foreign policy, May says, adding that they reiterate their “firm commitment” to the Iran nuclear deal. She also condemns North Korea and specifically names China as a nation that must help deal with the issue. As mentioned earlier - now confirmed - EU leaders have agreed to start internal discussions on their approach to the “second phase” - talks on trade and the transition to Brexit. This does not mean that such talks between the UK and EU27 are set to start, however. But the move does pave the way for the possible start of formal talks on the future EU/UK trade relationship in December. Theresa May’s press conference, which was due to start about 15 minutes ago, is likely to get going closer to 10.30am, we’re told. The former Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, is floating around the European Council, saying Theresa May’s efforts are “absolutely dismal” and she should not have signed up to talking simply about three red-line issues - EU citizens, Northern Ireland and money - before going on to discuss trade. But he held out some hope there could be a breakthrough, courtesy of the German chancellor Angela Merkel, who he said was under pressure from domestic industry. “Merkel could be the peace broker. She is the only hope,” he said. A Commons committee will examine how prepared the government is for a “no deal” exit from the European Union. The Treasury select committee will hear from Sir Ivan Rogers, the UK’s former ambassador to the European Union, who has described a no deal Brexit as “nuts”. The committee, which is led by the former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan, will consider transitional arrangements and the long-term economic relationship between the UK and EU as part of its inquiry. Morgan, a Conservative MP and a prominent Remain supporter, said: The progress and outcome of the Brexit negotiations will have profound implications for the economy and public finances. The committee will consider the short-term risks to an orderly withdrawal, and the shape of the long-term economic relationship. Firms and individuals need certainty about the situation after March 2019. The priority of the inquiry, therefore, will be to consider the negotiation, design and governance of transitional arrangements. Sir Ivan, who quit his Brussels post in January citing “muddled thinking” about Brexit, will give evidence on October 25 along with legal experts Professor Sir Alan Dashwood QC and Professor Catherine Barnard. The Department for Exiting the EU has responded to reports that the minister in charge, David Davis, is planning to present a “no-deal” plan to the cabinet, saying: It is in everyone’s interests to secure a good deal for both sides. We think that is by far and away the most likely outcome, but we have a duty to plan for the alternative. As expected, May and Tusk are meeting in Brussels. Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary defends the Universal Credit rollout. Opponents have attacked it for pushing people into debt, among other things. The way it was set to roll out is unique because, in the past when tax credit was rolled out, it was rolled out cross the country at one go. Nearly a million people got not money. And, since then, it’s been open to fraud and abuse. Some people say over £20bn has been lost through fraud and tax credits. People still arrive in my surgery and many surgeries having huge debts at the end of the year because of tax credits. All of this goes with Universal Credit. But the problem is that when they moved tax credits over... many of these people - 60% coming on to Universal Credit - carry debts and arrears already, directly as a result of those arrangement which are failing. Iain Duncan Smith opens his Today programme interview by objecting to the connotations of the phrase ‘no deal’, saying it suggests a position with no trade rules. Instead, it is a case of “what deal”, he says, and World Trade Organisation rules, which would be used if no deal was reached, is a position with trade rules. But he clarifies: it is not a position he would want necessarily to see. The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said Theresa May told Europe’s leaders she will not accept a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. He commended her address at the summit and said her language on the issue had strengthened. She specifically referenced the unique situation for both Ireland and Northern Ireland, which I think was very positive. She strengthened her language in relation to the border. She said the UK would not accept a physical border on the island of Ireland - again very positive language. But Varadkar repeated his call for more detail on the border question. The Leave-supporting former cabinet member, Iain Duncan Smith, is also due to give an interview to the same programme in about 15 minutes - check back for updates on that. Referring to Labour’s electoral chances, Mandelson closes by saying the party is in a strong position. But he warns Jeremy Corbyn of the dangers of playing only to his base, saying he will win a significantly larger majority at the next general election if he appeals also to more “centrist” voters as well. Asked if he backs a second referendum, Mandelson says he’s “not going that far this morning” and backs parliamentary sign-off on the Brexit deal. That, he says, is because he wants to “listen to the public”. Mandelson suggests some facets of Brexit are only just coming to light now and talk of reversing course needs to wait. If, in time, the public takes a different view, then Labour should take a different view, he says. Mandelson rejects the suggestion that Labour’s position is no clearer, saying the party wants to remain in the single market and customs union during a transition period. That, he says, would secure economic continuity. But he acknowledges Labour wants to keep its options open beyond that to see what it could achieve from talks, should it be given the chance to hold them. Mandelson suggests the UK government’s threats to walk away without a deal -like Leave campaign’s claims that one would be easy to achieve - are “ridiculous”. He further suggests the EU27 don’t know who within the cabinet they are negotiating with because it is split between a hard and soft Brexit. The former Labour cabinet minister, Peter Mandelson, is giving an interview to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on the Brexit negotiations. He starts by saying no deal would be “disastrous for the county”. The European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said he was not expecting a “miracle” at today’s talks of the kind that would clear the way for an immediate start of trade talks. The EU27 leaders will consider the progress made in Brexit talks so far, Juncker said, adding: “I don’t think that there will be a miracle.” Responding to May’s speech, he said: “We have some details but we don’t have all the details we need. But work is going on.” The Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskaitė, said both sides needed to stop “positioning” in the media, and start properly negotiating. She said: It was not expected to have a success at this European council. We hope we will be able, and she will be able to have success in December. [We need] from words to real deeds. And probably we all – not only the UK, us also – it is time go for real negotiations and and not just negotiating in the the media by rhetoric. Usually, the first stage of a negotiation starts in the media. We try to position ourselves make nice rhetoric, to show up. Enter thoughts for internal politics, either in Britain or Europe It is time to go straight to the table. Asked if she agreed with Muscat that the speech was May’s best effort so far, she said: “If we talk about rhetorical abilities, maybe. But, in negotiations, you need concrete negotiation abilities. Not only rhetoric.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is having an unexpected bilateral with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, in the margins of the European council meeting in Brussels. Arriving at the summit, the Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, described Theresa May’s speech the previous evening as her “best performance yet”. However, he said her appeal hadn’t “changed anything”. I think it was quite a constructive speech that she delivered. She made her case in a very eloquent manner but I think it hasn’t really changed anything from before that. I think today’s assessment will be a fair assessment. It will be one where we show we want to be constructive about what we want next in Brexit. I don’t think it will contain the language that we have made sufficient progress. To be honest, I think it was her best performance yet in the sense that it conveyed a warm candid and sincere appeal that she wants progress to be made that she has moved her position. I think that was appreciated. Obviously, there are the problems that we all know. And I think the wording of today’s statement will show there is willingness on the EU side to move forward. The Austrian chancellor, Christian Kern, said: It is clear to see there is rhetorical progress but we need to come to conclusions because uncertainty is not good for the continent and economies. It is up the to the British government to propose something that is the basis for progress, that is important. The EU27, those member states remaining after Brexit, are expected to declare that insufficient progress has been made in negotiations for trade talks to begin. Several leaders have made clear they want more clarity about how much the UK is willing to pay in its Brexit divorce bill. But they are also expected to offer May a glimmer of hope by agreeing to start internal “scoping” work on their trade stance ahead of a possible green-light for the second phase of negotiations, dealing with trade and the transition to Brexit, at their next gathering on 14-15 December. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said the EU27 needed “more meat on the bone” of Britain’s exit payment, following May’s promise in a speech in Florence last month that the UK would honour financial commitments made as an EU member. The offer was believed to amount to around €20bn (£18bn), while Brussels is understood to be seeking about three times as much. Good morning and welcome to today’s politics live blog, which opens with Theresa May arriving for the final day of talks with fellow EU leaders after her speech at a working dinner last night. The prime minister did not speak to reporters as she walked into the building in Brussels but she was given a boost by her counterparts after pleading with them last night to “work together to get to an outcome we can stand behind and defend to our people”. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, gave an upbeat assessment of the Brexit talks, saying that she sees no reason why they should not succeed. I have no doubt that if we are all in clear minds ... We are going to achieve a good outcome. As far as I am concerned, I don’t hear any reason to believe that we are not going to be successful. Merkel said she was “highly motivated” to work on a new mandate for chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, which might permit trade talks to begin in December. But she warned the second stage of talks would be “more complicated than the first”. On the divorce issues dealt with in the first stage, there was “by and large general agreement” on the future status of the Irish border and “headway” was being made on expats’ rights after Brexit, Merkel said, though she added that May had made no specific new offer on Britain’s financial settlement. The Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, said May had delivered “her best performance yet” at Thursday evening’s dinner, but that her intervention had not “really changed anything”. He told Sky News: It conveyed a warm, candid and sincere appeal that she wants progress to be made, that she has moved in her position. I think it was appreciated. Muscat said problems remained in the Brexit process and that he did not expect the EU27 to clear the way for trade talks at this summit. But he said: “I think the wording in today’s conclusions will show that there is willingness on the EU side to move forward.” Here’s a brief – but by no means exhaustive – preview of the morning’s action at the European council summit in Brussels: May is expected to hold talks with the council’s president, Donald Tusk, before leaving early as the remaining 27 leaders discuss their assessment of progress on Brexit in her absence.

AM Britain’s manufacturers are encouraged by what they consider to be progress on Brexit talks after Theresa May’s trip to Brussels for the EU leaders summit. But more needs to be done, cautioned Terry Scuoler, chief executive of the manufacturers’ trade body, EEF: The warmer words emerging from the European Council following the approach adopted by the Prime Minister suggest there is a glimmer of light at the end of this tunnel. Business needs to see more than a hint of progress, however, because serious planning for transitional arrangements should be taking place now if companies are to firm up their business plans and pin down investment. Firms in the UK and across Europe are united in seeking clarity on a transition deal that maintains a level playing field in order to avoid confusion and potential economic damage. Time is moving and without greater political certainty businesses will form their own conclusions and plan accordingly. That is why work on agreeing a transition needs to start now and businesses will redouble their efforts to encourage leaders in the UK and the EU to do that. The pound has reversed earlier losses against the dollar after a hint of progress on Brexit talks from a meeting of European leaders in Brussels. Sterling is up 0.1% at $1.3170. The pound is also up 0.5% against the euro, at €1.1157. Investors are feeling slightly more positive about Brexit negotiations, as Theresa May and EU leaders appeared to edge forward at the summit. EU leaders, excluding the UK, agreed this morning that they will begin to prepare for talks about how a transition period and Britain’s long-term future outside the EU might work - something May has been pressing for. Follow our politics live blog for all the latest developments in Brussels: Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, shares the view that Hammond is unlikely to be handing out early Christmas gifts in next month’s budget. The deficit is heading in the right direction, helped by increasing revenues from income tax, national insurance and VAT, which underlines how reliant government finances are on UK consumers both earning money, and spending it. Despite the improving fiscal outlook, we can’t expect too many giveaways in the forthcoming budget. While the deficit is falling, the government still owes an eye-watering amount of money. What’s more, the imaginary pie of future tax revenues that the chancellor has to play with is expected to be trimmed back significantly, thanks to an adjustment to economic projections made by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Finally there’s also Brexit in the mix, and the unknown effect this will have on the UK economy, and government finances. All of this means the Chancellor’s spreadsheets will tell him he doesn’t have a great deal of room for manoeuvre on Budget day. Lower than expected government borrowing in September and the year to date suggests Philip Hammond is on track to meet his target of £58.3bn for the year ending March 2018. However, Paul Hollingsworth at Capital Economics says the chancellor is unlikely to have room for big giveaways when he delivers the budget on 22 November. It is too soon for the chancellor to begin loosening the purse strings in response. After all, the OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility] expected the deterioration in the public finances to be back-loaded this year, reflecting the unwinding of a number of temporary factors. Moreover, it looks set to revise down its assumptions about productivity and the economy’s potential to grow in its November forecasts, which is likely to significantly reduce the room the chancellor left himself against his fiscal targets. As a result, this is likely to constrain the chancellor’s ability to provide big giveaways in the very near term. The Treasury is keen to show it is not complacent about the deficit, despite the lowest September borrowing figure in a decade. A spokesman said: Whilst we’ve made great progress getting the deficit down by over two thirds, government borrowing is still far too high at over £150 million a day. We will continue to take a balanced approach that deals with our debts and allows us to invest in our public services. Some welcome news for the chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of his budget on 22 November. The government borrowed less than expected in September, at £5.9bn - the lowest for the month of September since 2007, before the financial crisis dealt a huge blow to the UK economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast £6.5bn. The Office for National Statistics also revised down borrowing for August to £4.7bn from a previous estimate of £5.7bn. It means that over the first six months of the fiscal year (April to September), the government borrowed £32.5bn, £2.5bn less than at the same point last year. That is also the lowest year-to-date borrowing since 2007. Will the Bank of England’s rate setters put their money where there mouth is and vote for a hike in borrowing costs? Last month, investors were convinced a rate hike to 0.5% from the current all-time low of 0.25% was a certainty, after the Monetary Policy Committee dropped heavy hints: Since then however, some weaker economic data and more cautious comments from some members of the MPC have dampened expectations. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex: Last night Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe cast further doubt on a November rate hike by arguing that the UK is “not seeing sustained signs of domestic inflation pressure”. He joins Dave Ramsden on the dovish end of the spectrum, with the newest deputy governor claiming he was not one of the MPC members who believes rates need to rise “in the coming months”. A rate rise would require the backing of at least five members of the nine-strong committee. Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders voted for a rise in September, so they would need the support of three others. With Cunliffe and Ramsden seemingly out, as well as new member Silvana Tenreyro, that would leave: Mark Carney, governor Ben Broadbent, deputy governor Andy Haldane, chief economist Gertjan Vlieghe, external MPC member All four have hinted they might be willing to vote for a rate rise in November. The FTSE 100 could be in for a new record closing high. It is currently about 14 points off last Thursday’s close of 7,556.24. Over in Spain, investors are so far shrugging off the political instability created by Madrid’s decision to impose direct rule in Catalonia. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, has this take on the markets this morning: Markets are in a decidedly risk-on mood on Friday. Ignoring the risks from escalating tensions in Catalonia, European indices have opened higher across the board. Even Spain’s IBEX is just in the green. The Trump trade has been reignited, so it seems. Tax reform is definitely back on - if it was ever off, thanks to the Senate approving of the Republican-backed budget Thursday night. This is a major step towards tax cuts as it allows the GOP to pass legislation without the need for any Democrat help. Investors are in an upbeat mood across Europe this morning, boosted by the news that the US senate voted through budget plans for the 2018 fiscal year. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,543 Germany’s DAX: +0.5% at 13,048 France’s CAC: +0.3% at 5,384 Italy’s FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 22,191 Spain’s IBEX: +0.1% at 10,206 Europe’s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 390 Japan’s Nikkei has risen for a 14th consecutive session, posting its longest winning streak in more than 50 years. A weaker yen helped to push up shares, with the dollar up 0.6% to 113.16 yen after the US Senate voted on Thursday to approve a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year. The Nikkei closed up just 0.04 percent, or 9 points, at 21,457.64, but it was enough to clinch its longest daily winning streak since 1961. Japan’s share index has risen by more than 5% over the past fortnight on hopes that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling coalition will win a general election on Sunday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is under pressure this morning as investors become increasingly uncertain that Bank of England policymakers will follow through on hints that UK interest rates will rise. It was down more than half a cent at $1.3085, after some of the latest UK data started to point to slowing growth as Brexit uncertainty starts to be reflected in the behaviour of households and businesses. Consumers are feeling much more cautious about spending, with retail sales falling 0.8% in September. Meanwhile real pay has been falling for six months as prices rise faster than wages. On Thursday the Bank’s deputy governor Jon Cunliffe said it was not clear that interest rates needed to rise soon, planting further doubt in the minds of investors about an imminent rate rise.

Marriage equality advocates have warned that such a stance would allow service providers to discriminate against couples on any basis. On Friday Guardian Australia asked the Coalition for Marriage if it supported the right of private service providers such as bakers, florists and photographers to reject weddings on the basis of religious beliefs. Questions gave numerous examples, including the marriage of couples of: mixed faith, mixed race, who had engaged in sex before marriage, used contraception or been divorced. A Coalition for Marriage spokeswoman, Monica Doumit, responded that the group “believes that no one should be coerced to use their creative talents to endorse a message with which they disagree”. She said: “For example, we support the right of the many advertising agencies and meeting venues who have denied us service during this campaign to do so.” The Equality Campaign executive director, Tiernan Brady, said the comments showed the no campaign was engaged in “a blatant attempt to unravel existing anti-discrimination laws which serve everyone in Australia well, not just LGBTI people”. “It would appear the no side are suggesting anybody in Australia can refuse service for anyone else on any grounds they wish,” he said. “The Australian people won’t stand for that – they don’t want to go back in time in such a fashion.” Brady said allowing discrimination on the basis of any private belief was “the ultimate slippery slope”. The Australian Christian Lobby has called for private service providers to be able to refuse gay weddings but Doumit’s comments are the broadest expression so far in the postal survey campaign of how far a religious exemption to discrimination law could extend. On Tuesday Labor endorsed the cross-party bill produced by the Liberal senator Dean Smith after a Senate committee inquiry, in effect ruling out any further religious freedoms beyond the ability of religious ministers, celebrants and organisations to refuse to conduct weddings. The debate about exemptions to anti-discrimination law comes before a sitting week that will be the last before parliament resumes on 13 November and the result of the marriage law postal survey is announced on 15 November. There are some concerns in the government that the week could provide an opportunity for a boilover on marriage, as conservatives are working on their own marriage bill and John Howard has warned there will not be enough time to protect religious freedom after the result. But Liberal sources have played down the possibility, with supporters of same-sex marriage noting that senators are busy with estimates hearings and are not all present in the party room, and one conservative suggesting that a bill would not be released until after the result for fear of appearing defeatist. The national director of Liberals and Nationals for Yes, Andrew Bragg, said if a yes vote was recorded in the survey a private member’s bill would go ahead, as Malcolm Turnbull has said. He said a bill would be guided by three principles: “Firstly, existing discrimination in the Marriage Act should be eliminated; secondly, a strong protection for religious freedom should be provided; and thirdly, we should not reintroduce commercial discrimination in Australia.” “It would be self-defeating to repeal discrimination and replace it with discrimination,” Bragg said. A Liberal supporter of same-sex marriage told Guardian Australia: “At a time when the public regard for politicians is at an all-time low, the Australian community will not tolerate some politicians playing politics with a yes vote on marriage. “It will be a brave conservative Liberal politician who seeks to delay or use parliamentary tricks to undermine a yes vote. “If there is a yes vote, Australians will expect the parliament to act expeditiously on giving effect to same-sex marriage and providing sensible and fair protections about religious views in regards to marriage.” At the National Press Club in September the ACL executive director, Lyle Shelton, was asked how exemptions to discrimination law could be drafted so that they did not result in “extreme” cases of religious people discriminating against inter-race couples. Shelton dismissed the question as a “hypothetical” because “I don’t think anyone is suggesting that there should be racial discrimination – I certainly wouldn’t be”. He suggested laws to allow lawful refusal of gay weddings could be limited to “allowing people to continue to believe the same thing about marriage”. He warned that if such an exemption to discrimination law were not granted, people would not be able to “live out publicly” their religious beliefs in the way they conducted their business. In September 2016 the then Liberal senator Cory Bernardi said businesses should be allowed to discriminate against patrons “for any or no reason”, including but not limited to the right to refuse gay weddings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/commentisfree/2017/oct/22/high-court-proves-we-have-free-speech-against-environmental-wreckers","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T21:00:33Z","webTitle":"High court proves we have free speech against environmental wreckers | Bob Brown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2017/oct/22/high-court-proves-we-have-free-speech-against-environmental-wreckers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/commentisfree/2017/oct/22/high-court-proves-we-have-free-speech-against-environmental-wreckers","fields":{"headline":"High court proves we have free speech against environmental wreckers","bodyText":"The high court has drawn a line in the sand against laws which burden the right of Australians to peaceful protest. The court made no judgement on Tasmanian premier Will Hodgman’s decision to flatten the Lapoinya state forest in northwest Tasmania against the wishes of the local community. But it struck down his Workplaces (Protection from Protesters) Act 2014 aimed at stopping people from protesting effectively against such forests being logged. Lapoinya is a huddle of farms southwest of the Bass Strait city of Burnie. Its rolling hills have a patchwork of lush pastures, ploughed fields and copses of trees. At the heart of the district was the Lapoinya forest, a couple of hundred hectares of wildlife-filled rainforest, eucalypts and ferneries with the crystal-clear Maynes Creek, a key nursery for the world’s largest freshwater crayfish, running through it. When Forestry Tasmania revealed plans for the forest to be clearfelled for the distant wood-processing factory owned by Malaysian logging company Ta Ann, the people of Lapoinya remained confident that common sense would prevail. They called on the state government to intervene and ran a colourful but respectful public campaign to prevent the logging. Neither the premier nor his minister for forests visited or intervened. Instead, draconian anti-protest laws were enacted and by early 2016 the logging was imminent. I was invited to a dinner by the community and afterwards treated to a concert by talented local youngsters, with songs devoted to forests. The Lapoinyan dilemma was excruciating: these good people would never be violent or attack logging machinery, but would not be silenced as a distant and indifferent administration in Hobart destroyed their iconic forest. The locals prepared for a peaceful stand. If the public could see how beautiful the Lapoinya forest was then surely, even at this eleventh hour, the resulting political pressure would cause the government to back off. The bulldozers and chainsaws arrived in January 2016, with a cavalcade of police. While premier Hodgman assured Tasmanians his new laws were aimed at “radical” environmentalists and not “mums and dads”, the first two people arrested were a grandfather and a mother of two. That mother, also a neurosurgery nurse, was Jessica Hoyt. Her parents, Stewart and Barbara, have a farm adjoining the forest. In her teenage years Jessica, along with her siblings, had enjoyed riding along the forest’s bridle trail. The two were charged and faced first-offence fines of $10,000. The next day, reeling from the destruction, Jessica took friends back into the doomed forest. She was arrested again while walking through the trees and ferns. This second arrest put her in danger of being jailed for four years. A few days later, along with several others, I was also arrested after going back to Lapoinya to make video clips, intended for public distribution, about the sheer bloody-mindedness of the government’s operation. I was standing in an adjacent forest reserve. A bulldozer had backed off and the screech of the chainsaws and roaring thud of the trees coming down was close and confronting. The incongruity of laws stifling such a reasonable protest against the destruction of the public commons, in a democracy with a long history of advancement through peaceful protest, was compelling. This was underscored when, after our arrests, I received a number of messages from experienced legal experts from around Australia suggesting the laws breached the constitution’s implied right to freedom of political expression. Guided by Hobart solicitor Roland Browne and joined as co-plaintiff by Jessica, I engaged Melbourne barrister Ron Merkel QC to challenge the constitutional validity of the Hodgman laws in the high court. A public appeal by my foundation raised more than $100,000 to affray the costs, especially in case we lost. On Wednesday the high court ruled that those laws do infringe the freedom to peaceful protest inherent in the Australian constitution. “It is necessary to keep firmly in mind that the implied freedom is essential to the maintenance of the system of representative and responsible government for which the Constitution provides. The implied freedom protects the free expression of political opinion, including peaceful protest, which is indispensable to the exercise of political sovereignty,” they said. by the people of the commonwealth. It operates as a limit on the exercise of legislative power to impede that freedom of expression.” The Hodgman government had breached the limit of legislative power. Tasmania already had the usual array of laws to prevent dangerous or damaging behaviour. It also had a Forest Management Act which, besides guaranteeing the public its time-honoured access to the forests, empowers the police to arrest people who interfere with logging operations. The draconian new laws were not necessary for that purpose. They were designed to stymie effective environmental protests, like that at Lapoinya, which could draw public support and be politically embarrassing. The high court found the laws out, noting the deterrent effect on peaceful protest of their provisions: “The combined effect ... can bring the protest of an entire group of persons to a halt and its effect will extend over time. Protesters will be deterred from returning to areas around forest operations for days and even months. During this time the operations about which they seek to protest will continue but their voices will not be heard.” It is for premier Hodgman, a lawyer, to say; but just as he did not see the unconstitutionality of these laws, so I doubt he was their origin. It should be a warning to the other environmental wreckers. We are in a world of gross, rapid and escalating environmental damage. Corporations profiting from exploiting non-renewable resources face growing public scrutiny and antipathy. They cannot win the argument for wrecking ecosystems, so their alternative is to wreck environmentalists. Elsewhere in the world, scores of environmentalists are being killed each year by rampaging profiteers. But Australia is a peaceful democracy and the effective option is to lobby weak governments to clamp down on protests. The high court’s decision does not directly affect laws in states or territories other than Tasmania. But it draws that line in the sand and will be a benchmark for more challenges if other governments pass laws to protect environmental destruction from peaceful public reaction. More widely, it bolsters that right for people standing up for any good cause. There are growing calls for governments, already falling over themselves to grant concessions to the coral-killing Adani coalmine proposal in Queensland, to enact more draconian anti-protest laws than those already in place. The extreme right voices making those calls had better go read this judgment for democracy. The Lapoinya forest was razed, but it has proved to be a pyrrhic victory for the destroyers. Out of the peaceful but heartfelt stand of the handful of people in Lapoinya has come a high court ruling upholding the right to peaceful protest for every Australian."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/20/labour-party-chair-received-165000-from-union-watchdog-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T12:07:58Z","webTitle":"Labour party chair received £165,000 from union, watchdog finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/20/labour-party-chair-received-165000-from-union-watchdog-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/20/labour-party-chair-received-165000-from-union-watchdog-finds","fields":{"headline":"Labour party chair received £165,000 from union, watchdog finds","bodyText":"The chair of the Labour party received just over £165,000 from a trade union he ran that had only 10 members, an official report says. Ian Lavery, Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign chief and close ally, ran the National Union of Mineworkers (Northumberland area) until he entered parliament in 2010. The official union watchdog launched an investigation into payments to Lavery after media inquiries. Its report shows Lavery received a loan of £72,500, which was later written off, from a union fund to purchase a property; with his wife kept £18,000 from an endowment policy taken out on the property; and received a series of termination payments from the union worth nearly £90,000. He later paid back £15,000, which means he received a total of £165,387, the report from the Certification Office for Trade Unions and Employers Associations says. The certification officer, Gerard Walker, has concluded that no further action is to be taken. Asked to respond to the report, Lavery said: “Under my stewardship, the union always complied with the rules and the certification officer signed off every year’s transactions. As the certification officer’s report makes clear, no member of the union, past or present, has made a complaint about the financial affairs of the union. I am pleased that the certification officer has decided to not appoint an inspector or take further action. “This report should draw a line under almost two years of allegations and innuendo directed at me and my former colleagues.” Lavery succeeded Arthur Scargill as president of the NUM in 2002 and was general secretary of the Northumberland branch for 18 years before he became MP for Wansbeck in 2010. Lavery was president of the union when in 2008 it won a high court battle for compensation for miners who lost their jobs after the closure of Northumberland’s last deep mine. The court awarded 350 former staff at Ellington colliery each about £6,000. The certification officer launched an inquiry into Lavery after inquiries from the Sunday Times followed by the BBC. The regulator found that the Northumberland provident and benevolent fund loaned Lavery £72,500 to buy a house in 1994. Thirteen years on, the union Lavery was then running wrote off the loan. Lavery paid into an endowment fund to pay back the capital cost of the house. It under-performed but still paid out £18,000. The regulator found Lavery kept the money. The report also says Lavery received a number of termination payments from the union totalling £89,887.83. The report says neither Lavery nor the union could provide documentary evidence of the process or the decision by which Lavery was made redundant as he left his full-time job to take another as an MP. “The allegations further stated that the union’s then general secretary Mr Ian Lavery ceased to be general secretary when he was elected as the MP for Wansbeck on 7 May 2010 and questioned in what way this was redundancy and, if not a redundancy, asked on what basis the payments were made,” the report says. “The union and Mr Lavery stated that the post of general secretary and therefore Mr Lavery were made redundant in May 2010. Both the union and Mr Lavery were given the opportunity to provide documentary evidence to show a process or decision by which Mr Lavery was made redundant. Neither was able to do so and stated that no such documentary evidence existed. “In light of the absence of documentary evidence to support the union and Mr Lavery’s assertions that Mr Lavery was in fact made redundant, I do not consider that the appointment of an inspector would help to resolve the key issue as to whether Mr Lavery was made redundant within the terms of his contract of employment.” It was accepted that the union overpaid Lavery £30,600 in redundancy money, according to the report. Lavery disputed £10,600 of it, and he volunteered to repay £15,000, the report says. Labour’s Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, told BBC’s Newsnight: “Unions are regulated by the certification officer. Now, your own report says the certification officer has said that there is no reason to make any further investigation, and that no complaint from a member has been made. The industry regulator has said that there is not a case to pursue. “I know Ian Lavery as a really good man, and as a friend.” Asked whether Labour should investigate the matter, Gardiner said: “The Labour party will obviously want to satisfy itself that no member – we always satisfy ourselves that no member of the Labour party brings the party into disrepute.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/20/alfie-mawson-charlie-daniels-juan-mata-charity-common-goal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T12:15:07Z","webTitle":"Mawson and Daniels become first British players to join Mata’s charity project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/20/alfie-mawson-charlie-daniels-juan-mata-charity-common-goal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/20/alfie-mawson-charlie-daniels-juan-mata-charity-common-goal","fields":{"headline":"Mawson and Daniels become first British players to join Mata’s charity project","bodyText":"Alfie Mawson and Charlie Daniels have become the first British footballers to sign up to Juan Mata’s Common Goal project under which participants donate a percentage of their salary to charity.

In his office at the Department for Transport in Westminster, he comes across as affable and open – and talks the talk when it comes to bikes for transport. Having learned a “raft of things” in meetings with campaigners since the controversy, Norman says a key question is “how can we make the transition to a world where a 12-year-old can cycle safely?” “I like the 12-year-old test,” he says. “I think Chris Boardman is absolutely right to talk about that.” His solution? “I think if we’re doing our job properly, there’s a whole raft of things, and infrastructure is absolutely part of it. The lesson of many, many cases is better cycling infrastructure – better road infrastructure – helps to bring in new users but it’s not by any means the only part of the picture.” However, he sees this as primarily the preserve of local authorities and the likes of charities like Sustrans, not national government, which becomes problematic when local authorities fail to act out of a fear of backlash, or a lack of interest. He also believes in cycle training. “Bikeability is really important, actually teaching kids how to use a cycle safely and effectively on the road, teaching them good manners and good practice as well as signalling. I’m amazed by the number of cyclists who don’t signal effectively on the roads now – it’s staggering.” The controversy came after Norman wrote to cycling organisations stressing the need for riders to follow the Highway Code after the cyclist Charlie Alliston was jailed for killing Kim Briggs, having hit her while on a bike without a front brake. Critics noted ministers had never done the same with driving groups, despite a vastly greater toll among pedestrians from motor vehicles. Norman expresses surprise at the reaction of some campaigners to his letter, arguing people have not fully understood the scope of the two-part cycling safety review also announced. This pledges to look at both the laws over dangerous cycling, and more widely into cycle safety. “They had just looked at the first part and thought, ‘Ah, this is a kneejerk reaction to the Kim Briggs situation’, rather than thinking, actually we understand there is a legal issue we need to get sorted,” he says. Norman is keen to look at the evidence before making any commitments about the review, repeatedly refusing to be drawn on issues from autonomous vehicle growth and car sharing, to future cycling growth. He also fails to rule out mandatory helmet or hi-vis rules for cyclists, should they come up in the review, but stresses this will be entirely guided by evidence. “Obviously there will be some people who feel very strongly that there should be hi-vis, and there will be plenty of people who think very strongly the other way. It’ll be the same with helmets. The literature on risk is quite a well-developed one, I don’t need to tell you.” Despite the letter, Norman says he doesn’t necessarily believe cyclists break the law any more than other road users, and notes the role of infrastructure in this – at junctions without advanced stop zones for cyclists, he says, there is arguably an incentive for riders to consider jumping the lights to keep ahead of the traffic. In terms of his own cycling, like fellow Tory cyclist Boris Johnson, Norman says he isn’t afraid of cycling anywhere in London – he admits to almost enjoying Hyde Park Corner – and is happy sharing the road with motor traffic. “I don’t know if there’s evidence about [people being] too scared to cycle,” he says. “I’m a terribly bad example, because I’ve been doing it all my life.” It’s about how to get inexperienced younger or older people on bikes and ebikes, not people like him, he adds. Norman says cycling and walking are “at the heart of” Conservatism. “My view is that cycling and walking are really important and I think we, as a government, should be supporting it. And we are supporting it a lot.” He talks about cycling policy in terms of social justice, noting how cycling in the UK is disproportionately done by men, and that those on lower incomes can be put off by having nowhere to store a bike. “I don’t think a mode of transport which has a skew in any particular way is meeting the needs of society as a whole,” he says. In terms of policy, most important, he feels, is taking the cycling and walking investment strategy to the “next level”. The CWIS puts a legal obligation on government to invest in cycling and walking provision in England. While Norman believes the job of government is to be neutral between road users, he wouldn’t rule out intervening to push local authorities to disincentivise driving. This is where the CWIS will come into play. He said: “The really interesting question is going to come when we start the process of just nudging local authorities and these other businesses, to ask them: ‘Have you, as the law requires, built in cycling and walking into your infrastructure?’ That’s really important.” Many argue national design standards would help local authorities build better cycle infrastructure. He seems to agree. “If you look at international precedents, the evidence is pretty clear that that can make a huge difference. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see a lot of that put in the cycling consultation and we may want to take it on that, I’m not going to prejudge, but I think it’s a very interesting idea.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/20/the-eu-summit-brexit-and-theresa-may-who-said-what-quiz","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T12:27:15Z","webTitle":"The EU summit, Brexit, and Theresa May: who said what? - quiz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/20/the-eu-summit-brexit-and-theresa-may-who-said-what-quiz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/20/the-eu-summit-brexit-and-theresa-may-who-said-what-quiz","fields":{"headline":"The EU summit, Brexit, and Theresa May: who said what? - quiz","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/20/uk-mobile-customers-stung-bysharp-practices-says-consumer-group","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T08:27:36Z","webTitle":"UK mobile phone firms overcharging customers after contracts expire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/20/uk-mobile-customers-stung-bysharp-practices-says-consumer-group","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/20/uk-mobile-customers-stung-bysharp-practices-says-consumer-group","fields":{"headline":"UK mobile phone firms overcharging customers after contracts expire","bodyText":"Three of Britain’s biggest mobile phone networks keep charging customers extra for their handsets after they have been paid off, leaving them up to £38 a month worse off, a consumer group has said. Citizens Advice found that Vodafone, EE and Three were overcharging customers who failed to change their contract an average of £22 a month, rising to £38 a month for buyers of premium phones including the Samsung Galaxy S8, Apple iPhone and Sony Xperia XZ Premium. Raising concerns that older customers were being stung by “sharp practices”, it called for intervention from the regulator Ofcom if mobile networks failed to be clear about how contracts are structured and cut bills once phones are paid off. “Mobile phones are now an essential part of modern life, but the way that the cost of handsets are hidden within some contracts gives phone providers a way to exploit their customers,” said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice. Many contracts are paid monthly over two years and cover the cost of the customer’s phones, which can be hundreds of pounds to buy outright. At the end of the contract, the customer owns the handset and is free to stay on the contract or switch. However, Citizens Advice research found that Vodafone, EE and Three continued charging customers the same amount as when they were paying for the handset. In the worst case, customers with a 256GB iPhone could end up being overcharged by £46 a month on average, it said. Over-65s were the most likely to be caught out, with 23% on a handset-inclusive deal remaining on it for more than 12 months past the end of the fixed contract, compared with 13% of under-65s. Overall, 36% of people with a handset-inclusive mobile phone contract stayed on it beyond the fixed period, with 19% staying in the same contract for more than six months afterwards. Citizens Advice called on all providers to reduce their customers’ bills when they stay in the same contract past the end of a fixed deal to reflect the expired cost of the handset. Guy added: “It is clearly unfair that some phone providers are charging loyal customers for handsets that they have already paid for. It’s especially concerning that older customers are more likely to be stung by this sharp practice.” A Three spokeswoman said contract end-dates were made clear to new customers, who were encouraged to get in touch if they wanted to change their plan. A Vodafone spokeswoman said workers contacted customers near the ends of their contracts “wherever possible”. EE said separating phone and tariff sometimes left customers worse off, adding that most choose upgrades or a SIM-only plan when their contracts expire. Nina Bibby, chief marketing officer of O2, accused rivals of undermining trust and reputation in the mobile phone industry, and said the provider separated device and service charges in monthly bills: “We’d like to see the other operators review their position and follow our lead.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"membership/2017/oct/26/together-we-are-safeguarding-the-guardians-independent-journalism","type":"article","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T08:30:00Z","webTitle":"Together, we are safeguarding the Guardian's independent journalism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2017/oct/26/together-we-are-safeguarding-the-guardians-independent-journalism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/2017/oct/26/together-we-are-safeguarding-the-guardians-independent-journalism","fields":{"headline":"Together, we are safeguarding the Guardian's independent journalism","bodyText":"The most important relationship the Guardian has is with its readers. Which is why, when faced with serious questions about how we might fund our journalism in this new digital era, we asked you to be part of the answer. Today, I’m pleased to update you on our ongoing joint efforts to safeguard the future of the Guardian’s independent journalism. The Guardian is now funded by more than 800,000 supporters from more than 140 countries. Half a million readers are subscribers or members, or give to us on a monthly basis, while over the past 12 months we’ve received another 300,000 individual contributions from readers all over the world. We are also seeing strong sales of our print Guardian and Observer newspapers. We are encouraged and cheered by the hundreds of thousands of you who are supporting our journalism. In the last year alone, the number of readers who support us regularly has more than doubled; and we now receive more income from our readers than we do from advertisers. This is a significant step. We will continue to rely and build on this in the year ahead, as we aim with your help to reach many thousands more supporters, and sustain that support in the long term so we can keep investing in quality investigative journalism. The Guardian’s unique ownership structure safeguards our editorial independence from commercial or political interference and means we can reinvest any money we receive into this journalism that matters so much. We haven’t put up a paywall. Instead, we want to remain a strong, progressive force that is open for all. So we need many more of our readers to fund the Guardian: join them and support independent, quality journalism. When you stand with us you empower our journalists and inform the way we approach stories and subjects. Your participation helps us produce the work we are most proud of – here are some examples from the past few months. We have uncovered the risks and responsibilities that social media bring to our societies in our investigative series the Facebook Files, and published a number of stories about the worrying relationships between big data, billionaires and whether our democratic processes are being gamed by algorithms. Most recently, we reported on the concerned technology workers now disconnecting themselves from the internet. The Guardian has continued to invest in our coverage of the US presidency. Nearly one year on from his election, Donald Trump disregards the constitution, offends allies, and attacks minorities, the powerless, and those who are holding him to account. In the year that Trump withdrew the US from the UN’s Paris climate change deal, your contributions also helped us to bolster our environmental reporting: we significantly increased the size of our reporting team, and undertook a reporting project funded by readers, This Land is Your Land. Through our global defenders project, we are tracking the deaths of everyone who dies defending the environment over the next year, and we have broken many exclusive stories in this area. Our in-depth reporting of the world of sport continues to make a significant impact, with our revelations on racism allegations in the England women’s football team and an exclusive report from Ethiopia revealing how athletes were being treated “like slaves” by wealthy nations, while the issue of doping in British cycling was brought to light through our investigation. Throughout the year, our specialist Brexit team have worked closely with our world-class correspondents in parliament and across Europe, and our readers across the continent too, sharing the personal and the policy implications of this historic move. In Australia, we continue to publish the very best journalism that we can, despite a stunning lack of support from the Australian government at this difficult time for media organisations. We have maintained our focus on the subjects underreported elsewhere: in Beyond the Blade, we tell the stories of every person under 20 killed by a knife in Britain, challenging the stereotyped view of this crime; our New Arrivals refugee series has revealed the reality of journeying from Syria to Europe; and we continue to report shocking and important stories from offshore detention centres in Australia. Together we are doing crucial work. But advertising revenues continue to decline, with technology giants such as Facebook and Google dominating the digital ad space, and print advertising falling for most publications too. Now more than ever, the world needs progressive journalism, committed to facts and helping readers make sense of the world. Thank you for supporting the Guardian’s progress. If you read the Guardian, help us deliver independent reporting by supporting our journalism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/20/british-cycling-julie-harrington-jess-catalyst-change","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T13:55:58Z","webTitle":"British Cycling’s Julie Harrington: ‘Jess speaking out has been the catalyst for change’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/20/british-cycling-julie-harrington-jess-catalyst-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/20/british-cycling-julie-harrington-jess-catalyst-change","fields":{"headline":"British Cycling’s Julie Harrington: ‘Jess speaking out has been the catalyst for change’","bodyText":"Julie Harrington is watching youngsters hurtle round the BMX track inside the National Cycling Centre on the outskirts of Manchester. She has walked up the biggest ramp before, several years ago when she came here on a coaching development day while working for the Football Association. “I was encouraging people to look outside the game for best practice,” she says. “I invited the likes of Sir Dave Brailsford to St George’s Park to talk about how football might do things differently, ironically.” It was at a time when British Cycling was held up as the gold standard in sports coaching and governance. By the time Harrington joined the organisation as chief executive in May its reputation was in tatters. A draft version of an independent report found a “culture of fear” existed within the world-class performance programme, noting “dysfunctional leadership” and the “inept” handling of sexism allegations made by the sprint cyclist Jess Varnish. In her first interview since taking on the role, Harrington reveals she was confronted with a governing body where morale was low, cohesion between departments poor and record‑keeping left much to be desired. But she also sets out her stall for the future, claiming she wants to transform the sometimes murky reputation of cycling as well as continuing to win medals. “Before I joined it was right at the height of the publicity around the Jiffy bag,” says Harrington. “I met up with Chris Hoy because before I jumped in with two feet I wanted someone like him to tell me about the risk of going into a new organisation and to be given confidence. He said: ‘I was at the velodrome every day for a decade and I have never seen anything untoward.’ “Of course there was an independent review to find out about culture but part of my due diligence was to talk to people. What it told me is that it wasn’t institutional failings at British Cycling, it was a hell of a lot of people doing good stuff, just crying out for leadership and change.” The Guardian revealed on Friday that British Cycling has accepted the resignation of Richard Freeman, the doctor at the centre of the Jiffy bag mystery, who was too unwell to face disciplinary action over his failure to keep satisfactory medical records. Harrington accepted riders had been failed by the woeful record-keeping of the previous regime. “A dozen years ago this organisation had turnover of a couple of hundred thousand pounds,” she says. “To go from that over a few Olympic cycles to tens of millions it needed energy, enthusiasm and charismatic personalities. What it hadn’t had was somebody joining dots and it needed some basic good practice. “There were serious duty of care failings. As a national governing body we have a duty of care to our athletes obviously to look after them but also to riders that if there’s a suspicion of doping to be able to show the record-keeping. That’s not about watching our own back, it’s about great practice and never having a question mark over these athletes. We have a duty of care for their health and medical wellbeing but their reputation as well.” Harrington, who used to be the group operations director at the FA, has watched from afar this week as some of her former colleagues have been heavily criticised for the way they handled complaints of discrimination made by the England international Eni Aluko. The similarities between Aluko’s treatment and that of Varnish at British Cycling are unavoidable. Harrington met Varnish, who is considering legal action against the governing body and UK Sport, this month, together with the new performance director, Stephen Park. An initial draft version of an independent review into the culture of British Cycling stated Varnish had been dropped as an “act of retribution”. There were also suggestions that findings of an internal report were covered up by the British Cycling board. “I do see parallels between Varnish and Aluko,” says Harrington. “I wasn’t here at the time of Varnish but an investigation should be approached in a way that is about doing the right thing rather than approaching it from a paradigm of how do we make this go away. “Certainly Jess having the courage to speak out has been the catalyst for change. I really enjoyed meeting her and what I don’t want is someone who has represented our country – but also who I’d credit with being a catalyst for this change – having a bad taste in her mouth. Stephen Park is on record saying if she makes the required times she’s more than welcome back into the team. Clearly it wouldn’t be easy but we would smooth that journey.” One of Harrington’s first undertakings was a culture review where staff were asked about their satisfaction at work and she admits the results were not good. “As the organisation had grown it became very siloed, with the world-class programme operating separately from the recreation and education programme,” she says. “That breeds discontent between staff because there was no commonality. What I’ve found is a huge appetite for leadership, they want someone to bring the organisation together so I feel very welcomed.” Harrington’s first five months in the job has included the appointment of a head of medical services and a medical steering group. “I want our employees to sit around their respective dinner tables in the evening proud of where they work and not have anything hanging over them,” she says. “I want to make sure we’re not just fit for purpose but that we’re setting a benchmark for what medical governance should look like.” Next week Sessions will begin to develop an understanding in the ranks of what constitutes discrimination and unconscious bias. As Harrington puts it, she wants people to have the “confidence to have conversations about things like race and discrimination without feeling like they’re treading on eggshells”. But with power comes responsibility and the odd sleepless night, admits Harrington. “I don’t think anyone is going to thank us for improving the culture and losing. I don’t want to be the chief exec who was brought in to improve things but we have a medal crash. “I strongly believe you can have a great culture and still focus on really high performance. People confuse culture with a love-in. It’s actually about people having the confidence to challenge each other. You can do that and still win.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/20/rugby-league-england-affiliated-states-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T13:58:21Z","webTitle":"England run in 13 tries to rout Affiliated States in World Cup warm-up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/20/rugby-league-england-affiliated-states-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/20/rugby-league-england-affiliated-states-match-report","fields":{"headline":"England run in 13 tries to rout Affiliated States in World Cup warm-up","bodyText":"In the end, this was about as encouraging a warm-up as England could have expected for next Friday’s World Cup opener against Australia. A big win was always going to be somewhat inevitable against a team of second-tier players from the Affiliated States but Wayne Bennett will have learned plenty from the first outing of this tour. For the head coach, there will now be a week of extensive deliberation about the make-up of the 17 best equipped to beat Australia for the first time since 2006. Barring Jonny Lomax, every player in his squad was given at least 40 minutes to stake a claim to face the world champions in Melbourne. Most of them caught the eye. In the searing Perth heat, victory was never in doubt by the time England had established a 22-0 lead by the end of the first quarter, but it was a moment midway through the second half that perhaps best underlined the gulf in class between these two sides. Four Affiliated States players tried to halt a rampaging Alex Walmsley; he left most of them sprawled on the floor, with Bradley Gibson being held upright while he staggered from the field as his evening ended prematurely. “It’s been a great week and great preparation moving forward for us,” said Sam Burgess. So what selection dilemmas are there for Bennett to ponder? Perhaps more than he bargained for. Burgess was widely expected to start in England’s front row but an all-action 40-minute display in the back row , where he began his career a decade ago, could now see him switched. Luke Gale and Gareth Widdop – who had a hand in all six tries that put England 34-6 ahead at half-time before being withdrawn – look assured of starting berths in the halves. James Roby may yet force his way into Bennett’s thinking too after a fine return to the international fold in the second half. In a sign of what would follow for most of the night, Gale put England ahead after 32 seconds, before Elliott Whitehead – another standout performer in the pack – doubled their lead. Two tries for Ryan Hall, one for Jermaine McGillvary and the pick of the touchdowns from Gale put England well ahead by half-time. To their credit, the Affiliated States battled throughout but all they had to show for a bruising night’s work were two long-range efforts, one in each half. England did not let up after half-time – with seven more tries from a much-changed side. Roby, arguably the pick of the bunch in the second half, scored one, while Burgess’s brother, Thomas, claimed two in one of several impressive cameos."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/20/george-w-bush-donald-trump-speech-blood-hands","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T14:21:03Z","webTitle":"The blood on George W Bush's hands will never dry.

Don't glorify this man","bodyText":"For liberals across the spectrum, the temptation is real to lionize George W Bush now. Donald Trump is our child-king, slobbering over the country and embarrassing us all. He is parody made real, a lackey for rightwing billionaires everywhere. It’s not hard to find a talking head on the left who will say he is, without question, the worst president America has ever had. But don’t make that easy mistake. Especially not now as Bush, our 43rd president, rears his head from retirement to denounce his bombastic successor. At a speech in New York on Thursday, Bush set Democratic heartstrings aflutter when he declared that “we’ve seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty”. “Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone and provides permission for cruelty and bigotry,” he added. “The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them.” Bush delivered these words without mentioning Trump by name. The last Republican before Trump to serve as president, Bush lamented that America has seen “nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America”. “We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade, forgetting that conflict, instability and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism. We’ve seen the return of isolationist sentiments, forgetting that American security is directly threatened by the chaos and despair of distant places.” Devoid of context, Bush has a point. Trump is a bully who permits prejudice and cruelty. He doesn’t have much regard for internationalism. His impulses are isolationist in nature. What is ironic here is that Bush will undoubtedly be elevated to the status of a pious, gray-haired warrior speaking out in defense of the republic he once led, a talisman of decency for DC amnesiacs. He will be cheered as another brave Republican defying a president of his own party, his past rendered meaningless. There is a certain strain of conventional political wisdom exploited by the likes of Bush. It prizes optics over action, appearances over reality. Bush was a soft-spoken president, a nice enough seeming man, and typically politically correct. Well-coiffed and gimlet-eyed, he resembled a screenwriter’s conception of an American president. And he caused far more harm to the country and planet than Trump has so far, and maybe ever will. It was under Bush that America invaded Iraq, murdered hundreds of thousands of civilians, and destabilized the Middle East so thoroughly that it may take the entire 21st century to recover. More than 4,000 American soldiers died. He stocked his cabinet with warmongering neoconservatives far more cunning and apocalyptic in outlook than any of the amateurs who populate Trump’s gang. These were men who dreamed of civilization-annihilating wars and found a president willing to transform their dreams into crackling reality. The blood on Bush’s hands will never dry. Under the guise of spreading democracy, his administration brought suffering to the world and strangled civil liberties at home. The Patriot Act ushered in a dystopian national security state that was maintained by Obama and bequeathed to Trump. Bush’s economic policies, along with failures by Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, fed the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression. Trump may be more bumbling and unseemly than Bush, but if he avoids waging war on such a horrific scale, he will have averted true catastrophe. Like John McCain, who never met a foreign conflict he didn’t want American troops to die in, Bush is one of those statesmen who has acquired a new shine in the age of Trump, welcoming to pundits in the context of such disorder. Because of Trump’s chaos, there is a fetish these days for military men. Democrats hope the generals can stage a coup, restore order, and some stern-faced strongman with good table manners and an affinity for land wars can occupy the Oval Office. He will take chummy phone calls from Paul Wolfowitz, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. He will dream anew of “nation-building”. This is the world that gave rise to Bush’s presidency and nurtured his most heinous sins. Perhaps, in the months to come, Bush will emerge as a stiff-lipped anti-Trumper and CNN will cheer. That would be a good career move for him. Anything to make people forget a presidency that truly ruined the country and world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/20/meditation-on-a-lack-of-conservative-morality","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T17:34:43Z","webTitle":"Meditation on a lack of Conservative morality | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/20/meditation-on-a-lack-of-conservative-morality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/20/meditation-on-a-lack-of-conservative-morality","fields":{"headline":"Meditation on a lack of Conservative morality","bodyText":"The continuing enthusiasm for mindfulness in government and business should be welcomed. As someone who has practised a form of Buddhist meditation for nearly 30 years, I know how hard it is to still the mind and to begin to see things as they really are. It is a paradox of meditation practice that it is training the mind not to think about things that leads to understanding and clarity of mind, and not, as the Conservative MP Tim Loughton seems to believe, wallowing in the bath thinking (Report, 19 October). But for the sports minister, Tracey Crouch, to say that mindfulness is crucial to her department is to totally ignore the other important facet of Buddhism – sila, or morality. Buddhism values the qualities of generosity, kindness, compassion, unconditional goodwill to all beings. I see no evidence at all that the current Tory leadership of this country practises any of these. It’s distasteful to me that business people or politicians are taking on such a superficial understanding of mindfulness that they will spend half an hour in their lunch break doing a mindfulness practice and then go back to their work of shafting the poor and vulnerable in our society in the afternoon.

That is what we need to wake up to’","bodyText":"The police in Cambridge, Massachusetts, showed no mercy to Jon Kabat-Zinn in May 1970. The man now considered the godfather of modern mindfulness was a graduate student from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and an anti-Vietnam-war protester, agitating alongside the Black Panthers and the French playwright Jean Genet. “I got my entire face battered in,” he recalls. “They put this instrument on my wrist called the claw, which they tightened to generate enormous amounts of pain without leaving any marks. But they certainly left a lot of marks on my face. They pulled me into the back of the police station and beat the shit out of me.” Today, at 73, Kabat-Zinn’s restful, lined face shows no scars from that protest outside a police station, when a trip canvassing support for a nationwide university strike boiled over into violence,leaving him with stitches. He sits beneath the statue of Mahatma Gandhi on Parliament Square in London taking a breather after going straight from an overnight flight out of Boston into a 90-minute talk to a gathering of international parliamentarians about how he thinks mindfulness could – to put it bluntly – change the world. The once “very macho” anti-war activist who raged against MIT’s role in nuclear weapons research is the catalyst behind the west’s mushrooming interest in mindfulness meditation, having reimagined Buddhist contemplation practices for a secular age almost 40 years ago. With others, he pioneered an eight-week mindfulness-based stress-reduction course at the University of Massachusetts Medical School for patients with chronic pain, harnessing the fundamentals of mindfulness meditation as taught by the Buddha, but with the Buddhism taken out. “I bent over backwards to structure it and find ways to speak about it that avoided as much as possible the risk of it being seen as Buddhist, new age, eastern mysticism or just plain flakey,” he says. Kabat-Zinn had been meditating since 1965, but had no compunction in playing the Buddhism right down. “I got into this through the Zen door which is a very irreverent approach to Buddhism,” he says. He talks a lot about dharma, the term for the Buddha’s teaching, but he’s not a Buddhist and remarks that to insist mindfulness meditation is Buddhist is like saying gravity is English because it was identified by Sir Isaac Newton. The UMass Stress Reduction Clinic opened its doors in 1979 and taught people with chronic back pain, victims of industrial accidents, cancer patients and sometimes paraplegics. Kabat-Zinn has defined mindfulness meditation as “the awareness that arises from paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgmentally”. By focusing on the breath, the idea is to cultivate attention on the body and mind as it is moment to moment, and so help with pain, both physical and emotional. “It often results in apprehending the constantly changing nature of sensations, even highly unpleasant ones, and thus their impermanence,” he says. “It also gives rise to the direct experience that ‘the pain is not me’.” As a result, some of his patients found ways “to be in a different relationship with their pain” while others felt it diminish. The title of his 1990 bestseller about the clinic captures his approach to accepting whatever life throws at you: Full Catastrophe Living. Now, in 2017, Kabat-Zinn vibrates with an urgent belief that meditation is the “radical act of love and sanity” we need in the age of Trump, accelerating climate change and disasters such as the Grenfell Tower fire. He has a platform to build on. Mindfulness courses ultimately derived from his work are now being rolled out in the UK to school pupils, convicts, civil servants and even politicians. It is prescribed on the NHS in some areas to prevent recurrent depression, with 2,256 people completing eight-week courses last year. The course reduces the likelihood of relapse by almost a third, according to an analysis of nine trials. In the US, the NBA basketball champions, Golden State Warriors, are the latest poster boys for the practice after their coach, Steve Kerr, made mindfulness one of the team’s core values. “He is Mr Mindfulness in relation to the secular strand,” says Lokadhi Lloyd, a meditation teacher in London who has been on courses led by Kabat-Zinn. “Without him, I don’t think mindfulness would have risen to the prominence it has.” Supporters such as Willem Kuyken, a professor of clinical psychology at Oxford University, even suggest that Kabat-Zinn’s pioneering work could one day see him mentioned in the same breath as Darwin and Einstein. “What they did for biology and physics, Jon has done for a new frontier: the science of the human mind and heart,” says Kuyken. But mindfulness, Kabat-Zinn figures, must now be harnessed in a bigger way than so far seen, to do nothing less than challenge the way the world is run. This latest mission is why he has flown into London to speak to parliamentarians from 15 countries about how to act more wisely. “If this is another fad, I don’t want to have any part of it,” he says. “If in the past 50 years I had found something more meaningful, more healing, more transformative and with more potential social impact, I would be doing that.” There are signs many others agree with its potential. Globally, 18 million people subscribe to the Headspace app, practising mindfulness meditations through their headphones. In the shops, ranges of mindfulness clothing – not least “drop of mindfulness” tights (the only thing mindful seems to be the brand name) – colouring books and even dot-to-dot puzzles testify to the idea’s growing ubiquity – even if Kabat-Zinn derides much of this as “McMindfulness”. His work has attracted its share of sceptics, such as Miguel Farias and Catherine Wikholm, authors of The Buddha Pill, who caution that mindfulness is no cure-all and warn of a dark side if not taught correctly. Wikholm, a clinical psychologist, has said that “the fact that meditation was primarily designed not to make us happier, but to destroy our sense of individual self – who we feel and think we are most of the time – is often overlooked in the science and media stories about it”. There have also been 20 published case reports or observational studies where people’s experiences of meditation were distressing enough to warrant further treatment, according to a recent study. They include “meditation-induced” psychosis, mania, depersonalisation, anxiety, panic and re-experiencing traumatic memories. Kabat-Zinn and other highly experienced teachers point out that these are rare incidents and mostly relate to intensive retreats rather than the routine courses where meditators practise for perhaps half an hour a day. But he also admits that “90% of the research [into the positive impacts] is subpar”, with major studies still needed. Kabat-Zinn’s decision to pour his energy into trying to inject mindfulness into global politics should come as no surprise. In the political tumult at MIT in the late 1960s, he helped establish the Science Action Coordinating Committee to campaign against the university’s work with the Department of Defense, including research into multiple-warhead nuclear missiles. His activities regularly made the front page of the student paper, The Tech, as he appeared on platforms with Noam Chomsky, supported the Viet Cong and on one occasion translated the radical French playwright Jean Genet’s call for revolution. They meditated before actions, but one week, it reported how he and others stormed a meeting of the MIT Corporation chanting: “Kick the ass of the ruling class – end war research!” and “Power to the people.” In 1969, he told a meeting: “We are approaching a critical unique point in history. We are approaching an ego disaster of major proportions – overpopulation, pollution of every conceivable kind including mental.” When I read that back to Kabat-Zinn in Parliament Square, his response is urgent. “We’re worried about that right now, too,” he says. “Trump is crazier than anything we have ever seen ... This is our work at the moment, to see if we can maintain a degree of sanity and recognition of the fears and concerns of those who do not see the world the way we do. The temptation is to fall into camps where you dehumanise the other, and no matter what they do, they are wrong, and no matter what we do, we are right.” Trump’s threats to annihilate North Korea are one example of a people “losing their minds”, as is the lead poisoning of the water supply in Flint, Michigan. This month he’s travelling there to speak at a benefit for some of the victims of the 2014 decision to replace the supply with undertreated water. “The human mind, when it doesn’t do the work of mindfulness, winds up becoming a prisoner of its myopic perspectives that puts ‘me’ above everything else,” he says. “We are so caught up in the dualistic perspectives of ‘us’ and ‘them’. But ultimately there is no ‘them’. That’s what we need to wake up to.” Kabat-Zinn has just written a paper arguing that amid “the ascendancy of Trump and the forces and values he represents”, “endemic racism and police violence” and “persistent social and economic injustices … this may indeed be a pivotal moment for our species to come to our senses ... mobilising in the mainstream world ... the power of mindfulness”. He is at the House of Commons to make his case, but first he must get past the guards at the airport-style security system. While everyone else unpacks their laptops for the scanner, Kabat-Zinn produces a pair of ancient-looking copper meditation chimes, to the complete bemusement of the guard, who tries to confiscate them. When Kabat-Zinn explains they are for meditation, the puzzlement only deepens, as security staff gather to assess the threat. Finally, when he mentions it is for mindfulness, there is a flash of recognition and he is waved through. It is a moment of satisfaction for Kabat-Zinn: if a security guard knows the score, it must be catching on. Meditation is the “radical act of love and sanity” that can help manage the fear and aversion he believes underpin so many of the world’s problems. The Grenfell Tower disaster that claimed around 80 lives was partly down to an absence of mindfulness – “deep and authentic listening” – by decision makers who clearly felt an aversion to the complaints of residents. “There were many indications and pleas to take a look at the safety of that building with the cheaper cladding. People were saying: ‘This a fire trap,’” he says. “And because those people were without means or political significance, I think they were systematically unattended to. They thought: ‘It is not my job to attend to that.’ Everyone says: ‘Why didn’t we do something?’, but the reason is nobody said: ‘Let’s pay attention to what this is calling out for.’” Kabat-Zinn was born into a non-practising Jewish family and raised in upper Manhattan, near where his father worked as a scientist at Columbia University. It was rough and tough on the streets around Washington Heights and he jokes he is “the world’s most improbable meditator – a street kid from New York”. He started meditating while studying molecular biology at MIT in 1965 when a talk by Zen Buddhist Philip Kapleau “took the top off my head”. In 1979, married with children and working at the University of Massachusetts medical school, he had a 10-second “vision” on a meditation retreat in the woods 80 miles west of Boston. “I saw in a flash not only a model that could be put in place, but also the long-term implications,” he says. Kabat-Zinn foresaw mindfulness clinics spreading to hospitals and clinics with thousands of practitioners earning a living in a good cause. “Because it was so weird, I hardly ever mentioned this experience to others,” he says. “But it was so compelling I decided to take it on whole-heartedly as best I could.” Anyone who has tried to meditate knows how hard it is when the mind keeps wandering into thoughts, sometimes trivial, sometimes not. The difficulty people in chronic pain must have faced in embracing the elusive quality of attentiveness cannot be overestimated. But in Kabat-Zinn they had an experienced teacher. For more than 30 years, “every morning at five o’clock”, he would do yoga and then sit on his cushion and meditate. He stayed with his eight-week stress-reduction programme until 2000, spreading its influence through books, guided meditation CDs, teaching at retreats and endless conferences. In 2002, Welsh psychologist Mark Williams worked with colleagues at Cambridge and in Toronto to combine the US programme with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to form an eight-week mindfulness-based CBT course that, in 2004, was recommended for prescription on the NHS for recurrent depression. Williams taught mindfulness to the comedian Ruby Wax at Oxford University when she was looking to tackle her depression. She then popularised it through her 2013 book Sane New World. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been shown to be at least as effective as antidepressants at preventing relapse and, in a two-year trial by Willem Kuyken’s team, 44% of the MBCT cohort relapsed compared with 47% on pills. In one trial of 173 people, it was also found to reduce the severity of current depression, with an average 37% reduction in symptoms. It is being taught widely in the private sector with qualified MBCT teachers delivering courses in parish halls, workplaces and beyond. “The science of meditation is in its infancy,” Kabat-Zinn says. “We need decades more study. People talk about artificial intelligence and machine learning, but we haven’t scratched the surface of what human intelligence is really all about.” So now, Kabat-Zinn travels the globe. He is fascinated by teaching in China where he has detected a rebirth in the country’s contemplative traditions as a way of tackling its challenges. He leads intensive five-day retreats in the US, runs courses in Austria, Korea and Japan. Lately, he has been talking with David Simas, a former White House adviser and now chief executive of the Obama Foundation, who was inspired to take up mindfulness meditation by Kabat-Zinn. “I feel it’s my responsibility, since to a large degree people blame me for starting this whole ball rolling to participate in whatever way I can,” he says. “This is, in some sense, the fruition of that 10-second vision I had in 1979.” • This article was amended on 23 October 2017. An earlier version said the difficulty people in chronic pain must have faced could not be underestimated. This has been corrected to overestimated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/20/donald-trump-blame-terrorism-rising-uk-crime-figures","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T13:54:51Z","webTitle":"Was Donald Trump right to blame terrorism for rising UK crime figures?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/20/donald-trump-blame-terrorism-rising-uk-crime-figures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/20/donald-trump-blame-terrorism-rising-uk-crime-figures","fields":{"headline":"Was Donald Trump right to blame terrorism for rising UK crime figures?","bodyText":"A US study of Donald Trump’s tweets this week concluded they tell you about him more than they spark deep, insightful policy debates. But his sudden interest in the annual crime rate in England and Wales and his conflation of this week’s 13% jump in offences with “radical Islamic terror” attacks in Britain is likely to fuel another ugly statistic published by the Home Office this week. That was the four-month surge in hate crime following this year’s attacks, with British Muslim communities mostly on the receiving end of the 6,000 incidents a month when the figures peaked in June. First the textual analysis. For every Fraser Nelson, the Spectator editor who tried to point out – not without grammatical foundation – that “amid” didn’t necessary mean the president was directly blaming radical Islam for the rise in crime in England and Wales, there were many more – such as the notorious Katie Hopkins – who were only too willing to use it to fan the flame of Islamophobia. What about the facts? Well, Trump got the 13% right, which is the increase in police-recorded crime over the 12 months to June. However, a second yardstick, the Crime Survey of England and Wales, showed a 9% fall, but that excluded online crime. Perhaps the more reliable figure is the 19% increase in violent crime recorded by the police over the past year, including an 8% increase in the underlying murder rate. What do the statisticians say about what lies behind this accelerating increase in crime in England and Wales? “The 13% increase in police recorded crime from the previous year reflects a range of factors including continuing improvements to crime recording and genuine increases in some crime categories, especially in those that are well-recorded,” say the UK’s Office for National Statistics. So the increasing pace of terror attacks in England this year is not the cause? No, the ONS does not say that the attacks, let alone radical Islam, are among the causes of rising crime. Indeed, they go further and explicitly exclude the 35 victims of the Manchester and London terror attacks from the official homicide count for the year. They report that the number of homicides in England and Wales jumped by 46 victims to 629 – a rise of 8%. In British terms this is a worrying trend and put alongside a 26% increase in knife crime and 27% increase in gun crime amounts to an issue that the prime minister, let alone the home secretary, ought to be alarmed about. Yet, unlike Trump, neither saw fit to comment on the figures on Thursday, leaving it to a junior Home Office minister to explain what they are doing about it. As for Trump, he might like to reflect that the 629 homicides in England and Wales – population 53 million – in the past 12 months is somewhat below the 2016 death toll of 758 in the single US city of Chicago, population 2.7 million.

During a call made by Matthew Scully-Hicks on the day Elsie allegedly sustained fatal injuries, he described her as being “floppy and limp” and the operator can be heard instructing him to give her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Two months earlier, Scully-Hicks had also dialled 999 to report that Elsie had fallen down the stairs of the home in Cardiff he shared with husband Craig Scully-Hicks. In the recording of this emergency call he can be heard apparently trying to keep the little girl awake. He told the operator: “Her eyes are opening and they’re rolling around, I think she’s looking at me now but she’s not moving.” Fitness instructor Matthew Scully-Hicks, 36, is accused of killing Elsie two weeks after he and Craig Scully-Hicks formally adopted her. He denies murder. On Friday the Crown Prosecution Service provided audio recordings and transcripts of the 999 calls made on the day Elsie allegedly suffered the fatal injuries and on the previous occasion two months earlier. The jury at Cardiff crown court has heard the recordings. Matthew Scully-Hicks dialled the emergency services at 6.18pm on 25 May 2016. He told the operator: “I was just changing my daughter for bed and she went all floppy and limp, and now she’s not doing anything, she is lying on the floor.” He explained that he was trying to do CPR. The operator asked him to put his ear next to the girl’s mouth and listen for her breathing. He said: “She just took a breath in but it’s, she’s not breathing out.” The operator told him how to do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Matthew Scully-Hicks said he had done this and continued: “I saw the chest going in and out.” Next the operator guided him through chest compressions. Later he could be heard saying: “Oh my God” and “This is horrible”. The jury has heard that after Elsie was taken to hospital she was found to have suffered subdural bleeding and fractures to her skull, three ribs and a leg. She also had bleeding in both eyes. She died four days after being admitted. On 10 March, Matthew Scully-Hicks had dialled 999 and told the operator: “My daughter’s fallen down the stairs, she’s not responding to me, she, she’s just lying there.” Asked what caused the fall he said: “I didn’t push the gate closed properly and she fell down.” He added: “She’s just, she’s just lying there, she’s just all floppy … Her eyes are opening and they’re rolling around, I think she’s looking at me now but she’s not moving.” Later he said: “Oh my God, she’s being sick … I’ve got her on her side … ah there’s a bit of blood in there as well.” Elsie could be heard vomiting. He said: “Let it out love, let it out love, let it out babe.” He told the girl: “Elsie, Elsie, stay with me love. Good girl, Elsie, Elsie, Elsie, stay awake, stay awake, stay awake Elsie … Elsie stay awake love, stay awake … Elsie come on.” He appeared to go away from the phone to fetch a rattle-like toy and kept talking to Elsie. The sound of coughing and crying could be heard as the ambulance crew arrived. On this occasion Elsie’s injuries were considered to be consistent with a fall down stairs and she was allowed to go home. On Friday the jury heard from a pathologist who said injuries to the child’s eyes were similar to those that the victim of a severe car crash might be expected to suffer. Dr Richard Bonshek, a consultant ophthalmic pathologist who examined Elsie’s eyes after she had died, said he found bleeding in the retinas of both eyes, the coverings of the optic nerves, the optic nerve sheaths and in the tissue around the optic nerve in both eyes. He said: “Comparing these changes [in Elsie’s eye] with changes I have seen in other cases … I think that for accidental causes then one is talking of severe motor vehicle accidents, falls from heights [or] in cases when a child has been accidentally propelled down stairs or a child has been thrown down stairs.” Bonshek added the injuries were so severe that had Elsie survived she would “most probably” have had problems with her sight. “In terms of non-accidental injuries, these findings have been described in cases which have been ascribed to shaking as well of cases of shaking and impact, and impact alone,” he added. Dr Stephen Rose, a consultant paediatrician, told the jury on Thursday that in his view it was likely that Elsie had been shaken violently and that her head had been “rocked backwards and forwards so that her head was flexed down on to her chest and flexed backwards”. Of Elsie’s skull fracture, he said: “There must have been a cause of the fracture, skull fractures don’t occur spontaneously, and so the only mechanism for a skull fracture is if there was a blow to the head, either during the shaking injury which culminated in Elsie being thrown against a hard floor, or possibly her head being knocked against a wall.” The trial continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/22/cambridge-university-trigger-warnings-piccadilly-circus-targeted-advertising-david-mitchell","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T09:00:01Z","webTitle":"The trouble with getting lost in your own world | David Mitchell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/22/cambridge-university-trigger-warnings-piccadilly-circus-targeted-advertising-david-mitchell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/22/cambridge-university-trigger-warnings-piccadilly-circus-targeted-advertising-david-mitchell","fields":{"headline":"The trouble with getting lost in your own world…","bodyText":"Do we really want to know what’s actually going on? In the world and in the past and in plant cells and in space and in the flat upstairs? I get that it’s always going to be impossible to be sure. All any of us has to go on is a load of nerve signals hastily compiled into a vaguely coherent impression by the grey sponge that seems to be the site of the key thing that makes each of us whoever each of us is. It’s an impression that can get skewed by fear, rage, self-interest, hunger, a bad back or by being, to a greater or lesser extent, mad. Anyone who’s suffered from sciatica will tell you how disconcerting it is to feel a pain you’re convinced is emanating from your leg but which is in fact caused by an injury, located somewhere in the spine, to the nerve responsible for leg news. But it doesn’t feel like a faulty line – the nerve doesn’t crackle. It just feels like a sore leg. It is a totally convincing, rather undramatic, delusion and a salutary reminder that when we think we’re definitely looking at a table, that’s actually just the narrative our brain is imposing upon unsubstantiated data supplied by the optic nerve. On top of that, loads of the data our ocular nerves are getting hold of these days comes via various screens which are themselves imperfectly connected to, and flawed reflections of, the things that are really happening. So I totally accept that no one actually knows anything and, for all practical purposes, there is no such thing as objective truth. But that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not worth searching for – in the same way the ultimate unattainability of complete cleanliness doesn’t invalidate occasionally using the Hoover. For millennia it’s been a sort of given that humans are always, in various ways, trying to work out what’s up. And the results have been mixed. On the plus side, it’s provided a huge variety of cheese and celebrity gossip. In the minus column, there’s our expulsion from the Garden of Eden [citation needed] and nuclear weapons. Then last week I suddenly felt like we might be giving up the struggle. I read two very different news reports, but both were about denying or warping reality. And neither involved Donald Trump. The first was that Cambridge University lecture timetables are being labelled with “trigger warnings” about the plots of various literary works, including The Bacchae and Titus Andronicus. So English literature undergraduates are being protected from the knowledge of, among other things, what one of Shakespeare’s plays is about, in case it upsets them. Will budding physicists soon be allowed to shield themselves from the shocking understanding of what a black hole really is, or what will happen to the Earth when the sun explodes? They’re unsettling truths. The context of this story was concern over how universities are becoming bastions of these trigger warnings, as well as of “no-platforming” and “safe spaces”, rather than of freedom of speech. Jo Johnson, the universities minister, says he wants to do something about it, which is nice to hear but not as nice as it would be coming from a government that wasn’t record-breakingly inept. Unfortunately, there are many people who instinctively feel they have the right to be protected from opinions that offend them or facts they find distressing. It’s going to be difficult to talk them out of that position as they’ve convinced themselves there’s something immoral about being disagreed with. They want to be able to curate their experience of the world to exclude elements they’d rather didn’t exist. I know the feeling. On Twitter, if someone sends me a message that, in retrospect, I’d rather I hadn’t read, I immediately “mute” them. This means I won’t see any other messages they send me but, unlike if I’d “blocked” them, they don’t realise I’ve cut them out and so don’t have something else to get cross about. So two truths are suppressed: I remain ignorant of what they’re saying and they don’t realise they’re shouting into the wilderness. I’m not proud of it, but it’s more relaxing this way. And, in my defence, I’m not a globally renowned seat of learning and they’re not Germaine Greer. The second was the very different story that the new electric hoarding at Piccadilly Circus is going to have targeted advertising. There are hidden cameras within it that can apparently identify the age of passers-by or what make of car they’re driving and will change the sign’s marketing messages accordingly. This has been happening online for some time, but now it’s moving off the computer screen on to a tennis court-sized expanse of iconic central London wall. The wall will also offer localised wifi with which people will be encouraged to interact so their experience of that part of town can be further personalised. Essentially, then, the appearance of a famous landmark will be different according to who you are. There will be no “true” version. The writing on the wall will be different for you than it is for someone else. Reality will be warped by subjectivity before it even hits the optic nerve. First the internet and now Piccadilly have become like a high-functioning sociopath, shape-shifting according to their short-term needs from whomever happens to be looking. As it is, we spend too much of our lives in little pockets of the internet, surrounded by the slogans of products we’ve already bought and beliefs we already hold. Other online pockets seem strange and barbarian with their abhorrent views and crappy marketing. We can dismiss those people’s opinions, and they can dismiss ours, because, we think, those who disagree with us are simply “biased”. Their heretical viewpoints are the products of blinkered self-interest. Their way of looking at the world is wrong. But at least we’re all looking at the same world. For now. More or less. We can agree on the theoretical existence somewhere of a definitive truth. Are we still up for seeking that truth or are we happy to compound our own subjectivity by being ever more protected from views we oppose and only exposed to advertising designed exclusively for our particular tribe? It’s ironic that the advent of a technology facilitating unprecedented communication and understanding of the paradoxes and complexity of global events, and of billions of people’s reactions to them, is causing us to retreat from such knowledge. The apple’s tasting funny and we long for the peace of the garden."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/25/outsiders-by-lyndall-gordon-review-five-women-writers-who-changed-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T08:00:02Z","webTitle":"Outsiders by Lyndall Gordon review – five women writers who changed the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/25/outsiders-by-lyndall-gordon-review-five-women-writers-who-changed-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/25/outsiders-by-lyndall-gordon-review-five-women-writers-who-changed-the-world","fields":{"headline":"Outsiders by Lyndall Gordon review – five women writers who changed the world","bodyText":"Lyndall Gordon writes with passionate intelligence about the literature she loves. Since she first published her book on TS Eliot in 1977, she has developed her distinctive way of weaving together the writer’s life and writing, in studies of Virginia Woolf, Henry James, Mary Wollstonecraft, Emily Dickinson and others. Her books are speculative literary biographies; she is fascinated by the otherness and particularity of each of her subjects, but she’s always also pressing on their lives and their works to answer urgent questions of her own, reading their thought as urgently contemporary. Her Divided Lives, a moving memoir of her own childhood in South Africa and relationship with her beloved mother – who was intelligent and spiritual, struggling all her life with illness – feels like a source book for the preoccupations underpinning Gordon’s writing on literature. When her mother called her Lyndall, after the doubting, questing, imaginative heroine of Olive Schreiner’s The Story of an African Farm, she endowed her with more than just a pretty name. Gordon’s new book opens with Mary Shelley, takes in Emily Brontë, George Eliot and Schreiner, and ends with Virginia Woolf. There are separate sections on each writer, condensed biographical and critical sketches. The five are also linked explicitly through Gordon’s theme: they are all “outsiders” (it’s Woolf’s word from Three Guineas), or “outsider insurgents”, unconstrained by convention, writing against the grain of their time, prophetically imagining a different future, exploring “oddity in ways that speak to us about our unseen selves”. Gordon is a natural storyteller, and the lives stir us and fascinate us no matter how well we already know them. Some of them – Brontë’s and Woolf’s, certainly – have become foundation myths in our literary culture. Gordon has the storyteller’s feel for the details that make each episode vivid: Brontë sitting at lunch with the British chaplain in Brussels and not saying a word; Schreiner writing to her sister about her stillborn baby, “that beautiful, holy little life of mine”; Woolf putting on her mother’s taffeta dress to be photographed for Vogue. Gordon’s sympathetic imagination works so strongly that she almost slips inside the language of the writer and her era, ventriloquising it: Shelley’s “fine, gauzy hair, loose on her shoulders, spun as she moved her head”; Charlotte Brontë inscribes “a hidden nature graven in secret script”. Her judgments are full of novelistic insight, pushing into the biographical material to substantiate her hunches, tracing patterns and repetitions in these writers’ emotional lives and in their work. Eliot and Schreiner both fell for coldly intellectual men who didn’t find them physically attractive; seeking the approval of a stern master figure, they were eager to condemn the “silliness” of the ordinary women who were taken up with domesticity, with reading and writing frivolous novels. When the outsiders did find happiness with men (Percy Shelley, George Lewes, Leonard Woolf), it was with the ones who took them seriously as intellectuals and supported their writing. Speculations about their sex lives – the Shelleys’ love-making after the death of little “Willmouse” (their second child, William), Eliot’s disastrous honeymoon with John Cross, Woolf’s so-called “frigidity” – are risky, but read as imaginative and plausible. Eliot and presumably Woolf used birth control. Shelley was the only one among the five with living children. She tried to cope with the calamities of motherhood – not only repeated pregnancies and childbirth and childcare, but also the sickness and death of her offspring – while she followed her husband around Italy in pursuit of an ideal freedom. Gordon gives Percy Shelley a surprisingly easy time, on the grounds of his “assent” to Mary’s “distinction”: he seemed to extend his assent to a number of fervidly imaginative girls, and not always to care what became of his discards. The five writers are woven together in a narration across time, through their reading and sometimes as role models for one another. When Mary Shelley eloped with the poet they read aloud together from her mother Mary Wollstonecraft’s book Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Eliot read and approved of The Rights too, in her 30s (although copies were scarce in Victorian England). Schreiner in 1886 was asked to contribute an introduction to it. Woolf in 1929 wrote a biographical essay on Wollstonecraft. Eliot marvelled at Brontë’s “power, splendour and wildness”, and Woolf thought Brontë was an English Electra. Woolf was much more unkind on the subject of Eliot’s earnestness, however, than gets mentioned here; and while she admired The Story of an African Farm, she didn’t think anything else Schreiner wrote was much good, and wished she hadn’t been obsessed with “sex questions”. Schreiner visited Shelley’s memorial to her husband, but it was his poems she loved, not Shelley’s novel. There is no sign of the later writers taking any interest in Frankenstein. Gordon in her eager, hurrying inclusiveness wants to make each of her writers a way-station in a progressive evolution; “here and there, in unlooked for places, the new breed sprouts”. This is partly a 19th-century habit, a forward-looking hopefulness and hailing of new dawns; she catches it from her subjects. It is at the core of the Romantic tradition to which they all belong, apart from Woolf; Romanticism also celebrates the “natural” outsider, opposed to the “artificiality” of culture. Would we want to construct an equivalent consecutive history out of the lives of five male writers, even if some were also outsiders in a sense (Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy, DH Lawrence)? We might want to link them in terms of influence in their work, but probably not through their private lives. And in emphasising the female writers’ role as precursors or visionaries, we risk underplaying how distinctively each one is of her own age, participating in its idiom and its worldview as well as helping to form these. It’s interesting that Jane Austen can’t be fitted into this outsider-precursor sequence. She is surely just as radical in her own way, insisting that her women’s ordinary lives – their provincial gossip and dressmaking and flirtations – are worthy material for innovative fiction, refusing the master-narratives of high-minded Romanticism, making fun of them. And yet Schreiner is magnificent and tragic, addressing herself to later generations: “It was in the thought of your larger realisation and fuller life that we found consolation for the futilities of our own.” All five of the brilliant, exceptional women in this book really were thwarted. They suffered just as Gordon shows us: in their work because they struggled to participate fully in the institutions of intellectual life of their time, and in their personal lives because they couldn’t fit comfortably inside the frame of what was acceptably female. We don’t want to condescend to the complexity of the past, and progress may always be equivocal, provisional and fraught with unintended consequences. But sometimes nonetheless it’s plain to see. In our time in the west, women have won equal access to education and equal rights in law. Along with technological advances delivering easy contraception and safer childbirth and washing machines, these have effected fundamental shifts in our politics and perceptions of gender. Gordon’s five writers all had crucial roles to play in writing women’s voices into our history in the English-speaking world and beyond, making it impossible for power and reason to ignore them. • Outsiders: Five Women Writers Who Changed The World by Lyndall Gordon (Virago, £20).

Let’s take the departing BBC head of news at his own word: that’s he’s off to start a different kind of news organisation that will be allowed – ahem! – to reach conclusions, to take sides, to have beliefs. In short, to be free. But isn’t Harding’s current empire a vision of freedom? No Barclays or Murdochs telling him what to say. No sudden collapses in advertising to bring his plans tumbling down. This is a newsman’s nirvana, surely? Alas, think again. Or rather go to bed early and read the latest Ofcom prescriptions for corporation sanctity. Some of them land – or would have landed – straight in Harding’s lap. “We will strengthen news and current affairs rules,” Ofcom insists.” We have increased quotas for news and current affairs on BBC1 and 2, and set new conditions for radio. Radio 2 will be required, for the first time, to air at least three hours of news and current affairs in peak time per week, and Radio 1 to broadcast an extended news bulletin in peak time each weekday.” Oh! And never forget your “public purpose of providing impartial news and information to help people understand and engage with the world around them in accordance with its obligations under the charter”. Many of these prescriptions, meanwhile, take words like “diversity” and squeeze the life from them. Diversity in employment on screen and in production. Diversity in serving every region and community around the land. Diversity with new targets and formulae, subject to annual review and sanctions. At which point it may gently be observed that very little of this has much to do with airing crisp news or incisive analysis – and much more to do with the weight of government regulation tacked slyly, for purpose, on to charter renewal; along, of course, with hefty cuts in the licence fee and news budget, plus assorted contemporary problems, like pay differentials across the swath of news coverage. A nightmare. No wonder Harding reputedly longs for a life free from a) bureaucratic criteria; b) politicians; and c) rules for news gathering that impose almost inhuman restrictions on good reporting instincts. And the difficulty is that there’s never anything we could call closure. Overseas news has different rules. Jon Sopel doesn’t have to be fair to an unbalanced Trump. But the big issues that affect Britain are different. There’s no story bigger than Brexit, but it’s clearly a scoop-free zone. Any new voice of opinion – say, from Sir Martin Donnelly, lately Whitehall’s top expert on international trade, has to be countered 20 Today minutes later by a Leave businessman. Brexit, like the referendum that gave it birth, is an endless parade of he said/she said. Yet what does impartiality imply in this context? Only a collective lack of commitment that, on one side or another, has no basis in demonstrable fact. Impartiality isn’t independence to establish truth. I took some stick from Catalan nationalists last week for asserting that Catalan radio and TV channels create a cocoon of unreality around their cause. Which is predictable enough, in the sense that being for or against independence is an issue that affects and divides 7.5 million citizens. Of course, coverage on both sides seems warped. How could it not be, for instance, with the ex-deputy head of one driving organisational force for independence plonked in charge of TV3? But is that more or less useful than a BBC mired in the Ofcom mud and doomed to wheel in Iain Duncan Smith or Nigel Lawson at ritual rebuttal time? You can’t blame Harding for getting fed up. Nor, alas, can you blame ordinary viewers and listeners either."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/20/home-office-reverses-decision-stroke-victim-wife-leave-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T11:56:59Z","webTitle":"Home Office reverses decision to make stroke victim's wife leave UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/20/home-office-reverses-decision-stroke-victim-wife-leave-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/20/home-office-reverses-decision-stroke-victim-wife-leave-uk","fields":{"headline":"Home Office reverses decision to make stroke victim's wife leave UK","bodyText":"The wife of a British stroke victim told by the Home Office that he must become the sole carer for their two young children has been told she will receive a right to remain visa after the Guardian highlighted their plight. The Home Office had previously insisted Leah Waterman had to return to the Philippines, leaving her husband, Simon – who uses a wheelchair, requires 24-hour supervision to keep him alive and cannot speak, write or reliably understand what is said to him – as the sole carer for their two young British children. Three days after the Guardian broke the story, Leah Waterman was told she would not have to return home to apply for a visa to care for her family in the UK. The Home Office’s U-turn comes after it previously insisted there were “no exceptional circumstances” preventing her following the conventional route of applying for her visa from outside the UK. Simon Waterman was living with his wife and their children, Kimi and Bryce, aged 10 and seven, in the Philippines when he had a severe stroke in September 2015. The family moved back to Abergavenny in south Wales in December so Simon could be near his family. However, they were refused a visa for Leah to remain in the country. The decision was made despite unequivocal evidence from multiple medical sources detailing the extent of Simon’s disabilities, his repeated life-threatening seizures – some lasting as long as seven hours – the risk of sudden death and the impossibility of him looking after himself, let alone his children. “I’m totally overwhelmed,” Leah Waterman said. “I can smile now and I think I will get my first good night’s sleep tonight for many months. I will tell my children when they get home tonight. They will be so happy. We have tried to hide this situation from them but they have guessed something is wrong and have been increasingly upset about it. Simon too can now concentrate on getting better instead of desperately worrying about me having to go back to the Philippines. “It’s great that the Home Office’s decision has been revised,” she added. “But I wish they hadn’t made the wrong decision in the first place when our exceptional circumstances were so clear right from day one.” Simon, a former soldier in the British army, requires 24-hour care from Leah and medical experts. His stroke caused major brain injury, resulting in paralysis on the right side of his body and significant weakness on the left. He struggles to walk outdoors, risks falling whenever he stands up and would be unable to get himself off the floor if he did fall. He cannot do even gentle exercise for more than three minutes without requiring a rest. Since his stroke, Simon has had regular post-stroke seizures, lasting between 30 minutes and seven hours. They can happen at any time and have led to him being admitted to hospital at least five times during the past 12 months. Despite extensive medical evidence submitted with her visa application, the Home Office rejected Leah Waterman’s application for leave to remain in the UK because she had entered on a visitor’s visa. It said it would not even consider her request for a change of immigration status, because she did not have the right clearance when she entered the country. Leah Waterman, however, explained in her application that the family had arranged her visitor’s visa before her husband’s stroke so they could visit his parents and sister for Christmas in 2015. She sought legal advice after Simon’s stroke and was told that she could not apply for a right to remain visa until her visitor’s visa expired in June 2016, by which time the family feared Simon might have died. Leah Waterman was told, however, that the change in her husband’s health would qualify her to claim exceptional circumstances and apply for the new visa from inside the UK, which she did in July 2016. In its refusal letter of August 2017, the Home Office dismissed that advice: “We have considered … whether there are exceptional circumstances in your case [for example, whether you returning home to reapply for your visa] would result in unjustifiably harsh conditions for you, your partner [or] a relevant child,” the letter stated. “In so doing, we have taken into account the best interests of any relevant child as a primary consideration. Based on the information you have provided, we have decided that there are no such exceptional circumstances in your case. “The option is available to you to return to the Philippines and apply for the correct entry clearance,” the letter continues. “During this time, your children can remain in the UK under the care of their father.” Shah Williams, Simon’s sister, said: “I still can’t quite believe it. It’s such a relief and takes so much pressure off Leah and Simon. They can now start to move forward as best they can in the circumstances. The family can now look for some joy in the very changed life that we all now face after Simon’s stroke rather than focusing on the fear that Leah might be taken from us at any time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/29/the-inner-life-of-animals-peter-wohlleben-book-review-katharine-norbury","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-29T10:00:24Z","webTitle":"The Inner Life of Animals by Peter Wohlleben – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/29/the-inner-life-of-animals-peter-wohlleben-book-review-katharine-norbury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/29/the-inner-life-of-animals-peter-wohlleben-book-review-katharine-norbury","fields":{"headline":"The Inner Life of Animals by Peter Wohlleben – review","bodyText":"We don’t really know what makes animals behave the way they do, but several writers have had a stab at trying to work it out. These books include Marc Hauser’s Wild Minds in 2000, Jonathan Balcombe’s Second Nature: The Inner Lives of Animals in 2010, Carl Safina’s fascinating Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel in 2015, and Frans de Waal’s excellent Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? in 2016. To this list we can now add Peter Wohlleben’s The Inner Life of Animals: Surprising Observations of a Hidden World. Wohlleben’s name became familiar with the explosive global success of The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate when it was published in English in September 2016. His new book, The Inner Life of Animals: Surprising Observations of a Hidden World, sold over 250,000 copies in hardback when it was published in Germany and became an overnight No 1 bestseller. Now, translated into English, it looks set to do the same here. The success of Trees seemed to be attributable to a number of elements: the fascinating scientific research of Suzanne Simard, who introduced us to the idea of ancient “mother trees” and “the wood-wide web”, the means of communication trees use to transmit their needs to one another. Wohlleben added to this his vast anecdotal knowledge of “how woods work”, acquired over many decades working as a German forester. He has a conversational writing style, which is comparable to that of the chatty and accessible ecstatic saint, Teresa of Avila (who is still a bestseller 400 years after her death). Wohlleben presents short chapters in bite-sized portions, so the reader has a constant sense of learning something new almost with every page, and he employs this same model with The Inner Life of Animals. The formula is provably winning. I still felt I was on a robust learning curve as subjects as diverse as motherly love, gratitude, deception, desire, shame and knowledge of good and evil were explored one by one. Many of his stories are fascinating. The tale of an “abandoned” faun, brought home by children when it had been carefully hidden by its mother, so that she could graze and replenish her milk reserves seems, on the surface, no different from the countless tales of fledglings brought home by well-meaning children and raised as pets. But the deer, when it matured, far from becoming tame, tried to chase away its human “parents”, which now encroached on its “land”, resulting in violent attacks on its human foster parents. An exploration into the intelligence of pigs asks: “If researchers know so much about the intelligence of pigs, why isn’t the image of the smart pig publicised more? I suspect it has to do with eating pork.” Wohlleben’s candid observations invite scrutiny of our dietary habits, although, as David Attenborough pointed out, we don’t feed lions grass. In other places I found myself struggling with Wohlleben’s theories. In part this is because most of us have some knowledge of living with, or working alongside, animals and we have already formed our own ideas of how we interact, from our pet dogs and cats, to the garden birds that come back year after year or the sheepdogs made accessible by writers such as James Rebanks. But there is also a slight “two-book deal” feel here, and the manner in which Wohlleben attributes human feelings and morality to animals is spurious. There’s a lot of anecdote, not quite enough scientific rigour, and one too many references to YouTube for The Inner Life of Animals to be entirely satisfying. • The Inner Life of Animals by Peter Wohlleben is published by The Bodley Head (£16.99).

The Scottish actor said he had been over-exuberant with the remedy, which some claim eases muscle ache, after a 12-hour day of performing stunts on set for his latest film, Geostorm. Butler told the ITV chat show Lorraine: “I had heard of this guy injecting bee venom, because apparently it has many anti-inflammatory compounds. So, I’m like: ‘Come, come to New Orleans where we’re filming.’ So, he gives me a shot, and I go: ‘Oh, that’s interesting’ – because it stings. “Then he gives me 10 shots, and then I have the worst reaction. I kind of enter this anaphylactic shock. It’s awful, creepy crawlies all over me, swelled up, heart’s going to explode. But I go through it, and then I find out he gave me 10 times too much.” Butler was immediately taken to hospital, but admitted that four days later he decided to give the remedy another go. “I decide to do it again because, I think: ‘Maybe I just took too much.’ So, he’s on the phone, and this time I have to go to the hospital [again].” Bee stings have been used as a remedy, known as apitherapy, for centuries, initially by placing live bees on inflamed areas and in more modern times by extracting the venom from the living bees and injecting it. Butler, 47, known for films including 300, is not the first celebrity to dabble with bee venom as a medical remedy. Gwyneth Paltrow, who has moved from acting into the health sphere with her wellness venture Goop, has said she experimented with bee stings to help with inflammation and scarring. “It’s actually pretty incredible if you research it. But, man, it’s painful,” said Paltrow. Other conditions helped by bee stings according to advocates of the treatment include rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, skin lesions, and chronic hives. The New York dermatologist Jeannette Graf recently told Vogue: “Bee venom has the potential to help minimise symptoms – the science isn’t really there yet, but there’s potential for things that don’t respond to western medicine.” Jeff Goldblum, a guest with Butler on BBC1’s The Graham Norton Show, gently mocked the Scot’s use of the remedy. “I’ve done some cockamamie things in my time but that is crazy,” he said. “I think we should trust science.” Butler was recently hospitalised after a motorbike crash that left him with injuries to his knee and ankle. He said it happened after a woman parking her car reversed into his bike and he “did a somersault about 30ft in the air”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2017/oct/21/the-big-issue-actresses-must-inspire-other-to-speak-over-sexual-harassment-harvey-weinstein","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T23:05:35Z","webTitle":"Actresses must inspire others to speak out over harassment | The big issue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/21/the-big-issue-actresses-must-inspire-other-to-speak-over-sexual-harassment-harvey-weinstein","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/oct/21/the-big-issue-actresses-must-inspire-other-to-speak-over-sexual-harassment-harvey-weinstein","fields":{"headline":"The big issue: actresses must inspire others to speak out over harassment","bodyText":"The extent of sexual allegations against Harvey Weinstein is horrifying, but they give voice to “ordinary”, mainly female, employees for whom experiences of such behaviour also resonate (“After Weinstein, let’s stop asking women to answer for their sex predator’s crimes”, Comment). Unfortunately, unlike actresses, these women often don’t have the influence, confidence or money that facilitates being heard and taken seriously. Many women working in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, like me, endured everything from lewd comments to unprovoked and unwarranted overtly sexual male behaviour. In my case, it was hardcore pornography placed on my chair and a boss who regularly lay on the floor to look up my knee-length skirts. Worse was the accountant/technical author, who requested female assistants with exceptionally long hair so he could rub his genitalia against it while the woman typed corrections to his manuscripts. Ironically, this was arranged with the collusion of the personnel officer, who thought it was “all right” as long as they were, like me, married.

Unlike the majority of women, eventually I did complain, but was classed as making a fuss over nothing, while changing jobs wasn’t always an option or, alas, a remedy.

After last weekend’s horror show at Watford, Arsenal face Everton – another club with high aspirations feeling the heat – at Goodison Park on Sunday and the manager is demanding a strong response. Last season it proved to be a pivotal – and painful – fixture for Wenger’s side, ending an unbeaten league run that stretched for almost four months. Top of the table at the time, that stumble on Merseyside prompted a steady slip out of the top four. Wenger was not keen to be reminded. “The game against Everton is just about the men on the pitch on Sunday and the quality that we can produce,” he said. This season brings new territory for Arsenal as Wenger outlined how he has essentially decided to operate with two separate teams – one in the league and one for the cups. “It is impossible to come from a game of that intensity [in Belgrade] and play. Of course I left 10 or 11 players at home. I decided to rotate at the start of the season and will continue to do so,” he said before adding: “But the time will come when the rotation can go another way.” He wants to keep the door open for performers who impress on any stage to force their way into the biggest matches. Of the crew who picked up three more Europa League points this week, one or two would expect to return to Premier League contention on Sunday despite returning to London in the early hours of Friday. Petr Cech, who was dominant in goal in place of the injured David Ospina, will start at Everton and the goalscorer Olivier Giroud, who was close to a move to Everton over the summer, should be on the bench. The most intriguing case is Jack Wilshere, who again played with the intelligence and energy that is increasingly impossible to ignore. A Premier League start must come soon. Danny Welbeck, who injured his groin at Watford, is unavailable for the rest of October. “He is out for two to three weeks – he won’t be back before the break,” said Wenger. “He has a groin injury. Laurent Koscielny will be all right, Aaron Ramsey and Alexis Sánchez will be all right.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/20/electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-mostly-used-women-older-people-nhs","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T14:39:18Z","webTitle":"Electroconvulsive therapy mostly used on women and older people, says study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/20/electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-mostly-used-women-older-people-nhs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/20/electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-mostly-used-women-older-people-nhs","fields":{"headline":"Electroconvulsive therapy mostly used on women and older people, says study","bodyText":"The use of electroconvulsive therapy to treat serious mental health problems is more prevalent in women and older individuals, researchers have found. The study, which looked at data from a group of NHS trusts in England between 2011 and 2015, found that, on average, two thirds of recipients of ECT were women, and 56% were people aged over 60. The results chime with findings from the annual dataset release by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, which reveals that for 2016-17, 67% of patients receiving acute courses of ECT were female, as were 74% of those receiving ECT to prevent relapses – so-called “maintenance ECT”. The data also found the mean age of patients was 61 for those receiving acute ECT, and 66 for those receiving maintenance ECT. “This is remarkably consistent over a long period of time and in almost every country where it has been studied,” said John Read, professor of clinical psychology at the University of East London, and co-author of the latest study, published in the journal Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice. Early this year, a Guardian investigation revealed that, while ECT has been in decline since the latter half of the 20th century, the trend now appears to have stalled, with recent figures even suggesting a slight increase in its use. Used to treat serious mental health problems, including life-threatening and treatment-resistant depression, ECT involves passing an electrical charge through the brain to trigger a seizure. The patient is under general anaesthetic at the time, and the electricity is applied for a matter of seconds. While some experts say that ECT is an important and powerful tool for treating certain mental health problems, others argue that more research needs to be done to understand how it works, and whether it is truly effective compared with placebos. Patient stories are also mixed: according to the latest data from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, more than 72% of patients receiving acute ECT were rated as being much improved, or very much improved, at the end of the treatment, while fewer than 2% were deemed worse. That ECT is more commonly used among women and older individuals was of concern, said Read. “Nobody talks about it, or tries to explain it, or wonders why that might be,” he said, stressing that ECT does not tackle the social issues behind why more women than men appear to have depression. “[ECT] is part of over-medicalising of human distress,” said Read, adding that some studies have shown that the side-effects of ECT, primarily related to memory loss, are worse for women and older people. However, Nicol Ferrier, emeritus professor at Newcastle University and chair of the ECT committee at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said that analyses of multiple studies had not found the cognitive side-effects from ECT were worse among elderly people or women. The higher rates of ECT use among women and older individuals, added Ferrier, was neither surprising nor a cause for concern. “Depression is more common in females than males,” he said, noting that the ratios were particularly high for treatment-resistant forms of the condition. While Ferrier noted it was likely there were many factors behind that trend, he added that ECT appeared to be particularly effective for people with severe depression with life-threatening symptoms, psychosis and certain other diagnoses, and even more so among elderly women in this group. What’s more, he said, rates of ECT had declined among adults more generally, rather than older people. “One of the reasons, we think, is that use of antidepressants is associated with quite a lot of side-effects in the elderly, whereas ECT is actually really very safe and straightforward in the elderly – provided you do it with appropriate standards,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/23/mondays-best-tv-life-at-100-my-week-as-a-muslim-supergirl","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T04:59:11Z","webTitle":"Monday’s best TV: Life at 100, My Week As a Muslim, Supergirl","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/23/mondays-best-tv-life-at-100-my-week-as-a-muslim-supergirl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/23/mondays-best-tv-life-at-100-my-week-as-a-muslim-supergirl","fields":{"headline":"Monday’s best TV: Life at 100, My Week As a Muslim, Supergirl","bodyText":"A Year in an English Garden: Flicker &amp; Pulse 9pm, BBC4 Delightful, meditative film that uses the passing of the seasons as a springboard for musings on mortality, renewal and humanity’s relationship with nature.

Starting as an ingenue in the 1930s, she grew into a sophisticate in the 40s and 50s, and retained a dignified and magical presence in films into the new century. The outstanding examples of her art were the three films Darrieux made with the German-born Max Ophüls when she was in her 30s. In La Ronde (1950), she played the married woman who is seduced by a student (Daniel Gélin). The second and best of the three adapted tales by Guy de Maupassant in Le Plaisir (House of Pleasure, 1952) is La Maison Tellier, in which Darrieux played one of a group of prostitutes paying an annual holiday visit to the country. But it was the title role of Madame de ... (1953, released in English as The Earrings of Madame de …) that gave her even more of a chance to shine as a fickle socialite who sells her earrings to pay off a debt, unbeknown to her husband (Charles Boyer). Darrieux’s father was an army doctor who died when she was seven. Born in Bordeaux, but brought up in Paris, she was studying the cello at the Conservatoire when her ambitious mother entered the 14-year-old Danielle for an audition for an adolescent role in Le Bal (1931), directed by the Austrian Wilhelm Thiele. Many of her best films were made by German or Austrian directors. In 1934, she appeared in Curtis Bernhardt’s L’Or dans la Rue, and in Mauvaise Graine (Bad Seed), co-directed by Billy Wilder (with Alexander Esway), his first film made outside Germany. The latter, an appealing comedy-drama of an amateur crook lured by Darrieux into joining a professional gang, was a superb showcase for her talents. In the same year, she married the director Henri Decoin, with whom she made several films before their divorce in 1940. The following year, Darrieux’s star status was established when she was ideally cast as the tragic adolescent Marie Vetsera to Boyer’s Crown Prince Rudolph in Anatole Litvak’s Mayerling, the first and arguably the best of the various screen versions of this tale of doomed love. A few years later, Darrieux made a successful Hollywood debut in the title role of The Rage of Paris (1938), as a penniless French chorus girl in New York seeking a rich husband. However, she never had any intention of making a career outside France, and returned to make a few films before the Nazi occupation of her country in 1940. Darrieux entertained German troops with the cabaret act she had perfected, made two films, Caprices and La Fausse Maîtresse (both 1942), for the Nazi-controlled production company Continental Films, and went on a publicity trip to Germany with a group of other French stars. Now married to the Dominican diplomat and polo player Porfirio Rubirosa, she became a target for criticism, but was exonerated after the liberation. Coincidentally, in 1956, Jean Renoir wrote a play for her and Paul Meurisse called Carola, about an affair between a French actress and a German general during the occupation. Although Darrieux was quite willing to perform it, the project failed to materialise. (It was later produced as a television play starring Leslie Caron and Mel Ferrer.) Darrieux embarked on a prestigious postwar career, which included the three Ophüls masterpieces. She starred in Claude Autant-Lara’s sparkling adaptation of the Feydeau farce Occupe-Toi d’Amélie (Keep an Eye on Amelia, 1949) as a Parisian cocotte, dividing her favours among three men. The film incurred local bans in Britain and enraged American critics who, in the moralistic climate of the times, considered it lewd and immoral. Darrieux’s worldly reputation got her cast as an independent woman who had deserted her Texan husband many years before for the more sophisticated Parisian life in the MGM musical Rich, Young and Pretty (1951). Jane Powell played her daughter on a visit to Paris, understandably dazzled by her mother. The highlights of the film are Darrieux’s duet with Fernando Lamas, We Never Talk Much, and her rendition of There’s Danger in Your Eyes, Chérie. She made an impression in another American film, Joseph L Mankiewicz’s witty espionage thriller 5 Fingers (1952), as a down-and-out countess, attractive but duplicitous, who becomes entangled with a spy (James Mason). Back in France, she was a superb Madame de Rénal in Autant-Lara’s Le Rouge et le Noir (The Red and the Black, 1954), sexually involved with Julien Sorel (Gérard Philipe), her children’s tutor. She was a natural to star in Lady Chatterley’s Lover (1955), and was seduced by Philipe again in Pot Bouille (The House of Lovers, 1957), Julien Duvivier’s stylish adaptation from Zola’s novel of snobbery and ambition among the bourgeoisie. In between, she stood around glumly as Olympias, the mother of Alexander, in Alexander the Great (1956), Robert Rossen’s dour epic starring Richard Burton in a blond wig. In the next decades, Darrieux was more often seen on television than on the big screen, but turned up in films from time to time to remind international audiences of her appealing presence. Among these were Jacques Demy’s Les Demoiselles de Rochefort (The Young Girls of Rochefort, 1967), in which she was the mother, Yvonne, being courted by Monsieur Dame (Michel Piccoli), though marriage to him would make her Madame Dame; and 24 Hours in a Woman’s Life (1968), based on Stefan Zweig’s short story, in which she played a society widow who encounters a handsome young man at a casino in an Italian resort in 1914. In 1970, she replaced Katharine Hepburn on Broadway in the musical Coco. Although she was far more suitable than Hepburn in the role of the Parisian couturier Coco Chanel, and got good reviews, audience attendance diminished. It was, after all, 14 years since her last Hollywood film. But Darrieux remained one of the biggest and brightest stars in France, bringing class to mostly mediocre material. Some bright exceptions were François Ozon’s 8 Women (2002), an amusing all-female whodunnit, and Demy’s Une Chambre en Ville (A Room in Town, 1982) a romance in which Darrieux, the only undubbed lead, played a wealthy, tippling landlady. She provided the voice of the grandmother in the animated feature Persepolis (2007), and her last film was Pièce Montée (The Wedding Cake, 2010), a family comedy in which Darrieux played a glamorous grandmother. Her marriage to Rubirosa ended in divorce in 1947, and the following year she married the author Georges Mitsinkidès. He died in 1991. Their son, Mathieu, also predeceased her. • Danielle Darrieux, actor, born 1 May 1917; died 17 October 2017 This article was amended on 23 October 2017.

Train operator Great Western Railway said on Thursday the first two trains in the £5.7bn fleet were not carrying passengers while technical faults that emerged on a disastrous maiden journey this week were being worked on. The development is another PR blow for GWR, for Hitachi, which makes the trains, and for the government, which has claimed investment in the new trains shows it is putting passengers at the heart of its rail policy. On Monday the first of the Hitachi Class 800 trains, carrying dignitaries including the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, onboard, arrived in London 41 minutes late. Some passengers had to stand, an air-conditioning unit sprang a leak, and there were problems with an IT router and an air valve. On Tuesday many commuters travelling from the south-west of England to London experienced delays or cancellations because of a rock fall near Bristol – nothing to do with the new engines but an unfortunate coincidence. On Thursday passengers were unamused to find more problems with the IETs. A tweet from @GWRHelp explained: “I’ve been advised that there’s been a technical issue and Hitachi engineers are currently working to resolve the matter.” A spokesman for GWR added: “It’s not a single technical issue, but in order to fix some of the initial issues we saw on Monday, the computer system software on the trains has been updated at the depot. We want to make sure those changes are effective, and the trains are running on the network today to test they’ve worked. We hope to put them back into passenger services ASAP.” The spokesman said there were also some technical issues on Tuesday and Wednesday but nothing that stopped them carrying passengers. He added: “This week, they’ve successfully covered around 4,000 miles in normal traffic.” A Hitachi spokesperson said: “The trains are expected to be running again as soon as possible, after we’ve fully tested some improvements made overnight to the passenger experience.” Craig McCrum, head of sales at a London tech startup and one of those on the first train on Monday, was unimpressed. He said: “It’s disappointing that there appears to be ongoing faults with these much-hyped trains. This just further compounds my lack of confidence in GWR to be able to deliver anything close to a reliable service. “It is time for somebody to do something about this ongoing shocking service. The amount of disgruntled customers is growing by the day and GWR must be held accountable.” The bimodal trains operate on diesel and electric power and have allowed the government to brazen out the controversial decision to scrap electrification projects, leaving stretches of tracks unwired. By the end of 2019, 93 new IETs will replace existing services. GWR said they would provide a faster and more comfortable service."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/20/good-grief-danger-mouse-and-duckula-star-in-cosgrove-hall-animation-exhibition","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Good grief!

Danger Mouse and Duckula star in animation exhibition","bodyText":"The world’s only vegetarian vampire and an eyepatch-wearing, mystery-solving mouse are celebrated in a new exhibition that pays tribute to one of Britain’s most successful animation studios. Count Duckula, who shunned meat after being resurrected with ketchup instead of blood, and Danger Mouse, the world’s greatest secret agent, are two of the stars of a new show exploring the work of Cosgrove Hall, an independent animation company based in Manchester. In its heyday Cosgrove Hall was the biggest animation studio in Europe. Its programmes were shown all over the world, both original productions such as Danger Mouse, which ran for 161 episodes, plus remakes of Bill and Ben, the Flower Pot Men; Noddy and Postman Pat. The exhibition, at the Waterside arts centre in Sale, Greater Manchester, marks the opening of the Cosgrove Hall archive. It has been saved from destruction with the help of a Heritage Lottery Fund grant after languishing in an old pie factory in what is now Media City, the BBC’s Salford home. Visitors are greeted by a human-sized model of Igor, Count Duckula’s butler, who could not hide his disgust at his boss’s plant-based diet. The show also includes models and props made for Wind in the Willows, another Cosgrove Hall hit from the 1980s. Gilt-framed miniature portraits of Toad of Toad Hall, which were hung in the childish toad’s grand residence, are on display along with one of his costumes - an Eskimo outfit, complete with tennis racquet snow shoes. They were donated by Brian Cosgrove, who opened the studio in 1976 in Chorlton, south Manchester, with his illustrator friend, Mark Hall. The suburb provided the name for another of the pair’s best-loved stop-motion animations, Chorlton and the Wheelies. The show reveals some of the tricks of the trade, such as putting the puppets on wheels because it made animation far easier. For the same reason, the show’s baddie, Fenella the Witch, did not walk but simply sank into the ground and regenerated elsewhere on set when she needed to move. Cosgrove has also donated some of the many thousands of hand-drawn animation celluloids or “cels”, which he has been hoarding in his barn in Cheshire. For shows such as Danger Mouse, each second of animation required 12 subtly different frames, each drawn by hand on a transparent sheet of acetate. It was a laborious but ultimately rewarding process, insists Cosgrove, who is 83 and still draws regularly as he tries to find a publisher for a series of illustrated children’s books. “People thought animators must be mad. They came in at 9.30am and were often still there until 10pm, drawing the same characters over and over again, all day. Then they would come in the next day and do exactly the same all over again. The view was there must be a certain madness there. “But if you’re an animator and you see those drawings filmed and coloured with a voice on, it pays you back for all that madness. Suddenly you’ve created something special, but it’s a strange profession,” he said ahead of the Waterside opening on Friday. One of the exhibits is a cel of Penfold, Danger Mouse’s hamster sidekick, running away from danger. Perennially frightened Penfold, a useless crime fighter but loyal friend, was inadvertently based on Cosgrove’s brother, Dennis, then editor of the northern Sunday Express. “Dennis was also bald and had thick, black rimmed glasses,” said Cosgrove, who made his brother a Penfold model to put on his desk, complete with a plaque saying “Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.” Animation City presents: The Cosgrove Hall Films exhibition opens on 20 October and runs until 17 February 2018 at Waterside, Sale, M33 7ZF"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global/2017/oct/24/guardian-weekly-letters-trump-iran","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T10:59:22Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 27 October 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/oct/24/guardian-weekly-letters-trump-iran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2017/oct/24/guardian-weekly-letters-trump-iran","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 27 October 2017","bodyText":"Global community must act Julian Borger’s piece (Europe’s leaders bypass Trump to salvage Iran deal, 13 October) was insightful. I hope there will be more such independent action by European countries and others. Donald Trump may well be only playing tough brinkmanship in order to contain North Korea and Iran, but his dangerous words and actions risk going over the edge. I have no sympathy for the brutal regimes in North Korea, Iran and Syria; people suffering under the rule of such repressive governments should be given our utmost support. But the problems posed by North Korea aren’t going to be solved by Trump’s crude methods. In fact, Trump’s appalling activities could easily result in some minor incident setting off a major conflict. As the world situation has become very precarious, it is now vital that the international community get involved. We are in urgent need of saner and wiser leadership. It’s time for everyone to do something to avert a dreadful catastrophe. Steven Katsineris Hurstbridge, Victoria, Australia No safety in nuclear weapons John Mullan notes that Kazuo Ishiguro is the rightful winner of the Nobel prize in literature (13 October). The same can be said of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican) winning the Nobel peace prize. Ican originated in Melbourne, Australia, in 2007 as an initiative of the Medical Association for Prevention of War (MAPW). It is the first Nobel peace prize to have its roots in Australia, as noted by Ican’s national vice-president, Dr Sue Wareham, who was motivated to join MAPW two decades ago because of her “horror at the destructive capacity of a single nuclear weapon”. It beggars belief that the Australian government fails to grasp the essential truth that motivated Wareham: that a single nuclear weapon has enormous destructive capacity. Nuclear weapons worsen national security, not enhance it. Jenny Goldie Michelago, Australia Livestock farming has a role Caution is required when advocating the demise of livestock farming (George Monbiot, 13 October) because many of the planet’s dryland inhabitants derive their living from grazing. Nomadic pastoralists are dependent on animal husbandry not just for sustenance but as part of their culture. Harvesting animals that harvest native vegetation is a sustainable method of acquiring protein from areas of low productivity, when it is carefully managed. Switching to crops is fraught with difficulties, including unpredictable rainfall, soil erosion, the high costs of irrigation and other hazards experienced by farmers anywhere. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment tells us that 41% of Earth’s land surface is dryland and that 2 billion people live there. That is a lot of people and land to write off. Andrew Beattie Westleigh, NSW, Australia Nationalism is a menace As a Spaniard and non-nationalist Basque, I appreciated your sensitive take on the Catalan problem but was dismayed by Neal Ascherson’s column (Catalans are riding the independence wave, 29 September). He fails to distinguish between the sense of social belonging and nationalism: that ugly sentiment with roots in our tribal past, which makes us feel different from our neighbours, usually superior and insensitive to their predicament. For Ascherson, nationalism breaks even in its vices and virtues, as he apparently forgets the thousands of European deaths it has caused. He suggests that Catalonia felt Madrid was treating it as a colony: in fact it has a high level of autonomy that has been used to fuel unrest with its control of education and media, as shown by the rapid increase of aggrieved Catalan feelings. Even so, recent opinion polls fell short of a majority for independence. The EU has said that the Catalan independence movement runs counter to the European project, but Ascherson thinks “the global tide is with them”. Maybe it was illusory to think Europe was getting over its tribal past. Anton Digon Vitoria, Spain Briefly • It was distressing to read (Japan forced to face brutal work culture, 13 October) that in its first white paper the Japanese government said that 20% of employees were at risk of death from overwork, more than 2,000 from suicide due to stress and many more from illness brought on by spending too much time at work. This government paper goes on to state that more than 80 hours of overtime per month starts to pose a serious risk to health and life. It was damnably shocking to read that prime minister Shinzo Abe’s government proposes to cap monthly overtime at 100 hours, ie 20 hours more than the serious risk. Axel Brock-Miller Langford, British Columbia, Canada • The time is right for the UK to opt out of the European community (20 October). So what next? In this time of complex relationships, it might not be best for the UK to go it alone. The way forward might well be a closer relationship with Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland. There is much that holds these four nations together, and much they could share with the UK. To give one example: the benefit of maritime trade via the Baltic, North and Norwegian seas. The UK’s close transatlantic link with the United States could also benefit the Scandinavian nations.

On Wednesday the FA apologised to Aluko and her Chelsea team-mate Drew Spence for racially discriminatory remarks on Sampson’s part. The former England manager was described as having made unacceptably “ill-judged attempts at humour” by the investigating barrister Katharine Newton, who nonetheless did not conclude that he was racist. The 30-year-old Aluko, who has 102 caps, has not played for England since 2016 but Marley, previously England’s Under-19 coach, is adamant she intends to pursue an open‑door policy. “I’ve only been in the post 10 days but in those 10 days we’ve had talent spotters out assessing everybody available to play for England,” she said as her squad trained in northern France on Thursday before Friday night’s friendly against Les Bleues in Valenciennes. “It’s not just about one player, there’s a lot of good young talent out there and we want to find players playing regularly and doing well for their clubs who can help us get to the World Cup finals here in France in 2019 and, more importantly, go from No3 in the world to No1. I want to give everybody an opportunity to be part of that.” Asked if that meant a potential chance for Aluko should the striker perform well for Chelsea, Marley replied: “Yes, 100%, that’s the way I work. If a player’s getting good talent reports I’m in a position where I can look at that.” This season Aluko has been selected mainly as a substitute by Chelsea and will evidently need to re-establish herself as a regular in Emma Hayes’s team. Given Aluko’s criticism of England’s players for racing to embrace Sampson after Nikita Parris scored the opening goal of their 6-0 World Cup qualifying win against Russia at Prenton Park last month, any recall would also be politically loaded. The striker’s response, delivered via Twitter, was scathing: “For the most together team in the world tonight’s ‘message’ only shows a level of disrespect that represents division and selfish action,” she wrote. Marley, meanwhile, submitted her application to become England’s new manager before Tuesday’s deadline. The 50-year-old, who assisted Hope Powell, Sampson’s predecessor, has agreed to take charge of next month’s World Cup qualifiers against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kazakhstan and is regarded as a favourite to secure the role permanently in January. A holder of the pro-licence coaching qualification and a former Everton women’s manager, Marley ticks a lot of boxes and, significantly, worked with every member of the current senior squad at under-19 level. Yet if the FA regards the next three games as an audition, she sees the experience as an opportunity to gauge whether she really wants the role. “I get a trial run to see how it works but it’s about finding the best person for the job,” said Marley. “It’s been a difficult time for the players but so far I’m really enjoying it, having worked with them in the past there’s a familiarity which helps. If they want to say something to me, they’ll talk openly.” Even so she admits the departure of the popular Sampson, who led England to two major semi-finals, had hit her squad hard. Some players are said to be “shattered” by their former mentor’s exit. “They’re strong, independent women who know how and when to focus on football but it’s been really difficult for everybody,” Marley said. “When you work with people, and people are part of the team for such a long time, you build up personal relationships. “With changed management there are so many different emotions and it’s for me to help manage that, understand where people are at – but also help them focus on the new beginning which is Friday. “I’ve made it clear that now it’s about how can we work together to get through this and put in a great performance against France.” It will not be easy as Les Bleues are eager to impress a new manager of their own. Corinne Diacre, the ground-breaking former coach of Clermont Foot men in Ligue Two has succeeded Olivier Echouafni, sacked in the wake of his side’s Euro 2017 1-0 quarter final defeat by Sampson’s side. That was England’s first win against France since 1974 and Diacre’s players are out for revenge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/28/need-literary-festivals-escape-from-emojiland","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-28T07:00:52Z","webTitle":"Do we need literary festivals?

Wife not too pleased. 1961: John Profumo meets and begins affair with Christine Keeler. Wife not too pleased. 2017: I attend inaugural Cliveden Literary Festival. Wife delighted. I have loved literary festivals from the first time I went to Hay-on-Wye in the 1980s and sat in a pub garden discussing narrative technique with four other writers and an audience of one. University had been a letdown. No Gitanes-fuelled têtes-à-têtes with Sartre and de Beauvoir (and me as Camus) on the Boulevard Saint-Germain; no absinthe nights talking symbolism with Baudelaire and Rimbaud; just cycling to lectures in the rain and being in bed with a hot chocolate by 11pm. Now at last, at a pub in Hay, I was exchanging ideas with men and women of letters for whom the impersonal discussion of a line of poetry was very heaven. The Hay festival has since grown into a Byzantium, but that excitement remains. There are few sights more cheering, in a naughty world, than crowds of readers tramping across a field carrying books, some even by writers of adult fiction. There are worse ways of measuring out the year than going from literary festival to literary festival – Jaipur to Bath to Hay to Edinburgh to Mantova to Cheltenham and now to Cliveden – whether you’re there to listen or to speak. For the writer, it’s a revelation to see your words materialise and wing their way across a room, giving that disinterested pleasure that’s the only justification for writing in the first place. The Cliveden festival is remarkable, all considerations of architecture and landscape apart, for having arrived in the world fully formed. First it wasn’t, then it was. You look out over the marvellously engineered gardens into country you hardly recognise, and count your blessings. For this isn’t just about being far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife. Where we celebrate the word, we celebrate freedom from the aggressive illiteracy and factionalism that have become the mark of our times. Beyond is Emojiland, where the undead exchange malicious tweets with their own shadows, gibber and squeak in spite and envy, hate what they cannot comprehend, rail at what they do not have the eyes to see, the ears to hear or the intelligence to read, and deposit malignant rumours like dirty needles where others as bitter as themselves might find and pass them on. Do we need more literary festivals? You might as soon ask if we need clean air."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/oct/19/love-island-for-pensioners-which-shows-could-benefit-from-ditching-young-people","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T12:51:37Z","webTitle":"Love Island for pensioners: which shows could benefit from ditching young people?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/oct/19/love-island-for-pensioners-which-shows-could-benefit-from-ditching-young-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/oct/19/love-island-for-pensioners-which-shows-could-benefit-from-ditching-young-people","fields":{"headline":"Love Island for pensioners: which shows could benefit from ditching young people?","bodyText":"Very rarely does the television industry come up with a truly good idea. That said, it may have accidentally stumbled across one. The Dutch version of The Voice is about to make a spin-off series dedicated solely to pensioners. The Voice Senior will consist of a handful of episodes, none broadcast live, that will feature only contestants aged 65 or over. And, honestly, it sounds like the best possible version of The Voice. Based on statistics alone, the standard version of the show is a dud, with none of the winners going on to achieve a meaningful career in music. Meanwhile, The Voice Kids comes with the horrible tang of exploitation, since its contestants are unable to process the level of rejection that participation requires. However, if all the contestants are retired, everything changes. The likelihood is that they will be entering purely for the joy of singing. They will have no expectations, and none of the sweaty desperation of their younger counterparts. The whole thing will be about the elderly having fun. It sounds like an absolute blast. Hopefully, The Voice Senior will be replicated around the world. To be frank, the entire landscape of unscripted talent-show television – chock-full of identical, hoary franchises all content with spinning their wheels to ever-diminishing returns – needs a boot up the rear, and, by God, the elderly are the people to deliver it. The more I think about it, the more I believe that most shows (with the possible exception of The Jump) would be truly galvanised by OAP spin-off versions. Let me walk you through some ideas. Love Island Unlike First Dates, which does include its fair share of the elderly, Love Island is focused solely on the lunk-headed buffoonery of youth. This is one hell of a missed opportunity. A full series where all the strutting, hair-gelled, horny, twentysomething morons were jettisoned in favour of a selection of people who had already had their hearts broken by divorce or bereavement and just wanted to find a moment or two of meaningful companionship would be a tremendous, life-affirming piece of television. The Apprentice Depending on how kind you are being, The Apprentice lives to serve one of two functions. The first is to find genuinely capable businesspeople and celebrate their ingenuity. If that is the case, then it is only logical to make a series where all the candidates have built up a lifetime of knowledge and wisdom. The Apprentice’s second function is to locate and promote a series of dreadful rightwing, reactionary Katie Hopkins-style wingnuts, and anyone who has ever been home for Christmas knows that these aren’t exactly in short supply among older people. Either way, it is a win-win. The X Factor If anything, The X Factor would benefit from a senior version even more than The Voice, purely on the basis that pensioners are much less likely to put up with any of Simon Cowell’s nonsense. Imagine one of your grandparents taking part in the six-chair challenge. Imagine how quickly they would realise that life was simply too short to spend squabbling in such a gladiatorial bear pit. They would naff off as soon as Nicole Scherzinger starting pulling a faux-agonised face, wouldn’t they? It would be brilliant. I would be much more keen to watch The X Factor if none of the contestants was invested in the show’s bullshit machinations. Big Brother Imagine a version of Big Brother where the contestants had long grown out of wanting to peacock for the cameras. Imagine a version of Big Brother where the contestants had figured out how to stem domestic flare-ups before they became unmanageable. Imagine a version of Big Brother where the contestants actually knew how to run a household. That’s the version of Big Brother I would like to watch. Admittedly, in Channel 5’s hands, they would probably just turn it into a live-feed of a nursing home, full of people shouting frail non-sequiturs over full-volume Police Interceptor repeats, so maybe we should rule this one out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"careers/2017/oct/20/what-i-wish-i-could-tell-my-boss-you-were-a-monster","type":"article","sectionId":"careers","sectionName":"Guardian Careers","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"What I wish I could tell my boss: 'You were a monster'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/oct/20/what-i-wish-i-could-tell-my-boss-you-were-a-monster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/careers/2017/oct/20/what-i-wish-i-could-tell-my-boss-you-were-a-monster","fields":{"headline":"What I wish I could tell my boss: 'You were a monster'","bodyText":"I wanted to like you.

Occasionally, you crack a joke, and everyone laughs as though they find it funny. I soon started to become angry. In our second meeting you told me that you’d become bored, that no job was safe and asked me to pitch to you my position in the company.

This school allowed me to think bigger.” Around us, in the graffitied courtyard of a high school in Aranjuez – formerly the most notorious of Medellín’s barrios – kids of all ages mill about. Bass spills from the adjoining classrooms. In one room, an exasperated teacher is leading infants in a warm-up; in another, teens are being marshalled in breakdancing exercises with the intensity of a military drill. Upstairs, a group of twentysomethings contort to a remix of Notorious BIG’s Kick in the Door. Every night, this school is taken over by one of Colombia’s best known hip-hop groups, Crew Peligrosos. They offer underprivileged kids the chance to learn the four elements of hip-hop – breakdance, DJing, rap and graffiti – as an alternative to a life of gang affiliation. Though Pérez is the only female member of Crew Peligrosos, roughly 40% of the 600 students at the school, called 4 Elementos Skuela, are girls. “The Skuela teaches us to trust and believe in ourselves,” says Pérez. “Not only does it increase our strength and our skills, it also puts us in a new social position where we are capable of doing everything we set out to. It creates a new system in which women are secure in themselves and believe they can stand out in any activity.” After moving to Medellín 10 years ago from nearby San Carlos, Pérez came across one of the crew’s public performances. “I was blown away by the show,” she recalls. “I saw one girl performing and thought, that could be me.” Since the 80s the city has undergone a meteoric transformation, branded “the Medellín Miracle”. Once notorious as the world’s murder capital – in 1991 there were 6,349 killings, a homicide rate of 380 per 100,000 citizens – it now attracts international tourism and last year won the prestigious Lee Kuan Yew world city prize. Part of the credit goes to former mayor Sergio Fajardo who, from 2004-2007, implemented a bottom-up regeneration plan aimed at the city’s poorest neighbourhoods. The unsung heroes, however, were a nascent generation of hip-hop collectives who didn’t just denounce drugs and violence, but started social-development initiatives: street-art projects, arts festivals and educational programmes for children. As well as 4 Elementos, Medellín now boasts hip-hop schools in San Javier (Casa Kolacho) and Guayabal (La Gran Colombia), both of which teach around 400 kids. “The hip-hop culture in Medellín has been a key piece in the construction of the city’s collective imagination,” says Lina Botero, Medellín’s secretary of culture. “Many young people in the city’s most troubled neighbourhoods found in music, dance or graffiti a way of living outside the circles of violence and poverty to which they were destined.” Though hard to quantify, it is clear that the schools filled a huge new appetite for positive change. Soon after starting life in one memeber’s house, 4 Elementos was overflowing with eager students. The local high school offered up a classroom, and when that too was filled to capacity, Crew Peligrosos were handed the keys to the entire building on a nightly basis. To date, more than 4,000 young people have attended, some coming every day. All 22 members of Crew Peligrosos teach at the school and contribute 10% of their salaries towards running costs. The classes are free, there is no age limit and every student has the chance to represent Crew Peligrosos in public if they develop their skills to a sufficient level. “From 5-10pm every day we have the local kids here creating, creating, creating – trying to improve themselves,” says founder Henry Arteaga, known as JKE. “Previously they would have been out there destroying themselves and the neighbourhood. Hip-hop gave them an alternative.” Arteaga was inspired to found Crew Peligrosos in 1999 after seeing the film Beat Street, about the birth of hip-hop culture in the Bronx. “Those tourists who come here to do the Pablo Escobar tours have no idea what it was like back then,” he says. As they trained in the streets of Aranjuez, the group found many of the kids were keen to join in, and quickly saw the potential. “Our goal was to develop the person, rather than just the artist,” says Arteaga. The murder rate in Aranjuez has fallen 80% in the time since 4 Elementos began. Although a number of factors are involved, the school now organises presentations, countrywide tours and an annual festival where the students can share their new skills with a wider audience. Assisted by the Miami-based ABC Foundation, Crew Peligrosos are opening new branches in the barrios of Palmitas, Manrique, San Cristóbal and El Retiro. It is a model that has found success in other countries. In Venezuela, Hip Hop Revolución runs 31 schools aimed at turning teenagers into community leaders. In South Africa, the rapper Emile Jansen has led Heal the Hood, a school aiming to give the youth of Cape Town’s notorious Cape Flats district an alternative to gang life, since 2005. But progress is not the same as panacea. Arteaga bemoans the widespread use of the “Medellín Miracle” narrative to whitewash the city’s ongoing gang troubles. He recounts a turf war that broke out in the barrio two years ago, which resulted in 27 killings in one day yet went widely unreported. Nevertheless, Crew Peligrosos remain undaunted in their mission. Asked whether she’s craving hip-hop stardom, Pérez says: “No – I want to teach. I want to help this school become international, in order to give kids all over the world the same opportunity I’ve had.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/19/czech-republic-andrej-babis-billionaire-agrofert-populism","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T11:00:54Z","webTitle":"Czechs tipped to join populist surge in Europe by electing billionaire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/19/czech-republic-andrej-babis-billionaire-agrofert-populism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/19/czech-republic-andrej-babis-billionaire-agrofert-populism","fields":{"headline":"Czechs tipped to join populist surge in Europe by electing billionaire","bodyText":"Czech Republic is poised to join Europe’s lurch towards anti-establishment populism by electing as its prime minister a controversial billionaire who faces criminal fraud charges and accusations of communist-era secret police links. Andrej Babiš, 63, whose estimated $4.1bn (£3.1bn) fortune makes him the country’s second-richest man, could become the latest politician to drive a wedge between the continent’s east and west if he wins the parliamentary election this week. Opinion polls suggest the tycoon’s party, ANO (yes), will emerge as the biggest force after voters go to the polls on Friday and Saturday for an election held over two days, a legacy from communist times. That would put Slovakian-born Babiš in pole position to become prime minister heading a coalition, despite question marks over his past and warnings that he could threaten Czech democracy through his business empire. It also raises the prospect of Czech Republic joining neighbouring Hungary and Poland in being in conflict with the EU over alleged democratic violations. Prague is already at odds with Brussels for refusing to accept relocated migrants, triggering EU infringement proceedings. At the heart of Babiš’s message is a pledge to “run the state like a business”, a concept he has suggested could be furthered by halving the number of MPs in the Czech chamber of deputies to 100 and abolishing the upper chamber. Despite ANO’s official positioning as a centrist, liberal, pro-EU party promoting greater “efficiency”, Babiš has championed popular Czech concerns over Europe’s migration crisis, giving a series of hardline speeches against immigration in provincial areas, where anti-foreigner feelings often run high. With the current coalition leaders, the Social Democratic party (ČSSD), pledging not to serve in his government, Babiš may have to turn to fringe parties hostile to the EU and immigration. The election comes less than two weeks after Czech investigators charged Babiš, who entered politics in 2011 styling himself as an anti-corruption crusader, with fraud over nearly €2m (£1.8m) in EU funds given to a luxury hotel and conference complex, Čapí Hnízdo (Stork’s Nest), deep in the Bohemian countryside, 33 miles (40km) south of Prague. The money was intended to aid small businesses. But investigators allege that it was obtained illegally because the complex belonged to Babiš’s vast Agrofert conglomerate, which is made up of about 230 companies and employs 32,000 people, and should therefore not have qualified. Olaf, the European commission’s anti-fraud unit, is also examining the case, which Babiš has dismissed as politically motivated. Forming a governing coalition could enable Babiš to dodge the Czech prosecution by restoring his parliamentary immunity, which MPs voted to lift last month. The Czech president, Miloš Zeman, a close ally, could also issue a pardon, which Babiš would be constitutionally required to sign if he were prime minister. More worrying, critics say, is the concentration of power that Babiš would secure. In 2014, when he was finance minister in the outgoing government, Babiš acquired two of Czech Republic’s leading newspapers. Lenka Zlámalová, a commentator at Echo 24, who has investigated Babiš’s business interests, said: “If you combine media power, economic power and security power, the threat is clear. “If he takes responsibility for the intelligence services and control of the tax authority, it will be really dangerous. He can use it against his competitors. “His company is the biggest receiver of state and EU funds in Czech Republic. He receives about £1m more in subsidies a year than he pays in taxes. It’s really dangerous to combine politics and business in this way. Imagine if Theresa May was the biggest receiver of state or EU money in Britain.” Babiš, the son of a senior Communist party official, has attempted to sidestep the issue by putting Agrofert, holdings of which include fertiliser, chemical and food companies, as well as fertility clinics, into a trust company. Other questions have been raised about his activities under communism in what was Czechoslovakia. According to files in state archives, he was recruited as an agent by the secret police, the ŠtB. A dozen files suggest he operated under the codename Bures while in his official capacity as an employee of a state trading company, which allowed him to travel abroad. Slovakia’s constitutional court reopened the issue last week by overturning a lower court’s 2014 ruling that had effectively cleared him. Babiš had promised to challenge the latest verdict and argued that the secret police files identifying him were falsified and he cooperated only under duress, an explanation dismissed by experts as bogus. Radek Schovánek, a Czech defence ministry specialist on communist-era files and documents, said: “There were strict internal ŠtB rules on the treatment of files [on] secret collaborators. “They were authenticated and could not be falsified. Babiš was not forced into anything. He was a member of the Communist nomenklatura – the son of a nomenklatura – and his secret police file is typical of hundreds of such people.” Of more current concern is the challenge Babiš represents to democracy in eastern and central Europe. Pavel Šafr, the director of the Forum24 news website, said ANO’s lack of overt ideology presented a more complex challenge than the authoritarian governments of Viktor Orbán in Hungary and Jarosław Kaczyński’s Law and Justice party in Poland. “Orbán is a conservative nationalist with authoritarian attitudes and Kaczyński is a hyper-conservative, Catholic orthodox politician, but they are both within the known European tradition,” he said. “Babiš is not. He isn’t conservative, liberal or communist. He is Babiš, a universal populist. And that’s what makes him not understandable for Europeans.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/19/the-lady-from-the-sea-review-ingenious-ibsen-at-a-rate-of-knots","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T12:10:34Z","webTitle":"The Lady from the Sea review – Nikki Amuka-Bird is superb in Caribbean Ibsen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/19/the-lady-from-the-sea-review-ingenious-ibsen-at-a-rate-of-knots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/19/the-lady-from-the-sea-review-ingenious-ibsen-at-a-rate-of-knots","fields":{"headline":"The Lady from the Sea review – Nikki Amuka-Bird is superb in Caribbean Ibsen","bodyText":"Ibsen can benefit from a change of scene. By transposing the action of this play from 19th-century Norway to a Caribbean island in the 1950s, Elinor Cook’s new version clarifies a familiar text and Kwame Kwei-Armah, soon to take over the helm at the Young Vic, directs it with great panache. Yet as the play rushed past – 100 minutes with no interval – a few nagging doubts began to appear. Cook stays true to the play’s central dilemma: the conflict in the mermaid-like Ellida Wangel between her duty to her devoted doctor husband (played by Finbar Lynch) and her attraction to a mysterious, seagoing Stranger (played by Jake Fairbrother) to whom she was once betrothed. Shifting the story to the Caribbean also does nothing to diminish its potency. Ellida, like most of the characters, feels trapped in an island paradise with the sea as the only escape route. Cook has updated the dialogue with a good deal of ingenuity. Where Ellida, in Michael Meyer’s translation, looks longingly at a big steamer called The Englander, in this version she fantasises about a glamorous yacht owned by a famous Hollywood actor. In Ibsen her bookish stepdaughter, Bolette, dreams of flight in the vaguest terms; here she is offered the tantalising prospect of punting on the river at Oxford in a jaunty boater. Everything here is clear and precise and Nikki Amuka-Bird captures the amphibious nature of Ellida, who is first seen clambering over rocks in a bathing suit and whose instinctive reaction to a crisis is to jump into a standing pool on Tom Scutt’s watery set. Amuka-Bird is particularly good at suggesting that Ellida, while living in a recollected dream, has a sharp-witted contempt for a modern marriage ceremony that reduces women to chattels. Kwei-Armah’s production is excellently acted but goes at such a lick that situations don’t always have room to breathe. A classic case is the amazing scene between Bolette and her former tutor, where a disinterested offer of help turns into a marriage proposal. (I have a distant memory of a very young Vanessa Redgrave – long before she went on to play Ellida – moving in that scene from bright-eyed excitement to weary resignation.) Helena Wilson is here not given time to explore the character’s violent fluctuations of mood.

(See 4.29pm.) With original hopes that the move to phase two would be agreed at today’s summit now quashed, the British government is now very anxious to move the talks on by the end of the year - not least because EU leaders will not agree a transition while the talks are stuck in phase one. Merkel’s words gave Theresa May some cause for optimism as she arrived for the start of the two-day summit. Other EU leaders also struck a relatively upbeat note about the possibility of a breakthrough in December (see 3.34pm, 3.54pm, 3.57pm and 4.46pm), but there were also calls for May to offer more clarity about what the UK is willing to pay the EU as it leaves (see 3.17pm and 4.06pm.) Lloyd Blankfein, the head of Goldman Sachs, has tweeted about spending more time in Frankfurt, where the US investment bank is planning to move UK jobs, in a comment suggesting Brexit will be bad for the City. Jeremy Corbyn has said this highlights the uncertainty the government’s Brexit strategy has created. Commenting on the tweet, Corbyn said: It’s not a good thing if companies of any sort - manufacturing, services or anybody else - are thinking of leaving. This really highlights the uncertainty surrounding the government’s conduct of these negotiations. Damian Green, the first secretary of state, has said the rising level of political abuse is fuelling an “atmosphere of increasing hatred” which threatens to poison democratic politics in Britain. In a speech to the press gallery he said: If mainstream politicians and journalists start to behave like Twitter trolls and conspiracy theorists then democracy is in danger. I do think we need to respect each other motives and treat each other’s views with courtesy. If we don’t we risk feeding an atmosphere of increasing hatred which at the most horrible extremes led to an event like the killing of Jo Cox ... We have in the past few years witnessed a sad and completely ridiculous rise in routine comparisons to Hitler and the Nazis. It is symptomatic not just of a decline, but of a rapidly increasing viciousness in our discourse which is totally out of kilter with what I see day after day in the House of Commons. Even when we are in the chamber or on the media giving it what-for, we need to remember that we are all democratic politicians. What is pernicious is the attempt to portray your political opponents as somehow not quite human. It is the trick of extremists on both sides throughout the ages and we shouldn’t allow it to take hold in this country. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has called for an inquiry into London’s role in global money-laundering, amid concern about UK banks’ exposure to a corruption investigation into ties between South Africa’s wealthy Gupta family and President Jacob Zuma. Nicholas Paget-Brown, the former leader of Kensington and Chelsea council, who quit the post in the face of fierce criticism over the authority’s handling of the Grenfell Tower fire, is to step down as a councillor. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Emmanuel Macron has tweeted some very similar footage. Here is the video of Angela Merkel, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron having a conflab on the way in. Sadly, you can’t hear what they are saying. In his speech in Brussels today to European socialists Jeremy Corbyn used the term “national egotism”. He said: Beyond Europe’s borders we have seen war and climate change drive the mass displacement of people and forced migration; a refugee crisis on a scale not seen since the Second World War, tearing apart communities and families. That in turn is being exploited by some of the ugliest elements in our politics. People who are determined to promote fear and division within our societies. All of this against a backdrop where our world is slipping back towards the threat of global conflict; spurred on by national egotism and neo-imperial ambition. And where human and democratic rights - including freedom of speech - are increasingly coming under pressure on the fringes, and even within the borders of the European Union. These are some of the challenges that face us – and the people we represent. MLex’s Matthew Holehouse says that shows Corbyn is being well briefed. The Swedish government has commissioned research to prepare it for when the Brexit talks move on to the topic of trade, the BBC’s Adam Fleming reports. Earlier this week Bloomberg published a story based on a draft paper from the German foreign ministry showing that the German government is also starting to plan for a UK-EU free trade deal. Donald Tusk, president of the European council, told reporters that he did not expect a breakthrough on Brexit at this summit and that they would have to work “really hard” to get to the position where they could move talks on to phase two in December. He said: I don’t expect any kind of breakthrough ... We have to work really hard between October and December to finalise this so-called first phase. He was also asked if he agreed with the European parliament president Antonio Tajani about the €20bn being offered by Theresa May to the EU being “peanuts”. Tusk replied: I have never seen 20 billion peanuts in my life. This is from the Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskaitė. She is referring to the venue for the summit having to be switched because of toxic kitchen fumes. Joseph Muscat, the Maltese prime minister, has told Sky News that the EU27 want to be “encouraging” towards the UK about the prospect of the Brexit talks progressing to trade issues in December. These are from Sky’s Faisal Islam. Here is the full quote from Angela Merkel expressing hope that the Brexit talks can progress to the trade negotiation phase in December. She said: Tomorrow we will also discuss the question of Great Britain’s exit. There has been progress. Michel Barnier will tell us more about that. From where we are now, it [progress] is not sufficient enough to enter the second phase, but it is encouraging to move on with the work so that we can reach the second phase in December ... I want to keep on doing these negotiations in good spirit and at the same time taking into account and respecting the wish of the British people to leave the EU but also maintaining a good relationship between Great Britain and the EU. I’ve taken the quote from Politico Europe. This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. @Grybauskaite_LT is the Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskaitė. Angela Merkel has reaffirmed that Brexit negotiations could move onto trade by the end of the year, in remarks that could bolster the position of Theresa May. December is the crunch deadline when EU leaders will judge whether the UK has made “sufficient progress” on the divorce issues that will allow Brexit talks to progress to trade. The EU’s 27 leaders are expected to announce on Friday they will launch internal discussions on the future relationship with the UK, without the participation of the British government. Arriving at the summit, the German chancellor said there were “encouraging” signs that talks on trade could begin after the next EU summit in December, putting her seal of approval on the established EU position. The upbeat tone was echoed by Luxembourg’s prime minister Xavier Bettel. He said: We were friends, we are friends and we still will be friends. I am sure we will find an agreement. He noted the change in tone between May’s speeches, including her latest outreach to EU citizens. “Times change and even Theresa May’s Facebook post went in the right direction.” French president Emmanuel Macron chose to emphasise the unity of the EU27, as he arrived at the summit. He said EU’s unity was “very strong on Brexit”, adding that “we are all united behind one same negotiator Michel Barnier”. Shortly before the summit began, footage showed the British prime minister in earnest conversation with Merkel and Macron. The prime minister has repeatedly attempted to go over the heads of the EU’s Brexit negotiators, by appealing to European leaders to jump start the talks. Earlier this week, Downing Street tacitly admitted this gambit had failed when it signed up to a joint Brussels statement that “both sides agreed that [Brexit] would be discussed in the “framework agreed between the EU27 and the United Kingdom”. Finland’s prime minister Juha Sipilӓ said he hoped to see progress onto trade in December, once the three divorce issues (EU citizens’ rights, money and Ireland) had been resolved. He said: Of course we are a little bit frustrated about the progress but hopefully we can be in that position [to discuss trade] in December. Asked whether the EU should plan for a no-deal Brexit, he said: “Not yet”. Like Angela Merkel (see 2.56pm), the Finnish prime minister Juha Sipila also expressed the hope that the Brexit talks would be able to move on to phase two, the future trade negotiation, in December. He said: I hope we can decide the next phase in December’s meeting, but today we are not in that position. Phil Hogan, the Irish European commissioner, said this week that the UK was “now so close to the cliff edge of a hard Brexit that we can see the drop almost in front of us.” Arriving at the EU summit, Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said he did not agree. “I think we have a way to go yet,” he said. Brexit does not happen until April 2019. We are quite far back from the cliff edge at this stage. But it’s incumbent on the EU prime ministers and presidents to ensure that we don’t sleepwalk towards that cliff and that substantially more progress is made in the next couple of months. We are well away from the cliff. But Varadkar also said that althought progress had been made on the Irish border, it was “just not enough”. Language isn’t enough. If the UK is leaving the European Union it is on them to put forward detailed proposals to ensure that things remain much the same. That is at the core of the conflict with the position that the UK is taking. Varadkar also said he was optimistic of more common ground in the Brexit talks by next month, the Press Association reports. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has said the UK will do “very well”, even if it has to leave the EU with no trade deal. Speaking to reporters after a meeting in London with Mexican foreign minister Luis Videgaray Caso, he said: I think that we will get a deal and it will be a great deal and a great Brexit but with any negotiation you’ve got to be prepared to walk away. And we are going to be prepared to do that and, as Luis has said, I think we’ll do fine but we’ll also be able to develop our relations with Mexico and that’s very exciting as well. Asked if Britain would be fine if no deal is reached with the EU, he replied: We have to prepare for every eventuality, and as our esteemed guest Luis Videgaray has said, we will come through it very well whatever happens. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, told reporters at the EU summit it should be a priority for Britain to come up with a clear proposal on the bill they will have to pay when they leave the European Union in 2019, Reuters reports. The Reuters report goes on: Rutte said it was the key to progressing, as Britain desperately wants, to the next phase of Brexit talks about the future trade and security relationship. When he had a phone call with his counterpart Theresa May last week Rutte said he’d told her: “’Listen, we need more clarity specifically about the bill.’” Only if there is clarity on the bill is there “a chance for the statements today and tomorrow to be leaning more towards the British,” Rutte said as he walked into the summit. Rutte said he would prefer to be offered a definite sum, with estimates varying from €20bn to three times as much. “I’d prefer a sum, so we can negotiate about it. But if this is asking too much, then at least have a proposal how to get to a sum. But even that, she hasn’t been able to produce,” he said. And Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said there were there were “encouraging” signs that the Brexit talks could move on to the subject of the future trade relationship as early as December. According to the Press Association, as Merkel arrived at the summit she said enough progress had been made to encourage her to think it would be possible to “take the work forward and then reach the start of the second phase in December”. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said the EU27 were united in their stance on Brexit as he arrived at the EU summit. He said: This European council will be marked by a message of unity. Unity in the Brexit discussions because we are all united on how things stand, the interests we have and our ambitions, behind one negotiator. These are from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. This is from Lloyd Blankfein, the global head of Goldman Sachs. He is saying Brexit is going to be bad for the city ... Theresa May has arrived at the EU summit in Brussels saying she plans to set out “ambitious plans for the weeks ahead” in the Brexit process. (See 1.24pm and 1.32pm.) Sir John Sawers, the former head of MI6, has told peers that Britain may have to invest more after Brexit in defence and diplomacy to maintain its global influence. Otherwise British influence will diminish, he said. (See 1.07pm.) David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has distanced himself from a claim he made in September about the prospect of the UK paying €50bn to leave the EU being “nonsense”. He has also hinted that the government will offer a new concession to the EU regarding the rights of EU nationals living in the UK, specifically related to family reunion rules. (See 11.14am.) Jeremy Corbyn has called on both Theresa May and EU leaders to stop posturing and take steps together to build a new relationship during a speech in Brussels. The UK will inevitably leave the EU without a deal and businesses should start preparing for trade on World Trade Organisation terms, the former cabinet minister Owen Paterson has said. Campaigners for the rights of EU citizens in the UK and British nationals in Europe have said a letter from Theresa May reassuring them they will be allowed to staywhere they are post-Brexit is “meaningless” and a PR exercise aimed at other EU leaders. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has been accused by senior Conservatives MPs of paving the way for “tyranny”, after the government whipped its MPs to abstain on a Labour motion on universal credit. Scotland is set to become the first part of the UK to introduce an outright ban on smacking children, after the Scottish government confirmed it would ensure that a member’s bill to give children equal protection from assault becomes law. Ministers have confirmed in the Lords that an investigation is under way into claims that UK banks could be unwittingly linked to a corruption scandal in South Africa. Labour former cabinet minister Lord Hain has raised concerns with the chancellor that banks including HSBC and Standard Chartered could have acted as “conduits” for laundered money. As the Press Association reports, Treasury spokesman Lord Bates confirmed at question time in the Lords that Hammond had taken immediate action in referring it to the “relevant authorities” so that “justice is done and seen to be done”. LBC has announced that MPs Jacob Rees-Mogg and Chuka Umunna will guest present their morning phone in next week, from 10am to 1pm, on Monday and Tuesday respectively. They are standing in for James O’Brien, who is on holiday. Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, has told Emma Barnett on Radio 5 Live that the EU does not want to do a trade deal with the UK, but that the UK does not realise it yet. He said: Brussels does not want a mutually advantageous deal and London has not realised it ... It is true that Britain crashing out on WTO terms is going to be damaging for many German exporters, Italian winemakers and so on, so it will be mutually disadvantageous. But the fallacy lies in the presumption that those who are conducting the negotiations from Brussels and their political masters in Berlin and Paris, are interested in an economic outcome. They’re not. They’re far more interested in making an example of Britain so that others around the European Union get a lesson that anyone who opposes their authority gets crushed. Even if this comes at the expense of German automobile manufacturers or Italian winemakers. Theresa May has called for “urgency” in reaching an agreement on citizens’ rights, as she arrived at an EU summit in Brussels. The prime minister was one of the first leaders to arrive at the summit, where she said the UK wanted to play a full role in dealing with shared challenges on counter-terrorism, defence and migration. This council isn’t just about our exit negotiations, it’s also about various other really important issues: defence, security, counter-terrorism, migration and I am going to be showing how the UK can continue playing a full role. The summit is not officially about Brexit at all. The formal agenda is dedicated to a host of foreign policy issues: migration, Turkey, the Iran nuclear deal, North Korea. French president Emmanuel Macron has added EU trade policy to the agenda, in a bid to protect French farmers from any future trade deal with South American countries. The British prime minister asked to take the floor to make a point on Brexit, which she is expected to do at the end of dinner. Diplomats said they did not expect EU leaders to give detailed responses to May’s intervention. “I am not surprised [that she wants to speak] because she has no other platform to speak her mind to other EU leaders,” said a senior EU diplomat, who added: “I doubt anybody would want to say anything substantial as a kind of comment or reaction to what she will say.” Another said they were not expecting anything spectacular from the prime minister. “We are not expecting a coup de théâtre.” In her opening remarks May said: This council is about taking stock, it’s also about looking ahead to how we can tackle the challenges that we all share across Europe. That means of course continued cooperation, cooperation that must be at the heart of the strong partnership we want to build together. Asked about Brexit, citizens’ rights was the only issue May referred to directly, with no specific mention of the other ‘divorce’ issues, the disputed question on money or the status of northern Ireland. She referred back to her speech in Florence, which addressed these issues. I set out a few weeks ago in Florence a very bold and ambitious agenda and vision for our future partnership between the eu and the UK at the heart of that remains co-operation on the key issues and dealing with the shared challenges that we face. Theresa May has arrived at the EU summit and as she went in she said it was about “taking stock” and about setting out “ambitious” plans for the weeks ahead. We’ll be looking at the concrete progress that has been made in our exit negotiations, and I’ll be setting out ambitious plans for the weeks ahead. I particularly, for example, want to see an urgency in reaching an agreement on citizens’ rights. But May also stressed that the summit was not just about Brexit. It would cover other issues, and she would show how the UK will continue to play a full role, she said. Asked by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg if she was willing to compromise on her Brexit offer to the EU, May sidestepped the question, and just said spoke about the “ambitious vision” she had already set out in her Florence speech. Sir John Sawers, the former MI6 chief, has told peers that spending on the military, intelligence and diplomacy may have to increase in order to maintain the UK’s influence on the world stage after Brexit. Giving evidence to the Lords EU committee, he said: After Brexit it will be vital that we sustain, in many ways enhance, our investments in diplomacy, defence, intelligence - very high investments are made already - if we want to have an influence in the world of the sort we have had over the last 30 or 40 years. Sawers, who now chairs the consultancy firm Macro Advisory Partners, said the UK could face being forced to rebuild after Brexit in the way it had following the downturn in the 1970s. My biggest concern is the economic impact that Brexit is going to have. Everything I hear from my friends in the City and the investment world suggests that the economic impact of Brexit is going to be quite significant ... In the next five years or so, if I’m right that the economy is going to take a hit, then our influence will diminish in that period ... There is a range of outcomes here. The default outcome is that the UK is poorer and weaker as a result of Brexit. We would have to take specific actions through the negotiations and over the years following Brexit in order to recover that position and demonstrate a new dynamism. Sawers compared the situation to the 1970s after which “we managed to turn that round through the ‘80s, ‘90s and 2000s - it is possible to do that but it will be a major challenge, a national challenge”. At one point Sawers also suggested Brexit might not happen. “Brexit - assuming it goes ahead - will have an impact,” he said. As the Sun reports, that has not gone down well with the pro-Brexit Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. Jeremy Corbyn, in Brussels to meet the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has also been speaking at a conference on the future of socialism, organised by the Italian leader of the socialist bloc in the European parliament, Gianni Pitella. Opening his address, he said: Since the financial crash we have seen years of austerity all across Europe. That was a political choice shaped by ideology that was crippled many parts of out economies. Encouraged the dismantling of our public services and drive down wages and living standards ... It is wrong, unnecessary, it is immoral and it is unacceptable to us as socialists. Corbyn also said that some on the left had been “too willing to defend the status quo and the established order”. He said: Our broken system has provided fertile ground for nationalistic and xenophobic politics ... Unless we offer a clear and radical alternative and credible solutions to the problems people face, unless we offer a chance to change the broken system, unless we offer hope of a more equitable and prosperous future, we are clearing the path for the the far right to make inroads to our communities. The neo-liberal economic model is broken. It doesn’t work for most people. Inequality and low taxes for the riches are hurting our people and the economy as even the IMF acknowledges. Our thinking must become the new consensus. Jeremy Corbyn has said said that failing to reach a trade agreement with the EU would be “catastrophic” for British jobs. Speaking in Brussels in an interview with Sky News, he said: The prime minister seems to have managed to upset just about everybody and have a warring cabinet around her. It is up to her to get the negotiations back on track. We cannot countenance the idea that we just rush headlong into no deal with Europe. No deal with Europe would be very dangerous for employment and jobs in Britain. The idea of no deal would mean that World Trade Organisation rules would be implemented straight away in March 2019. It would be catastrophic for manufacturing industry jobs and we would have real problems all through the economy. I don’t want to see that. I want to see an agreement being reached. We have to realise the seriousness of the situation and the chaos in which our government is operating at the present time. It is a chaos of their own making. The prime minister hosted Bill Clinton for a private meeting at Downing Street, where they primarily discussed Northern Ireland, as well as HIV and Aids. The pair spoke for 45 minutes, but Downing Street said it would not give more details, saying the contents of the discussion were private. Earlier this week, the former US president met DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill outside Belfast. In response to Valerie Vaz, Andrea Leadsom also defended the government’s decision to delay the EU withdrawal bill’s committee stage. There were 300 amendments and 54 new clauses that have been tabled to consider, she said. She said it should be “reassuring” to MPs that the government was looking at them carefully before bringing the legislation back to the Commons. It should be reassuring to the House to know that government is looking very carefully at those amendments and new clauses, to ensure when it does come back to this chamber for its response and for the debate in this chamber - where we have eight days of debate with eight protected hours on each day - that the responses will be well thought through. But I’d like to point out to members across the House who may not be aware of this is there’s nothing odd at all about a pause between second reading and committee of the whole House .. It is with our clear intent, our stated intent to show respect to this House by coming back to it with clear, considered responses to all of those proposals made by honourable members across the House. She also said there was nothing odd about having a lengthy gap between second reading and committee stage for a bill of this kind. She said that there was a six-week gap between second reading and committee stage for the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, and a 10-week gap for the Human Rights Act. Leadsom did not address the point that the EU withdrawal bill is different, because ministers are under pressure get it through parliament fairly quickly to provide businesses with some certainty ahead of Brexit. And, while her claim that ministers are looking at the amendments to the bill “very carefully”, is undoubtedly true, it is not principally a matter of showing “respect” to the Commons. Ministers are taking their time because they are worried about being defeated on key issues. Last month, after the government abstained in two opposition day debates, government sources said this tactic would become the norm for the rest of the parliament. Motions passed after opposition day debates are not binding anyway and, without a majority, the Tory whips cannot be confident of winning. So they have decided they would rather not take part than run the risk of losing these votes narrowly. The following day at business questions, when a Labour MP suggested that boycotting opposition debates was an abuse of process, Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said MPs should not believe everything they read on Twitter. She implied that the news reports about what the government was going to do were wrong. It is now clear that Leadsom’s quasi-denial was misleading. Last night, when the government abstained on the universal credit vote, the Tories effectively confirmed that staying away was their strategy for dealing with opposition day debates. Their tactics generated a big row. (Read the points of order here, at the bottom of the page.) Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, has just challenged Leadsom over this in the Commons. Leadsom responded by claiming that the government was not going to ignore last night’s vote. She said: The government is listening, and has been listening ... I do want to assure colleagues that this House is absolutely being listened to. Leadsom said ministers were responding to concerns raised by MPs about universal credit. But last night’s motion, passed by a majority of 299, said the universal credit rollout should be paused. Ministers are not going to accept this, and Leadsom told MPs just now that the government is not bound by motions passed after opposition day debates. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has just announced the business for next week in the Commons. As expected, the EU withdrawal bill didn’t feature. The government still has not announced when it will return to the Commons to start its committee stage. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has given an interesting interview to various European newspapers. They included Die Welt, who conveniently have posted a transcript in English. Here are the key points. Davis backed away from a claim he made in September about the prospect of Britain paying €50bn to the EU being “nonsense”. When asked if that was still his view, he said: Look, this is a negotiation and we want to resolve this in a way which meets our international obligations. I used that phrase because we don’t think that the legal argument stands up so we do it a different way. But it’s a negotiation and we’re going through the process at the moment of assessing, do the technical work on the commitments. We’ll then make a political judgement on what we think is realistic and sensible. But that’s a judgement that should be informed by everything, informed by the whole deal, not informed by a figure picked out of the air. Davis used the phrase “nonsense” on the Andrew Marr Show on 3 September when asked about a story in the Sunday Times that day (paywall) saying: Theresa May is set to approve a politically explosive Brexit bill of up to £50bn after the Conservative party conference in October in an effort to kickstart trade talks with the European Union. Under plans being drawn up in Whitehall, Britain would pay between £7bn and £17bn a year to Brussels for three years after Brexit before ending sizeable direct payments into EU coffers in time for the 2022 general election. Davis told Marr: “It’s nonsense. The story is completely wrong.” Speaking to Die Welt, Davis seemed to be saying that the UK still does not think it legally owes the EU €50bn, but that it might make a payment going beyond its legal minimum obligation. He has already said that the UK will meet its “moral” obligations to the EU as well as its legal ones. He has also said the final decision over what to pay will be a political one, and not just a strict legal one. Peter Foster, the Telegraph’s Europe editor, reads Davis’s comment to Die Welt as an admission that the deadlock over money is in London, not Brussels. UPDATE: A source close to Davis has been in touch to say that, when Davis told Marr the Sunday Times story was “nonsense”, he was referring to the claim that May had agreed a figure for the Brexit bill. Davis was not commenting on the figure in the story, the source claims. The source says it is therefore wrong to infer that Davis is backing away from saying that it is “nonsense” to say the Brexit bill will end up at €50bn. But anyone watching the Marr show, or reading the Marr transcript, will have got the impression that Davis was dismissing the €50bn figure, and not just an aspect of the story. And Davis himself told Die Welt that he used the phrase “nonsense” because he did not accept the legal argument that the UK owed €50bn. Davis hinted that the UK may offer a new concession to the EU on the rights of EU nationals. He implied this could involve EU nationals continuing to have certain rights in relation to third-country spouses that UK citizens do not have for a period after Brexit. He said: Let me deal with family rights, which is most difficult first. The issue is that in order to give perpetuity on family rights it would give to three million people in the UK rights that British citizens themselves don’t have. I am trying to think of a way of maybe a short-term way of sorting this, a certain window whatever. Davis was referring to the way the current system means that Britons who want to bring a non-European spouse to the UK face tougher restrictions (a minimum income rule) than EU nationals living in the UK. The EU argues that closing this loophole will amount to a reduction in the rights of EU nationals. Asked whether this “window” might last five or 10 years, Davis said he was thinking of something “a bit shorter than that”. He claimed he was not accusing the EU of delaying the talks. Asked if he thought EU leaders were holding things up so that businesses relocated to the continent, he replied: I’m not sure I’d take the view there’s a deliberate slowing of the process. I wouldn’t subscribe to that. This is not quite what he told MPs on Tuesday, when he accused the EU of holding up the talks in the hope of trying to get the UK to pay more. He rejected claims that the government was divided over Brexit. Theresa May’s Florence speech was agreed “unanimously” by cabinet, he said, and he said Brexit involved “the most detailed set of policies I have had to deal with as a minister”. But there still arguments, he accepted. On the substantive issues, there is unanimity. Of course, there is debate. This is a live democracy, and this is a debate about what is the best way to do things, and I do debate with myself sometimes what the best thing is. He said the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal was not a probability, but a “very distant possibility”. He said Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, wants to loosen his negotiating mandate. Ministers have said as much before (see, for example, Philip Hammond here), but Davis suggested he has been told this by Barnier himself. He said: What we know from discussions with Michel Barnier is that he is looking for a bit more leeway in his mandate. He has had a pretty tight mandate so far. We would also like him to be able to talk about the transition period, or implementation period as we call it. Theresa May has tweeted a link to her open letter to EU nationals living in the UK. Owen Paterson, the Conservative former environment secretary and one of the signatories of the Leave Means Leave ‘Let’s default to WTO’ open letter (see 9.18am), was on the Today programme talking about it. He said that the UK should not be “terrified” of leaving the European Union without a deal and that trading on WTO (World Trade Organisation) terms would be acceptable. He said it was “inevitable at the moment, it is an ineluctable certainty we are going to end up with WTO at the end of this anyway” so it was better to “state that now” and give business time to prepare. He also rejected concerns that the lack of a trade deal could lead to queues at ports, claiming that only 2% of shipments were checked by customs, with nearly all trade done electronically. Responding to his interview on Twitter, the Tory MP Sir Nicholas Soames, a pro-European, accused Paterson of being “defeatist” and said leaving the EU without a trade deal would be “absurd”. A German parliamentarian close to the chancellor, Angela Merkel, has confirmed that the European Union wants the UK to agree to pay up to €100bn (£89.4bn) to settle the Brexit divorce bill. Michael Fuchs, vice chair of the of Merkel’s CDU/CSU group in the German parliament, said the €20bn (£17.9bn) so far offered by the UK was inadequate. Asked by ITV’s Good Morning Britain how much the EU was demanding, Fuchs said: I cannot give you the final figure, but there is a figure of between €100bn and maybe €60bn [£53.7bn]. Something in between these two numbers should be the right point. This is what the negotiations have to do at moment. I hope David Davis is coming up with decent proposals, €20bn is definitely not enough. Fuchs also confirmed that money was the major sticking point in the stalled negotiations. He said: There is an offer of €20bn which is obviously not enough. You can just calculate all the pensions and it’s very obvious that the Europeans don’t want to pay the pensions for the Brits which are living in Brussels. So we have to find a solution on that topic first and then we go on with other topics. But Fuchs described May’s letter to EU citizens living in the UK as a “positive” sign that she was considering the interest of Europeans in the UK. Asked to respond to Fuchs comments about money, Brandon Lewis, the immigration minister, said: We are in negotiations. We will honour our commitments - we have got a moral duty to do that but [we need] to work through exactly what it is to make sure what we are paying for is right for Great Britain, as much as it is right for the European partners. EU leaders are meeting in Brussels today for one of their regular summit. These events take place around half a dozen times a year, and often they are routine, but this one was supposed to authorise a Brexit talks breakthrough and, as a result, is attracting considerable scrutiny. As well all know, we won’t get the breakthrough, because EU leaders will not decide that “sufficient progress” has been made in phase one of the talks (EU citizens’ rights, money and Ireland) to justify moving on to phase two (trade and the transition). But there is considerable interest anyway in what EU leaders say about the prospect a switch to phase two being agreed at the next summit in December. I’ll be covering the opening of the summit, although the key developments are likely to come out out of my time - at the dinner tonight, where Theresa May will make the case for accelerating the talks, and tomorrow, when the EU27 deliver their assessment. As the Guardian reports today, EU leaders feel the need to treat May with some caution because they don’t want to do anything that will leave her even weaker domestically, and hence unable to honour any Brexit commitments she made. And we saw a good example of the pressure she is facing at home overnight when the Leave Means Leave campaign issued an open letter signed by, among others, four former Tory cabinet ministers (Lord Lawson, Peter Lilley, John Redwood and Owen Paterson) saying May should prepare now to leave the EU with no trade deal because the EU is negotiating in bad faith. Here is an excerpt. It has become increasingly clear that the European commission is deliberately deferring discussions on the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU27 post-Brexit. This is causing a highly damaging level of uncertainty for businesses which need time to make preparations for March 2019. The EU is taking this approach because they do not believe that the UK would be prepared to go to WTO rules for our trading relationship with them. If at the European council this week, the EU continues to refuse to discuss the future framework for a trade relationship, we should formally declare that we are assuming that we will be subject to WTO rules from 30th March 2019. This would provide businesses with absolute certainty about the future and enable immediate steps to be taken to implement our independent trade policy. If, early next year, the EU then decides to come back to discuss free trade, this will be a bonus - but it is not and should not be treated as essential. The Telegraph is splashing on the story. In other EU developments: Jeremy Corbyn is in Brussels for meetings with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, and others. May has issued a direct appeal to EU citizens living in the UK saying that after Brexit they will be able to stay. Michael Fuchs, vice chair of Angela Merkel’s CDU/CSU group in the German parliament, has told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that the UK’s offer to pay the EU around €20bn when it leaves is inadequate and that it should pay between €100bn and maybe €60bn. I’ll post more on this soon. The Times (paywall) is reporting that Britain is “fighting a Brussels ‘rip-off’ that adds up to €7bn (£6.25bn) to the Brexit divorce bill by inflating the cost of pension liabilities for retired European Union officials. Here is the agenda for the day. All times are UK times. 9.30am: Theresa May meets the former US president Bill Clinton in Downing Street to discuss Northern Ireland. 9.40am: Jeremy Corbyn is due to arrive in Brussels for his own Brexit talks. He is meeting Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament, as well as the Italian, Swedish and Portuguese prime ministers. 10.30am: Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, takes business questions in the Commons. She will be asked about when the EU withdrawal bill will return to the Commons. 11am: Sir John Sawers, the former head of MI6, gives evidence to the Lords EU committee about Brexit. 11.30am: Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, and Donald Tusk, president of the European council, hold a press conference ahead of the summit. 1pm: May arrives at the EU summit. 1pm: Damian Green, the first secretary of state, speaks at a press gallery lunch.

The firm apologised after it released promotional material that showed a cast of tracksuited characters, including a pregnant woman drinking and smoking and a tattooed man striking an aggressive pose, in a pub. The Cockney’tivity Christmas dinners are scheduled to take place across three weeks in December in an “authentic Hackney boozer” in London’s East End. Attendees will get a three course meal and a “Cockney Christmas story” from the actors. The company, Zebedee Productions, said it would be a “proper celebration of east London culture” and said many of the people involved had links to the East End. But critics pointed out the entry fee meant that, while local working-class people were being sent up, it was unlikely they would be able to afford to be in on the joke. “The local people, they just get laughed at, they get joked at and there’s no respect there,” said Joe Ellis, who was born and grew up in the East End. Josh Clarke, who helped run a campaign to gain asset of community value status for a local pub to save it from closure, said: “These establishments want to keep a certain kind of person out. There’s no one involved in that who said: ‘Let’s respect Cockney culture.’” Ellis said there was a divide between the locals and those who moved in more recently: “They’re sticking up two fingers to the local community and profiteering off the local people.” Susan Clarke, who was born and bred nearby, said the show’s promotional material relied on stereotypes of Cockneys. “It angers me when you see things like this. We are not all benefit scrounging slobs going round saying ‘alright mate’ and talking in rhyming slang,” she said. Another Hackney woman added: “Pubs and other places working-class people used to go to have been closed down en masse, and now instead they’re hosting events that cost as much as some people have to live on a week.” Aisha, who asked for her surname to be withheld, said the event was distasteful and “just another symptom of the massive social cleansing going on in the area. It’s just the epitome of what’s been happening all over the UK for the past decade - a sort of working-class tourism.” Zebedee’s owner, Zoe Wellman, defended the production, saying: “My mum was born and bred in Gants Hill, and I’ve lived in Hackney for the last 10 years ... and Darren [a partner in Zebedee] is a Wood Green boy through and through. “We’re all really excited about what we’ve been working on and, as a small theatre and production company, this is a project really close to home. Being from the area ourselves, it was never a question of poking fun at a stereotype and those who live in the area, however we are truly sorry for any offence caused.” Aisha said the actors’ backgrounds did not matter to her and bemoaned the stereotypes they were portraying. “There are no celebrations of working-class culture – we’re represented through shows about benefit cheats, Jeremy Kyle and things like this play. “I grew up surrounded by people who were eloquent and intellectual, and also happened to be working class. I want to see that represented, instead of this idea that we’re all tracksuit-wearing dossers.” The controversy follows similar rows, including that over the Job Centre bar, which was criticised for insensitivity after opening up in an old job centre in south London, and the Cereal Killer cafe, which serves breakfast cereal at £3 a bowl in one of London’s poorest boroughs and was the object of a large protest in 2014."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/19/rising-at-increasing-rate-in-england-and-wales-police-figures-show","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T13:10:27Z","webTitle":"Police data shows crime rising at increasing rate in England and Wales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/19/rising-at-increasing-rate-in-england-and-wales-police-figures-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/19/rising-at-increasing-rate-in-england-and-wales-police-figures-show","fields":{"headline":"Police data shows crime rising at increasing rate in England and Wales","bodyText":"The rise in crime is accelerating, with the latest figures showing a 13% increase in all police-recorded offences across England and Wales, and even greater rises for violent offences including knife crime, sexual offences and violence against the person. The crime figures show an underlying 8% rise in the murder rate, an increase of 46 victims, with 629 homicides recorded in the 12 months to June, excluding the 35 people killed in the London and Manchester terrorist attacks, and the 96 Hillsborough deaths in 1989, which were included in the headline figures. The acceleration from a 5% rise in the 12 months to June 2015, to 7% the following year, and 13% in the 12 months to June this year, together with even larger increases in violent crime, will sound alarm bells in Downing Street. Theresa May might find some comfort in the results of the Crime Survey of England and Wales, which shows a 9% reduction in overall crime but is less effective at providing a good indication of changes in low-volume offences, including most forms of violent crime, or emerging trends. John Flatley of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said: “Today’s figures suggest that the police are dealing with a growing volume of crime. While improvements made by police forces in recording crime are still a factor in the increase, we judge that there have been genuine increases in crime, particularly in some of the low-incidence but more harmful categories. “Police figures cannot provide a good measure of all crime in society, since we know that a large volume of it never comes to their attention. The recent increases in recorded crime need to be seen in the context of the overall decline in crime indicated by the Crime Survey of England and Wales.” The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said: “The Tories can no longer hide behind claims that crime is falling to justify their severe cuts to the police. “They have left our communities exposed, with police numbers the lowest on record at a time when forces are under unprecedented pressure from surging crime, an ongoing terror threat, and from covering for cuts to other services.” Sarah Newton, a Home Office minister, welcomed the fall in the crime survey estimates and improvements in police recording. “But while it is clear that much of the rise in police-recorded violent offences is due to better recording, we know that some of this increase is likely to be genuine, which is why we have taken urgent action to stop these crimes and keep our communities safe,” she said. “This week, we began consulting on tough new laws to crack down on acid attacks and knife offences. Our domestic abuse bill will help to bring this heinous crime out of the shadows and ensure victims receive both support and justice, as we invest £100m to prevent and confront violence against women and girls. We are also investing £1.9bn to counter the cyber threats we face.” The ONS said police had recorded 5.2m offences in the year to June, which reflected genuine increases in some crime categories as well as continuing improvements in some categories. The crime survey estimated that there were 10.8m incidents, including 5m of fraud, online crime and computer misuse. In contrast to the police figures, it showed the majority of crime categories falling or showing no statistical difference. The quarterly crime figures also highlight for the first time 711 deaths or serious injuries caused by illegal driving, a 6% rise on the previous year. But it is the accelerating increases in the volume of violent crime reported to police that will most alarm the public and politicians. The ONS said the underlying rise in the homicide rate followed a general upward trend in recent years and contrasted with the downward trend over the previous decade. The headline figure of 664 homicides for the 12 months to June shows a fall of 2% on the previous year’s total of 679. The increasingly violent nature of England and Wales is underlined by double-digit increases in types of violent crime that, although low in volume, cause significant harm and alarm. They include a 27% rise in gun crime to 6,696 offences, a 26% increase in knife crime to 36,998 offences, robberies up 25% to 64,499, sexual offences up 19% to 129,700, and stalking and harassment up 36% to 243,086 reported incidents. The overall category of violence against the person, which includes homicide, death or serious injury caused by illegal driving, violence with injury, violence without injury, and stalking and harassment, rose 19% to 1,229,260 reported incidents. There were also double-digit increases in domestic violence and public order offences. Some categories of police-recorded crime fell in the past year, including drug offences, down 9% to 132,935, and non-domestic burglary. The largest increases in violent crime were reported by South Yorkshire police, up 49% to 31,838 offences, Durham constabulary (up 48% to 16,532 offences), Greater Manchester police (up 46% to 76,404 offences) and Northumbria police (up 39% to 35,458 offences). But it will cause increasing political alarm that large-volume offences such as burglary and car crime, which had been falling over the previous two decades, are rising. Domestic burglary is up 21% to 235,335, while thefts are up 11% to 1.9m. The Home Office data shows there were more than 8,000 allegations of rape reported to police that were not officially recorded as rapes. There were 52,406 allegations initially classified as rapes in the 12 months to March, of which 41,159 were subsequently officially recorded, leaving 8,624 cases that were not pursued. Of the remaining 2,623, 1,746 were “cancelled” due to additional “verifiable information” that indicated a rape did not take place, the crime had already been recorded or it had been recorded in error, while 877 allegations were transferred to other forces to consider. A Home Office data table shows the reason for 4,920 of the 8,624 cases not being recorded was: “Victim/third party not confirmed/cannot be traced”. A further 1,320 were not pursued because “credible evidence exists to the contrary”. The remaining 2,384 cases involved incidents committed outside the jurisdiction of the police force they were reported to and transferred to the appropriate force."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/19/julie-bishop-keen-to-work-with-ardern-despite-attack-on-nz-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T09:33:53Z","webTitle":"Julie Bishop keen to work with Jacinda Ardern despite attack on NZ Labour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/19/julie-bishop-keen-to-work-with-ardern-despite-attack-on-nz-labour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/19/julie-bishop-keen-to-work-with-ardern-despite-attack-on-nz-labour","fields":{"headline":"Julie Bishop keen to work with Jacinda Ardern despite attack on NZ Labour","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull has congratulated Jacinda Ardern, the leader of New Zealand’s Labour party, on her shock election victory. Turnbull spoke to Ardern on Thursday afternoon and both leaders reaffirmed the strength and importance of the Australia-NZ relationship, saying they looked forward to working together and meeting face to face. The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, who claimed two months ago it would be “very difficult to build trust” with a New Zealand Labour government following accusations the NZ party had colluded with Australia’s Labor party in an attempt to “bring down” the Turnbull government, has also congratulated Ardern. Bishop said on Thursday – during a quick doorstop at Canberra airport – that the relationship with New Zealand was broad and deep and she was confident the two countries could work together, signalling a keenness to move on. “We have a very strong and deep relationship with New Zealand and I’m looking forward to working with the new government,” Bishop said. When asked if she could trust Ardern, Bishop said that matter had been dealt with. “The fact is Ardern gave an explanation a couple of months ago about the behaviour of a New Zealand member of the Labour party and she said at the time that his conduct was wrong, it was unacceptable, it should never have happened, and that he shouldn’t have become involved,” she said. “And I accepted her explanation and I agree with her absolutely.” Her comments came hours after Penny Wong, the shadow foreign affairs minister, called on the Turnbull government to take “immediate action” to rebuild relations with the incoming New Zealand government. “Labor congratulates Jacinda Ardern and the New Zealand Labour party on successfully concluding negotiations to form the next New Zealand government,” Wong said in a statement. “Labor also thanks outgoing prime minister, Bill English, for his contribution to the strong and warm ties between our two nations. “It is now incumbent on the foreign minister to undo the damage caused by her irresponsible remarks during the election campaign.” Ardern, who became leader of NZ Labour less than three months ago, became the prime minister-elect on Thursday after the leader of NZ First, Winston Peters, announced his party would enter into a coalition deal. After hours in which he teased the public and media with the promise of a decision, Peters made the revelation in a televised broadcast. He did not tell Ardern or the outgoing prime minister and National party leader, Bill English, in advance which of them he would be backing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/ng-interactive/2017/oct/30/how-the-north-stayed-underground-grime-makina-psychedelia","type":"interactive","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-30T06:00:48Z","webTitle":"'There are a lot of weird people around here': how the north stayed underground","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ng-interactive/2017/oct/30/how-the-north-stayed-underground-grime-makina-psychedelia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/ng-interactive/2017/oct/30/how-the-north-stayed-underground-grime-makina-psychedelia","fields":{"headline":"'There are a lot of weird people around here': how the north stayed underground","bodyText":"From turbo-charged Eurodance in Newcastle to Pennine psychedelia and grime in Hull, the north of England keeps underground scenes thriving outside the glare of the mainstream. Welcome to five of the strangest ‘It’s easy to feel like an outcast’: punk in Cumbria In a terraced house in coastal Whitehaven, young punk band Scumbrians are crammed – unfashionable bondage trousers and all – into bassist Kristie Mason’s father’s kitchen. “We never realised how big punk was round here,” says singer Looke Norman, armfuls of tattoos creeping under his NHS hospital cleaner’s uniform. “But when we formed the band we realised that there were loads of others like us.” It is estimated that 15 or 16 such outfits are currently gigging in the county. With its breathtaking landscapes and Wordsworth and Beatrix Potter associations, Cumbria seems an unlikely punk-rock hotbed, but it is the perfect breeding ground for a disaffected, underground music scene. “Windermere and Grasmere are honeypots,” says Matty Little, guitarist in Kill Spector, trying to be heard over the racket of hen parties in Carlisle station. “But once you get beyond the Lake District, Cumbria is grey. There aren’t many proper jobs and it’s easy to feel like an outcast. Punk is our alternative community.” Bands attend each other’s gigs and are mutually supportive. There have been punk groups in Cumbria since the Ramones played in Carlisle Market Hall in 1977, but interest was rekindled when local promoter Dave Bell started putting on gigs in pub cellars. Today, the community spans generations. Kill Spector’s members are aged from 19 to 45. Carlisle rowdy sorts Top Dog consist of two lifelong punks and two much younger converts: drummer Rab Desborough-Hartley came from happy hardcore. “But I used to slip Nirvana into my DJ sets and speed it up,” he chuckles, “so it wasn’t a big stretch to join a punk band.” Guitarist Nigel Barton witnessed that Ramones gig aged 15 and underwent a political awakening. “I got involved in Cumbria Under Nuclear Threat [CUNT],” he sniggers. “But no one would wear the T-shirt.” Today, two generations his junior, Scumbrians’ mix of raucous old-school punk and contemporary subjects such as refugees and zero hours contracts is genuinely affecting. Raging about the world has already cost guitarist Jake McAllister his job. “My boss was trying to ring me while we were playing,” he grins. “I came offstage to a text message: ‘You’re fired!’” Ouch. But recently, Scumbrians, Top Dog and fellow Cumbrians No Thrills and Hexed appeared at Blackpool’s Rebellion festival. Could Cumbrian punk be ready to go overground? “The music isn’t new, but it’s raw and honest and speaks for a forgotten generation,” considers Matty Little. “If one of us does a really good gig in Manchester or London, I’m sure it will take off.” Dave Simpson ‘No one is really in charge’: DIY venues in Sheffield Egg boxes on the wall, nominal door fees, eclectic music and an unwritten “don’t be a dick” rule – these sorts of spaces are currently booming in Sheffield. “If you can see it, we’ve built it,” Ed Crisp says, while showing me around Delicious Clam, a rough and ready but charming collectively run studio, practice space, label home and venue that opened this year. Located in a former wig shop next to where the indoor Castle Market recently stood, Delicious Clam is one of many idiosyncratic venues that are turning the city into the DIY underground capital of the UK. There is also the more polished the Big Wow, located in an old welder’s workshop; punk and hardcore mecca the Lughole; plus Plot 22, the Audacious Art Experiment (TAAE) and community spaces such as Foodhall and Regather. “No one is really in charge – it’s a collective where everyone has an equal say,” TAAE’s Luke Twyman says of his venue, a dinky and wonky space that has crammed in some glorious parties over the years, from late-night raves with Helena Hauff to gigs by the Minutemen’s Mike Watt. These micro-venues dotted around the city, generally accommodating 30 to 100 people, are filling gaps left by the closure of pubs and small venues (such as the Grapes and the Red House) while serving as an antidote to corporate or increasingly gentrified spaces. Eschewing £5 pints, unsympathetic sound engineers and brusque door staff, the aim is, as TAAE’s Nick Potter says, “to rewrite a lot of the social norms that are embedded in traditional music and drinking establishments”. With members having access to the space during the day, it creates a place for experimentation, collaboration and socialising during hours most venues don’t offer. When it does run late into the night, discrimination and harassment – still an ugly part of club and gig culture – aren’t tolerated. And also, says Potter, “there’s scope for offering experiences outside of the usual financial necessities, without expensive drinks or enforced entry fees. Bring your own is the norm, but first and foremost just bring yourself. No one should be turned away from community entertainment and socialisation for lack of funds.” Fundraisers, crowdfunding campaigns, membership fees, door takings and lots of donated time and expertise keep these places going. The more spaces that open up, the stronger the sense of creation, community and collaboration. “We share ideas, building materials, tools, even venues when places get double booked,” Crisps says, with Twyman echoing: “As more spaces open up, the scene has really come together to form more of a community that identifies with certain economic values, as opposed to just music taste.” Daniel Dylan Wray ‘It’s our identity’: Hull’s rap scene Philip Larkin remarked that Hull, geographically isolated on the east coast, was “a city that is in the world yet sufficiently on the edge of it to have a different resonance”. Thus, after producing artists as diverse as Mick Ronson and the Beautiful South, the City of Culture is now witnessing an explosion of grime-influenced music. Local acts emerging from below the radar include rapper Chiedu Oraka and the Lockdown collective, MCs Muzi Swaks, Hybrid Kid, Playa One, Cameo Brooks and Live Lans. Lans also drums in Bud Sugar, a multiracial, Specials-type five-piece whose euphoric, socially conscious pop reflects modern Britain’s multicultural society. Hull MCs are quite different from their London or even Manchester counterparts. They don’t rap about guns or clothes. Instead, in Hull accents, they spit bars about their lives in the city. “It’s our identity,” explains Oraka, 29, who, a sliver over 2 metres tall (6ft 7in), is literally the biggest MC in Hull. As the main players cram into a coffee bar, it’s also striking to hear how many of them grew up with single mothers, experienced racism (Oraka was the first non-white kid on his estate) or what he calls “trials and tribulations”. “Three weeks in a young offenders institute – a nice little holiday. But I grew up,” he smiles, and describes how a university degree and youth work set him on a new path. Although Oraka and Bud Sugar are musically different, their numerous shows together reflect a shared outsiderness. “We were outside the bubble,” explains the latter’s singer, Bacary Bax, under his gravity-defying dreadlocks, “so we had to make our own.” Alienation from the city’s drinking scene and “clubs playing rubbish music” drove them to put on their own nights, such as Oraka’s Audacity, as an alternative. The big man has been a “grime geek” since he was nine, when mates would grumble: “‘You can’t listen to this rubbish, it’s too fast.’” After freestyling in his bedroom in an American accent (“My mate said: ‘Your flow is sick, but that needs to stop,’” he chuckles), he connected with producer/musical partner Deezkid via Facebook. Bud Sugar, meanwhile, combine an array of disparate influences – grime, hip-hop, funk, the influence of Bax’s mum’s African and reggae records, and even a ukulele – to create a vibrant, original sound he calls “codhead skank Afropop.” Oraka recently appeared at Radio 1’s Big Weekend and thinks the scene can’t get bigger locally. “If I just become the biggest thing in Hull, I’ve failed,” he insists. “I want people to say: ‘Those guys put the city on the map.’” Dave Simpson ‘It’s kept us on the straight and narrow’: makina in Newcastle There’s a track by Makinarium on a recent Monta Musical label compilationthat is called Don’t Ever Change. It’s aptly titled because makina – turbocharged 170-180bpm Eurotrance capped off with rapid fire MCing – has been the sound of the north-east of England for nigh-on 20 years, without ever bowing to fashion. “The north-east scene has always thrived on that high-energy vibe,” says promoter and youth worker Sandy Duff, “like Italian piano house, and then happy hardcore. But in the late-90s this Spanish ‘machine music’ – makina – started to overtake the UK hardcore, and became coupled with a unique MC style.” That style, with local accents to the fore, started very simple – essentially rave-hyping with occasional boasts or threats – and remains rigid and on-the-beat stylistically. But bit by bit, it has come to reflect the lives of the scene’s participants. “People really listen to us,” says popular MC Rockeye. “Like, the MCs are the stars. I’ve had kids in hospital get in touch saying how much the lyrics mean to them, and it makes us realise how seriously this is taken. Doing it has helped me, too. It’s kept us on the straight and narrow after I got out of prison.” “MCs like Rockeye,” says Fred Phethean, of the Comusica education project at Sage Gateshead, “are the YouTube generation, who talk about their lives more. Lately they’ve started to refer to the music as ‘Monta’ after the label, and the tunes are getting more stripped down for the MCs. Some are even starting to take influences from grime and hip-hop for the first time.” Amazingly it’s still a vinyl culture, with a constant stream of new tunes shifting significant physical units, and classics sometimes fetching hundreds of pounds. The scene is truly local – Rockeye rattles off Chester-le-Street, Hartlepool, and Middlesbrough as having the main events outside Newcastle, with just the occasional rave booking in Liverpool or Scotland – but it is growing and spreading. “It was underground for years,” he says, “but honestly it’s mainstream here now. Monta Musica can sell out 2,000 tickets for the Newcastle Academy easy, and you’ve got to see the energy there to believe it.” “Maybe one day,” says Phethean, “someone’ll make a makina track with a chorus as well as just MC verses, and have a breakout record.” Until then, though, it remains almost unknown outside the region – another proud, weird mutation in British dance music. Joe Muggs ‘The towns have a vibe and an aura’: the trans-Pennine underground The valleys of the Pennine Hills were once at the heart of the industrial revolution. Now, the buildings left behind by cotton and commerce have found a new lease of life, providing cheap spaces for a thriving left-field music scene. The Trades Club in Hebden Bridge is at the centre of this trans-Pennine network of venues, promoters, artists, writers and free-thinking heads. Booker Mal Campbell puts the area’s enthusiasm for weird sounds down to a reaction to the post-Mumford &amp; Sons “happy earnest people playing mandolins” folk scene, and adds that “you do see people magic mushroom picking quite a lot”. The spirit of psychedelic derangement is a common theme around these parts. Emma Thompson of the Islington Mill in Salford, the instigators of much of this resurgence in far-out creativity, remembers one particularly hectic night in the former textile mill. Called Bummer Camp and hosted by queer rapper Christeene, “it was filthy empowerment – people were bouncing well into the next day.” She adds that the strength of the developing trans-Pennine underground is its collaborative spirit and lack of ego or rivalry. The people behind Golden Cabinet, a night at the Kirkgate community centre in the Yorkshire town of Shipley, agree, citing the Islington Mill as a source of both inspiration and practical help. A giant PA system nicknamed the Tower of Power, which belonged to Mill-based experimental group Gnod, regularly made the trip across the hilltops. “The sound was incendiary,” they say. “The windows threatened to fall out and you could hear the bass three streets away.” While this might be a drastic change from the Kirkgate Centre’s usual fare of fitness classes and Lego fun days, they insist that Golden Cabinet is a friendly space: “Inclusivity is very important. Although some of the music we put on might seem challenging, we want everyone to feel welcome.” The idea that weird music can be at the heart of the community rather than shunted to the margins is common across the trans-Pennine underground. Over in Hebden Bridge, the Trades Club acted as a focal point for recovery work during the floods of 2016. Further down the valley, the Golden Lion pub’s life as a weird music venue-cum-community centre began when it was seriously damaged by flooding. Now, as well as sets from acid-house hero Andrew Weatherall, the ever-present Gnod and groups from the cosmic, psychedelic New Weird Britain scene, you might also find a session on anti-fracking activism or UFOs. Golden Lion promoter Richard Walker puts some of this down to the legacy of the hippy communities who settled in the area in the 60 and 70s. “The towns have a vibe and an aura,” he says. Musician Sophie Cooper is a Golden Lion regular, using the venue for tour rehearsals, as well as putting on gigs. Attracted to the area by departed local freaky musical hero Ned Netherwood and the prospect of cheaper rent than London, she fell in with the Golden Lion thanks to the encouragement of landlady Matthanee Nilavongse. “If I want to do a fine art opening, a vegan buffet and a wedding all at once she’ll just let me do it,” Cooper says. “Everyone is really accepting – there are a lot of weird people around here.” Luke Turner"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/ng-interactive/2017/oct/19/womens-ashes-the-players-who-can-shape-the-series-interactive","type":"interactive","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T17:00:31Z","webTitle":"Women's Ashes: the players who can shape the series – interactive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2017/oct/19/womens-ashes-the-players-who-can-shape-the-series-interactive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/ng-interactive/2017/oct/19/womens-ashes-the-players-who-can-shape-the-series-interactive","fields":{"headline":"Women's Ashes: the players who can shape the series – interactive","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/19/labors-stand-against-mandatory-sentences-defended-as-dutton-attacks","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T05:51:46Z","webTitle":"Labor's stand against mandatory sentences defended as Dutton attacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/19/labors-stand-against-mandatory-sentences-defended-as-dutton-attacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/19/labors-stand-against-mandatory-sentences-defended-as-dutton-attacks","fields":{"headline":"Labor's stand against mandatory sentences defended as Dutton attacks","bodyText":"The Law Council has praised Labor’s stand against mandatory minimum sentences for sexual offences against children as Peter Dutton and the justice minister, Michael Keenan, step up their attack over the controversial measure. The Law Council president, Fiona McLeod, said on Thursday that mandatory sentences were a “one-size-fits-all” penalty that caused “unintended consequences”. On Wednesday Labor’s shadow justice minister, Clare O’Neil, said in a lower house debate that the party opposed mandatory minimum sentences for serious or repeat offenders contained in a government bill to crack down on child sexual offences. O’Neil said mandatory minimums would “let guilty people off the hook because juries are less likely to convict them when they know there is no discretion about the sentence”. She argued that mandatory minimums would prevent criminals cooperating with police to “bring the kingpins who run [child exploitation] networks to justice”. O’Neil said the bill would impose a mandatory five-year jail term on an 18-year old in a relationship with a 15-year-old, such as a year 12 student and a year 10 student sending explicit images over Snapchat. A spokeswoman for O’Neil told Guardian Australia that, despite attacking the mandatory minimum sentences, Labor will vote for the bill even if the measure is not removed. On Thursday Keenan told 2GB Radio he was “astonished” Labor would not support the main measure of the bill. He said there was “no such thing as a minor commonwealth child sex offence, they’re all horrible”. “Currently commonwealth child sex offenders, 40% of them don’t even spend one day in jail and, of the cohort who do go to prison, the most common length of time served is six months.” Dutton told 2GB Radio that Bill Shorten should explain why Labor did not support minimum mandatory sentences for child sexual offenders when they supported them for people smugglers. “Why on earth he’d oppose that, I don’t know,” he said. “The fact is that they supported these mandatory provisions in relation to people smuggling ... and they’re saying that sex offenders don’t deserve these minimum sentences and there is huge hypocrisy.” In 2010 Labor created mandatory minimum sentences for “aggravated people smuggling”, which have never been successfully prosecuted. It has never supported mandatory sentences for people convicted of terrorist offences. Asked about Labor’s stand on mandatory minimums McLeod told ABC News: “The problem with mandatory sentencing, in any bill, and in … the child sex offenders’ bill, is that it can lead to drastic unintended consequences.” McLeod said if a 17-year old were in a relationship with a 15-year old, the older partner would “suddenly” be guilty of a criminal offence when they turned 18. “You instantly have, with no discretion for the courts whatsoever, a minimum period of jail,” she said. “It must be an unintended consequence and it’s far too harsh.” McLeod suggested that increased sentences could send a signal about the seriousness of crimes without the “great unfairness for many people” caused by mandatory minimums. “Courts can take this into account in their sentencing principles. We don’t want to hamstring the court so they have no option.” The sexual crimes against children bill passed the lower house on Thursday. Keenan said he was hopeful the Senate would pass it because “we’ve got a lot of common sense out of the crossbench”, although he expressed disappointment Labor had not supported it. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has defended Labor’s opposition to mandatory minimum sentences for firearms offences, such as trafficking weapons, explaining that it has a principled opposition to removing judges’ discretion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/20/new-zealand-jacinda-ardern-priorities-climate-inequality-women-cannabis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T04:47:24Z","webTitle":"New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern sets out priorities: climate, inequality and women","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/20/new-zealand-jacinda-ardern-priorities-climate-inequality-women-cannabis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/20/new-zealand-jacinda-ardern-priorities-climate-inequality-women-cannabis","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern sets out priorities: climate, inequality and women","bodyText":"New Zealand’s prime minister elect Jacinda Ardern has laid out her priorities for the country, saying she plans to urgently address climate change, tackle inequality and improving women’s lives in the home and workplace. On Thursday, NZ First leader Winston Peters threw his support behind Ardern’s Labour party, allowing them to form a coalition government with a slim majority. Like the rest of New Zealand, Ardern was left in the dark before the announcement by Peters. On Friday, Ardern described the moment she realised she would become prime minister, when Peters started talking about all New Zealanders sharing in the nation’s wealth. “It was during Mr Peters opening remarks and comments that I really got a sense of that shared common ground, particularly that comment about all New Zealanders benefitting from economic prosperity - that was the moment I thought ‘he’s going with us’,” Ardern told RNZ. “We have found allies in this parliament who wish to join with us in building a fairer New Zealand, ” Ardern told her caucus on Friday afternoon, where she was welcomed with applause, kisses and hugs. “A country where our environment is protected, where we look after the most vulnerable, where we support our families, where we make sure people have the most basic of needs, like a roof over their head.” Ardern reiterated that she is committed to having 50% of her caucus made up of women – a goal she is yet to achieve. “I have great ambition as a woman and as prime minister elect that we will make great gains as a government in issues like equal pay, in issues like supporting women in the roles they choose to take, whether they be work or in caring roles ... I hold that issue close to my heart.” The Green Party who have signed a confidence and supply deal with Labour revealed that Labour has agreed to hold a referendum on legalising cannabis for personal use by 2020, and treating drug abuse as a health issue by increasing funding to drug and alcohol treatment centres. In a letter to Green Party supporters leader James Shaw said Labour had also secured his party’s support by agreeing to a significant boost to the national conservation budget, addressing the gender pay gap in the public sector, increasing funding for social issues,overhauling the welfare system and establishing an independent climate commission. On Friday Ardern also committed to establishing a climate change commission, setting a target of net zero for greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and restoring the Emissions Trading Scheme which would include the agricultural sector – a move New Zealand dairy farmers say would cripple their business. Ardern said Winston Peters had been offered the deputy prime ministership, but had not said if he would accept the offer. There was also no news on what agreements Labour had made with NZ First to secure its support, though Ardern hinted that her plan to implement a water tax had softened during negotiations and said she and Peters were united in their belief that the regions of New Zealand had been “neglected” and needed significant investment. The government’s 100 days plan would stay “broadly stay the same” she said, and would include raising the student allowance by NZ$50, banning overseas speculators from buying existing houses, setting up ministerial inquiries into the mental health crisis and historic abuse of children in state care, and passing the healthy homes bill legislating that rental homes be dry and warm. Ardern said Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had called her and their conversation was “incredibly warm and friendly”. British Prime Minister Theresa May had also been in touch to offer her congratulations and Ardern was scheduled to speak to her on Friday night where she thought they would discuss issues of trade and security. Ardern told RNZ she would “absolutely” accept a call from Donald Trump, but he had not phoned yet. On Thursday evening Ardern celebrated her appointment to the top job by returning to her Wellington studio apartment with partner Clarke Gayford and eating a pot of noodles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/21/commonwealth-bank-defends-20000-limit-on-deposit-machines","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T21:00:04Z","webTitle":"Commonwealth Bank defends $20,000 limit on deposit machines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/21/commonwealth-bank-defends-20000-limit-on-deposit-machines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/21/commonwealth-bank-defends-20000-limit-on-deposit-machines","fields":{"headline":"Commonwealth Bank defends $20,000 limit on deposit machines","bodyText":"The Commonwealth Bank has defended its decision to allow an unusually high $20,000 deposit limit on its “intelligent” deposit machines, which allegedly allowed drug syndicates to launder tens of millions of dollars, saying small businesses liked the larger limit. Ian Narev, CBA’s chief executive, also tetchily defended the bank’s financial performance in the wake of the money laundering allegations, saying despite CBA’s share price falling 6% the share price was still higher than it was after the bank’s capital raising in 2015, and shareholders had received five dividends in recent years. “All the Australians who bought into that capital raising, even after all this in the market, have done very well,” Narev said on Friday. “But that’s beside the point”. Appearing at a parliamentary inquiry into the major banks on Friday, Narev was joined by the CBA chairman, Catherine Livingstone, who was appearing before the committee for the first time. The committee chair, the Liberal MP David Coleman, subjected Livingstone to a grilling, asking her why she had approved bonuses for CBA executives when she knew the bank had breached anti-money laundering laws by failing to report – more than 53,000 times – that its intelligent deposit machines (IDMs) had been used for cash transactions of $10,000 or more between 2012 and 2015. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre has alleged that CBA failed to provide to authorities a total of 53,506 reports – known as threshold transaction reports – from November 2012 and September 2015. It has alleged CBA became aware in April 2015 of “repeated suspicious and connected patterns of structured cash deposits followed by international money transfers”. The explosive allegations led the lawyers Maurice Blackburn and the litigation funder IMF Bentham in August to announce a potential class action on behalf of Commonwealth Bank shareholders over a share price drop caused by money laundering allegations. Coleman wanted to know why CBA’s board didn’t disclose to shareholders in its 2015-16 remuneration report that it was aware of the IDM reporting breaches, and why CBA executives were still paid bonuses. “When it published that annual report in August, when you were on the board … there were five criteria for so-called short-term executive bonuses … and what the board said was … four of those five were on target, and that one was above target,” Coleman said on Friday. “The board did not identify in that remuneration report any issue related to the executive management team’s conduct despite the fact that you knew about the TTR [threshold transaction reports] issue which, as you know, is potentially literally billions of dollars of exposure to the bank in terms of the potential fines that can be issued.” Livingstone told Coleman she was “firmly of the view” that the bank had met all its continuous disclosure obligations at the time, and she stood by her decision to sign off on the remuneration report. “On the basis of the facts that the board knew at that time, we made the right determination,” she said. “A board has to operate on the basis of the knowledge that it has at any one time. We believe we have done that. We take these matters extremely seriously.” Coleman replied: “You signed off on a remuneration report that found all metrics had been met, and one, which actually relates to risk … was above target … It is very hard to see how at bare minimum that is not extraordinarily incompetent, if not more problematic for the individual directors than that.” Livingstone said: “The period to which you relate, and the events of that time, are the subject of Austrac civil proceedings and therefore unfortunately I’m not in a position to go into detail.” Narev, who will be leaving CBA by mid-2018, said the bank had decided to set a 200-banknote deposit limit on its IDMs to satisfy its small business customers, and that had set a theoretical deposit limit of $20,000. The Labor MP Matt Thistlethwaite said: “If you’re a criminal and you want to launder $3.5m and send it overseas through one of these machines, if CBA’s takes 200 notes and the other [banks’ machines] take a quarter of that, it’s a no-brainer isn’t it, for a criminal?” Narev said: “We are certainly open and eager to have any discussions we can based on what we’ve learned about whatever changes we should make [to these machines] that will make us do our job better.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/20/manus-medical-team-to-stay-on-after-detention-centre-closes","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T06:29:43Z","webTitle":"Manus medical team to stay on after detention centre closes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/20/manus-medical-team-to-stay-on-after-detention-centre-closes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/20/manus-medical-team-to-stay-on-after-detention-centre-closes","fields":{"headline":"Manus medical team to stay on after detention centre closes","bodyText":"The healthcare provider for Australia’s offshore processing regime, International Health and Medical Services has been contracted by the Papua New Guinean government to stay beyond the closure of the Manus Island detention centre at the end of the month. Under the recently signed contract IHMS will continue providing healthcare to refugees – who are expected to settle in the PNG community – and non-refugees in Lorengau and in Port Moresby, but it is not known how long for. PNG’s general healthcare system is in crisis, with reported shortages of medication across multiple regions, including Manus province. “Medical care will continue to cover mental health services and will transition clients on to a PNG formulary, where it is considered clinically safe to do so,” an IHMS spokeswoman told Guardian Australia. “Of course, with closure of the Manus RPC [regional processing centre], services can no longer be provided at that location.” The spokeswoman said as a result detainees were being assisted to “self-manage” their medications during the transition to having to access services in the community or in Port Moresby. “We would note that self-management of medications is the norm in most doctor-patient relationships around the world.” But some medical professionals were concerned at the decision, noting the high prevalence of mental health issues among the cohort. “This is potentially a very risky strategy in that some of the medication these people are on relate to mental health problems,” said Prof Louise Newman, a spokeswoman for the Asylum Seekers Advocacy Group. “There is heightened tension there at the moment, reports of people whose mental health is deteriorating, we have a couple of deaths thought to be suicides. It’s a very volatile environment so from a mental health perspective this is a very risky strategy.” Guardian Australia understands risk assessments were conducted before patients were given a month’s worth of medication, but IHMS would not detail how many – or if any – patients were deemed too much of a risk to include. Questions as to whether it was an interim measure or if larger prescriptions would continue to be handed out once the new system was in place were also not answered. Dr Peter Young, the former head of mental health at IHMS, said without knowing what support the organisation was giving to patients once the centre closed, it was impossible to know if the decision was reasonable. “Of that cohort of people being released in the community, you’d expect there to be a number with mental health problems requiring a high level of support and follow-up attention,” Young said. “Without knowing what is constituting the service IHMS says they’ll be providing, I’d certainly think handing out a month of medications without supervision could be negligent and dangerous. They should be open about this and to show exactly what support will be provided.” About 900 men remain in Papua New Guinea after being sent there for detention and processing by Australian immigration authorities. Authorities have been steadily closing sections of the centre around detainees, shutting basic services and threatening arrest as part of efforts to encourage people to move into the nearby town of East Lorengau – if they are refugees – or to return to their country of origin if they are not. On Wednesday the United Nations warned of a looming humanitarian emergency as a result of the closure and urged the Australian government to step in. A letter distributed to detainees on Thursday warned that all food, water, sewage facilities and electricity would cease inside the centre after 31 October. The note, written in Farsi, also said the fences would be taken down and the site returned to the control of the PNG defence force. The Kurdish Iranian journalist Behrouz Boochani said the note had sparked fear among his fellow asylum seekers and refugees. “The refugees have already had a bad experience with PNG navy soldiers, on Good Friday this year, when they attacked the detention centre and fired guns into the centre,” he said. “It is unacceptable to put refugees in this situation – either move to Lorengau where they risk attack by angry local people, or be taken over by PNG defence forces who have already seriously threatened their safety.” The director of legal advocacy at the Human Rights Law Centre warned the situation “could be about to turn into a bloodbath”. “PNG military personnel have attacked these men once before,” Daniel Webb said. “Now our government is tearing down the fences and putting them in charge.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/20/xi-jinping-china-president-leninist-quest-authority-control-carries-dangers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T10:15:28Z","webTitle":"Xi Jinping’s Leninist quest for a dynasty inspires congressional love-in","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/20/xi-jinping-china-president-leninist-quest-authority-control-carries-dangers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/20/xi-jinping-china-president-leninist-quest-authority-control-carries-dangers","fields":{"headline":"Xi Jinping’s Leninist quest for a dynasty inspires congressional love-in","bodyText":"They sounded like the words of a patient at a self-help group, but the addiction being discussed here was China’s president, Xi Jinping. “I’m Wang Yong from the Tonghua Iron and Steel factory,” proclaimed the delegate from the north-eastern province of Jilin. “When I saw General Secretary Xi Jinping yesterday, I was so excited I thought about jumping on to the stage!” On a smoggy Thursday morning in Beijing, hundreds of Communist party members had flooded the Great Hall of the People – the ceremonial nexus of Chinese political life – for a day of debates tied to this week’s 19th party congress. Some, like Wang, hailed from the frigid border regions the world once called Manchuria; others the semi-tropical climes of China’s south-western frontier. Some sported drab black suits and burgundy ties; others the dazzling traditional garb of minorities such as the Dai, the Lahu and the Yi. As they streamed into this vast Mao-era auditorium, to ponder everything from poverty reduction to environmental protection and investment, there was only one man on their minds: China’s president. “We’re grateful to General Secretary Xi Jinping and to the great Communist party of China!” Gao Derong, a member of the Derung ethnic minority, exclaimed at a session on the affairs of the south-west province of Yunnan. Addressing an assembly about his province, the Liaoning party chief, Li Xi, reported: “We’ve launched a series of resolutions in accordance with General Secretary Xi’s ‘four efforts’ policy.” After lunch, the head of China’s markets regulator produced perhaps the most hyperbolic homage to his country’s “proletarian revolutionist”. “[Xi] saved the party, saved the military and saved the country,” gushed Liu Shiyu. “He saved socialism.” To the outsider there was an almost comic feel to this explosion of sycophancy, even if some of the praise for the thoughts of Xi Jinping seemed to be heartfelt. “I think Xi’s comments were realistic, down-to-earth and seriously inspiring,” said He Xun, the party chief of a Tibetan village. But the relentless expressions of devotion on show at the week-long summit, which began on Wednesday with Xi’s declaration of a “new era” of Chinese power, are no laughing matter. Three days of incessant fawning have reinforced the sensation that the world’s second-largest economy is now ruled by one of its most influential, and perhaps enduring, leaders since Mao Zedong; a reality that will have ramifications far beyond China’s borders. Donald Trump, who is scheduled to visit China early next month, might fail to retake the White House in three years’ time – or even make it that far. But there is a growing sense that his Chinese counterpart is in it for the long haul and could remain in power well beyond the end of his second five-year term. “Many people are worried the Xi Jinping era will not end [in 2022],” said Jerry Cohen, a veteran China scholar at New York University, who suspects Xi will find ways of retaining power “sort of like the Putin arrangement in Russia”. “So this could go on for some time.” Cohen and other human rights experts say their main fear is the impact his staying power will have on Chinese academia and its nascent civil society. Both have found themselves in Xi’s crosshairs since he took power in November 2012 and began dismantling sources of potential opposition. Cohen rejected the theory, still expounded by some, that having consolidated power in his first term, Xi might reveal himself to be a reformer or a “crypto-liberal” in his second. “I would be amazed if Xi begins to relax controls given the number of [economic and environmental] problems that he is much more aware of than we are … He knows that he can’t afford to allow freedom of expression,” he said. After the election of a protectionist climate-denier to the White House last year, some have looked to Beijing for leadership on issues such as free trade and global warming. “No country can afford to retreat into self-isolation,” Xi pronounced on Wednesday. Later he added: “Any harm we inflict on nature will eventually return to haunt us.” But there are fears too about how China’s increasing international swagger might adversely affect its relations with the west. “As Xi persists – and if he persists with being a strongman internationally – I think relations with the United States in particular, but also perhaps with Europe, will worsen,” predicted Roderick MacFarquhar, a China expert at Harvard University. “What everyone will discover is that China will have … its own ideas about [being a responsible international player] and they will not include being nicely-nicely in the South China Sea, they will not involve being nicely-nicely with the Japanese.” MacFarquhar said Xi appeared to have built a position of enviable strength in his first stint as leader, even if China’s “sophisticates” considered his strongman tendencies a turnoff. “Unless some politician or some angry general decides enough is enough and that Xi Jinping is making China a laughing stock by this one-man rule campaign … and has the contacts and the determination to do something, nothing is going to change.” But Xi’s Leninist quest for authority and control also carried dangers: “The changes that he has brought about … are a form of strong Leninism, which China has not experienced since the early 50s. We don’t know to what extent the population will accept that.” “This is a vast country, with hundreds of millions of people in different parts, whose exact thoughts about the situation … are very difficult to perceive. And the more Leninism there is, the more people are frightened, the less one is able to perceive it – until something happens. “Things have happened in China. Things do go wrong in China,” MacFarquhar warned. “Even in the best ordered regimes, like Xi Jinping’s.” Additional reporting by Wang Zhen"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/23/getup-warned-by-electoral-commission-it-may-be-associated-entity-of-labor","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T17:01:00Z","webTitle":"GetUp warned by electoral commission it may be ‘associated entity’ of Labor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/23/getup-warned-by-electoral-commission-it-may-be-associated-entity-of-labor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/23/getup-warned-by-electoral-commission-it-may-be-associated-entity-of-labor","fields":{"headline":"GetUp warned by electoral commission it may be ‘associated entity’ of Labor","bodyText":"GetUp is writing to its members warning the Australian Electoral Commission is set to review whether the campaigning group is an “associated entity” of Labor and the Greens after expressing a preliminary view it may be. Under electoral law an associated entity is one controlled by or “operates wholly or to a significant extent for the benefit” of a registered political party. Associated entities face more stringent reporting requirements, including disclosure of donations. Guardian Australia understands the AEC wrote to GetUp noting it might have to submit an associated entity disclosure because its 2016 election activities benefited Labor and the Greens. The AEC said it had not come to a final conclusion on whether GetUp was an associated entity, but said the organisation could risk prosecution if it did not complete the return by the deadline of last Friday. GetUp refused to submit the return, arguing in lengthy submissions that it is independent of the political parties. The AEC has reviewed GetUp’s status twice before at the behest of Coalition parliamentarians and on both occasions - in 2005 and 2010 – it concluded GetUp was not an associated entity. But GetUp’s email to its members, seen by Guardian Australia, warns “this time is different” and claims “the AEC’s preliminary review seems stacked against us, with cherry-picked facts and twisted legal interpretations”. “They’re trying to use the threat of criminal penalties to force GetUp into becoming an associated entity of Labor and the Greens,” it says. Under the Electoral Act it is an offence for an associated entity to fail to lodge a return. GetUp warns its members that “hard-right forces”, including Liberal senator Eric Abetz, are behind the push, which it says will “attack [members’] place in our politics and diminish our collective power”. In 2010 the AEC noted the difficulties of administering the test of what a “benefit” to a political party is and how to interpret the “inexact phrase” of “significant extent”. It said factors relevant to the test included donations to a political party and “directly advocating voting for a particular party”. In the 2016 federal election GetUp for the first time distributed how-to-vote cards which stated “the Liberals are holding us back” and recommended a vote for Labor, the Greens, the Nick Xenophon Team and former senators Ricky Muir and Glenn Lazarus. Before that election GetUp distributed “score cards” which rated the parties on progressive issues but did not direct preferences. The AEC has said indirect or consequential benefits to a particular political party do not constitute a “benefit”. “Thus, the fact that an organisation advocates a ‘left’ agenda does not mean it is operating for the benefit of all ‘left’ registered political parties. “Some closer connection is required between the actions of an organisation and a party before one can say the organisation operates for the benefit of that party.” GetUp reiterates it is an “independent grassroots movement” and has told its members that “not a single dollar has ever been exchanged between GetUp and any political party”. The email says GetUp cannot “submit to the lie” that it may be an associated entity, and is prepared to fight in court. It has asked a $12 donation from members. On Thursday the Australian reported GetUp had appointed two new directors to its board with Labor ties, including former Labor digital director Daniel Stone. It quoted Liberal MP Ben Morton, who suggested GetUp was “nothing more than a front for Labor and the Greens”. The joint standing committee on electoral matters is currently conducting a review of political donations. Abetz, a long-standing critic of GetUp, made a submission complaining the group had targeted Coalition MPs including Peter Dutton, George Christensen and Andrew Nikolic at the 2016 election. Abetz accused GetUp of “misleading voters” by claiming to be independent despite “links to Labor, the Greens and the unions”. He declined to comment further. The chair of the joint standing committee on electoral matters, Linda Reynolds, has argued GetUp, green groups, church groups and industry organisations are campaigning and raising large amounts of money but are not visible or sufficiently regulated by the AEC. The national director of GetUp, Paul Oosting, has rejected the claim, stating that like all third party non-profit organisations, GetUp is covered by requirements of the Electoral Act, including disclosure of donations and authorisation of electoral messages. On Thursday Oosting defended GetUp’s independence, saying its priorities were set by the values of its one million members, not party politics. “The reality is, the hard right is desperate to undermine our movement because they know we’re growing more powerful as they get more and more out of touch with everyday people,” he reportedly said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/oct/22/australia-v-england-womens-ashes-first-one-day-international-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T06:52:35Z","webTitle":"Australia beat England in Women's Ashes first one-day international – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/oct/22/australia-v-england-womens-ashes-first-one-day-international-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/oct/22/australia-v-england-womens-ashes-first-one-day-international-live","fields":{"headline":"Australia beat England in Women's Ashes first one-day international – as it happened","bodyText":"Well then. If every game is that enthralling then we’ll be knackered by the time the men’s Ashes starts. A perfect curtain-raiser at a sold-out Allan Border Field felt special, especially after the recent deluges threatened to rob us of a full day’s play. England did well to wrestle back the game after coming up short with the bat. Alex Blackwell’s knock was a lesson to the visitors’ top six, who failed to crack on despite putting together decent starts. England won’t be looking for excuses, but they’ll know they came into this match slightly undercooked after their two warm-up matches were washed out. Thursday presents them with a chance to draw level with the second ODI. As for Ash Gardner, she was highlighted on this very site as someone who is on the cusp of going big. Today’s turn of three for 47 and 27 off 18 suggests this may be the series that propels her to the next level. Until Thursday, it’s goodbye from us! 50th over: Australia 231-8 (Blackwell 67, Jonassen 4) No problem for Jonassen, who thumps her first ball through cover for a glorious four to give Australia the win and put them 2-0 up in the series! What a fantastic opening fixture. England were always short but they dug deep to come within two wickets and five balls of pulling off a fine win. Blackwell gets the plaudits as she walks off but it was a brutal cameo from Ash Gardner that did it... 49th over: Australia 227-8 (Blackwell 67) ... and what that does mean is that the new bat is on strike. Jess Jonassen to face, with two needed from the last over... England are fighting for every inch here. Brilliant stop by Sciver at midwicket and a quick throw finds both batsmen at the same end. They cross and Wellington has to go... 48th over: Australia 222-7 (Blackwell 65, Wellington 1) Ball after the Garnder dismissal, Taylor whips the bails off in an attempt to stump Amanda-Jade Wellington first ball. Luckily, the leggie’s back foot was down just in time. Seven needed from 12... Twist, anyone? A brilliant innings comes to an end as Garnder goes for an 18-ball 27. The job’s not quite done yet, with 9 needed from 16, but that’s a wicket England could have done with two overs ago... 47th over: Australia 218-6 (Blackwell 63, Gardner 26) Garnder cannons a Brunt slower ball off her own helmet. She then cue-ends the next ball down the ground for a single. Blackwell, meanwhile, is settling for deflections behind square on the leg side. This time, Gardner picks the variation and powers it over square leg for her second six! Oh no and it’s an awful mess next delivery as Brunt searches for the yorker but ends up sending it down the legside for five wides! 11 off the last two balls and it’s Australia’s to lose from here... 11 needed from 18... 46th over: Australia 203-6 (Blackwell 61, Gardner 18) Agricultural slash from Ash Gardner skews a ball meant for long off to square leg for a couple. But it’s an excellent over from Shrubsole as she concedes just three! 45th over: Australia 200-6 (Blackwell 60, Gardner 16) SIX FROM GARDNER! Sciver’s not even that short but Gardner swivels into a pull shot and puts it onto the grass banks at square leg. A couple of singles and it’s 29 required from 30... 44th over: Australia 192-6 (Blackwell 59, Garnder 9) Nevermind Blackwell, Ash Gardner’s first ball is whipped through backward square leg for four! Shrubsole over-pitching. An over-correction to the off-side... and Gardner punches through backward point! “She’s got a real knack of doing this,” says Charlotte Edwards, who has been on the wrong end of some special efforts from Gardner in Australian domestic cricket. 37 needed from 36 43rd over: Australia 182-6 (Blackwell 58, Garnder 0) Pressure on. Brunt’s change of pace has not only accounted for McGrath (slower ball), but the quicker delivery, combined with Taylor standing up to the stumps, is keeping Blackwell in her crease. 47 needed from 42... McGrath finally gets one out of the screws... but it’s straight to Lauren Winfield on the leg side rope! Cool as you like from the opener. Blackwell or bust. 42nd over: Australia 179-5 (Blackwell 56, McGrath 6) McGrath manages to get a couple of singles away to at least help Australia close out the over as close to a run-a-ball rate as possible, thanks in part to a neat reverse dab for two from Blackwell. 41st over: Australia 174-5 (Blackwell 53, McGrath 4) It’s a real struggle for McGrath out there. Once again, Brunt’s got her number and, somehow, McGrath’s not bowled when trying to heave a back-of-the-hand slower ball that looked destined for the top of off stump. A single of the final ball won’t displease England... 55 from 54 needed 40th over: Australia 171-5 (Blackwell 52, McGrath 3) A dot off the first ball from Marsh and it’s 65 from 65 required. Pressure on Blackwell, which she tries to release by skipping down the wicket. A bit of grip for the off-spinner, though, plugs, lifts and creates another dot as Blackwell fails to find the leg side. A single to long on brings McGrath back on strike. Pressure on the newbie rising... but a scampered single to mid off gives Blackwell back the strike. A bit of cat and mouse as Blackwell moves around the crease creates confusion as Blackwell steps to the off side, changes to a left-handers grip and then leaves the ball outside her new off stump. Taylor, meanwhile, can’t see a thing and it races away for four byes. 39th over: Australia 164-5 (Blackwell 50, McGrath 2) Knight plays her ace as Katherine Brunt returns. Immediately, Brunt starts with four dots to McGrath. Make that five, as McGrath misjudges the boune and plays into the covers with her hands well out in front of her eyes. A slower ball is thumped to the fence for.. no, straight to midwicket! A maiden. Brilliant from KB... 38th over: Australia 164-5 (Blackwell 50, McGrath 2) A wayward delivery is helped around the corner for four before Blackwell brings up her half-century from 62 balls with a punch down to long on. She came in at 87 for four and, much like Villani before her, has hit the ball cleanly and regularly to the fence, with six fours in her first 50. 65 required from 72 37th over: Australia 156-4 (Blackwell 44, McGrath 0) Classy from Blackwell, who charges Hartley’s second ball of her final over and blazes it down the ground for four. 36th over: Australia 151-5 (Blackwell 39, McGrath 0) All on Blackwell from here. Tahlia McGrath dots out the last three balls of the over, swiping ineffectively at her first. This is only her second ODI appearance for Australia. A lot of faith to have her so high... Sciver your timbers 35th over: Australia 150-5 (Blackwell 38) Cat, meet the pigeons. BIG SCALP! A partnership of 63, the highest of the match, is ended then and there as Haynes slaps a short ball seemingly beyond Nat Sciver at midwicket. But Sciver is not of our world and dives low to her left to take a fantastic catch! A third wicket for Hartley... 34th over: Australia 148-4 (Haynes 29, Blackwell 37) Three half-chances from Nat Sciver’s over, there. A shot on the bounce for Wilson at cover. A classy leg-side stumping in which Blackwell’s back foot stayed rooted behind the crease. An LBW appeal a tad high. Unfortunatelyfor England, the sum of the three is sod all. Australia require 81 from 96 balls.. A simple chance, all in 33rd over: Australia 145-4 (Blackwell 36, Haynes 28) And it’s a bad one. Alex Hartley’s fielding has improved exponentially over the last year but that’s a poor drop. Blackwell misjudges the flight and ends up chipping back to the bowler. It comes at a comfortable height and not as quick as Hartley expects. The hands are in position, but there’s not enough behind them. 32nd over: Australia 143-4 (Hayes 27, Blackwekk 35) Gunn’s variations, while effective, aren’t really forcing Haynes and Blackwell to do anything different. Worth having a quick burst from Brunt? Four singles from the over. 31st over: Australia 139-4 (Blackwell 33, Haynes 25) A single to square leg brings up the fifty partnership. Get Blackwell 30th over: Australia 135-4 (Haynes 23, Blackwell 31) Gunn back into the attack after her first over went for 11. Wicket-to-wicket she goes and I can’t imagine there’d be too much variation in line. But there is in length and the last ball is put away emphatically through extra cover for four. The partnership is 48... 29th over: Australia 128-4 (Haynes 20, Blackwell 26) Taylor is standing up to both batsmen, as Shrubsole varies her angle on the crease to try and find a way beyond this partnership. Haynes drives to mid off and this time nearly runs herself out! The throw from mid off misses. 28th over: Australia 126-4 (Haynes 20, Blackwell 25) Ooooh chance? Knight goes for a return catch and turns away whincing. In fact, it wasn’t a chance, as Haynes drives back to the bowler on the bounce, but it jams her fingers and goes away for a single down the ground. Knight is leaving the field to get treatement. Danni Wyatt is the substitute fielder. 27th over: Australia 123-4 (Haynes 19, Blackwell 23) Haynes is happy to tick things along with singles. Blackwell’s able to find boundaries at will, without taking too many risks. Given the required rate is 4.61, Australia will fancy themselves as favourites. 26th over: Australia 120-4 (Haynes 18, Blackwell 22) Captain Heather Knight, with her crafty (non-turning) off spin, is now in play. Flight from Knight tempts Haynes to go big... a lofted shot down the ground doesn’t go far enough but, thankfully for Australia, it’s just beyond the despairing dive of Anya Shrusbole. A single taken brings Blackwell on strike, and a couple of late dabs bring six runs in total. 25th over: Australia 110-4 (Haynes 13, Blackwell 16) Shrubsole back into the attack. Tell you what, Haynes has nearly done to Blackwell what she did to Villani. Again, it’s a drop into the covers that the Australian captain is running for. This time, Blackwell’s quicker from the nonstriker’s end and Sciver’s throw is wayward. 24th over: Australia 109-4 (Haynes 12, Blackwell 16) She might be at it again, you know... another boundary to Blackwell, this one run fine to third man. 23rd over: Australia 103-4 (Haynes 11, Blackwell 11) Century up for the hosts: Blackwell skips and thumps Hartley back past her for four. Worth looking back at this scorecard from the World Cup semi-final against India. Harmanpreet Kaur took the biscuit, but Blackwell was concocting her own one-woman salvo in the chase before she became the last wicket to fall... 22nd over: Australia 97-4 (Haynes 10, Blackwell 6) Now it’s time for England to do what they do best in this period. Strangle. Marsh, as smart as they come, gets a few darts out to prevent both batsmen from getting under the ball. Takes pace off a couple to really make them work: Haynes, though, still manages to nab a single through extra cover. 21st over: Australia 95-4 (Haynes 9, Blackwell 4) Quality shot through midwicket from Blackwell gets her off the mark with a four in her 142nd ODI. 20th over: Australia 88-4 (Haynes 8, Blackwell 0) Tit for tat after England’s top-scorer Lauren Winfield was sawn off by her partner. Villani has been the only batsman on both sides to have cracked on at nearly a run-a-ball. What a waste of a fine start. Alex Blackwell is in and Australia need 141 from 180 balls. Another gift for England and it’s a biggie! Haynes sets off for a single into the covers but Villani is far from convinced. Still, she sets off as Sciver swoops, hurls and Taylor, positioned in front of the stumps, gathers and removes the bails with the nimbleness and thuggery of Seve Ballesteros! 19th over: Australia 87-3 (Villani 38, Haynes 8) Effective from the skipper: Hartley moves to over the wicket to the left-hander, so Haynes knows she can hit through the line of the ball, over but inside mid on, for four. 18th over: Australia 82-3 (Villani 38, Haynes 3) Marsh continuing. Villani, too, as she strikes down the ground and manages to beat Jenny Gunn to the rope for her seventh boundary. Haynes off the mark with a neat looking cover drive. 17 overs: Australia 74-3 (Villani 33, Haynes 0) Needless from Perry, now that I’ve had a few watches of it. Rachel Haynes to the middle for her first knock as sort-of-full-time captain. First ball after the drinks break. Perry’s been using her feet to turn Hartley’s natural length into half-volleys and the odd full toss. So Hartley pulls her length back, beats the edge and Sarah Taylor’s sharp hards do the rest. Another big scalp for the left-arm spinner. 16th over: Australia 74-2 (Perry 20, Villani 33) Laura Marsh, queller-in-chief, is brought into the attack and immediately finds the edge of Villani’s bat. Unfortunately for Marsh, there’s no first slip and both third man and fine leg are up in the circle. Four more to EV. And then some, as the number four bat skips down and drives beautifully over the umpire’s head. Drinks. 15th over: Australia 64-2 (Perry 19, Villani 24) Both Perry and Villani using their feet to Hartley’s left-arm spin. From around the wicket, it can cramp right-handers for room. But in stepping forward, and often away to the leg side, they’re making half-volleys of most and full tossses of a few. Basically, not needing to worry about any turn. 14th over: Australia 59-2 (Perry 16, Villani 22) Ooooooh one goes begging for England... Villani whips away to deep square leg where Tammy Beaumont is hurtling in from the boundary. The England opener took a couple of brilliant catches in that position during the World Cup but this one dies on her a more than she expected. Still: she got there and it probably should have been taken. 13th over: Australia 58-2 (Perry 16, Villani 21) Alex Hartley into the attack. What you need to know: left-arm spin, fight for days, only deals in high profile scalps. The woman for the occasion. That being said, she does give Perry the chance to hit the first six of the innings with a juicy full toss. Perry obliges, right down the ground. 12th over: Australia 52-2 (Villani 21, Perry 10) Fifty up for Australia as Villani goes high to the leg side for another four. She’s racing away, while Perry dawdles like a distracted toddler. A toddler that has smashed everything out of the middle, mind. 11th over: Australia 47-2 (Perry 9, Villani 17) Eventful first ball from Jenny Gunn... Perry slaps it straight back at the bowler, who sticks out her right hand as her follow-through takes her to the left. The tips of her fingers are stung as the ball races away for four. Knowing Villani wants to go after anything wide, Gunn bowls her “whiff ball”, which is a few clicks faster than a tectonic plate. After missing out on the first one, Villani throws her hands through a second which clears the infield and skips over the cover boundary for four. An ill-timed aerial drive down the gound gets her a couple more, too. 10th over: Australia 36-2 (Perry 4, Villani 11) The last over of the first Power Play sees a change as Nat Sciver replaces Shrubsole. Sarah Taylor’s up to the stumps and there’s a bit of outswing on offer for the Surrey allrounder. Just when it looks like Sciver’s just going to concede just a single from her first over, a slight drop in length allows Villani to slap her over backward square leg for four. Second Power Play – a maximum of four players outside of the circle – has been called... 9th over: Australia (Perry 3, Villani 7) Brunt’s run of dots is ende 31-2d by a dab through backward point for a single before Villani rocks back and cuts the penultimate ball of the over for four through the same region. The first non-Healy boundary of the Australian innings. 8th over: Australia 26-2 (Perry 2, Villani 3) CHANCE! Villani off the mark with an edge that Sarah Taylor can only tip around the post. The frustration here is not with Taylor but the fact that first slip had been taken out for the start of the over. 7th over: Australia 22-2 (Perry 1, Villani 0) Heather Knight doing what Rachel Haynes did so well in the first act: a fairly orthodox ring field – first slip, too – but everyone in a few paces to ensure there’s no single on offer in the circle. Both Perry and Villani have cracked some nice looking drives that have only found fielders. A second consecutive maiden for Brunt. 6th over: Australia 22-2 (Perry 1, Villani 0) Perry off the mark with a late cut to the fielder at third man off her 10th ball. Villani six-balls and no runs into her stay. Both have excelled from this position before: in early, plenty still to get. But just the start that England wanted. 5th over: Australia 20-2 (Perry 0, Villani 0) A real gift for England and Brunt, who was finding little through the air and less off the pitch. Credit to her, though: it was a better length delivery that nabbed Healy. But, still... I mean... why, Alyssa? Having hit expertly along the carpet, Healy, for some reason, decides to clonk one in the air, straight to Anya Shrubsole at wide mid off. “I hope she’s kicking herself in the changing room,” says Mark Taylor. Nonsense shot to play in the circumstances. 4th over: Australia 20-1 (Healy 18, Perry 0) Just as with Megan Schutt earlier, Anya Shrubsole is making the new white ball talk. A reminder that this is the first time that these two sides are using a new ball from each end – a recent law change in women’s ODIs. Healy drops and runs into the off side, as Fran Wilson mops up well at backward point. Perry yet to get off the mark... 3rd over: Australia 19-1 (Healy 17, Perry 0) Another straight drive from Healy frustrates Brunt further. There’s a bit of history between these two. Safe to say they “enjoyed” their battles during the 2015 series over in the UK. 2nd over: Australia 14-1 (Healy 12, Perry 0) Anya Shrubsole, World Cup final revelry still in the threads of her ODI kit, gets England on the board. Bit of shape away from the left-hander but it was the bounce that did for Bolton. Areas, Ravi... That’ll do it. The carnage of the first over makes way for a bit of English glee in the second as Nicole Bolton misjudges one from Anya Shrubsole and in attempting to run the ball down to third man she merely edges it through to the keeper. 1st over: Australia 12-0 (Healy 12, Bolton 0) Alyssa Healy averages 13.1 batting in the top two positions. After the first over here, she’s already onto 12. A whip off her pads, a pull in front of square and a drive inside mid on bring her three boundaries, as Brunt realises that Healy’s not here to scratch around. Morning/Afternoon all, depending on which hemisphere you’re reading this from. Up top, it’s just ticked past 4am and it is from here that I’ll be guiding you through Australia’s chase. I know what your wondering and the answer is “yes” – I have eaten a second dinner (or is it a pre-breakfast?) to tide me over. Coffee helped for a bit. A smoothie will have to do from here on in. England will need a bit more than pulped fruit to defend their total of 228-9. Australia start this part of the match as favourites. Left-handed bat Nicole Bolton takes her usual spot up top and Alyssa Healy will join her, opening for the first time in ODIs since 2014. Katherine Brunt to take the new ball... A mid-sized target, but certainly defendable for England if they can get on top early. Megan Schutt on ABC Grandstand says that it’s a good batting wicket, and that they’ll approach things positively. So no fears for Australia, after England got off to a great start, then rather squandered it as some fine bowling from Australia reeled them back in. It was a game of pressure, and not a lot went England’s way when they tried to release that pressure. I will leave you to ponder the teams’ respective chances at the break, and you will soon be in the capable and tender hands of Vithushan Ehantharajah. 50th over: England 228-9 (Shrubsole 11, Hartley 2) Shrubbers! Lovely shot from Anya Shrubsole, cracks a lofted off-drive down the ground for four. Clean strike. They get a single, then Alex Hartley’s only ball is the last of the innings, and they scramble back for a second run after Hartley heaved it into the leg side. Healy’s backhander hits the stumps, but Hartley was home. That’s it! Schutt ends with 2 for 44 from her 10. Great bowling. Wellington gets the immediate chance to make amends, and does. Mid off this time, and Gunn scooped the Schutt delivery straight there. England down to Jack. 49th over: England 219-8 (Gunn 8, Shrubsole 5) Dropped! Amanda Shellington, unfortunately for her, as Gunn chips down to long off and Wellington puts down a straightforward catch running in. It doesn’t cost Australia too much, as yet another Jonassen over goes for three. She’s finished her allotment with 1 for 38. 48th over: England 216-8 (Gunn 6, Shrubsole 4) Schutt continuing, and Shrubsole gets a welcome boundary with a big edge through slips. Probably won’t be enough, but we’ll see. Sayonara, wheels. Marsh goes for a big wallop, just gets an edge, and it soars high to drop mid-pitch into the waiting gloves of the keeper. 47th over: England 210-7 (Gunn 4, Marsh 2) Four overs remaining. Jonassen to Gunn, who knocks a run into the covers, gets the strike back, then sweeps another. Both of these two can bat, Laura Marsh used to open in T20s. But Jonassen just gives nothing away. Three singles from the over, nothing more. Quoth the raven. 46th over: England 207-7 (Gunn 2, Marsh 1) 10 overs, 2 for 50 is Perry’s analysis at the end of the spell. The wheels all but removed for England at this stage. Perry gets a brilliant ovation from the packed pavilion as she goes back to field in the deep. Can’t do it today. Brunt walks at Perry, goes for a mighty slog down the ground, and misses it utterly to lose her leg bail. Some joy for the pace bowler at last. 45th over: England 204-6 (Brunt 11, Gunn 1) Gunn and Brunt at the crease. These two did the job in Bristol in the World Cup, setting enough runs to beat Australia by three. Must do the same here. Honours are with Gardner for the first five balls of the over, keeping Brunt tied down, but nobody puts Katherine in the corner. Last ball, she puts every ounce of muscle she has into a big sweep, and that’s a lot. Schutt sprinting around from backward square nearly gets there for the mid-air diving take, but it just gets by her for four. Well, Wilson never looked on today, despite hitting her first ODI six. She goes for the big loft, Perry is at deep midwicket, and Gardner gets her third for the day. 44th over: England 198-5 (Wilson 26, Brunt 6) Single for Wilson first ball, then Wellington gets too far to the leg side for Brunt. First a sweep under-edged for a couple, then one nailed square for four. Wellington finishes her block of 10 with 0-39, which shows how good her first eight overs were. She helped build the pressure that got her teammates wickets, even though she didn’t get amongst those numbers herself. 43rd over: England 191-5 (Wilson 25, Brunt 0) That rather derails England’s momentum. Brunt is a fast scorer, can she get it back? What a take from Villani! She’s down at long on, and Sciver lofts a big hit straight. Villani gets back and she’s right on the rope. Gets up with both hands, reels in the ball, but is about to fall out of bounds. She spins around, gets the ball in one hand, and flings both arms out like a swan dive, somehow giving her the balance to hover right above the rope. She manages to place her leading foot about a centimetre inside the boundary, and she’s staring straight down at that foot as she recovers her balance. So she knows it hasn’t touched the fibre, and she’s able to signal to the umpire that it was cleanly held. The replays confirm it. Quick thinking in the field, and a huge wicket for Australia. 42nd over: England 188-4 (Sciver 35, Wilson 23) The Duke of Wellington returns. This could get interesting. She’s not in her groove yet, drops short too many times. Scivers sweeps one, Wilson cuts one, Sciver pulls one, so does Wilson. Sciver cuts, then finally they nail one, Wilson pulling between the outfielders. Poor over from Wellington, great for England. 41st over: England 179-4 (Sciver 32, Wilson 17) Gardner the bowler from the commentary end of the ground. Round the wicket, flat, attempted pull, wide. That’s to start with. Then another one. Can’t give that many away. A couple of singles, then there’s the pressure shot from Wilson. Big straight drive, skewed leading edge, but again the breeze carries it longer, and it lands beyond Villani as the fielder sprints back. The ball plugs and stops. Shows you how much moisture remains in this turf. A couple of runs. Seven from the over, that’s what England need. Minimum. 40th over: England 172-4 (Sciver 30, Wilson 14) Wilson walks across her stumps, Perry tries to get past her pads, and the umpire calls it wide. I still think the rules should be amended to accommodate that. Unfair advantage for a batsman to change the lines. But Wilson can’t get off strike. Sciver scored a single from the first ball, and Wilson is stuck for a couple more dots. Finally whacks a run through cover. Some pressure building on Fran? Ten overs left. Can they get past 250 with another 80 runs? 39th over: England 168-4 (Sciver 28, Wilson 13) Jonassen replaces Schutt and bowls her eighth over, Haynes ringing the changes. Three singles, but then Wilson can’t get away. Defends a couple, plays straight to the field. Biding time for the final assault? 38th over: England 165-4 (Sciver 26, Wilson 12) That is Fran Wilson’s first ODI six. Perry is taking some tap. Not a deliberate shot, one might say - I think she was trying to paddle the ball through square leg. Got a top edge, and Perry gave her enough pace for the top edge to carry the fine leg rope. This is the Perry mode du jour - bowl fast, decent looking deliveries, and go for plenty of runs. Wonder if it’s a matter of bowling too short? 37th over: England 156-4 (Sciver 24, Wilson 5) Schutt is back, with her trademark squat at the top of her mark. Still giving away very little. Three dots as Wilson can’t beat the field, then a couple of singles. The brakes remain on. 36th over: England 154-4 (Sciver 23, Wilson 4) Perry is back. Funny that McGrath only got one over as a change bowler. It’s not going to engender confidence in your new player. Perry mostly bowling short. Wilson pulls a run, Sciver slashes another off the top edge to third man. Then Perry goes short once too often, and Sciver slams the boundary on the pull shot through square. 35th over: England 146-4 (Sciver 17, Wilson 2) Gardner dishes up another economical over. Plenty of people out on the hill, and I noted when I came into the ground this morning how many families and people with young kids, especially young girls, were coming in. Great to see, and the generation of elite players in another 15 or 20 years should be well stocked. 34th over: England 143-4 (Sciver 15, Wilson 1) A few singles from Jonassen’s wicket-taking over. A question on the tweet box. Not really, no. Historically there hasn’t been the depth in power hitting for the end of the innings. But that’s changing. Wilson is all about improvising and hitting unexpected gaps, Sciver can hit a monster ball. So a pair like this could definitely add runs quickly. The pressure tells! Dot ball, dot ball, and eventually Knight feels she has to go. Tries to loft lift Jonassen over mid-on, doesn’t strike it right, and it drags squarer to deep midwicket. Of course there’s someone out there, and the classic pressure-slog-wicket combo comes through. England wobbling now, after a great start. Fran Wilson in next, a fine finisher. Can she rescue this innings? 33rd over: England 139-3 (Knight 15, Sciver 12) This is top bowling from Australia now. Five dots to Sciver from Jonassen, then six to Heather Knight from Schutt. A maiden, and nearly had a catch from a miscue to the covers. 32nd over: England 139-3 (Knight 15, Sciver 12) Jonassen back with a very tidy over. Tangling them up a bit, Knight off strike first ball but Sciver can’t beat the field from any of the next five balls. 31st over: England 138-3 (Knight 14, Sciver 12) Schutt is back, and Healy is standing up to the stumps to make sure Sciver can’t step out against the seamer. England’s big hitter can’t score for three balls, then finds a couple of runs. Knight drives nicely to the outfield for a single. 30th over: England 134-3 (Knight 13, Sciver 9) Wellington at it again. Once an over, she bowls an unplayable ball. That classic leg-spin shape, the drift and dip, the turn away. Too good for most players, they almost can’t get wickets because those balls are always going to beat the bat. But then she can throw in the straight one, like the one that should have got her Winfield’s wicket. This over Sciver finds a comeback at last, a hard sweep shot that splits the outfield for four. This should be fun. 29th over: England 127-3 (Knight 12, Sciver 3) Gardner doing her bit as well, racing through the overs and giving nothing away. Three singles from the over. They need to get Sciver, the Australians, she’s the most dangerous in England’s team. 28th over: England 124-3 (Knight 11, Sciver 1) Wellington turning the screw again. They just don’t want to take a risk against her. The wickets are falling at the other end, but much of the credit has to go here. 27th over: England 122-3 (Knight 10) Australia dragging themselves back into this match now, thanks to Gardner. Good ball! Taylor looks annoyed, but that was out. Gardner around the wicket, lands it just on leg stump and straightens it. Taylor is on the back foot trying to work it square and misses, and while it hits her a bit high it would have been hitting the bails. Gardner’s first Ashes wicket. “You know what they say about pretty 30s,” says one observer. “They win you games of cricket.” 26th over: England 113-2 (Taylor 29, Knight 6) Taylor was Wellington’s wicketkeeper at the Adelaide Strikers two seasons ago, so if anyone in the England team can read her, it’s Sarah. She’s trying to find ways to score. Plays a clever lap shot down to a very fine fine leg, after Knight gets down low and nails a sweep straight to the long leg for a single. 25th over: England 110-2 (Taylor 27, Knight 5) Knight wants to get on with it. Tries to loft Gardner down the ground, but doesn’t get all of it and the ball plugs between Villani and Schutt out at deep midwicket. Worth a couple, then a misfield at cover lets Knight scramble another single. 24th over: England 104-2 (Taylor 25, Knight 1) Reassessment time for England, and Haynes takes advantage of the potential hesitation by bringing Wellington back. She dishes up a maiden. Interesting point of balance in this innings. 23rd over: England 104-2 (Taylor 25, Knight 1) The skipper is out in the middle now, as Gardner finishes her over tidily. It’s finally over. Winfield chops behind point and starts wandering down the pitch while ball-watching. It was Taylor’s call and she started going, then turned back. Someone had to be out, and the throw as in. Winfield could feel unlucky, but to be fair she’s already been out three times. 22nd over: England 102-1 (Winfield 48, Taylor 24) Tahlia McGrath on for her first run from the racetrack end of the ground. Looks likely, tall, good pace, lots of upside. They work her around though in her first over, it’s always going to take some time to settle if you’re bowling in the Ashes for your second ever international match. 21st over: England 96-1 (Winfield 44, Taylor 22) Ash Gardner comes on with her off breaks. That’s enough quiet stuff, says Winfield, as she walks at the bowler and crashes six down the ground. Big swing, nice arc of the ball. Eight from the over. 20th over: England 88-1 (Winfield 37, Taylor 21) Wellington proves that she can do the same. Two singles from her over the only gain for England. 19th over: England 86-1 (Winfield 36, Taylor 20) Jonassen back again, doing what she does. Four singles as things calm down. An exercise in contrasts. 18th over: England 82-1 (Winfield 34, Taylor 18) Wellington! Brilliant from her, shocker from the umpire. That is plumb. She tosses it right up, pitches on middle, goes on straight, Winfield misses the sweep, and it’s hitting middle stump. Except the umpire doesn’t move and there’s no DRS. That’s a shocker. Then guess what happens next? Dropped. Winfield, another big sweep, to deep midwicket. Perry running forward, dives, tough chance and she can’t hold on. That would have been a great take, but two chances go begging for Australia in the over. Everything happens when Wellington’s at the crease. 17th over: England 78-1 (Winfield 32, Taylor 16) Jonners to continue after the scheduled sporting hydration refreshment interval. Gives it some flight and a chipped single, then pulls back the length and Taylor nearly jabs it to short midwicket. We’ve had word in from Amanda Wellington’s mum. Heather, I don’t think you have much to worry about. 16th over: England 75-1 (Winfield 30, Taylor 15) “Phwoar, this girl’s got something!” is the expressive outburst from Charles Dagnall on ABC / BBC radio, as Wellington produces another peach. A mango. A luscious dragonfruit. Tossed it up, drifted in, pitched and spat the other way. She’s beat the edge three times in seven balls. Winfield and Taylor both watchful now, they’re a little worried. A couple of careful singles, and that’s all they’ll risk from the over. It’s drinks. 15th over: England 73-1 (Winfield 29, Taylor 14) Jonassen overpitches, after I promised she wouldn’t, and Taylor crashes it straight for four. Mid-on and mid-off are both up, and she cleared them with ease. Gets a single through the covers, and then Winfield tries to match the big hit. Gets a fair bit of it. Gets enough of it, for six! Just. It was a bit miscued, it was hanging for a long time, but with Villani running back hoping for a catch, the ball caught the breeze and just plonked over the midwicket rope. Another big over for England, they’re flying this morning. 14th over: England 62-1 (Winfield 23, Taylor 9) Here we go, here we go, here we go. Amanda Wellington is absolutely one of the most exciting talents in world cricket. Leg-spinner, gives the ball plenty of air, rips the hell out of it, lands it and turns it massively. A couple of singles, then she hits her straps. Lands two in a row that do exactly what I just said, beating the edge and then the shoulder of the bat with turn. 13th over: England 59-1 (Winfield 22, Taylor 7) Jonassen relentless when she bowls. At the batsmen constantly, gives them very little room, rattles through the overs, rarely overpitches. Winfield tries to sweep and gets a big top edge that luckily lands safely behind square leg. The shortish length stops her finding any fluency trying to force through the leg side. 12th over: England 56-1 (Winfield 21, Taylor 5) Taylor looking good early. Haynes has had a lot of running to do early from her spot at cover, and she does well again there, hauling the ball back for two runs rather than four. Perry the bowler, she’s mostly been handled with relatively assurance this morning, and the wicket came from a fairly ordinary shot. Six overs done for her now, 1-27. 11th over: England 49-1 (Winfield 20, Taylor 3) Dropped! The spin change is made, Jess Jonassen comes on, and so nearly brings immediately results. Winfield forces straight and hits it straight back at Jonassen, it was hit hard but direct. Should really have snared that but it was low. A drive out to the cover boundary is well saved with a big dive. 10th over: England 49-1 (Winfield 17, Taylor 2) Eight from the over, with some wides and leg byes, and a couple for Taylor first ball. But Australia have the wicket they wanted. Caught at mid-off! Diving take from Schutt as Beaumont walked at Perry, tried to bang it straight, and could only lift it to the infielder. Dropping just in front of her, it was a good take by Australia’s opening bowler from Australia’s other opening bowler. The lead runscorer of the World Cup is gone. 9th over: England 41-0 (Winfield 15, Beaumont 24) Haynes has more faith in her bowler than I, and keeps Schutt on. This time it works a treat, Schutt restricting the scoring to a single. England probably happy with how they’re going, no need to force it. 8th over: England 40-0 (Winfield 14, Beaumont 24) No spin. Perry to continue. Looks good against Winfield, yet another beating of the edge as Lauren tries the advance again. Great to hear Jim Maxwell back on the ABC - apparently the online feed is having some troubles, but we can hear the famous tones booming down the corridor from the commentary box. “Perry in to bowl...” She keeps scoring to a couple of singles. Some more stats gold from the main account: 7th over: England 38-0 (Winfield 13, Beaumont 23) Start the over with a six! Beaumont gets another one on her pads from Shooter McGavin, and times it gloriously over forward square leg. The ropes are right back at Allan Border Field but that sailed into the fence. Lovely timing. Then she flings the bat at a wide ball outside off, over-corrected, and thrashed it through cover point for four. Time to try some spin, Captain Haynes? Looks that way, as Beaumont takes a single and Winfield edges for four. 6th over: England 23-0 (Winfield 9, Beaumont 12) Perry continues. Straight, Winfield gets down low and laps around the corner, a kind of knee-high pull shot. Takes a single. Perry gets more elevation a couple of balls later, nice head-high bouncer but Beaumont is equal to that, another single to the same long leg position. Perry bowls a wide that’s nearly flicked for four. Winfield batting with a much higher backlift than in the World Cup, blade right up, in the Jonny Bairstow mould. It looks good as she walks at Perry and cover drives for four. That was a dismissive shot. 5th over: England 16-0 (Winfield 4, Beaumont 11) Clipped through square for four! Beaumont finding her range, as Schutt gets onto the pads. Plenty of space out on the leg side, there’s only a mid on, short midwicket, and a long leg. 4th over: England 12-0 (Winfield 4, Beaumont 7) Bit more action from this Perry over. First it’s a genuine edge from Winfield, down to third for a single. Then Beaumont slams a boundary through cover point, going at a wide one, before scrambling a single into the covers. Perry comes back with a very brisk delivery that zips past the edge. 3rd over: England 6-0 (Winfield 3, Beaumont 2) Nice slower ball from Schutt, outside off, draws an awkward waft from Tamsin. Schutt drills in on that off stump again, and the result is a maiden. Very handy start from the women in gold. Stats guru Hypocaust has a take on Australia’s team selection: 2nd over: England 6-0 (Winfield 3, Beaumont 2) Perry will open proceedings from the racecourse end. Shortish length to a shortish player, Beaumont gets on the back foot and nudges around the corner. Winfield does likewise, then Beaumont again. Taking things easy at the start here, though both at times like to get off to a flyer. 1st over: England 3-0 (Winfield 2, Beaumont 0) Schutt to start, as is so often the way. Winfield to receive. She drives one firmly to mid-off, another to cover, but can’t beat the field. Schutt’s only error is to let one slip down leg side. Otherwise she’s tight on the off stump. Perfect length. All Winfield can do is drive straight, with no real power. In the end she knocks a couple of runs away off the final ball. Right, the anthems are done. Australia has been advanced, fairly. The Queen is doing just fine without our help, just quietly. The teams are walking out. England gave medals to the kids standing with them - for a minute we were asking, were those their World Cup medals? That would have been an amazing alpha move. Sadly not true, it turns out. Interesting from Australia, who’ve dropped Beth Mooney and boosted Alyssa Healy up to open. This was telegraphed when Healy went up to open in the WNCL the last few state games. Perry will bat at three. And Tahlia McGrath will play her second game, the seaming all-rounder, taking the spot that Mooney freed up, while Amanda Wellington comes in for fellow leg-spinner Kristen Beams. England, serenely, are fielding the same XI as the World Cup final. Guess you would.

Good morning from Brisbane, or good middle of the night to England, or good dawn, post-prandial, or crepuscular limerance wherever else you might be around the world. The dove has returned with an olive branch, the Ark has found land, because the rain has stopped. It is a gorgeous sunny morning here at Allan Border Field, as we wait for the Women’s Ashes to get underway with the first One-Day International. Geoff will be here shortly.

Roselyn Akombe quit as a commissioner of Kenya’s electoral board by issuing a statement from New York saying the rerun of the presidential election scheduled for 26 October cannot be free and fair. “I do not want to be party to such a mockery to electoral integrity,” Akombe said in a statement. The flight of such a high-profile electoral official underlines the growing crisis in the east Africa state, long seen as a bastion of relative political stability in a volatile region. The US-educated former United Nations official told the BBC she had fled from Kenya to New York after receiving numerous threats but did not identify who was threatening her. “This election as planned cannot meet the basic expectations of a credible election,” said Akombe, who was one of seven election board commissioners. “Not when the staff are getting last-minute instructions on changes in technology and electronic transmission of results. Not when in parts of country, the training of presiding officers is being rushed for fear of attacks from protesters,” she said. “We need the commission to be courageous and speak out,” said Akombe. Speaking later in the day, the head of Kenya’s election commission, Wafula Chebukati, said that despite “full technical preparedness” for this month’s fresh presidential vote, it is “difficult to guarantee free, fair and credible elections.” The incumbent president, Uhuru Kenyatta, won the poll in August, beating veteran opposition politician Raila Odinga by nine percentage points. But Odinga mounted a legal challenge claiming the electoral commission’s computer system had been tampered with to produce false results. The supreme court annulled the elections, citing irregularities and ordered a fresh election, which will be held next week. Odinga has withdrawn from the fresh poll, saying the electoral commission has not made sufficient changes, such as new members or new procedures, to guarantee a fair election. Akombe’s resignation will further undermine confidence in the coming polls, which face a number of tough logistic challenges. The electoral commission tweeted a short statement saying it regretted Akombe’s resignation. Odinga on Tuesday suspended protests intended to press for reforms to Kenya’s electoral commission, citing the killings of his supporters by police. The protests, concentrated in the western town of Kisumu but with smaller crowds in Nairobi, the capital, and coastal Mombasa, have seen opposition supporters setting tyres alight, lobbing stones at police and in some cases looting shops and destroying property. On Friday two protesters were shot dead by police in Odinga’s rural home of Bondo, in the west of the country. On Monday an 18-year-old man was shot dead during a protest in Kisumu. His mother insisted he was not taking part and had gone to buy ice cream. “In honour of the innocent victims of the state, our protests will stay suspended. On Friday, we will mark the memory of these victims as heroes of the struggle for electoral justice,” said Odinga. Local media have reported that training sessions for election officials have been disrupted by crowds of young men. In her statement Akombe said: “It broke my heart in the last few days to listen to my staff in the field, majority of whom truly want to do the right thing, express to me their safety and security concerns.” The top information technology official at the Kenyan electoral commission was murdered shortly before the August polls. His death significantly undermined the confidence of many Kenyans in the vote. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch reported that 67 opposition supporters have been killed in protests since the 11 August announcement that Kenyatta had been re-elected in the first poll. Kenya has a history of political violence. More than 1,200 people were killed after a disputed presidential election in December 2007.

The FTSE 100 company and two of its top former executives were charged in the US of hiding losses by inflating the value of assets in Mozambique, which Rio bought in 2011 for $3.7bn ($2.8bn) and sold a few years later for $50m. America’s financial regulator, the Securities and and Exchange Commission, filed a complaint in federal court in Manhattan. It alleges that Rio Tinto, its former chief executive, Tom Albanese, and its former chief financial officer, Guy Elliott, failed to follow accounting standards and company policies to accurately value and record its assets. As the project began to suffer setbacks, resulting in the rapid decline of the value of the coal assets, Albanese and Elliott sought to hide or delay disclosure of the nature and extent of the adverse developments from Rio Tinto’s board of directors, auditors, and investors, the SEC alleges. “Rio Tinto and its top executives allegedly failed to come clean about an unsuccessful deal that was made under their watch. They tried to save their own careers at the expense of investors by hiding the truth,” said Steven Peikin, co-director of the SEC’s enforcement division. The miner said it intends to “vigorously defend itself” against the allegations. “Rio Tinto believes that the SEC case is unwarranted and that, when all the facts are considered by the court, or if necessary by a jury, the SEC’s claims will be rejected,” the company said in a statement. Shell announced that Elliott was immediately leaving his position as a non-executive director at the Anglo-Dutch oil company as a result of his involvement in the legal case. “We sincerely hope he satisfactorily resolves those proceedings and, that in that event, he would like to be considered for rejoining the board,” said Charles Holliday, Shell’s chairman. Rio Tinto was separately fined £27.4m by the UK’s financial watchdog for breaching disclosure and transparency rules over its handling of the Mozambique mining assets. It is the largest fine imposed by the Financial Conduct Authority on a company for a breach of rules relating to a firm’s official listing. The Financial Conduct Authority said the fine would have been bigger at £39.1m but the penalty was reduced because Rio Tinto agreed to settle at an early stage. Rio failed to carry out an impairment test and to recognise an impairment loss on the value of mining assets, which should have been disclosed in 2012 half-year results, the FCA said. “The UK listing regime requires listed companies to adhere to high standards of disclosure and transparency,” said Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA. “Rio Tinto should have been aware of its obligation to carry out the impairment test and the resulting material impairment should have been reported to the market at its half year results in 2012.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/18/george-soros-gives-18-billion-dollars-open-society-foundation","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T09:16:58Z","webTitle":"George Soros gives $18bn to his charitable foundation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/18/george-soros-gives-18-billion-dollars-open-society-foundation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/18/george-soros-gives-18-billion-dollars-open-society-foundation","fields":{"headline":"George Soros gives $18bn to his charitable foundation","bodyText":"The financier George Soros has transferred about $18bn (£13.7bn) to his human rights foundation, bringing his lifetime giving to $32bn and making the foundation one of the world’s largest. The donation makes Soros’s Open Society Foundations the third largest charitable foundation in the world, behind the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation and the Wellcome Trust. Officials from the foundation told the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times that the Hungarian-born investor has increased the pace of donations from the proceeds of his successful hedge fund. The latest combined donations of $18bn represent the bulk of Soros’s estimated fortune of $23bn. Open Society works globally to “build vibrant and tolerant democracies” and has given away nearly $14bn since it was founded in 1979. Soros, who made huge profits betting against the British pound when it crashed out of the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992, is a vocal supporter of liberal causes. He was a large contributor to Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential bid and makes his latest donation amid rising tensions with the government of Hungary in a row over academic and press freedom. The pro-government website 888.hu, run by an ally of Hungary’s rightwing president, Viktor Orbán, has been widely criticised after it published a list of journalists it claimed were “agents” of Soros, who is originally from Budapest. On Tuesday, David Kostelancik, the US chargé d’affaires in Budapest, said: “This is dangerous to the individuals, and also to the principles of a free, independent media.” Orbán has accused Soros of being a “national security risk” and a “public enemy” over his alleged support for what he calls the dangerous mass immigration of Muslims into Europe. Orbán’s government is also engaged in a legal stand-off with the Budapest-based Central European University (CEU), which was founded by Soros. Its rector, the Canadian former politician Michael Ignatieff, accused Orbán’s government of trying to “slowly strangle” the university by refusing to sign an agreement with New York state to allow it to continue to operate in Budapest. Ignatieff said: “A solution is on the table, but every time we get within reach of a solution, the goalposts get moved. A university that is deliberately kept by the government in a state of legal uncertainty to suit their political convenience, is a university that is in danger.” Orbán’s government had maintained it was merely seeking to level the playing field between foreign and domestic universities in Hungary. But in July, Janos Lazar, Orbán’s chief of staff, admitted that Soros’s campaigning on migration changed the relationship between CEU and the government."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/oct/18/bbc-journalist-rajini-vaidayanathan-denies-cover-up-sexual-harassment","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T07:42:46Z","webTitle":"BBC journalist denies corporation covered up sexual harassment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/18/bbc-journalist-rajini-vaidayanathan-denies-cover-up-sexual-harassment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/oct/18/bbc-journalist-rajini-vaidayanathan-denies-cover-up-sexual-harassment","fields":{"headline":"BBC journalist denies corporation covered up sexual harassment","bodyText":"A BBC journalist has denied claims that the corporation attempted to cover up the sacking of a colleague who had sexually harassed her and other women. Rajini Vaidyanathan, a correspondent based in Washington DC, revealed in a blogpost on the BBC website that she had been subjected to sexually inappropriate advances from three married colleagues, one of whom was later fired. She was inspired to write the piece by the #Me Too social media movement, used by women to share experiences of sexual harassment, which emerged in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. But the Daily Telegraph seized on her experience as an example of a BBC cover-up, alleging the corporation “hushed up” the sacking of Vaidyanathan’s colleague, an accusation she immediately and angrily denied. “To be clear,” she wrote in a thread of tweets. “The @dailytelegraph write up of my #metoo experience contains errors. The BBC DID NOT try to hush up the sacking of a colleague who sent harassing messages to women inc me. Managers were v open about it after. He was sacked within days of person making a complaint. “I wasn’t aware of what had happened immediately, as I no longer worked with him. But I found out a while after. There was no cover-up over this I can assure you. Also BBC has been extremely supportive in allowing me to share my story. And continues to be. “In short this headline isn’t what the story should be. The point is people, mainly women, in all industries/workplaces face harassment. My article was to highlight how common it is.” In her blogpost, Vaidyanathan revealed that a few years ago a married colleague started sending her sexually explicit messages. She wrote: “I was horrified but at first I thought I needed to be polite, as there was a chance we’d work together again (why do women always feel they need to be polite in these situations?) “I didn’t really know what to say, so I responded telling him that it sounded pretty normal for some men to think like that, hoping he’d go away. “But his messages continued and became more creepy. He said he’d fantasised about sex with powerful women, and how he wanted to cheat on his wife. “I told him to talk to someone else – not me – and to get help. I didn’t tell anyone at first. I felt disgusted but kept it to myself.” Vaidyanathan later discovered that another female colleague had also received sexually explicit messages from the same man. “Soon after I heard he’d been fired,” she said. “Another colleague had filed a complaint against him.” She also recounted two other examples of another colleague who made sexual advances at an Italian restaurant in New York in 2004 and another married colleague who knocked on her hotel room door after sending her a “suggestive” text. The BBC told the Telegraph it takes any allegations of bullying or harassment very seriously."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/oct/18/jenny-graves-wins-australias-250000-prime-ministers-prize-for-science","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T06:19:23Z","webTitle":"Jenny Graves wins Australia's $250,000 prime minister's prize for science","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/18/jenny-graves-wins-australias-250000-prime-ministers-prize-for-science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/oct/18/jenny-graves-wins-australias-250000-prime-ministers-prize-for-science","fields":{"headline":"Jenny Graves wins Australia's $250,000 prime minister's prize for science","bodyText":"Jenny Graves transformed our understanding of how sex chromosomes work, and led to the realisation that the human male Y chromosome may be on a path to extinction. For that and a slew of other groundbreaking work, Graves has been awarded Australia’s top science prize. Graves, now at La Trobe University, helped pioneered the field of “comparative genomics”, where the function of different parts of genomes are compared between species, in order to understand how they have evolved – and how they continue to evolve. She helped discover the gene on the human Y chromosome that is responsible for the male sex developing. And in a paper from 2002, she made the surprising hypothesis that the Y chormosome may disappear in about 4.5m years – a finding she described as a “throwaway line” that received enormous scientific and public attention. The paper discussed findings revealing that over the years the male Y chromosome had lost almost all its genes. Our non-human ancestors began with about 1,600 genes on the Y chromosome 166m years ago. And since that time, it has been whittled down to just 50 or so. If that trend continued, the chromosome would disappear in about 4.5m years, Graves said. Subsequent work suggested the Y chromosome might have stabilised in its degraded state. And Graves pointed out that over 4.5m years, if it did disappear, humans might evolve another way of determining sex. “In any case, 4.5m years is a long time. We have been human for less than 100,000 years,” she wrote in 2014. “And I can think of several ways in which we are likely to become extinct long before we run out of Y chromosome.” Much of her work has involved the comparison of the genes of Australian animals – kangaroos, platypuses and reptiles, which, when compared with human genomes, revealed a lot because of how distant they are in the evolutionary tree, representing enormous amounts of separate evolution. Her work has led to discoveries that have helped improve understanding of human disorders involving the immune system and blood proteins as well as the strange contagious cancer that has been threatening the Tasmanian devil with extinction. Her work has also focussed on the role of epigenetics – how genes are switched on and off. And she has helped discover the enormous variety of different ways that genes or the environment determine sex in other animals. For her pioneering investigations of the genetics of sex, Graves has received the $250,000 prime minister’s prize for science, it was announced on Wednesday. While both her parents were scientists, Graves said she wasn’t particularly interested in science at school until her final year when she had a biology teacher she found inspiring. Even then, she didn’t like biology until they began studying genetics, she says. “I was hooked from that time on, and decided I’d do science at university.” Graves has published more than 440 scholarly works, which have been cited more than 17,000 times. Also recognised in the prime minister’s prizes for science were three other scientists and two teachers. Eric Reynolds, a professor of dental science at the University of Melbourne, discovered a protein in milk that helps repair and strengthen teeth. For inventing and commercialising a way of putting that protein in gum and other products, Reynolds was awarded the prime minister’s prize for innovation. The Frank Fenner prize for life scientist of the year went to Jian Yang from the University of Queensland for work helping reveal that genetic variation in complex traits like obesity, cognitive ability, and schizophrenia is due to the contribution of a large number of genetic variants across the genome. The Malcolm McIntosh prize for physical scientist of the year was awarded to Dayong Jin from the University of Technology Sydney for creating new kinds of microscopes that allow observation of molecules at work inside living cells. Neil Bramsen, a teacher at Mount Ousley public school, received the 2017 prime minister’s prize for excellence in science teaching in primary schools. He was honoured for for innovative partnerships with scientists, the community and other schools to foster students’ enthusiasm, knowledge and skills in science. Brett McKay from Kirrawee high school received the prime minister’s prize for excellence in science teaching in secondary schools for his achievements in inspiring his students to love science and to use it in their daily lives."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2017/oct/19/tree-of-codes-review-wayne-mcgregors-modern-ballet-fails-to-find-heart","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T23:41:15Z","webTitle":"Tree of Codes review – Wayne McGregor's modern ballet fails to find heart","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/oct/19/tree-of-codes-review-wayne-mcgregors-modern-ballet-fails-to-find-heart","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/oct/19/tree-of-codes-review-wayne-mcgregors-modern-ballet-fails-to-find-heart","fields":{"headline":"Tree of Codes review – Wayne McGregor's modern ballet fails to find heart","bodyText":"Tree of Codes opens with a magical world: a pitch-black stage with moving lights decked out on the costumes of unseen dancers. It could be a starry constellation or fragments of a city as seen from an aeroplane at night, or a group of robots powered by a playful AI operating system. Whatever it is, the opening piece of Tree of Codes enchants. The music by Jamie xx adds to the AI feel: the aural equivalent of tiny pinpoints of lights bouncing around the stage. The next piece is also sweet and clever. Dancers line up in a row, giant blossoms obscuring their faces. Images, limbs and lights move out from inside the blossoms as they shift and open and close. Once again, the music, movement and light work together in an almost orchestral way. There are brain-bending hints of psychedelia. Tree of Codes, which premiered in Australia on Wednesday night as part of the Melbourne festival, has collaboration and shape-shifting in its DNA. The work is inspired by a short, strange book by novelist Jonathan Safran Foer, the author of Everything is Illuminated. In this book, Safran Foer took another text, Bruno Schulz’s 1934 short story collection The Street of Crocodiles, and literally – with scissors – cut words out of the book, changing the text on each page you flipped to. In doing this, a new story was created. The Olivier award-winning choreographer Wayne McGregor has gone even more meta with this, and created something new and strange out of Safran Foer’s experiment, in collaboration with xx, visual artist Olafur Eliasson and the Paris Opera Ballet, who have loaned two dancers - Lucie Fenwick and Julien Meyzindi – to the Melbourne show, with a cast rounded out by Company Wayne McGregor. Jamie xx composed the score using an algorithm that turns the text into music, often to great effect, although some of music towards the end has echoes of Philip Glass – all the staccato pips and pops of strings and synths. I preferred the more sweeping, epic score of the earlier part of the show. The dancers, mostly wearing unobtrusive nude costumes, are flawless. The piece runs at 75 minutes without interval and without pause, and the stage is constantly alive with movement, refracted light and evolving sets. McGregor has said his biggest influence is architecture, and there is something architectural about the shapes the dancers make – fluid then freezing into sublime patterns. But after the first two promising opening sequences, the rest of the work fails to live up to its early daring. Parts of it had a nightclub feel: this could be thanks to associations with Jamie xx’s work in his band the xx, and partly due to the alternately dark and sweeping lights. And despite the dancers’ technical perfection (or perhaps because of it), they can seem too removed from the audience as they move behind or are distorted by Eliasson’s spectacular set. There was something cold about the performance: it failed to emotionally have it. The sold-out crowd gave it a standing ovation – but while I was also dazzled, this diamond-cut precise work lacked warmth and heart. In troubled times art gives us solace, but I did not find that solace here. • Tree of Codes is at Arts Centre Melbourne until 21 October, as part of Melbourne festival"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/18/bob-brown-wins-high-court-challenge-to-tasmanian-anti-protest-laws","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T23:40:03Z","webTitle":"Bob Brown wins high court challenge to Tasmanian anti-protest laws","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/18/bob-brown-wins-high-court-challenge-to-tasmanian-anti-protest-laws","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/18/bob-brown-wins-high-court-challenge-to-tasmanian-anti-protest-laws","fields":{"headline":"Bob Brown wins high court challenge to Tasmanian anti-protest laws","bodyText":"The former Australian Greens leader Bob Brown has won a landmark high court fight against Tasmanian anti-protest laws passed in 2014 and under which he was charged in 2016. Brown, the third person arrested under the Workplaces (Protection from Protesters) Act 2014, argued the laws directly targeted implied freedom of political expression in the constitution and were therefore unconstitutional. The landmark case stemmed from Brown’s arrest while filming a video about an anti-logging protest at Lapoinya state forest in Tasmania’s north-west in January 2016. The Tasmanian government dropped the charges against Brown and his co-arrestee, Jessica Hoyt, once they mounted the high court challenge but Brown continued the challenge to protect future environmental actions, arguing they impinged on an implied right to free speech in Australia’s constitution. In a 183-page judgment, the court ruled in favour of Brown and Hoyt by a six-to-one majority. The law prohibited protesters from “preventing, hindering or obstructing” businesses, even in public areas such as state forests or the access points to areas where commercial activities are conducted, if they ought to have known the impact their political activity would have on the business. Speaking after the decision was handed down, Brown told the Guardian it was “a great day for Australian democracy”. “The high court has said: ‘There is a right to political expression and we will uphold it.’ You can’t just start jailing people on account of their political beliefs or peaceful actions they might take to uphold those beliefs.” At the hearing in May, Brown’s counsel, Ron Merkel, told the court the law discriminated against protesters by allowing companies to give consent to certain political activities, in effect silencing only those opposed to logging. Merkel described the law as “unusual” and without precedent in Australia because police powers to order protesters to move on and the automatic ban on them returning for four days were only enlivened when they agitated “political, environmental, social, cultural or economic issues”. Michael O’Farrell, the solicitor general of Tasmania, explained to the court that charges against Brown had been dropped because police had “misapprehended” the legal status of the area he had been found in, and it was not a business premises or access area. O’Farrell submitted the law was not designed to ban protests per se but only those who intended to, or could be imputed to have intended, to stop or hinder lawful business activity and successfully had that effect. He suggested there would be nothing unlawful about protesters holding signs outside a logging area and standing aside to allow vehicles to enter. O’Farrell accepted the public is allowed to use state forests where their use is “not incompatible” with forestry uses but said that “doesn’t mean Brown and Hoyt have some sort of freestanding right to protest” in the area. A majority of the court agreed the laws did breach the constitution’s implied freedom of speech. In particular, they ruled that by stopping members of the public from carrying out protests on public lands – “forestry land and related business access areas” – the laws impugned those free speech provisions. But the court also ruled that aspects of the law that stopped protesters from hindering business activity on business premises were allowable. Since the Hodgman government introduced the laws after an election promise in Tasmania in 2014, as part of that state’s long-running forestry wars, two other states tried to follow suit. New South Wales succeeded, introducing laws that imposed a tenfold increase in fines for people protesting against coal seam gas and mining developments and increased penalties to a possible seven years in jail for “hindering the working of equipment belonging to or associated with a mine”. Both the NSW Bar Association and the Law Society of NSW have attacked the NSW laws, saying they also encroach on rights to free speech implied in the constitution. Three people have been arrested under those laws and pled not guilty to challenge them. Sue Higginson from the NSW Environmental Defenders Office, who is representing those three arrestees, said the Brown victory was promising for their case, and they would examine it closely to see if it means they have a case to challenge the NSW laws on similar grounds. The former Western Australian government proposed similar laws but they were not enacted before the March election and have been thrown out by the McGowan government. Brown said his victory ought to give other state governments pause before introducing similar laws. “The corporate sector seeing it can’t win environmental arguments has got weak politicians to try to knock out the environmentalists and it’s not working,” he said. The Human Rights Law Centre appeared before the court in support of Brown, and before the decision said it would be important for Australia’s democracy. “Free political communication and expression and the right to protest are absolutely essential for a healthy, vibrant democracy,” said executive director of the Human Rights Law Centre, Hugh de Kretser. “Tasmania’s laws go too far in shutting down important debate and criminalising peaceful protests.” “Governments shouldn’t be able to sell off our democratic rights in order to protect business interests,” De Kretser said. “The high court’s decision strikes down key parts of this excessive legislation that led to the arrests that sparked this case. The Tasmanian government should now scrap the legislation entirely.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/oct/17/tottenham-harry-kane-real-madrid-sid-lowe","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T21:30:19Z","webTitle":"Harry Kane relishes Real Madrid experience but key moment proves elusive | Sid Lowe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/oct/17/tottenham-harry-kane-real-madrid-sid-lowe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/oct/17/tottenham-harry-kane-real-madrid-sid-lowe","fields":{"headline":"Harry Kane relishes Real Madrid spotlight but key moment is elusive","bodyText":"A backheel at the Bernabéu. That is quite a baptism or it would have been if, as most of this stadium first thought, it had actually happened. The replay told a different story but it was Harry Kane the Tottenham Hotspur players ran towards as the ball settled in Keylor Navas’s net, giving them the lead just before the half-hour. The problem was that at the end of the game it was also Kane they sought out, Hugo Lloris putting an arm round his shoulder and walking him to the touchline. This was an excellent result celebrated by supporters, but it could have been even better and Kane’s face told a tale of opportunity lost. Mauricio Pochettino has said he is forever giving Kane videos, endless clips of moments in games, things to correct, improve and learn from. He will not need to hand over footage of what happened here in the 71st minute for Kane to replay it over in his mind, when he stood alone before goal, the kind of opportunity he would have dreamed of, but saw Navas save his shot. Nor, he will be sure, will this moment sink him; it may even propel the striker to more. The manager has, after all, described him as “the best player in the world in terms of mental strength, willpower and endeavour”. That does not make it painless, though, not least as this was set up as his night. When Fernando Llorente found him with 19 minutes remaining it really could have been. “Harry the Strong” one Spanish front-page headline here had called him. “Kane is the danger,” another warned and Raphaël Varane knew. “Everything Harry touches goes in,” Llorente had said. Sometimes even the things he does not touch go in too. Serge Aurier’s cross from the right sought him as he dashed in front of Varane, looking for a flick. The ball evaded him but not the defender chasing him and it deflected beyond the goalkeeper. “The more I play, the more I get a sense of what defenders will do,” Kane had said, but he cannot have expected this. Nor would he have expected what happened an hour later. “If you haven’t played at the Bernabéu, you haven’t been baptised,” Pochettino had said. After half an hour here his side led. High in the north-eastern corner, where 4,000 Spurs fans gathered, and in a small pocket low in the west stand too, celebrations began. “He’s one of our own, he’s one of our own, Harry Kane, he’s one of our own,” they chanted. Inevitably, some of the focus in the build up to this match was spent asking: how long for? And where would he go? They are the questions that inevitably attach themselves to players this good – and against Madrid especially. Gareth Bale, absent through injury, and Luca Modric, present everywhere and as wonderful to watch as ever, were a reminder of that, and then there was Cristiano Ronaldo – the man who, like Kane, had scored 43 goals in 2017 at the start of this game. By the start of the second half it was 44, a penalty struck home to put Madrid level before the break. The surprise, by the end, was that it was not more. Ronaldo was relentless without further reward, scoring one, hitting the post, drawing an excellent save from Lloris and then forcing another stop after a surging run that took him past three men. He ended the night on 44. Kane ended on 43, that first goal not his, the second denied him and disappointment gripped. Yet if this was a test – and it had been presented as one, against the man against whom the very best are judged – he might not have matched up but he played his part. Even when it came for him to play the part, he could not. He slipped to his knees; his manager will trust that he will soon be on his feet again. He will remind him of the good he did here. It would be generous to suggest that Kane forced the opening goal but he had forced a sharp save from Navas, leaping to head a corner, and then escaped impressively on the right, getting away from Sergio Ramos and pulling the ball towards the near post for Llorente, who was hooked to the ground by Casemiro only for the referee to look away. Tottenham’s lineup was a startling one, that partnership among them, but it had its moments. Llorente and Kane had played 34 minutes together before. Llorente occupied the central defenders, bringing Kane into play and using the ball with intelligence and calm. “He gave Harry freedom and fixed the centre-backs; he was fantastic,” Pochettino said. He provided the best opportunities too. His neat controlled header played in Eriksen, whose shot was pushed away at the near post. Just before, he had rolled the ball into Kane. It should have been the defining pass. The last time Spurs were here, in 2011, Kane was at Brisbane Road. He played five minutes for Leyton Orient in a 2-0 win against Plymouth Argyle. Now here he was at the Bernabéu. Inside the area at the north end, the goal before him, fans above him; one of their own; his moment. He opened his body and, right-footed, tried to guide it inside the far post. Navas moved fast, left hand reaching, and just as quickly the moment was gone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/18/disability-scheme-to-be-reformed-as-chief-admits-rollout-was-flawed","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T05:39:56Z","webTitle":"Disability scheme to be reformed as chief admits rollout was flawed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/18/disability-scheme-to-be-reformed-as-chief-admits-rollout-was-flawed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/18/disability-scheme-to-be-reformed-as-chief-admits-rollout-was-flawed","fields":{"headline":"Disability scheme to be reformed as chief admits rollout was flawed","bodyText":"The official leading the rollout of the national disability insurance scheme has conceded parts of its implementation have been flawed, saying he had heard the community’s concerns “quite loudly”. The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) announced on Wednesday a significant overhaul of the way it interacts with people with a disability and develops their support packages. The NDIA will move to end its much-criticised reliance on phone interviews to make complex decisions about a person’s unique support needs. Face-to-face planning would now become the standard, the NDIA said. Advocates have welcomed the change. But People with Disability Australia has warned it may not be feasible without an injection of staff and funding. “PWDA remains concerned about how these goals will be met without an increase in human resources or budget,” the organisation said. The overhaul of the NDIS “pathway” has been made after months of consultations with more than 300 people with a disability, their carers and families, and providers. The NDIA was told the scheme was “not meeting expected standards”. The NDIA chief executive, Robert De Luca, said the agency had learned from its early issues and would move quickly to address shortcomings. The consultation process had told him “quite loudly” the parts of the NDIS that were working, and the parts that were not. De Luca said improvements would always be needed where “you’re starting from scratch” and “you don’t have a template to follow”. “What we’ve heard through the process is that the phone conversation hasn’t always been as engaging as it could have been in a face-to-face environment,” De Luca told Guardian Australia. “That the capability of the people on the phone wasn’t at the right level to understand the needs of the people that we’re helping,” he said. The agency has faced persistent criticism over its implementation of the NDIS, the biggest reform to the disability sector in decades. Participants and advocacy groups have repeatedly warned that inadequate and inconsistent decisions are being made on support packages. Many of the problems have been linked to the pace of the rollout, a lack of expertise and knowledge about disability within parts of the NDIA, and a lack of proper resourcing. The Queensland public advocate’s office said earlier this month that to meet the NDIS rollout deadlines, planners would need to develop support packages for 3,600 people a week. But De Luca said many of the problems being experienced did not relate to the speed of the rollout. “The issues don’t relate to the pace of the rollout. They relate to the quality of the conversation, the quality of the plan development, the technology,” he said. NDIS records suggest 70% of planning conversations were occurring over the phone, which critics say leaves planners with an inadequate idea of a person’s home environment and unique support needs. Phone calls are also not an accessible means of communication for many participants. The changes announced on Wednesday would seek to address that problem, and ensure “all NDIS plan development” occurs face-to-face. It will also give participants a consistent point of contact, and will ensure planners and support coordinators “spend time understanding the unique needs of each participant”. That is designed to address concerns that the NDIS is faceless and rigid, and bounces participants between offices and staff with frequency. Communications with participants will be changed to ensure information is clear and consistent, and available in accessible formats. The NDIS online portal and tools will also be improved, to reduce the costs for providers and simplify their use. The new system will be piloted, before being rolled out across the country. PWDA said it was pleased to see the focus on face-to-face planning, and the creation of consistent points of contact. The changes showed the NDIA had “listened to concerns that people with disability have consistently raised”, the advocacy group said. The NDIA also announced it would place a stronger focus on connecting people with supports in the health, education and transport systems. PWDA welcomed that approach. “Tailored responses for children with disability, participants with psychosocial disability, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participants and other diverse groups should include all aspects of a support pathway, and be integrated with other systems, as the NDIS in isolation will not enable them to get the most out of available supports,” it said. “Lack of clarification in funding responsibility is currently leaving people confused about which system their supports are funded under, and gaps are occurring.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/19/son-volt-review-rock-pioneers-explore-new-sound-in-first-australian-tour","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T00:27:45Z","webTitle":"Son Volt review – rock pioneers explore new sound in first Australian tour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/19/son-volt-review-rock-pioneers-explore-new-sound-in-first-australian-tour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/19/son-volt-review-rock-pioneers-explore-new-sound-in-first-australian-tour","fields":{"headline":"Son Volt review – rock pioneers explore new sound in first Australian tour","bodyText":"On Windfall, the evocative opening track on Son Volt’s first album back in 1995, Jay Farrar sang about “Switching over to AM/Searching for a truer sound”, a couplet that works as a neat explanation of the band’s relentless quest into the depths of country, blues and rock music. It’s a journey that had not, before now, led him and the band to Australia, but they gave a flavour of what had been missed with a coruscating show at the Factory theatre in Sydney on Wednesday night. Although the band’s new record, Notes of Blue, consciously draws on the blues guitar styles of the Mississippi delta, the group’s signature driving riffs owe more to the harsher, electric Chicago blues sound typified by the night’s opening track Lost Souls. Its stuttering, buzzsaw attack flows seamlessly into Static. Farrar might have made his name in the alt-country days, but his stock in trade is a rock sound all his own. In his 20-plus years leading Son Volt, he has created a body of work few can equal. Throw in his songwriting partnership with Jeff Tweedy under the banner of alt-country pioneers Uncle Tupelo and you have someone who, with a dash of grunge and country sensibility, has reimagined the heartland rock sound for more than a generation. The Picture, from 2007’s The Search, would be more suited to an arena than the confines of the Factory, such is the gusto with which Farrar and his excellent band launch into it, likewise the old favourite Back into Your World. Ten Second News, a slow burn from the first album, is given the full 70s rock treatment courtesy of Chris Frame on guitar and Mark Spencer on pedal steel. This is a surprising indulgence beyond the band’s usual three-minute punch, and Farrar, a no-nonsense performer who is not given to banter between songs, even gives it a cursory introduction. It’s positively gushing by his standards and his inscrutability might explain why, despite revered critical status, his music is not widely known. The contrast with Tweedy, a gregarious, charming stage performer whose band Wilco has achieved much greater acclaim, is glaring. Farrar’s only concession to rock-dom is to wear Roger McGuinn-style sunglasses. The change of gears through the set is impressive and hits its straps with a run of classic songs such as Drown and the Woody Guthrie-inspired Bandages and Scars. Windfall is an inevitable encore, showcasing the band’s ability to switch the mood from rock to rootsy folk at the flick of a switch. “Catching an all-night station /Somewhere in Louisiana /It sounds like 1963 /But for now it sounds like heaven,” Farrar sings. It sure does."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/oct/18/2018-aflw-draft-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T03:10:44Z","webTitle":"2018 AFLW draft: Isabel Huntington selected by Bulldogs with No1 pick – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/oct/18/2018-aflw-draft-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/oct/18/2018-aflw-draft-live","fields":{"headline":"2018 AFLW draft: Isabel Huntington selected by Bulldogs with No1 pick – as it happened","bodyText":"Thanks everyone who followed along with the live blog, and happy researching/watching youtube videos of all your new favourite players.

Apparently Aasta O’Connor was very, very happy that the Bulldogs went with Huntington at No1. Says her character will add to and enhance the culture. Pick eight: Jess Allan (Adelaide) Age: 18 years Position: Ruck/key forward Club: Salisbury/Glenelg Despite having ruck Rhiannon Metcalfe on its list, Adelaide welcome another ruck in Jess, whose older sister Sarah plays for the club. Goddard says what she admires most about Allan is that she’s “such a good teammate”. Although she says it’s “a cliche”, Goddard knows the Crows will be the “hunted” this year. Reflects on seeing Sarah Perkins leave the room in tears last year. Pick seven: Jordan Zanchetta (Brisbane) Age: 22 Position: Midfielder Height: 154cm The smallest AFLW player. Did her ACL 18 months ago, which derailed her chances of playing last season. Has been in the best three midfielders in QLD for a while. Good mates with existing Lions player Emily Bates. Two-time All Australian at Youth Girls level and joint QWAFL best and fairest in 2015. Pick six: Eden Zanker (Melbourne) Age: 17 Position: Forward Height: 183cm Club: Woorineen/Bendigo Pioneers Eden is a country girl from near Tooleybuc, and only returned to football this year. She plays at centre-half forward and/or full-forward. She’s tall and athletic, aggressive and has a strong mark and good kick. She finished 10th in the agility test in the combine, and is developing as a forward/ruck. Was selected in the 2017 TAC Cup Girls Team of the Year and AFLW Under-18 All-Australian side. Rarely beaten overhead. Pick five: Jodie Hicks (GWS Giants) Age: 19 Club: Belconnen Magpies Didn’t attend the combine, but coach McConnell says she’s strong over the ball, makes good decisions and distributes the ball very well. Sydney Sixers WBBL player, but also played under-18s, and two time All Australian. Pick four: Monique Conti (Western Bulldogs) Age: 18 Position: Midfielder Height: 161cm Club: Melbourne Uni/Calder Cannons Monique is a small midfielder but she has elite power, very clean hands and an “uncanny ability to get in and out of traffic” according to coach Groves. Another dual athlete - an elite basketballer with the Melbourne Boomers. Was the 2016-17 Women’s National Basketball League Rookie of the Year and member of the 2017 TAC Cup Girls Team of the Year. She’s very competitive and strong overhead for her size. Pick three: Chloe Molloy (Collingwood) Age: 19 Position: Forward Height:172cm Club: Diamond Creek/Calder Cannons Not a huge surprise here either, the Pies have a future superstar in Molloy. She made a name for herself in the grand final against Darebin, kicking a goal despite sustaining significant ligament damage to her collarbone after being crunched by Melbourne star Karen Paxman. She was the VFLW Rising Star as well as a joint winner of the TAC Cup Girls Best and Fairest and 2017 VFLW goal-kicking awards. Selected to be part of the Team of the Year in both the TAC Cup Girls and VFLW competitions. Supported the Pies growing up. Pick two: Stephanie Cain (Fremantle) Age: 21 Position: Midfielder/half-back Club: Swan Districts Was on the Dockers’ list last season and Michelle Cowan says she’s been re-drafted after all the hard work she’s put in, and deserves the second-chance. Won best and fairest for Swan Districts this season. Has improved her running capacity, fitness, application and professionalism. Pick one: Isabel Huntington (Western Bulldogs) Age: 18 Position: forward Height: 180cm Club: Melbourne Uni/Sandringham Dragons Here we go - no surprise with pick one. The other option was of course Chloe Molloy. Huntington missed the entire 2016 season with an ACL, but was admired for her dedication to rehab, and leadership potential. Huntington is tall and athletic with excellent skills, she’s clean and has great football IQ. She played a starring role in the 2016 Under-18 national championships, where she kicked five goals and racked up more than 30 possessions in a single game. She should line up alongside Katie Brennan in a very dangerous forward line. Two live feeds Just in case you’re interested - there’s a couple of live feeds happening simultaneously. If you’re on the AFL website, you can watch official proceedings, whereas on Facebook Sam Lane and Aasta O’Connor (Western Bulldogs) are hosting the draft and answering fan questions. They’re currently discussing how big a loss Tayla Harris is for the Lions. Harris has returned to Melbourne and will line up for Carlton this year. We’re very close to starting the draft. Dana Hooker Great story up on the Fremantle FC website about their inaugural best and fairest winner. Hooker wasn’t selected until pick 130 - in round 17, and said she doubted that she had a career in the AFLW. “I was sitting on the end of my seat towards the end of it thinking - I don’t know if (senior coach) Michelle (Cowan) is going to pick me anymore,” Hooker said. “I felt maybe it wasn’t going to happen.” Speeches underway We’re still hearing from NAB and other representatives. Great to hear that in the last 12 months, there have been more than 500 new clubs nationally, and participation in women’s football has tripled. Waiting on new teammates Hannah Scott from the Western Bulldogs is eagerly awaiting her newest teammates. My sense is that ‘Izzy’ Huntington will go at No1, leaving Collingwood to swoop on Molloy at No3. The Dogs could then take Huntington’s teammate Conti at No4. Fremantle, with pick two, may go for key forward Emily McGuire, who was unable to attend the combine, or mature-age prospect Ashton Hill. GWS may then look at Haneen Zreika with pick five - or Kate Bartlett, the Western Australian who nominated for NSW draft pool. We’re on! Finally, we have a stream. Angela Pippos, author of Breaking the Mould: Taking a hammer to sexism in sport, is kicking off proceedings. In the dark Again, according to the AFL website “players, coaches and families are literally in the dark as to clubs’ selections due to a power outage”. We’re all just riding a wave of suspense right now. The AFL has done their own ‘mega preview’ of the draft at this link, if you’d like to check out their assessment of what each team needs. Nervous players, happy coaches Apparently we have a room full of nervous potential draftees, but Adelaide coach Bec Goddard and Collingwood captain Steph Chiocci are looking nice and relaxed. The Crows will be confident of another successful season after blitzing the competition earlier this year. In 2016 the club took AFLW 2017 rising star Ebony Marinoff with their first pick. Awaiting live feed Still no luck here on the live feed front, but apparently we are minutes away from starting. Back shortly. Nicola Barr’s open letter to draftees Nicola Barr has the honour of being the first player drafted in AFLW history – going to GWS. She’s written an open letter to this year’s pool, which you can read here. Here’s a preview: “The inaugural AFLW draft was an incredibly empowering moment for young girls and women within the sphere of football and in everyday life. Heading into the draft, I had mixed emotions — excitement, anticipation, nerves, doubt and gratitude. Fortunately for me, I was in a position where I knew I would be taken at No. 1, so the pressure to be picked by a team was off. However, having the ‘No. 1’ title came with a different kind of pressure and expectation. Walking into a building filled with incredible female footballers that I’d heard about and looked up to was intimidating. Coming from NSW and with little AFL experience, I felt almost out of place.” Power outage According to the AFL website, there is a “power outage at the venue which is causing a slight delay. The draft will now kick off at 12.10pm AEDT”. I knew the live feed was too good to be true. In case you’re wondering, here’s what it looks like inside the secretive venue: Club by club picks and rookie draft Western Bulldogs: 1, 4, 11, 19, 27, 34 Fremantle: 2, 10, 18, 26, 33, 40, 44 Collingwood: 3, 9, 13, 20, 21, 35 Greater Western Sydney: 5, 17, 25, 39, 43, 47, 49 Melbourne: 6, 14, 22, 30 Brisbane Lions: 7, 15, 23, 31, 37, 41, 45, 48 Adelaide: 8, 16, 24, 32, 38, 42, 46 Carlton: 12, 28, 29, 36 Draft order is determined by reverse ladder order, plus whatever happened in the trade period (the Dogs nabbed pick one in the trade that sent Jamie Lambert to Collingwood). In case you’re wondering, every club has a primary list of 27, as well as three rookie spots. They are allocated a number of draft selections depending on the state of their list (so Collingwood has six selections while Melbourne has only four). There is a rookie draft on Friday — clubs have three rookies; one cross-code and one aged under 21 and the third, one of either. Who will go at No1? Mystery surrounds who will be taken at pick one by the Bulldogs. The most likely candidates are Isabel Huntington, Chloe Molloy and Monique Conti. Chloe Molloy, a key forward who is 19 years old and co-captained VWFL side for Diamond Creek, shot into contention after swapping from basketball to AFL (she was previously listed as a development player by WNBL side Melbourne Boomers). She kicked the equal-most goals in the VWFL competition (alongside Western Bulldogs star Katie Brennan), and was taken under the wing of current Collingwood AFLW captain Steph Chiocci. Molloy’s uncle Jarrod played 49 of 200 games for Collingwood, and both Chloe and Chiocci will be hoping she falls to Collingwood at three. That will happen if the Dogs opt to draft Isabel Huntington with their first pick. Huntington is also a key forward and starred in the 2016 AFL youth girls before she missed 2017 with a ruptured ACL (she also broke her leg in 2015!) The 18-year-old school captain of St Michael’s Grammar School wants to study medicine, and has until recently prioritised study over football given the limited options available to women. She currently plays for the Melbourne University Women’s Football Club (MUWFC). Finally, there’s Monique Conti, Huntington’s teammate at MUWFC. She’s hoping she can follow in the footsteps of Erin Phillips and become the next high profile dual footballer/basketballer to make her mark on the AFLW. She’s a Melbourne Boomers guard who represented Australia at the world u/19s, and won 2016-17 Women’s National Basketball League rookie of the year. She’s an ever-handy goalkicking midfielder and will be an asset to her team. Luckily for the Bulldogs, they hold picks one and four, so they’ll almost certainly nab two of these stars. Here are the two MUWFC team-mates at the draft: Welcome to our coverage of the second draft in AFLW history. Today, 49 players will find their way onto an AFLW list. There will be a mix of Under-18 players, state-league players above the age of 18, and delisted AFLW players from last season drafted, with all players being offered one year contracts. Unlike the men’s AFL draft, players nominate which state they would like to be drafted from, and can only be drafted by clubs from that state (unless they are overlooked entirely, in which case they can be picked up by interstate clubs as free agents, should a list spot remain – see Sarah Perkins last year). Therefore, interstate teams effectively chose from their own pools, while Victorian clubs vie for top local talent. This makes draft order less important than in the AFL, but promises for intriguing tactical manoeuvres amongst the Victorian clubs. It all begins at 12pm AEST (AFLW Facebook live feed permitting - fingers crossed!) I’ll be back in a moment with some speculation on who will go at No1, as well as details like club by club picks. Stay tuned! Kate will be here shortly. In the meantime, have a read of her piece on yesterday’s decision to preclude Hannah Mouncey from nominating for today’s draft."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/25/turkish-judge-bails-eight-amnesty-human-rights-activists","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T21:48:32Z","webTitle":"Turkish judge bails eight human rights activists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/25/turkish-judge-bails-eight-amnesty-human-rights-activists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/25/turkish-judge-bails-eight-amnesty-human-rights-activists","fields":{"headline":"Turkish judge bails eight human rights activists","bodyText":"A Turkish judge has ordered the release on bail of eight human rights activists including a senior official from Amnesty International, who were standing trial on terrorism-related charges. The decision was made after a marathon 12-hour hearing in the Çağlayan court, Istanbul, in the opening session of a trial that had been condemned by rights campaigners as politically motivated and an attempt to crush dissent. The decision means that 10 out of the 11 human rights activists who were detained in the case, including Amnesty’s Turkey director, İdil Eser, will be immediately released on bail. Taner Kılıç, Amnesty’s Turkey chairman, will remain in detention as he is on trial in a separate case in the city of İzmir. Amnesty International’s secretary general, Salil Shetty, said in a statement: “Today, finally, we celebrate that our friends and colleagues can go back with their loved ones and can sleep in their own beds for the first time in almost four months. “But any joy is tainted by the ongoing detention of Amnesty International’s chair, Taner Kılıç, whose separate trial is due to start tomorrow. These politically motivated prosecutions are an attempt to silence critical voices within Turkey but have only served to highlight the importance of human rights and those who dedicate their lives to defending them. “Tonight we take a brief moment to celebrate but tomorrow we will continue our struggle to ensure that Taner, İdil and their colleagues are acquitted of these baseless charges. We will not stop until the charges are dropped and all of them are free.” The trial was seen as a an important test of the Turkish judicial system in one of the most high-profile cases since last year’s coup attempt threw the country into turmoil and led to the dismissals and detentions of tens of thousands of people accused of links to Fethullah Gülen, an exiled preacher based in the US whose movement is widely believed to have orchestrated the putsch. It will come as a welcome surprise to human rights activists who had despaired at the Turkish authorities’ increasing attacks on human rights and the detentions of activists and journalists in Turkey over the past year. But optimism will be tempered by the fact that the charges in this case have not been dropped and more journalists and activists have have been detained in recent days and weeks. The campaigners released on Wednesday were accused of plotting an uprising and charged with aiding militants as well as the Gülen movement. They face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty. They were arrested during a workshop on digital security on the resort island of Büyükada off the coast of Istanbul and held in detention for months. Prosecuting authorities claim it was a secret meeting to organise an uprising or even to conduct espionage. Most of the 10 Amnesty supporters at the meeting have been held in jail since their arrest on 18 July. Kılıç did not attend the workshop because he was in prison after being arrested the previous month but he is accused of knowing it was happening. In a separate case he is accused of downloading the ByLock app, a secure messaging platform that was allegedly used by members of the Gülen movement until the beginning of 2016, after it was penetrated by the Turkish intelligence service. Amnesty says a forensic examination of his phone showed no evidence of it having been downloaded. The hearing on Wednesday began with a reading of the indictment and statements by the defendants, who argued that there was no evidence linking them to terrorist groups. In a twist, the prosecutor in the case recommended the release on bail of all but one of the defendants. Dozens of people protested outside the crowded courthouse in Istanbul’s judicial palace as the trial opened, holding banners bearing images of the activists and the hashtag #FreeRightsDefenders. “I have dedicated my life to truth and justice and that is all I ask of this court,” said Özlem Dalkıran, a pro-democracy campaigner and one of the defendants, during opening statements to the court."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/17/study-methane-emissions-from-alberta-oil-and-gas-wells-are-worse-than-thought","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T21:41:20Z","webTitle":"'This is a really big deal': Canada natural gas emissions far worse than feared","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/study-methane-emissions-from-alberta-oil-and-gas-wells-are-worse-than-thought","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/17/study-methane-emissions-from-alberta-oil-and-gas-wells-are-worse-than-thought","fields":{"headline":"'This is a really big deal': Canada natural gas emissions far worse than feared","bodyText":"Alberta’s oil and gas industry – Canada’s largest producer of fossil fuel resources – could be emitting 25 to 50% more methane than previously believed, new research has suggested. The pioneering peer reviewed study, published in Environmental Science &amp; Technology on Tuesday, used airplane surveys to measure methane emissions from oil and gas infrastructure in two regions in Alberta. The results were then compared with industry-reported emissions and estimates of unreported sources of the powerful greenhouse gas, which warm the planet more than 20 times as much as similar volumes of carbon dioxide. “Our first reaction was ‘Oh my goodness, this is a really big deal,” said Matthew Johnson, a professor at Carleton University in Ottawa and one of the study’s authors. “If we thought it was bad, it’s worse.” Carried out last autumn, the survey measured the airborne emissions of thousands of oil and gas wells in the regions. Researchers also tracked the amount of ethane to ensure that methane emissions from cattle would not end up in their results. In one region dominated by heavy oil wells, researchers found that the type of heavy oil recovery used released 3.6 times more methane than previously believed. The technique is used in several other sites across the province, suggesting emissions from these areas are also underestimated. In the second region, home to a mix of gas and light oil wells, researchers found results that were roughly equal to those reported by industry and unreported sources. However, they found that only 6% of methane emissions in this region were from industry-reported sources, with the remaining emissions, known as fugitive emissions, from unreported sources such as unintentional equipment leaks. The finding could have major implications as Alberta and Ottawa strive to reduce methane emissions by 45% from 2012 levels by 2025, said Johnson. “It shows how much isn’t captured in current reporting requirements, and therein is a challenge and an opportunity all wrapped in one.” The study then sought to conservatively extrapolate the findings, correcting only for sites that are home to heavy oil. What they found was in Alberta – home to 68% of Canada’s natural gas production, 47% of its light crude oil production as well as 80% of all crude oil and equivalents – total emissions were likely 25 to 50% higher than previous government estimates. The findings excluded mined oil sands, which are believed to be responsible for about 11% of methane emissions. Canadian advocacy group Environmental Defence described the findings as alarming. “The methane gas currently being wasted would supply almost all the natural gas needs of Alberta, and is worth $530m per year,” Dale Marshall of the organisation said in a statement. “This represents an economic cost for governments in the form of lost royalties and taxes, and for industry in terms of revenue.” Marshall pointed to the readily available solutions for controlling leaks and intentional releases of methane gas, portraying them as some of lowest cost strategies available to reduce carbon emissions. Researchers said they have already begun presenting their findings to various levels of government, depicting it as a chance for industry and regulators to more effectively tackle emissions of methane – a gas far more potent than CO2 but which persists for less time in the atmosphere. “When you take methane emissions and convert them to CO2 emissions so you can compare to cars, for Alberta, the total methane we’re talking about on a 100-year scale is 8 to 9.7 million vehicles. If we do it on a 20-year timescale, we’re talking maybe 28 to 33 million vehicles,” said Johnson. “This is a real opportunity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2017/oct/18/energy-battle-turns-to-the-states-as-the-sell-heats-up-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T07:13:50Z","webTitle":"Greens vow to protect ABC from 'blatant ideological attack' – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2017/oct/18/energy-battle-turns-to-the-states-as-the-sell-heats-up-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2017/oct/18/energy-battle-turns-to-the-states-as-the-sell-heats-up-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Greens vow to protect ABC from 'blatant ideological attack' – as it happened","bodyText":"And on that note, we’ll finish up for the day. But don’t despair – we have one more day of fun and games ahead of us before the break. First, let’s take a look at what we learnt and what we have to look forward to. Energy was still the name of the game, but bipartisan support is still up in the air. NBN complaints are on the rise, but the prime minister says that is to be expected as more people connect. Energy industry insiders believe the Neg includes a carbon price. Responsibility has been added to the government’s Neg talking notes, along with affordability and reliability. Greens senators, along with Labor, NXT and Jacqui Lambie, appear to have forced the Peter Dutton-led citizenship changes off the agenda, at least for the time being. You can expect another day of energy talk, as Labor continues to hammer the lack of modelling and question the savings. That’s it from us for now. Mike Bowers and I will be back early tomorrow morning. A big thank you to the Guardian Australian brains trust and to everyone who commented, played along, or reached out on Twitter. We made it through hump day, or parliamentary Thursday, so let’s see if anyone, particularly your correspondent, has anything left in the tank for tomorrow. And remember, we are still waiting on that high court ruling, which could be just the shot in the arm this week needs! Thanks again and I look forward to seeing you back here tomorrow. Just because we all need a little light relief at the end of a day, I can inform you that the Senate, led by Cory Bernardi, passed a motion: That the Senate (a) takes note of an event scheduled to occur on 26 October 2017 at the Australian National University entitled “Celebrating the 1917 Russian Revolution”, organised by Socialist Alternative; (b) observes that this year marks 100 years since that revolution, which led to a litany of human rights abuses and approximately 10 million deaths; (c) notes that the 1917 revolution promoted Leninist and Marxist teaching to the broader world; and (d) rejects any assertion that the teachings of Lenin or Marx should be celebrated in a liberal democracy. For anyone who cares – and I mean anyone – the last movie Malcolm Turnbull can remember seeing was the last of the Hobbit movies, with his daughter. He still Netflix and chills, “whatever that means”, and did you know that he is a Game of Thrones fan, because I am not sure he has ever mentioned that before. In fact: BREAKING the prime minister watches Game Of Thrones. Triple M Sydney cuts short Can’t Stand Losing You by the Police to go to Malcolm Turnbull, who opens with the “trifecta” of “affordability, reliability, responsibility”. He says energy policy is one of the greatest challenges for government’s all over the world, as the market transitions to new technologies – and as he always says “get the politics and ideology out of it. It’s been a disaster.” Lucky for him, the “smartest people in the room” wrote this policy, and now there is a “triple bottom line”. An update on the citizenship bill (the one with the retroactive longer waiting periods, stricter English tests et al): it remains on the list, but it is sitting at number four on the schedule, which gives it almost bupkis chance of being reached tonight. The government has until 7.20pm to bring it up for debate, under the terms of the Greens disallowance motion, but given they have not ceded enough ground yet for the Nick Xenophon Team to even come close to giving it their support, it doesn’t look like happening. This doesn’t mean it is dead, buried and cremated by any definition – the government can bring it back to the Senate motions paper, but to do so will require a vote. You’ll know when it gets close (if it goes away after today) when that happens. In the meantime, the Senate is debating its matter of public importance, with today is clean energy, followed by the Greens’ disallowance of the government’s plan to strip councils of their rights to hold citizenship ceremonies, if they don’t do them on Australia Day. Abbott is also “very, very happy” the government has dropped the clean energy target “because that was always a very bad move”: And certainly the policy framework that the government announced yesterday will be vastly better for everyone than Labor’s plans for a 50% renewable energy target so full marks to the government for a big, big step forward, but ... there will be still renewables in the system, the more renewables there are, almost inevitably, the higher the price, because you have to have matching coal- and gas-fired power to make sure that when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine the lights will still come on, so this remains a problem. But he applauds the dumping of subsidies for wind and solar power “absolutely”. As I said, this is a big step in the right direction and full marks especially Josh Frydenberg, who has worked night and day and laboured mightily to bring about this very significant improvement in our policy. Good on him. Sadly, his chat is cut short by a house division. Tony Abbott is speaking to 2GB. He says the health minister, Greg Hunt, is one of the smartest ministers in the cabinet. That is in context of the upcoming over-the-counter ban on codeine, which Abbott says he understands but thinks Hunt will be monitoring. This media motion has just passed the Senate, with Labor joining with the Greens: The Senate notes: a) The overwhelming public support for the ABC and SBS in providing news services, quality programming including for children, and online catch up services iView and SBS On Demand. b) The vital role of the national broadcasters in promoting a diversity of services in the Australian media environment. c) The Liberal-National Government is waging an ideological war on public broadcasting, as evidenced by successive budget cuts, reviews and inquiries, and its recent deal with the One Nation Party in the context of the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017 which includes: a. a competitive neutrality inquiry into the ABC and SBS b. amendments to the ABC Charter to undermine its independence c. amendments to legislation to force the disclosure of the salaries of staff at the ABC and SBS. The Senate agrees it will not support legislation that forces the ABC or SBS to publicise the salaries of its staff, breaching their right to privacy. The government has been dancing around this issue for the past day a bit, mostly because it may not want to alert the party room to the fact it might have got this by them. But is the Neg a carbon price? The chief executive of the Australian Energy Council, Matthew Warren has given his verdict on Sky: Well, yes, of course it is. Anything that operates, anything that drives investment in the electricity sector in the 21st century, if is going to work, has to reflect the carbon price. There is a value that is attributed to the risk of carbon in all investments. The communications minister, Mitch Fifield, has commended the ABC bill to the chamber, which would add “fair and balanced” to the ABC charter, which already has the word “impartial”. It is important to recognise that the bill will not alter or diminish in any way the ABC’s independence. Objectively, there should be no concern about this proposal. The ABC’s own editorial policies require the ABC to adhere to fair treatment in the gathering and presentation of news and information, and a balance in its news reporting that follows the weight of evidence. The amendment contained in this bill simple enshrine this obligation in legislation. As a few of you have pointed out, “fair and balanced”, which was the One Nation suggestion, was the slogan of Fox News, but it dropped it, less than a year after its creator, Roger Ailes, was fired after sexual harassment allegations. A quick update on where Andrew Wilkie’s allegations in parliament have gone: the Greens and crossbench want a Senate inquiry: The Australian Greens, together with Senator Jacqui Lambie and the Nick Xenophon Team are moving for a Senate inquiry into the regulation of Australia’s casino industry, after allegations of poker machine tampering levelled at Crown Casino. Crown should not continue to operate its poker machines until a full and independent audit is undertaken, said the Australian Greens Leader, Dr Richard Di Natale. We know that pokies cause substantial harm in the community. Actions that trap people into losing even more money are deeply concerning and need to be investigated. Politicians at the state and federal level cannot sit by and allow such serious allegations to go unchecked. Crown has given over $1m to the LNP and ALP in the last 10 years: now we will see what that money buys them. On Syria’s president Bashar al-Assad, Bishop says the regime will “have to be part of the negotiations towards a political solution [in Iraq]. What we don’t want to see is Syria falling to complete anarchy – there has to be a political solution. “There is now a Raqqa civilian council which has been set up to focus on local governance in Raqqa, but the coalition will have to work with the Assad regime and Russia and Iran and others who have been backing Assad to find a political solution which involves [the] Syrians.” Speaking on Sky, Julie Bishop says the government has not forgotten about the 110 Australians who went to fight for Islamic State. Should they survive, about 80, maybe 83 Australians have been killed fighting for Isis by the anti-Isis forces and others ... I don’t know whether all 110 will [want to return to Australia] but there is that potential and that is why we are tracking them, they are under surveillance to the extent that we can, we are working with partners in the region to exchange information, and we will seek to track them and to intervene so they can’t carry out a terrorist attack on the way home or indeed in Australia. To catch up on all things question time, you can head here: Sarah Hanson-Young has had a bit to say about the ABC changes the government has proposed (with a little help from One Nation, and by help, we mean demands). The Greens communications spokeswoman said in a statement: Australians love and trust the ABC and are sick of seeing the public broadcaster used as political punching bag. The Greens will fight to protect the ABC from this blatant ideological attack and will do everything we can to save our public broadcaster from the government and One Nation’s axe. First it was Tony Abbott breaking his promise not to cut the ABC’s funding; now it’s Pauline Hanson wanting to dictate how the public broadcaster does its job and how it reports on news. It was only a few months ago that Pauline Hanson crowed about going after the ABC as revenge for the broadcaster reporting the dodgy antics the One Nation political party gets up to. Opening up the ABC’s charter to give more coverage to the loopy ideas of anti-vaxxers or anti-science is not about making the public broadcaster ‘fair and balanced’ – it’s revenge from One Nation senators who can’t handle the truth being reported. I’m calling on Labor and the Nick Xenophon Team to join with the Greens in voting this toxic legislation down. We finish on an “any alternative approaches” dixer for Darren Chester, where he links the Neg to regional development and then we are done. Small mercies. Michelle Rowland tries again (after a dixer). “Is the prime minister so out of touch that he doesn’t understand the people are complaining because his second-rate copper NBN is slower, more expensive and less reliable than what the prime minister promised? Malcolm Turnbull is once again very pleased to talk on this. I thank the honourable member for the question because it gives me an opportunity to update my earlier answer. As of today, as of the 12 ... October, the latest numbers, 6 million people are able to connect to the NBN. Nearly 40,000, nearly 40,000 premises were activated on the NBN in the last week. Labor, remember, 50,000 in six years. The reality is this: As the honourable member knows, and she should know this, that what has been going on is that retail service providers, Telstra, TPG, have not been buying enough bandwidth to provision their customers. That is being investigated by the ACCC. It has been called out. They have been given three months to get their act together and ensure that what they promise they deliver. It has nothing to do with whether the network is fibre to the premises, fibre to the basement, fibre to the node, the problem of under provision by retail service providers is common across all technologies. The honourable member should recall that she was part of a government that completely and utterly failed this project. They left us a train wreck. We have turned it around. We are getting it built. We are getting it built. Over 6 million premises can connect. Over 3 million are connected and it will be finished by 2020. We have moved on to the the NBN and Malcolm Turnbull is very happy with Labor because it “gives me an opportunity to remind honourable members once again that every 10 days the NBN under our government is connecting more Australians than Labor did in six years”. “We are connecting between 30,000 to 40,000 premises a week! 30,000 to 40,000 premises a week! There are now 3 million customers connected ... ” Labor starts yelling “copper” but Turnbull continues – but it is nothing we haven’t heard before. The NBN is available at more than 6 million premises. It is on track to be completed by 2020. It is “well past” the halfway mark. He’s the rubber and you’re the glue. Chris Bowen wants Scott Morrison to confirm that the “sum total” of documentation the opposition was provided was a single letter: Given the opposition has received absolutely no other documentation modelling or evidence from the government, can the treasurer confirm that the cabinet and the joint party room considered and adopted a major government policy based purely on the vibe? Morrison: The shadow treasurer is such a terrible, sad sack! Here are the papers the government has available to us that are available to the opposition. The ACCC’s inquiry into gas, Mr Speaker, the interim report and its 75 pages, the ACCC’s report into retail electricity pricing, Mr Speaker, some 175 pages. The electricity statement of opportunities prepared which I tabled, Mr Speaker. The advice the commonwealth government on dispatchable capacity, Mr Speaker. I have now a document, a statement from the cChief scientist, Dr Alan Finkel, on the Australian government’s energy announcement which he says, “The process was thorough, the emissions reduction trajectory has provided a credible ... ” You get the idea. Peter Dutton gets his dixer and, in a feat of verbal gymnastics, manages to link strong borders to energy policy. But one of the things that all of these projects have in common, Mr Speaker, is they need reliable and affordable power. They must have reliable and affordable power and that is what the national energy guarantee provides, Mr Speaker. It means more capacity in the system. More supply, driving down the price, working with the other elements of the government’s energy policy which are also driving down price and driving up reliability. Now, who could be against a policy that ensures reliability and drives down the price of energy, Mr Speaker? No sensible person would and that is why, as the minister for the environment and energy pointed out, there’s been so many third-party endorsements of this policy in the last 24 hours. There are two people who are against it. There is the leader of the opposition, Mr Speaker, who is like the dog that caught the cow – he’s been demanding a policy on energy that would drive down prices and reliability and now he’s caught it, he doesn’t know what to do with it, Mr Speaker. And he’s leading the Labor party into a very bad policy position because he is like the dog that caught the proverbial! The other person is the premier of South Australia, the premier of South Australia who just wants to pick a fight with Canberra! It is here that I remind you that Tony Abbott is also against the policy. But I’m sure he’ll have more to say himself on 2GB a bit later. Just a quick brush-up at the desk. Christian Porter takes a question on the energy supplement for carers asked to Malcolm Turnbull and manages to get Sam Dastyari into his answer. As you read this, please be advised there is a Chinese delegation sitting in the gallery, as welcomed by Tony Smith, who found this exchange quite interesting, given the amount of chatter that started up among them. Was the Labor’s fiscal plan saving the supplement, banking it and spending it? Absolutely. What the member for Jagajaga does is gets up here and criticises the government for making a savings measure which they have made, which they have banked and which they have already spent. And in the process of doing so, the member for Jagajaga criticises the fact that the energy guarantee has the capacity to deliver a savings in 2020 each year of up to $115 a week. Now – a year – a year. The criticism of that is that – the criticism of that is it is not enough, Mr Speaker. In fact, Senator Dastyari tried to make that criticism today with a cheeseburger. I understand he was more of a Chinese food aficionado, but hear, hear! $115 a year is a potential saving to Australian households, it is actually significant. It might not be significant to members opposite who prefer Chinese food but a potential $115 a year saving is very significant. It is absolutely significant when you compare it to the potential cost increases for the average electricity bill that are going to occur if you try and put$66bn worth of taxpayers’ money into subsidising renewables which members opposite also say don’t … It might be prudent to point out that a Queensland election is expected to be called at any moment and Katter’s Australian party is fighting One Nation off in its two Queensland electorates as I post this photo. Tanya Plibersek has the call and she asks Malcolm Turnbull about the promised drop in power prices made before coming to office, where “the Liberals promised Australians their power bills would drop by $550 a year. They didn’t.” Scott Morrison has A LOT to say about this, but is hushed by the Speaker. Plibersek picks up where she left off, asking about the “lousy 50 cents a week in three years’ time. Why would the Australian people believe anything this prime minister says about energy prices?” Malcolm Turnbull decides to rest his voice; Josh Frydenberg takes the floor. “Well, Mr Speaker, I thank the member for her question. And I can read from an ACCC report,” he begins. (“Well done, Josh,” yells a Labor MP.) “I can read from an ACCC report which says about the abolition of the carbon tax the commonwealth treasuries estimated$550 cost saving to households is reasonable, Mr Speaker,” Frydenberg says. Barnaby Joyce gets his daily dose of dixer and picks up from yesterday with his attack on basket weavers, but unfortunately there is no update on Moonbeam and Dewdrop from the Manic Monkey Cafe, but we do get a history lesson: And I want to quote someone from the Labor party who was talking about that Gladstone coal-fired power station. This member said this: “Naturally the Australian Labor party welcomes the commonwealth participation in the provision of electricity in central Queensland, which is an area where power has been hardest to come by and is the most expensive in Australia.” That member for the Labor party later went on to say about this: “The only problem he has with the coal-fired power is the advance was not a grant.” Who was that member of the Labor party? Who could that be? Who could that be? I will take the interjection that said Mark Latham. Edward Gough Whitlam. Hasn’t the apple fallen a long way from the tree? The apple has gone all the way from central Queensland ... the basket weavers now run this – I can say to them, men and women ofAustralia, if you want to play, $66,000m then vote ... [Labor]. Some might think technologies have moved on since Whitlam’s time, but it’s good to have Joyce let those people know they are wrong. Malcolm Turnbull is up again and being asked by Bill Shorten about the guarantee part of the national energy guarantee: just now the prime minister confirmed that his lousy 50 cent savings are only likely. Doesn’t this make a mockery of the prime minister’s so-called guarantee?” I can ... understand the way in which the leader of the opposition is squirming on this issue. I can understand his embarrassment, having called for bipartisanship, having called for us to listen to experts, having support of the establishment of the Energy Security Board, then when these independent experts, authorities in the field give an advice that doesn’t suit him politically, he wants to attack them personally. He wants to challenge their integrity. Yesterday, Mr Speaker, he was having a go at the integrity of the Energy Security Board. Muttering to himself, oh he was, I could hear him, muttering away to himself, talking to himself – that may well have been the case – you will get an attentive audience when he does that(!) What we have is the advice from the Energy Security Board that will deliver affordable and reliable power. What it does is ensure that the energy market operator will not have to be as she is every other weekend intervening in the South Australian energy market calling on expensive gas-fired generation to keep the lights on because there is not enough dispatchable power in the South Australian market. What this will do is ensure that we have reliable power, that is affordable power and that we meet our emissions reduction obligations under the Paris agreement. Bob Katter has stormed out of the chamber after he didn’t get to ask his whole question, because he ran out of time. Here is out it went down: Katter: Prime minister, electricity prices in Victoria, Queensland and South Australia in the 13 years, 1989 to 2002, rose from $650 to $780, $113 in 13 years. In 2002 all pricing was done by free open market operations and the industry privatised. In the next 13 years, the price skyrockets from $810 to $2,130. A $1,300 increase. Clearly, the prime minister ... The Speaker, Tony Smith: The member for Kennedy will resume his seat. We will take that as a 45-second statement. We will go to the member for Chisholm. Insert blow-up. While Katter yells that he is being “shut up” because the government doesn’t want to hear what he has to say, a comment which gets a round of applause from a gentleman in the public gallery which is not picked up by anyone else, Smith decides he has had enough. The member for Kennedy has been asked to resume his ... The member for Kennedy will resume his seat. There was no question. There was no question. The member for Kennedy will resume his seat. The member for Kennedy will not reflect on the chair. The member for Kennedy, unlike members of the opposition, has additional time to ask a question. Special rules have been put in place to allow 45 seconds. And they were put in place principally for him. And there was 45 seconds of quotes and statements without a question. This is question time and I’m not going to be lectured by the member for Kennedy. The member for Chisholm has the call. Katter tries to make a point of order, but he is ignored and then takes the parliamentary equivalent of picking up his bat and ball and walking home, by collecting his papers and storming out of the chamber. And that just made filing from inside the chamber worth it, despite the neck strain. Meanwhile, in the Senate: For context, that is over Brandis’s insistence on pronouncing Richard Di Natale’s name with his own special inflections. Malcom Turnbull returns to answer a Bill Shorten question on whether or not Kerry Schott, talking to Lateline overnight, was correct when she said: “I don’t think anybody can guarantee a price reduction.” This is taken as an attack on Schott. Because of course it is. Kerry Shott is one of our nation’s greatest public servants, energy experts, economists, mathematicians, and what she said on Lateline is absolutely correct and what honourable members opposite know is the case. The fact of the matter is this: As she said, and as we know,there are many impacts on a household’s electricity bill. Wholesale prices are one important factor. But there’s also the matter of the price of fuel, which is not affected by this policy. The price of gas. What did Labor do to gas? They sent the price through the roof. What have we done? We have brought the price of gas down by ensuring that Australians are protected and they get the gas they need. Another big factor, too, is the cost of networks. That is not affected by the energy guarantee, it is a separate issue. That is being attacked by the abolition of the limited merits review, now through the parliament. The reality is, as Rod Sims has said, as Kerry Schott has said, as we all know, except those in this parallel universe of ideology and political stupidity opposite, what we all know is that energy prices are affected by many measures. This national energy guarantee will deliver lower wholesale prices than any alternative and that’s what Australians need, reliability, affordability and responsibility. We have a plan. Labor’s just got one whine after another. Scott Morrison gets a dixer and, in his answer, appears surprised that the opposition, would, well, oppose something the government has put forward: Yesterday, we said yes to providing certainty for investment in boosting energy supply through the national energy guarantee that will make power more affordable, more reliable and achieve our environmental commitments. Business and industry have said yes to that, Mr Speaker. Economists have said yes to that, Mr Speaker. The chief scientist has said yes, Mr Speaker, to the national energy guarantee. What has Labor done again? Labor has said no. Labor have no plans for investment certainty, they only have a plan to say no, Mr Speaker, on every single occasion as this government works to drive investment that support jobs,that supports certainty, that support higher-paid jobs and that support a growing economy, Mr Speaker. What they do is they look for any excuse to say no, any and every excuse and they will sink to seeking to discredit and bully an Energy Security Board with people appointed by Labor state governments. And yet we have seen them in interview after interview seek to undermine those independently appointed members of that board, seeking to bully and intimidate like the unions they defend and protect for that behaviour in this place on every single day, Mr Speaker. The recipe from those opposite is higher taxes, higher subsidies, $66bn in higher costs for Australian business and consumers which ... Sadly, we run out of time before we get to hear what that recipe creates. It’s official– the government has decided on its three-word sell. Barnaby Joyce is his usual healthy shade of beetroot but Turnbull’s voice is already starting to fade. That’s the problem with the non-stop sell. Someone might need to pass him a Soother. The Labor backbench is not as rowdy as the Coalition, as yet. But it is only just warming up. Turnbull takes a dixer on energy and gets to use his smartest people in the room quote again. One would assume he includes Alan Finkel in that, given that he is the chief scientist. We move on to Mark Butler and the affordability aspect of the Neg: Last night when asked whether she would personally guarantee to the people of Australia that their energy bills will be cheaper in three years’ time under the prime minister’s latest energy policy, the chair of the Energy Security Board said: “I don’t think anybody can guarantee a price reduction.” When the chair of the government’s Energy Security Board can’t guarantee that energy prices will fall for households, why should the Australian people believe the prime minister’s so-called guarantee? Turnbull is REALLY feeling the Halloween spirit. First werewolves, now scary movies: One thing we can guarantee is that if you impose a $66bn subsidy on the Australian energy sector, and you get the taxpayers to pay for that, you can guarantee that electricity bills will be higher. If you continue to ignore the lead for dispatchable base-load power you will get more blackouts and then you will get more volatility. We know how this Labor horror movie goes. It’s been playing in South Australia for years. We know what it does. They have no conception of the engineering and the economics that we need to deliver a reliable and affordable energy plan. And as for Dr Shott, I can say to the Labor party, she can’t be intimidated. She is one of the finest public servants in this country. This is what she said, this is what she said: “The guarantee is about providing a reliable power system and meeting the emissions target set in the Paris agreement.” What will happen when those mechanisms are put in price is prices are likely to come down and they are likely to keep coming down. That is exactly the same advice that we received in the letter from the Energy Security Board. The experts that we have been called on to listen to and take advice from. The lols are coming early this question time. Bill Shorten opens with a question on the Coalition’s “latest energy policy” but can’t get it all the way out, because Josh Frydenberg is laughing harder than a middle-aged man watching Monty Python. Malcolm Turnbull, obviously feeling the Halloween spirit, gets a little supernatural with his answer. Earlier today the leader of the opposition stood in front of some solar panels. And for a little while he was talking sense and then a beam of sunlight struck the panel and he was transformed, not into a werewolf but an economic fantasist. This is what he said. Renewable energy is getting cheaper – he did. He said it’s correct to say we have been moving down the renewable energy path and we are seeing the benefits and he said it needs to be subsidised! Now, Mr Speaker, this is the bit that we are struggling to understand. Mr Speaker, his comrade in arms, his comrade in arms was of course the member for Sydney. She said, she’s even more emphatic, she said the renewables are becoming cheaper all the time and are already cheaper than coal. Kieran Gilbert [from Sky] was not asking an unreasonable question when he said, “So why subsidise them?” She said, “It is not about subsidies, it is about certainty.” This is the Labor party. It is about certainty. $66bn of cost loaded on to Australian families and Australian businesses in order to subsidise technologies that are already the cheapest alternative, according to the Labor party. Question time is almost upon us. Taking a look at the morning’s events, energy will once again be the name of the game. But with the telecommunication ombudsman report, the NBN will most likely get a go as well. I’m going to try to report on QT from the chamber, so wish me luck. If there are tech problems, you can bet I will be getting my running shoes on for you. You’ll find the amendments Gareth Hutchens had mentioned on the citizenship bill here. People are reacting very seriously to the allegations Andrew Wilkie raised in parliament this morning. It looks as though Peter Dutton’s controversial citizenship bill will be struck from the Senate notice paper this evening. Last month the Senate voted to give Dutton until today to bring his bill on for debate in the Senate because they were tired of him telling voters how crucial his bill was while simultaneously withholding it from the Senate so it couldn’t be debated. His office has reached out to key members of the Nick Xenophon Team in the past few days to talk about making amendments to the bill but it all seems too late. It was the NXT that derailed Dutton’s attempt last month to enact his citizenship laws, saying they could not support the bill package in its current form. It meant the government would have to either dump the package completely, or make substantial changes, to get the bill through parliament. In yesterday’s Coalition party-room meeting, Dutton told his colleagues that he would amend the citizenship package. Guardian Australia has been told his office has been talking about reducing the English language test from level six (university standard) to level five, and to amend the retrospective elements of the bill that have caused consternation. But those amendments would still not be enough to persuade the NXT to come onboard. The NXT has previously said the bill is “fundamentally flawed” and needs considerable redrafting. One of their major complaints is that Dutton wants to give himself – and subsequent immigration ministers – the power to overrule decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on citizenship matters. That aspect of the bill does not appear to have been part of recent discussions about amendments. The Greens have not been contacted by Dutton’s office in the last week. They expect the bill will be struck from the Senate notice paper this evening. Christian Porter is defending the government’s planned welfare reforms. You may remember from earlier this morning (which already seems a lifetime ago) the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, slammed the proposed welfare drug testing trial and said it was stigmatising social security recipients. If the real goal is to reduce the use of illegal drugs, why start with the poorest members of society? Will there also be a policy designed to drug test and crack down on the well-to-do who spend far more on drugs, and receive all sorts of tax deductions, social security payments and other government benefits? Or is it only the poorest whose drug use the government feels it should punish through social security-based measures? Porter told Sky the measures should be given a chance. We’ve got 100,000 people who don’t do the right thing in the system, overwhelming two-thirds of people either don’t miss any appointments over six months, or they miss one, and they tend to move off the payment very quickly, but what we have identified is the present complexities and slackness of the compliance system means we have 100,000 people who routinely miss important things like job interviews, and they get stuck on the payment. So it is a very complicated, long and important piece of legislation. I am very confident that almost all of it will go through the Senate. Obviously the contentious issue is testing drugs in welfare recipients and to mandate treatment and it is no secret that there has been some opposition to that ... I think government should be able to try things new things in the welfare space by virtue of the fact that a lot of the old approaches simply don’t work. Over at the Press Club and Brendan O’Connor is addressing the impact of the gig economy on industrial relations and how Labor plans on dealing with it: Federal Labor is examining exactly what we should be doing for people who are selling their labour on particular digital platforms. Recently, we have had Airtasker negotiate with unions in New South Wales a better deal for people who are using Airtasker to find work. Labor hasn’t settled on exactly what we need to do but we will apply the values that we apply to our public policy generally. We should embrace technology but we have to ensure it is not used to obviate obligations under particular laws, to undermine people’s rights and that includes industrial rights. We have a long way to go. Not only in this country. I think globally a long way to go to tackle the complexity of what is happening with the use of technology, exemplified by Uber. We will have more to say about that before the election but it is a complex area of law and I am examining other jurisdictions as to how they are approaching it. Didn’t vote? You’re one of 1 million enrolled Australians who didn’t take up their democratic right and legal obligation in the same-sex marriage postal survey. AAP reports the Australian Electoral Commission’s latest annual report found a 46% increase since the 2013 election in people not voting, with the lowest turn out, 91%, since compulsory voting began in 1925. Julie Bishop has confirmed Australian forces have played a role in the recapture of Raqqa, which served as the Islamic State capital for some time. AAP reports Bishop confirmed the Royal Australian Airforce provided support as part of the international coalition, but added there were complexities: The Syrian city of Raqqa and at least 90% of territory held by Isis in Iraq has been taken back by coalition forces. About 80 Australians fighting for Isis in Iraq and Syria have been killed in the conflict and the government continues to track the movements of another 110 believed to be in the field.But as Isis forces flee south, entrenched conflicts between Iraqi and Kurdish forces have been reignited in Kirkuk and Sinjar. This is deeply troubling and it’s an example of the layers of complexity in Syria and Iraq. Bishop said Australia remained focused on defeating IS, raising concerns it would “reappear with substance in other parts of the world including in the Philippines”. Scott Morrison took the Turnbull government’s message to Queensland, telling the ABC Brisbane audience the state’s Labor government’s 50% renewables target was “nuts”. That should definitely help bring Queensland on board at Coag. He also explained exactly what the Neg was designed to do. It works like this. You walk into the shopfront of a retailer – put it in that context – Origin, AGL, whoever it might happen to be. What they have to do, they have to buy energy from the system from all the producers, the wholesalers and others – which a) delivers on a reliability standard which is set by the Energy Market Operator and provides a portfolio of energy that meets the emissions reduction target. So, when you’re buying your energy, you know you’re getting a product which meets both reliability and meets Australia’s environmental obligations. So, this actually does deliver on the trifecta of affordability, of reliability and environmental obligations. So you get rid of the subsidies out of the system – and the reason you can do that is they’re no longer necessary, the price of renewables has come down, they can now compete on their own two feet as they should. So the energy retailers will find that the cheapest way of getting that energy package together to provide to you the customer. Over at the National Press Club, Brendan O’Connor is giving a speech on workplace relations. Here’s his opening: We cannot tackle inequality or build a future of inclusive prosperity unless Australia has a workplace relations system that is both productive and fair. We have to both address the challenges in the labour market that exist now and prepare for what is coming. Essential to that task is striking the right balance of power between workers and employers. The tilt of bargaining power away from workers and to employers has gone too far. Too many of our fellow Australians can no longer see the link between hard work and fair reward. Inequality is at a 75-year high. Wage growth is flat lining. Work is too often hard to find, and insecure. For too many low and middle-income earners, access to education and training is limited. Workers don’t believe they have the power any more to negotiate a better deal at work. And many are deeply anxious about what the future will bring. The consequences for our society and our economy are profoundly negative. Another question time strategy hint from Labor, with Mark Butler discussing the chief scientist. I think Alan Finkel should be congratulated with his work over the last months, taking advice from experts overseas and through process developed a comprehensive plan. Malcolm Turnbull has turned his back on that plan. Yes, at the end of the day, Alan Finkel said there needs to be an orderly mechanism to combine climate and energy policy and he then said the clean energy target was the best mechanism. He said it was the mechanism that would deliver the best outcome for households on power prices and Josh Frydenberg reflected that when he did his presentation to the Coalition party room. He [had] a slide that said the clean energy target will lower prices. Malcolm Turnbull reflected that. The problem for us all is that Tony Abbott vetoed it and again Malcolm Turnbull ended up capitulating to Tony Abbott. As a reminder, here is what Finkel said yesterday, when asked about the clean energy target, where he concluded there was more than one way to “skin a cat”: The clean energy target is not a headline item. It is bullet point number two of three bullet points. It is not even introduced as a clean energy target, it is introduced as the need for a credible mechanism and there are multiple ways of achieving a credible mechanism. As promised ... Also undetected yesterday because of the focus on energy, Peter Dutton told party room colleagues he would amend the citizenship package. This is not high court citizenship issue but the becoming an Australian issue. He said the government would reduce the English test from level six (university standard) to level five. But this won’t be enough to secure a crossbench breakthrough. The NXT says it will need more than this concession to reverse its opposition to the controversial overhaul. Stay tuned: we are hearing there is movement on the citizenship reforms after all. We shall have those details with you as soon as we can. We are moving quickly today, so please stay with me while I try and keep up. The communications minister, Mitch Fifield, is moving forward on the ABC reforms he promised to One Nation as part of the deal for their support on the media reforms. I’ll let Fifield explain what is going on. After all, I would hate to be accused of not being fair or balanced while reporting facts. From his statement: The Turnbull government will today introduce legislative reforms to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Act to enhance the ABC’s commitment to rural and regional Australia and require its news services to be fair and balanced. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment (Rural and Regional Measures) Bill 2017 will implement reforms championed by Senator Bridget McKenzie to enshrine a formal commitment to rural and regional Australia in the ABC’s charter. The bill also requires the ABC to consult on changes affecting rural and regional audiences, through the establishment of a regional advisory council. The bill will also require there be at least two members of the ABC board with a substantial connection to, or substantial experience in, a regional area through business, industry or community involvement. The government would already satisfy this obligation through its appointments to date. The bill also introduces greater transparency by requiring a number of additional particulars to be included in its Annual Report. These amendments will ensure the ABC has an even greater focus on, and regard for, the needs of rural and regional communities. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment (Fair and Balanced) Bill 2017 will require news and information to be ‘fair’ and ‘balanced’, in addition to the already legislated requirement to be ‘accurate and impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism’. The bill seeks to legislate what the ABC already expects of itself. The ABC’s own editorial policies already cover ‘fair treatment’, as well as requiring ‘a balance that follows the weight of evidence’. And the MEAA’s journalistic code of ethics refers to ‘fairness’ no less than six times. The amendments will cement the standards expected by Australian taxpayers. Turning my Eye of Sauron outside the Canberra bubble for just a moment (I know, I know, I should get out more) the former Greens leader Bob Brown has had a win in the high court. Here is a bit from Michael Slezak’s report, which you’ll find here: The former Australian Greens leader Bob Brown has won a landmark high court fight against Tasmanian anti-protest laws passed in 2014 and under which he was charged in 2016. Brown, the third person arrested under the Workplaces (Protection from Protesters) Act 2014, argued the laws directly targeted implied freedom of political expression in the constitution and were therefore unconstitutional. The landmark case stemmed from Brown’s arrest while filming a video about an anti-logging protest at Lapoinya state forest in Tasmania’s north-west in January 2016. Meanwhile Julie Bishop has announced a new consul general to Istanbul, Jeffie Kaine. The Australian consulate general in Istanbul plays a significant role in fostering trade and investment between Turkey and Australia. Istanbul is the business and finance capital of Turkey. It generates almost one quarter of Turkey’s GDP and accommodates one fifth of Turkey’s population of almost 80 million. Istanbul is a popular destination for Australian travellers and a gateway to the Gallipoli peninsula. Our enduring relationship with Turkey is grounded in our shared experience at the Gallipoli battles of World War I and covers a broad range of areas including Anzac commemorations, cooperation on counter-terrorism and participation in the MIKTA (Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey and Australia) forum. Australia and Turkey enjoy close people-to-people links, with some 67,000 Australians claiming Turkish ancestry. Our economic relationship continues to strengthen, with two-way trade growing by 14.6% in 2015–16 and totalling almost $1.5bn. Ms Kaine is a career officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. She was most recently director, head of mission/senior executive service section. In Canberra, she has held a range of positions, including in the Iraq taskforce and staffing branch. She has served previously overseas in the Australian permanent mission to the United Nations in Geneva and the Australian embassy in Jakarta. While we’ve all been focused on energy (or perhaps that’s just me), trouble has broken out inside the government on another front. This fight is over plans to regulate the salary and appointment of banking executives, which is one of the things the government is doing to hold off calls for a royal commission into the banks. The veteran Liberal MP Russell Broadbent kicked up a stink about this package in the Coalition party room meeting yesterday, and is reserving his rights, which means he might cross the floor to vote against the change. Broadbent has told me governments should not be regulating the internal affairs of businesses. He says that’s like Labor’s plans for bank nationalisation in the 1940s. “This is totally at odds with what the Liberal and national parties stand for,” Broadbent said. “I think Ben Chifley tried something like this in 1947.” He says he is not “sticking up for the banks” but for a point of principle. All pretty interesting. We’ll keep an eye on development. Andrew Wilkie is speaking more about the allegations he has tabled in the parliament this morning, regarding Crown casino. He won’t go further into the allegations during the press conference because parliamentary privilege does not extend to the Senate courtyard and press conferences. But Wilkie, a whistleblower himself, says he is also not going to do anything which could identify the group which have come forward to him. He’s calling for a parliamentary inquiry into the allegations and wants the Victorian government and the federal government to investigate what has gone on. I’m not going to talk to the specific allegations: You know where to find them in the Hansard record if you’re interested in seeing them. What I will say is that the three whistleblowers who have approached me, I’ve met them – I’ve confirmed their identity, and I think that the allegations have enough weight to them that we should take them seriously, and they should be investigated. It’s now up to the federal government and the Victorian state government to take strong and immediate action. The federal government because some of the allegations would involve breaches of federal law, and obviously the Victorian government because the allegations, if true, would indicate breaches of Victorian law. So, I’m now looking to the prime minister and to the premier to find out what they’re going to do about these very serious allegations. Clearly there needs to be some sort of inquiry by the relevant law enforcement and regulatory agencies and I’m also looking to the parliament to form some sort of parliamentary inquiry into these allegations, and perhaps more broadly than just Crown casino, just to be able to reassure ourselves that if these allegations are true, that at least they’re limited to Crown seen know, but we will wait and see. Now, I’ve have seen the footage that I have tabled today of the three whistleblowers, you will see that some considerable trouble has been taken to hide their identity. And that’s fair enough because these are three men who are making very serious allegations. It is a very risky thing that they’ve decided to do, to become whistleblowers. It is not an easy road, whistleblowing in this country, but I can reassure the media, that although their identity is concealed, that I have confirmed their identity and although I cannot make any comment about the accuracy or not of their allegations, I do know that these are three people who we should listen to, and we should take their allegations very serious. Meanwhile you can play our own interactive pokie machine to find out just how addictive they are: Back to the politics. Bill Shorten is at the Mt Majura solar farm , with about half the Labor shadow cabinet (that may be a slight exaggeration, but with Mark Butler, Chris Bown and Andrew Leigh, joining him, it’s quite crowded) Labor is still examining the policy, but they are certainly no fans of the process. From Chris Bowen: What we saw yesterday was Turnbull energy policy 72.0. The latest attempt, as they go from crisis to crisis with an energy policy. Just a few weeks ago we were told by the prime minister a clean energy target “would certainly work” Josh Frydenberg told us it would reduce electricity prices. A few weeks before that just in the last session, we were told that the answer to Australia’s energy needs was to keep the Liddell power station open, the coal-fired power station, words that don’t utter their lips anymore. T The prime minister says it is about engineering and, but it’s about party politics. What is particularly concerning is the lack of modelling which goes with this policy. I’ve seen more thorough modelling in a high school economics essay than the government has been able to produce this far. Particularly scary is the fact that the treasurer said this morning the Labor party has all the information that the government has. Well, I tell you what, that means the government has no information, no modelling at their disposal. This is not the fault of the Energy Security Board. They have been given an unrealistic timetable and unrealistic task by the government, again which has been driven by the rival factional and liberal politics of the party room, not by good policy. The Labor party has been offering bipartisan support to the government for months for a proper energy policy, but we are all of a sudden expected to think that this latest thought bubble from the government which we were told last week they had a different plan, the week before that a different plan and all of a sudden this is the one that the Labor party should automatically back without the modelling and research. The Labor party will continue to be the adults in the room in this conversation. We will continue to offer support for good policy, but policy which is supported by the evidence and the facts, and the fact that this government has put this policy together with strings and Band-Aids, with no modelling, no thorough analysis, as has been confirmed by the energy board themselves, that they have to now go to do the work, well, let’s see that work, and if they publish it all for all to see, clearly. The government is still hoping for bipartisan support, to help give business and industry some certainty that the policy would survive beyond the next few minutes. It would also help bring the Labor states on board, which would be the easiest way for the government to get this all happening. But it probably didn’t help that Scott Morrison was demanding Labor support the policy almost immediately yesterday, before anyone had even had a look at the policy. It seems that whatever political goodwill there was regarding this, is evaporating quite rapidly. If you missed it here’s Peter Lewis on the energy policy shambles. Before the politics gets in the way again, here’s a bit of what Malcolm Turnbull told our Invictus Games team: It’s good to see so many of you again. Last time we met we were in Sydney with Prince Harry and you’ve been hanging out with him at the Invictus Games where you’ve been so successful. It’s great to see you again Gary. You kept Julie Bishop – Julie Bishop is here – you were part of our close personal protection team in Afghanistan years ago, not long before you suffered your injuries in the Black Hawk crash. And you kept us safe. You put your life on the line with your comrades to keep us safe there as you all do and have done every day. We live in a dangerous world. There are many people that seek to do us harm and we know that the freedoms we exercise in this parliament are due to you and those like you who have carried out with that Anzac spirit the defence of our nation for generations. We’re surrounded by parliamentarians, the servicemen and women of tomorrow, all of these young people – their freedoms, their future depends on the sacrifices you have made and so many other brave Australians will make in the years to come. You’re an inspiration. We thank you for what you’ve done. And Bill Shorten: I want you to know, just as the prime minister has said, on behalf of all Australians – that by returning from adversity, by returning from places which many Australians will never have to go, coming through that storm, that difficulty and that uncertainty – coming through the other side – you served your country again, by your inspiration. You are proof of the human spirit’s boundless resilience. I want you to know how many people you give hope to by your effort. They mightn’t always get the chance to tell you, but trust me, you give a lot of people, a lot of hope. And you are also a reminder of the duty that we owe all of those who’ve served, the duty to support the men and women of the ADF and their families. Looking around this room, you can almost feel and see the pride that your families have in you. You should know that every Australian wishes they could be here, telling you how proud they are of you. You represent: the purest expression of sport, the noblest example of mateship, the very best of Australia. Wilkie has released a statement ahead of his press conference: Today very serious allegations have been levelled at the poker machine industry. Although the allegations focus on Crown in Melbourne, they could also suggest a broader pattern of behaviour in the poker machine industry, which would obviously have grave implications for people right around Australia, including in my electorate of Denison. These allegations are obviously very serious. If members and senators, law enforcement and regulatory agencies, and the media, scrutinise the video record of the whistleblowers’ testimony, I’m sure they’ll agree that the claims warrant an immediate and strong response. I call on the federal and Victorian governments to ensure the allegations are investigated thoroughly. The truth will not be uncovered without a parliamentary inquiry, as well as investigations by law enforcement and regulatory agencies. Andrew Wilkie has set off a small explosion in the House, tabling allegations from whistleblowers and using parliamentary privilege to allege “illegal machine tampering” at Victoria’s Crown casino, and worse. We’ll bring you more on that as soon as we can. But here is a little of what he said in parliament this morning. Although the allegations focus on Crown in Melbourne, they also suggest a broader pattern of misbehaviour in the poker machine industry and that obviously has grave implications for people right around Australia, including in my electorate in Denison. For example the whistleblowers allege illegal machine tampering, including the disabling of the lower debt options and the modifying of buttons to allow prohibited autoplay. Both of which increase ... losses. There’s software manipulating to increase gambler losses even further, in particular on weekends when the number of naive first time and casual users is obviously greater. I am horrified to recount that the Victorian commission for gaming and liquor regulation has allegedly done nothing to stop this shocking criminal misconduct. Indeed, according to the whistleblowers, in some cases the commission is clearly complicit in covering it up. Regrettably, the alleged misconduct at Crown is not limited to poker machines. Indeed, the whistleblowers also allege the casino avoids Austrack scrutiny of individuals involved in transactions over $10,000 by sometimes tolerating and even encouraging the misuse of identity documents. If these allegations are true, then Crown would be facilitating money laundering for any number of nefarious reasons for tax fraud, drug running and even terrorism. Wilkie is due to speak on this more in a press conference very soon. My, my, my Malcolm Turnbull has been a busy man today. He has just “gatecrashed” the Polished Man event staged by Josh Frydenberg and Fisher MP Andrew Wallace. Wallace could give Taylor Swift lessons in “surprise face”. “The Polished Man campaign aims to raise awareness about ending violence against children,” he said. “Men are encouraged to paint a fingernail to help start the conversation and show their support. “We all have all of us, have a vested interest and a duty to look after all of our children and ensure there is no violence against children, no violence against women, and I think the Polished Man initiative is [great].” For those wondering, Turnbull went with a Liberal blue for his nail. Back to the NBN, which is emerging as one of the bigger sleeper issues and is set to get bigger as more and more people are connected. The communications minister, Mitch Fifield, has responded to the latest complaint figures: The TIO report shows that overall complaints about the NBN represent just 1% of the 2.4 million users connected to the NBN. (27,000 complaints out of 2.4 million connected NBN users at June 30, 2017) The rise in complaints remains broadly in line with the rate of the NBN rollout. (121% increase in premises connected to the NBN, compared to a 159% increase in complaints). The #1 source of industry complaints overall was customer services issues, which has nothing to do with the rollout of the NBN. The #2 source of industry complaints was billing and payment issues, which has nothing to do with the rollout of the NBN. The #1 NBN-related complaint was in relation to connection delays, which demonstrates Australians want to connect to the NBN as quickly as possible. The government is working closely with NBN Co and retailers to ensure the processes for switching to the network are meeting consumers’ needs. Australia’s Invictus Games team has been honoured at a reception at Parliament House, which allowed for a bit of human interaction between Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten. Meanwhile, Chris Bowen said Labor would be “the adults in the room” (although the room at this stage is looking like an adult daycare) when it came to energy policy. Well what’s very clear is that the government is scrambling. We have policy on the run, we have an energy policy being put together with strings and Band-Aids. What is very clear and has been publicly confirmed by the Energy Security Board is that this policy that is being put together by the government has no modelling, we have no guarantees as has been made clear, and that this is being cobbled together in a desperate attempt to stop the Liberal party room going into meltdown and so that we can have an attempt, the latest attempt, at energy policy in Australia. Now this is a government which has believed in an emissions intensity scheme and then didn’t, within days. It is a government which told us the clean energy target would “undoubtedly work” and that it would put downward pressure on prices and reduce energy prices, and yesterday scrapped it. Now, all of a sudden, everybody is meant to automatically and suddenly agree that the government has got it right this time, on their 72nd approach – their 72nd attempt at energy policy in Australia. We have no modelling. The energy board has confirmed that all they have is analysis of similar policies and that now they will proceed to do modelling, after the announcement. Bill Shorten and Mark Butler have plans for a press conference at a solar farm today, so you can see where Labor is taking this debate. Meanwhile, the prime minister is maintaining his (slightly annoyed) line to anyone who would question the national energy guarantee. From his doorstop press conference this morning: Turnbull: Look the Coag set up the Energy Security Board. You know, this is its creation. There were more Labor governments involved with appointing these experts than there were Liberal ones, or Liberal-National ones. Coag has asked them for their advice on this very issue and they will obviously get the same advice. And so my message to the Labor premiers is: put the politics aside for a moment, put it aside for quite a while in fact, let’s focus on Australian families, let’s focus on delivering a genuinely bipartisan energy policy. It will be enduing, it’s based on engineering and economics and that will deliver affordable power, reliable power and meet our international commitments. Journalist: Prime minister, the ESB has talked about the modelling and the prices. Will you release it? Turnbull: Of course, well, the ESB – I can answer that very simply. We’ve asked them to do more modelling on this and when it’s done it will be released and it will be part of the Coag considerations, for sure. Journalist: Will the commonwealth go it alone if the states don’t agree? Turnbull: Look, I’m not going to speculate on that type of scenario. I am confident that common sense will prevail. I mean, Australians are fed up with all of the political partisanship. That’s why we went to Energy Security Board and we asked them to consider how we ensure we achieve this affordable, reliable and responsible outcome. I mean it’s a triple bottom line. You want to have a market that is as flexible and competitive as possible but you’ve got to ensure that it’s the lowest possible cost, that energy is reliable. Labor’s regional communications spokesman, Stephen Jones, has also had a swipe at the NBN rollout, in the wake of the latest telecommunications ombudsman complaint report. Well it’s not OK. The people of Australia, the small businesses of Australia, are fed up with the government. The brags about its NBN project seems deaf to the complaints about what’s really going on. Missed appointments, connections that don’t work, services that don’t work. People are paying for a service that they simply aren’t getting and, when they try and raise a complaint, then they get the NBN ping-pong. They get bounced between the phone companies and the NBN – nobody taking responsibility. Paul Karp has a bit more on the Newspoll results on the marriage equality postal survey and what it all means: On Tuesday the Labor caucus resolved to push for Liberal senator Dean Smith’s private member’s bill to be used to legislate marriage equality as soon as possible if the yes vote wins. The move clears the way for Labor to push a bill through the Senate as early as the week of 15 November, when the Australian Bureau of Statistics announces the result, although the opposition claims it is not pre-empting the result. John Howard has seized on Labor’s decision, telling the Australian it is an “added reason” to vote no because further exemptions to discrimination law to protect what he called religious freedom are unlikely. Just on Senate business, for those playing along at home, you may notice Peter Dutton’s citizenship reforms are well down the list. That’s a pretty big indication the Senate won’t be getting to them today, before the scheduled close of business just after 7pm. Which usually wouldn’t be a problem, except the pesky Greens, along with Labor, have passed a motion that gave the bill a deadline of close of business today, to be debated or struck from the paper. With the Nick Xenophon Team holding firm against the changes, telling the government to go back to the drawing board, it doesn’t look like Dutton’s changes will become reality anytime soon. The bells are ringing, signalling parliament is about to officially begin for the day. The House schedule can be found here. While the Senate one can be found here. Looking outside of energy for a moment, the Senate has the government’s welfare reforms listed for debate today – they would be the ones that introduce the drug-testing trials. It is safe to say that the current UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Prof Philip Alston, is not a fan of the policy. The Australian government is conflating social protection and drug enforcement policies in a way that is counter-productive, unless the main goal is to stigmatise social security recipients. If the real goal is to reduce the use of illegal drugs, why start with the poorest members of society? Will there also be a policy designed to drug test and crack down on the well-to-do who spend far more on drugs, and receive all sorts of tax deductions, social security payments and other government benefits? Or is it only the poorest whose drug use the government feels it should punish through social security-based measures? Paul Karp will have a full report on that for you, soon. As predicted, Labor has honed in on the “affordability” aspect of the national energy guarantee. Tanya Plibersek told Sky Labor would take a look at the policy but added: What kind of government proposes something as big and serious as this without doing any modelling and without doing a regulatory impact statement? I think it is a shambles and it is driven by their internal problems. I think they wanted to announce this much later this year but Tony Abbott has put pressure on them with his outbursts in public and so they’ve gone too soon without any modelling or regulatory impact statement. Same Dastyari meanwhile took the opportunity to launch his latest Senate doors (where the media waits to question arriving politicians) stunt, showing up with some melted soft serve and cheeseburgers. “These are soft-serve savings,” he said. “You think it is a good idea at the start. It goes flaccid quickly and afterwards you wonder what all the fuss is about.” Has anyone looked up defensive in the dictionary lately? Here is a snippet of the AM interview between Sabra Lane and Malcolm Turnbull this morning. Lane: You are guaranteeing that they are the best informed but you are still not guaranteeing those figures. Turnbull: Sabra, what I am guaranteeing is that we are taking advice from the best people in the field and that is unquestionably the Energy Security Board. Coag, the Labor premiers ... Lane: We will get to a board in just a tick. Turnbull: No, no, Lane: I’m sorry ... prime minister ... Turnbull: What are you apologising for? Lane: I am sorry to interrupt you. The Coalition has made affordability an issue. Turnbull: Yes. Lane: There is no modelling to back the figures up. Turnbull: They come from the Energy Security Board. Lane: The board is made up of the regulator and the commission bodies that oversaw the last 10 years of disastrous policy in this country. Turnbull: There is nobody better qualified to talk about the way the market operates and how we can best ensure reliability. The energy market operator is headed by Audrey Zibelman, who did a similar job in New York before she came out to Australia. She is, as she said yesterday, regularly intervening in the South Australian market to keep the lights on because of the failure of politics in South Australia and the introduction of a massive amount of wind energy in that state without the back-up or the security to ensure system reliability. So, Sabra, you can, if you wish, disrespect these distinguished and expert Australians. I don’t. I’m taking their advice and I just want to remind you that that Energy Security Board was established by Coag. There were more Labor party governments supporting the establishment of the Energy Security Board and they will give the same advice to the Coag governments as they have given to us. All I’m saying, my only request, is that their advice is considered very carefully and respectfully and, I mean, I was surprised to hear your attack on those distinguished Australians. I think you should – I think we owe them the respect that their credibility and expertise deserves. You know what we really owe is a duty to your listeners to get their power bills down and that’s why we’re taking the right advice. We are going to establish a level playing field so that technologies can compete because we owe it to Australians to take the politics and the name calling and the disrespect out of this debate, focus on the engineering and the economics. That’s what the Energy Security Board has done and that is the duty I owe to your listeners and all Australians. Side note – so far, well, at least as far as I can tell, government ministers have avoided calling it the Neg. It’s “the policy” or “what we are doing”. Take from that what you will. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, has also been sent out on the front lines and he’s been just as defensive as you would expect. Asked about the saving figures, which work out, best-case scenario, to about $2 a week (sometime between 2020-2030) he told the ABC the Neg needed to be considered with all the other changes the government has made. “This is not the only thing the government is doing. This increases certainty. In addition to that, we’ve got the initiatives on gas, to secure gas for Australian domestic demand, the work we’ve done with the retailers, the work we’ve done on reforming the regulation. All of this means people are getting discounts now that they wouldn’t have got a year ago, two years ago because of the work the government is doing. On top of that, always a relative choice. People will always pick what the Labor party is saying which has a 45% emissions reduction target and which would require $66bn worth of subsidies that you don’t need to pay to meet our environmental obligations that we’ve set out at 26% ... There is a great light that has been shone on this. Australians have a clear choice: they can pay more for electricity under Bill Shorten or they can have lower prices under Malcolm Turnbull and the investment certainty that goes with it, that meets the environmental obligations. It’s a clear choice. To a sleeper issue now, but one which is annoying a lot *buffering* of, of, of *buffering* people. The telecommunications industry ombudsman has released the latest complaint figures for 2016-17, which Labor’s communications spokeswoman, Michelle Rowland, described as a “damming indictment” of the government’s roll out of the NBN. “The TIO reports that NBN complaints in 2016-17 surged by 159% when compared to the previous period,” she said in a statement. “Of significant concern, NBN complaints are growing 37% faster than the number of new NBN services being activated – a pattern not observed in any of the previous years. “And, for the first time, internet services are the highest source of complaints to the TIO.” Malcolm Turnbull is one of the staunchest defenders of the program, having overseen it while communications minister. He has repeatedly said that, given the scale of the roll out (it reached 6 million premises in August), there are going to be some bumps but he is watching it. Here is what he told Today: Just a fact of life, it is a bit like television. If you’ve got hardly any viewers, you won’t get a lot of complaints. With NBN, what we have now got, it is true. What we have now got is about 3 million people are actively connected on to the network. We are connecting more people every 10 days than Labor did in six years. So you get a lot more customers, they are rolling on and around 30,000, 40,000 a week. Clearly you are going to get more complaints but you know what? We aim to have 100% satisfaction. Can’t be achieved, I know that, but the goal is to ensure that the installation experience is a good one and obviously that people are satisfied with the service when they get it. The prime minister is also facing residual questions over Tony Abbott’s reluctance to accept the policy. Here was his response to that on Sunrise: We didn’t adopt the clean energy target. If we wanted to, we would have. We had reservations about it and what we have now is a recommendation from the energy security board which consists of the leaders of our energy market regulators and operators, the smartest people in the room, these other experts that everyone is telling us to listen to, this is where you find the engineering and the economics that is the guide to my government’s energy policy. The day of slogans, ideology and politics, we should put it behind us ... Industry has recognised on a truly rational and objective approach, a level playing field backed by engineering and economics. Malcolm Turnbull is talking to Sabra Lane on ABC and is getting very defensive over the average saving figure and whether the government can guarantee it. The short version is, it can’t. But he has turned any questioning of that figure into an attack on the experts on the energy security board. That started yesterday, when Turnbull attacked Bill Shorten for “disrespecting” those on the board, when the figure was queried. All we have here is a calculation from the ESB. It has promised to do more modelling before Coag but, at the moment, the government can only point to a few lines. It says that should be enough. But given the amount of attention the government has focused on the affordability aspect during the power wars, it is not something that is going to go away anytime soon. The energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, has attacked the states for expressing criticism of the national energy guarantee. “It’s bizarre for them to be openly critical when they don’t have the detail,” he told Radio National. Frydenberg cited endorsements of the Neg from the Grattan Institute, AGL, Energy Australia, the Australian Industry Group and BlueScope. Asked if the Neg essentially sets an emissions intensity baseline that in effect mandates renewable energy, Frydenberg said renewables “will be absolutely critical” and electricity generators will need “a mix of assets”, including thermal generation and renewables. “The question is: what is the lowest cost to the consumer? With technology costs coming down quite dramatically the ability to back-end [emissions reduction] is there. [The Paris agreement target] is very important to meet.” Frydenberg noted that electricity suppliers can use “the existing contract market to source the right amount of generation” to meet the twin objectives of emissions reduction and reliability. The Neg is alive and the government has embarked on a sell that could teach Hollywood studio bosses a thing or two. The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, was up before the sun hitting the airwaves with his brief of “affordability, reliability and responsibility”, the message having been slightly tweaked overnight to acknowledge the environment. Malcolm Turnbull has also been beaming across commercial TV screens on the big sell but, having convinced the party room (with a few notable exceptions, Tony Abbott included), it is on to the states. The government wants Coag to agree to this but the Labor-led states may be a problem. Speaking to Sunrise, Turnbull said this is what the states wanted, so they should get with the program. What I am saying to everyone and to the premiers who sit around the table at our meetings; you appointed the energy security board. You appointed them as they are smart and you wanted that advice. They have given us the advice, why don’t we listen to it and follow it? Why don’t we listen to the experts we asked for advice knowing that this will mean energy is more affordable, more reliable and we will still be able to meet emission reduction commitments under the Paris treaty? Meanwhile, Frydenberg told Sky that he reached out to Abbott, who he called a “conscientious objector” on this issue, before the party room to explain the policy to him: I did ring him before party room and was upfront about [what the policy can do] and asked him to keep an open mind. Labor also looks like having had a Bex and a lie down after being hit with the Coalition policy yesterday and is crafting its response. Expect it to look at the saving aspects – the $110-$115 figure is only an average, which won’t start until 2020, and there is no guarantee to those figures. Just advice the government has been given by the energy security board but, so far, the government can’t show the modelling that points to it. Or guarantee when those savings will kick in. Turnbull is being very cagey on that point and this morning has taken any questioning or scepticism over the figures as “disrespecting” the experts. So that’s going well. In other news, the latest Newspoll shows the yes vote has a commanding lead among people who have already voted in the marriage law postal survey, leading 59% to 38%. So strap in and get ready for round #3478 in the energy battles. Mike Bowers is prowling the hallways, so follow him at @mpbowers or me at @amyremeikis and have a chat in the comments. I’ll look through them as the day goes on.

Two events under the title No Grey Area will be held on Saturday 28 October 2017. One of the events will be an industry-wide session on how to stamp out sexual harassment in theatre. The other will be an event curated by the theatre’s associate director Lucy Morrison, where people who wish to have their stories heard can have a space for them to be told. Last year, the Royal Court held a company-wide meeting on sexual harassment in the theatre which resulted in a mutually agreed verbal code of conduct. The theatre’s artistic director Vicky Featherstone said the aim was to “eliminate the so-called grey areas that so often allow people to get away with abuses of power”. The lessons from the code would be shared during the industry wide meeting. At the sharing event, members of the theatre will read stories submitted through an open call on the Royal Court website. There will also be an opportunity for people to take part in the reading of the gathered accounts on the day. No Grey Area was initiated by Featherstone, who tweeted last week that British theatre must speak out as Hollywood has done, and asked for suggestions from followers on what could be done. “Following last week’s revelations concerning Harvey Weinstein it is time to confront the abuses of power that have been occurring in our own industry for years,” Featherstone said. Regarding her call-out for suggestions on Twitter, she said she was overwhelmed by the “open and candid response” from the many people who got in touch and shared their stories. She said: “What shocked me most was how many of those who approached me were fearful they’d be named and also of the significant negative implications speaking out could have for them. Despite those fears they wanted to have their voices heard to prevent such abuses happening to those coming after them.” She said that sexual harassment is systemic and predominately carried out by those in power to people in positions junior to them. “It is across every part of our society,” she said. “If it is not dealt with in an open way we have no hope of change, and change must happen.” She also quoted Erica Whyman, deputy artistic director at the Royal Shakespeare Company, who said in an article for The Stage: “I have a responsibility to make our theatre a place where none of us needs to think twice before calling out and addressing behaviour that we all already know is unacceptable.” Featherstone added: “So come on, let’s end this bullshit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/18/even-moderate-drinking-by-parents-can-upset-children-study","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T23:01:37Z","webTitle":"Even moderate drinking by parents can upset children – study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/18/even-moderate-drinking-by-parents-can-upset-children-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/18/even-moderate-drinking-by-parents-can-upset-children-study","fields":{"headline":"Even moderate drinking by parents can upset children – study","bodyText":"Three in 10 parents say they have been drunk in front of their children and half have been tipsy, and such behaviour can trigger family rows or make children anxious, research suggests. Even moderate drinking by parents can leave children feeling embarrassed or worried or lead to their bedtime being disrupted, according to the study led by the Institute of Alcohol Studies (IAS). It is the first evidence that even low-level parental drinking – at no more than 14 units a week – can prove damaging to children. Children who see a parent tipsy or drunk are less likely to see them as a positive role model, the report says. The findings have prompted calls for parents to think more carefully about their alcohol consumption and for the government to overhaul official advice about when and how much people should drink. “It is worrying that the majority of parents reported being tipsy or drunk in front of their child. All parents strive to do what’s best for their children, but this report has highlighted a troubling gap in their knowledge,” said Katherine Brown, the IAS’s chief executive. “Parents who have a glass or two of wine in the evening deserve to understand how this might affect their children and the steps they can take to minimise this impact.” The report, co-produced with the Alcohol and Families Alliance and Alcohol Focus Scotland, says 29% of parents believe it is acceptable to get drunk in front of their children as long as that does not happen very often. Other findings include: 15% of children have asked their parents to drink less. 16% of parents have felt guilty or ashamed of their parenting as a result of their drinking. 12% of children said their parents paid them less attention because of their drinking. 11- and 12-year-olds described alcohol as “like sugar for adults” and said parents drink to “solve their problems”. Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner for England, said: “Many parents make the unwise assumption that even moderate levels of drinking doesn’t bother their children. Parents need to make a judgment before they drink on what impact their drinking might have on their kids.. “We know some children become very anxious when their parents use alcohol in ways that lead to uncertain, unusual or unpredictable behaviour. In my view the best way to make that judgment, as in lots of areas to do with children, is ask them, listen to what they say and act accordingly.” The report is based on interviews with a representative survey of 997 adults and their children around the UK. All the parents said they consumed no more alcohol than the 14 units a week recommended in official guidelines. The former health minister Caroline Flint, who is the daughter of an alcoholic, said: “We too quickly dismiss parental drinking as harmless fun and relaxation, but this report shows that parents do not need to be regularly drinking large amounts for their children to see a change in their behaviour and experience problems.” Alison Douglas, the chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said the switch in recent years from drinking in pubs to buying alcohol in supermarkets and off-licences meant children now saw parents drinking more than before. “This means children are more likely to be around alcohol and to witness drunkenness. As well as the negative impacts on children’s wellbeing, seeing how adults drink can have a big influence on our children’s future drinking habits,” she said. The Department of Health said it was aware that parents’ drinking habits could harm their offspring and it was considering what measures it might take. “While no one would want to interfere with the right of adults to enjoy a drink responsibly, we are committed to giving people the information they need to make informed choices about their drinking, which we provide through the UK chief medical officers’ guidelines,” a spokesman said. “We are also acutely aware of the impact adults’ drinking can have on their children. That’s why we are looking at what further support we can provide to tackle alcohol harms, focusing on vulnerable groups including families and children.” Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, who has spoken about his father’s death as a result of drinking, said: “This crucial report highlights that even non-dependent parental drinking has serious health implications on children and families. “Children are incredibly perceptive of their parent’s drinking habits and this analysis must serve as a wake-up call to the government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/17/kurdish-forces-abandon-long-held-lands-to-iraqi-army-and-shia-fighters","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T22:13:15Z","webTitle":"Kurdish forces abandon long-held lands to Iraqi army and Shia fighters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/kurdish-forces-abandon-long-held-lands-to-iraqi-army-and-shia-fighters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/17/kurdish-forces-abandon-long-held-lands-to-iraqi-army-and-shia-fighters","fields":{"headline":"Kurdish forces abandon long-held lands to Iraqi army and Shia fighters","bodyText":"Kurdish forces have abandoned lands they had controlled since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, allowing Iraqi troops to move into disputed areas that had been central to hopes for an independent Kurdistan with expanded borders. In a stunning collapse, peshmerga units loyal to the de facto Kurdish president, Massoud Barzani, pulled out of the towns of Bashiqa, Khanaqin and Sinjar less than a day after surrendering the city of Kirkuk to the Iraqi military and allied Shia forces. The withdrawals on Tuesday shattered ambitions to use a referendum on independence held on 25 September to consolidate a Kurdish hold on towns seized in the three-year war against Islamic State. Less than three weeks later, the poll has had the opposite effect, stripping away the extra 40% of land – up to 36,000 sq km (14,000 sq miles) – its leaders had claimed and showcasing an intractable divide between the region’s two rival power bases. The rapid fall of Kirkuk gave impetus to the capitulation across northern Iraq, with forces loyal to Baghdad sweeping unopposed into areas that military leaders thought they would have to fight for. Instead, Iraqi troops found empty streets, shuttered shops and primitive roadblocks, which were quickly cleared, before the relaxed arrivals took up their new positions. Barzani, who has acted as president for the past two years, made his first statement since the surrender of Kirkuk, claiming the defeat did not mean the end of the independence project that he had championed. “The loud voices you raised for the independence of Kurdistan that you sent to all nations and world countries will not be wasted now or ever,” he said in a statement. “What happened in Kirkuk city was the result of unilateral decisions of some persons within a certain internal political party of Kurdistan, which eventually led to the withdrawal of the Peshmerga forces, as was seen.” On the northern entrances to Kirkuk, a day after the rout, senior peshmerga officers appeared stunned by what had taken place. Few agreed to be interviewed as they set up new defences 25 miles away from the city. Diggers gouged trenches in scorched brown earth, and bulldozers piled dirt into hilltop berms, while others cleared mounds on roads that had been intended to stop Iraqi advances. Gen Gazi Mala Salih, the director of Iraqi Kurdistan’s finance ministry, who acts as a senior officer, described the collapse of the city as a “truly historic betrayal” by allies and Kurds alike. Sitting with other senior officers near one of the new positions, he said: “If you go back through the French Revolution and American history, self-determination has been a basic right. “We had strong cards to play – 92.7% is the overwhelming support of people. The US, Britain and western powers are not faithful allies. “They are lying to themselves and their people and they are betraying their principles. They should feel shame for the rest of their histories for not supporting us. “I will be honest: I am ashamed to be an Iraqi. The Kurds provided a shield of 1,500 kilometres to protect the world from Isis, and this is what we get for our sacrifice.” In Erbil – the centre of Barzani’s power base – the spectre of Iranian involvement in the attack on Kirkuk is a dominant theme. There are also claims that Bafel Talabani, the son of the late leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) bloc, allied with the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani to withdraw from the city. Kirkuk’s defences collapsed after peshmerga units loyal to a faction of the PUK withdrew, allowing Iraqi forces easy access to the southern half of the city. Using a historical pejorative to describe Iran, Mala Salih said: “If the Safavid empire [the ruling dynasty in Iran from 1501 to 1722] is going to rise and rule our region, there is no difference between the turbans in Tehran and Najaf, and those of Isis. If I don’t accept Isis, I won’t accept them either.” Addressing the intra-Kurdish dispute, which is at its most pronounced since the Kurdish civil war 20 years ago, he said: “If a tree doesn’t have a worm in it, it can live for 1,000 years.” In the Kurdish districts of Kirkuk in the north of the city, all shops remained closed on Tuesday and streets were largely empty, except for drivers who had queued with their cars in long lines outside fuel stations. Panic-buying has suddenly become common, with locals believing the Iraqi seizure of Kirkuk will lead to a reduced oil supply to Erbil in particular. Waiting in a fuel queue, Peshtiwan Aziz, 31, said: “It was the Kurds who were divided who let the city fall. It should come back to its people now. This is a total assault on the rightful rulers of the city and it has been taken away from them by force.” Further south, towards Arab and Turkmen areas of the divided city, some shops were open, and residents mingled easily. Locals walked past Iraqi flags that had been hoisted over Kirkuk’s citadel, alongside a Turkmen banner and posters eulogising the late Jalal Talabani, a Kurd who was president of Iraq from 2005 to 2014. In Sinjar, meanwhile, where the entire Yazidi community were forced into exile in August 2014, the few locals who had returned were wary of the return of Iraqi forces. Yazidi units from the Popular Mobilisation Forces were first into the town, at the foot of Mount Sinjar, and were later joined by Shia forces. “They have been fine, so far,” said Manal Nadhim, one of few local women to have returned, “but it’s more trauma for us. We just want our old life back.” Additional reporting: Mohammed Rasool"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/17/antonio-conte-chelsea-alvaro-morata-roma-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T17:11:34Z","webTitle":"Antonio Conte rues Chelsea’s ‘thin’ squad and ponders Álvaro Morata recall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/17/antonio-conte-chelsea-alvaro-morata-roma-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/17/antonio-conte-chelsea-alvaro-morata-roma-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Conte rues Chelsea’s ‘thin’ squad and ponders Álvaro Morata recall","bodyText":"Antonio Conte has conceded Chelsea’s “thin” senior squad will force him to take risks in his team selection in the weeks ahead with a perceived lack of options, over which he had expressed concern to the hierarchy over the summer, leaving them vulnerable to suffering further injuries to key players. Chelsea will have Álvaro Morata available again after a thigh complaint for Wednesday’s Champions League group game against Roma, the Spain international having been cleared to return to first-team duties after three days’ full training with the group. However, Victor Moses and N’Golo Kanté will be absent until next month with hamstring problems, injuries Conte puts down to an increased workload with his team competing in four competitions. The head coach had hoped the board would add far greater strength in depth over the summer but, despite an outlay of close to £180m – virtually all of which ended up being recouped in sales and loan fees – has been left confronting a cluttered schedule with his options only marginally bolstered. The Roma game is Chelsea’s second of seven in 22 days, with successive Premier League defeats either side of the recent international window having damaged the team’s title defence. Asked whether the point will come when he has to prioritise either domestic or European competition, Conte said: “We have to go game by game. We are only in October and not in March. Now it’s impossible to take a decision like that. But the situation is difficult. We have to play every three days, and it’s not simple. Also because, in this moment, we are ‘thin’ and we have to play always the same players. Honestly, there is this type of risk to have other injuries. I hope not. But the best way, now, for us is to go game by game, and then to decide every game which is the best formation, and sometimes to take risks or not about our players. “The problem is we are playing always the same players. We have players in our team who are not used to playing three games in a week. For Kanté it’s the first time. For Moses, the first time. For Morata, it’s the first time to play regularly for his team. For Marcos Alonso it’s the same. “When you have a lot of games, you need to rotate players. If this is not possible, I have to take risks. Then, for example, against Manchester City. Morata was injured after 20 minutes. But if I hadn’t put Morata in the starting XI, you’d have told me I’m crazy. Sometimes the players need to rest instead.” Conte had resisted the temptation to select Morata at Crystal Palace on Saturday, where defeat left Chelsea nine points off the Premier League leaders, but is confident there is no risk of the forward suffering a recurrence of his injury if he features against Roma. “I could have taken a risk and forced him to play against Crystal Palace, but I’m not so stupid,” he said. “The situation is very difficult. You have to make the best decision and against Roma I’m not taking a risk if I decide Morata can play. He has been training with us and is in contention. “We know very well our situation. For sure, when there are injuries of this type, to important players, then it’s very difficult for us. But there is this situation and now we must be very good to overcome and try to do our best. For sure, it’s not simple when you don’t have a lot of players like Morata, Kante or now Moses ... important players.” David Luiz is expected to feature in central midfield against Roma – who are second in the group and have their own severe selection problems with Kevin Strootman, Rick Karsdorp and Stephan El Shaarawy just returned from injury and lacking match practice – and Eden Hazard operating just behind Morata. That combination proved so successful at Atlético Madrid last month when Chelsea maintained their pristine start to Group C by inflicting the Spanish club’s first defeat at the Estadio Metropolitano. Form has dwindled domestically in the period since, leaving Conte hopeful the Champions league will reinvigorate his players. “It’s a good time to play again, above all after two defeats,” he added. “To play tomorrow is very important, but the Champions League is a very tough tournament and Roma are a great team. They’re doing very well in the Italian league, so we have to pay great attention. They are well organised and have a lot of great players.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2017/oct/23/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T14:00:19Z","webTitle":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/oct/23/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2017/oct/23/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","bodyText":"Welcome to this week’s blog, and our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Anyone who finishes Hermann Hesse’s The Glass Bead Game deserves a a little recognition, so let’s start by clearing the floor for samye88: This is a fictional biography set in the 23rd century, of Joseph Knecht, Master of The Glass Bead Game, a man epitomises the human intelligence and artistic achievement. It is not easily relatable, even for us book people. The sharpest minds here at TLS will appreciate the concept of the elusive Game or many abstractions on music and science better than I do, I’m still grateful that I’ve read it and extracted nourishment from it. If I see it as a bildungsroman, it has a touchingly magical and winsome quality that greatly satisfies me: Joseph has led a charmed life, for an intelligent boy with admirable intuition, he succeeds all his life, wins over all the important movers/shakers along the way, reaches one height after another until he reaches the highest possible office of his profession before age 40. It is too ‘easy’, too soon, too perfect. And the Castalian way of pure Mind life lived in isolated protection from events of the world, free from struggles of the economy, becomes increasingly anemic and empty for Joseph, who can see the lack with clear eyes and who possesses hidden courage and resolve to transcend, to move from stage to stage... Some readers comment that the book is dull and they abandon it early or half way. I’d like to highlight that the second short story in The Three Lives - The Father Confessor, is a standalone jewel that should never be missed at any cost! While we’re enjoying lengthy reviews, HaveOneOnMe’s thoughts about Dennis Cooper’s strange novel The Sluts are also well worth a bit of space: It’s the kind of book that makes you look on your bookshelf with embarrassed disgust, from all of those books’ - suddenly apparent - phoney civility and decency. A conspiratorial reaction (why doesn’t transgressive literature get more press?; why have I been reading what I’ve been reading all these years?) that’s validated, to an extent, by the fact that Cooper isn’t stocked in any bookshop I’ve been to. The Sluts is a new millennium epistolary novel comprised entirely of reviews on a gay escort website, instant messages, emails, and faxes. It’s about an escort named ‘Brad’ who is reviewed by several clients on the agency’s review page, but the reviewers’ reviews narratively snowball, by way of each successive review alluding to, contradicting, or defensively falsifying previous reviews: each reviewer claims to have had a “real life” encounter that doesn’t match up (at all, or completely) with the fragmented facts established on the review thread... The one thing that is common to all involved (including, perhaps, the reader) is a morbid obsession with ‘Brad’ ... Everyone wants to fuck Brad and, also, to kill him. Literally. The murder of the object of desire as the ultimate post-fuck rush; the famous death drive rendered literal and real. Except. Of course. It may not be. Since it’s an epistolary novel in the age of the Internet, so, more so than every before in human history, we are capable of seeing, as Cooper shows, many multiple versions of the same story simultaneously, making reality and truth meaningless and almost beside the point: the point being, the narrative (of The Sluts) simply serves to satisfy a collective desire of the storytellers. And that desire is extremely disturbing. By way of contrast, here’s a short and sweet review from judgeDAmNationAgain: Finally finished Life: A User’s Manual by Georges Perec, and what a joy it was - ambitious and broad, and without being affected. And another from paulburns on Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s The Leopard : Didn’t get it the first time round many years ago as a yoof. For one thing I don’t think I knew enough history and I was just too young. This time round I just loved it. A magnificent poetic evocation of Sicily in the 1860s (and a very subtle indication of how after the unification the Mafia became so powerful - perhaps.) A thing of beauty it will do your heart harm to miss. Don’t miss the Visconti film of the novel either. That too will do you a power of good...

The amount invested by UK manufacturers in new plant and machinery has slowed to 6.5% of turnover, from 7.5% last year, according to a survey by EEF, the industry trade body, as companies press the pause button until there is further clarity on a Brexit deal. Britain’s business community has warned the government that it must urgently agree a Brexit transition deal with the EU or risk losing UK jobs and investment. “With global demand on the up, conditions should be ripe for industry to make new investments in capacity and productivity-enhancing technology, but Brexit means the future outlook for investment is not clearcut,” said Lee Hopley, EEF’s chief economist. The 328 companies taking part in the annual EEF/Santander investment monitor were almost evenly split over whether they intend to increase spending in the next two years. A small majority, 51.1% of manufacturers, intended to spend more on plant and machinery, either to replace obsolete equipment or to take advantage of new opportunities on the back of an improved global outlook. For the other half, uncertainty over the UK’s exit from the EU was holding back planned investment, while there was also little focus on investing to improve process efficiency. Hopley said the chancellor, Philip Hammond, should use his forthcoming budget on 22 November to introduce measures that would encourage business investment. “Political uncertainty is adding to the hurdles of cost and lack of skills in holding back spending on automation technology,” she said. “The forthcoming budget can at least start to address the latter of these challenges, starting with an ambitious industrial strategy that tackles barriers to investment head on and ensures UK manufacturers are equipped to compete for the future.” Official figures to be published on Wednesday are expected to show UK growth stalled at 0.3% in the third quarter, having grown at the same rate in both the first and second quarters of 2017. Economists said a sharper-than expected fall in retail sales in September was likely to weigh on the third-quarter growth figure, which is also expected to reflect a sharp drop in construction output over the period. However, George Brown, an economist at Investec, said a weak growth rate of 0.3% in the third quarter was unlikely to scupper the Bank of England’s plans for an interest rate rise at its November meeting. If the Bank’s monetary policy committee does raise rates from an all-time low of 0.25% next month, it would be the first increase in more than a decade. Another leading UK business trade body, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), also urged the government to use next month’s budget to help companies prepare for Brexit rather than prioritise “goodies and giveaways”. “The best possible Brexit deal won’t be worth the paper it’s written on if conditions for growth aren’t right here at home,” said Adam Marshall, director general of the BCC. “The chancellor has a unique chance to move the dial on growth and productivity now, leaving the UK in a position to succeed over the long term. Action to slash the up-front costs faced by business, to incentivise investment, and to improve mobile coverage and infrastructure would lead to a real boost to productivity, wages and trade.” The lobby group’s proposals included a special Brexit investment allowance, to incentivise business investment during the process of leaving the EU. “At a critical moment for the UK economy, the chancellor must be bold and deliver a big budget that prioritises economic confidence and investment,” Marshall said. “A budget that prioritises goodies and giveaways rather than future-proofing the economy would be a dereliction of duty by the government as a whole.” The Federation of Small Businesses called on Hammond to use his budget to provide investment to deliver on promised improvements in the UK’s broadband and road networks. The body urged the chancellor to make good on its 2015 commitment to a universal service obligation, providing UK-wide access to broadband by 2020. It also called on the government to provide support for the major road network initiative, which aims to increase investment in routes under local authority control in England. “The UK has slower download speeds than Romania, Bulgaria and Thailand,” said Mike Cherry, the FSB national chairman. “We welcome the government’s commitment to an ambitious industrial strategy. But clearly we’re not going to have an economy of highly paid, highly productive workers when a significant proportion of businesses can’t even access the internet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/22/hostage-situation-reported-bermuda-park-nuneaton-retail-park-police-ongoing-situation","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T18:16:07Z","webTitle":"Police storm bowling alley in Nuneaton to bring hostage situation to an end","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/22/hostage-situation-reported-bermuda-park-nuneaton-retail-park-police-ongoing-situation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/22/hostage-situation-reported-bermuda-park-nuneaton-retail-park-police-ongoing-situation","fields":{"headline":"Police storm bowling alley in Nuneaton to bring hostage situation to an end","bodyText":"Police have stormed a bowling alley in Nuneaton where a gunman took two members of staff hostage on Sunday, bringing the incident to an end. Warwickshire police said a man was arrested and no one was injured in the incident. “At 2.30pm this afternoon Warwickshire police received reports of a man with a firearm in Nuneaton. “Specialist firearms officers and police negotiators, along with fire, ambulance and police air services, attended the location at the bowling alley in St David’s Way, Bermuda Park. “A man has been arrested and is in police custody. “Members of public at the bowling alley and neighbouring properties were evacuated to safety and nobody was injured during the incident.” Shortly after 6.30pm a series of loud bangs could be heard and about 10 minutes later an ambulance was allowed through the police cordon and two people got out. The suspect was treated at the scene and taken to hospital, while two other men were uninjured, West Midlands ambulance service said. Warwickshire police chief superintendent Alex Franklin-Smith said: “We would like to thank local people for their patience and cooperation while officers dealt with this incident. We are pleased that we were able to bring this incident to a peaceful resolution and that there were no injuries.” Mehdi Afshar, the chief executive of MFA Bowl, praised the police’s response. “I have been told by our operations director that the police have stormed the building and the individual has been arrested,” he told the BBC. “A big thank you to the police who do a fantastic marvellous job. I am very relieved.” Earlier, Warwickshire police’s Twitter account had warned people to stay away from the retail park in Nuneaton as reports of a hostage incident emerged. A number of police cars were pictured on the scene. The West Midlands ambulance service said there had been no reported casualties. An update posted later on the police force’s Facebook page told residents the incident was “unconnected to any terrorist activity”. Afshar had told Sky: “We understand that there is a gunman in the place and he is holding two of our staff as hostage.” He said there had been no contact with the two members of staff, adding: “All our staff, the rest of our staff, are safe and they made sure that all the customers have left the premises so everybody is in safety, with the exception of the two people who we know are missing, and we assume that they are the two that are still inside the premises because the manageress has done the check but those two people are not accounted for.” An eyewitness at the retail park, Liz, a 53-year-old school office manager who did not give her surname, had told the Guardian: “The gunman appears to be pushing a hostage to the door with a gun to his head to collect paperwork from police negotiators who are trying to negotiate with them. “We’d only been in Frankie &amp; Benny’s [restaurant] five minutes when it kicked off and police told us to stay put. Within minutes we were surrounded. “Armed police are on every corner and we’re all safe. It’s just not pleasant and someone might get hurt.” Another eyewitness, 16-year-old student Eden James, said: “We just came to go to the cinema and were told we weren’t allowed in and that they were evacuating because someone’s got a shotgun in the bowling alley. “The gunman has taken the manager and a boy hostage. The boy, who is tall, broad and is wearing a black T-shirt, keeps coming in and out to negotiate with the police [on behalf of the gunman]. But we’re not sure what his demands are because the police won’t let us close enough. “There’s around 30 police cars, police dogs and a helicopter so it seems to be under control. “The mood here is pretty cheerful because everyone who was in the car park has been given hospitality from Frankie and Benny’s.” Sarah Fleming, a witness in a restaurant at the retail park, told Sky News reports of the incident had started to come through at about 3.30pm and she had been told the man was armed. “Police have advised us that there is a man with a shotgun and he does have hostages,” she said. “Everyone’s a little bit scared.” The gunman had brandished his weapon above his head and yelled “game over” after arriving at the bowling alley, one witness said. Alex Moore-Holland told Sky News: “We were just having a game ... and a man who was also bowling ran across our lane and he was like ‘get out, get out’, shouting. “I was like ‘What’s going on?’ so I turn around and there was a white guy, greyish beard, weird-looking man, he’s got a gun up here, like this over his head. “He was saying ‘game over, game over’, everyone shouting, screaming, panicking, trying to get out and I didn’t know what to make of it, really. “I ran, got my things as quickly as I could and get out of there.” Eyewitness accounts on the Coventry Telegraph website said a neighbouring soft play centre and cinema were on lockdown, with customers asked to stay inside. All roads into the area have been closed. Fleming said police were allowing some people parked in the part of the car park furthest from the bowling alley to leave. Paul Edgington, a cinemagoer who said he was with two children, tweeted to the police: “I’m stuck in the cinema. Are we safe? How long are we expected to be locked down?” West Midlands ambulance service said it had been called to the incident at 3.40pm. A spokesman said: “We currently have an ambulance, two paramedic officers, the hazardous area response team, and an emergency planning manager at the scene.” The Warwickshire and Northamptonshire air ambulance was initially dispatched but has since left the scene. The local MP, Marcus Jones, told Sky News it was an “extremely concerning situation”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/22/social-care-funding-and-the-cost-of-short-term-thinking","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T17:38:24Z","webTitle":"Social care funding and the cost of short-term thinking | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/22/social-care-funding-and-the-cost-of-short-term-thinking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/22/social-care-funding-and-the-cost-of-short-term-thinking","fields":{"headline":"Social care funding and the cost of short-term thinking","bodyText":"You suggest (Editorial, 17 October) that “the gradual extension of free care, starting with critical care and extending to those with substantial needs as money became available” would be a key part of the reform of social care funding. A solution on these lines has been available to governments since 1999 when the royal commission on long-term care (of which I was a member) recommended that the costs of intimate personal care should, in principle, be met by the state from general taxation, with individuals being responsible like the rest of the population for their housing and living costs subject to means testing. The unassailable justification for this proposal is the gross injustice whereby cancer sufferers have all their needs met by the state while others, notably Alzheimer’s sufferers, are liable for their own care costs unless they have negligible resources. However, the proposal was brusquely rejected by Westminster, though adopted in Scotland, where it works effectively. Had it been accepted back then, “free care” would now be a seamless part of health and care provision covered by mainstream funding. Robin Wendt Chester • As long as social care is provided almost entirely by the private sector (under 10% remains in public hands) it will be impossible both to plan strategically and operate efficiently. The private sector plays no effective collaborative role in the strategic planning of service provision (the duty of national and local government) modelled on expected demographic change over future decades. Indeed, private providers are essentially disparate and short-term focused – even handing back contracts mid-term when they prove or are predicted to be unprofitable. Moreover, they have no interest in providing care as a public good. The private sector, in the market as it is currently structured, will always follow the money (that is, affluent old people who can pay for care out of their own pockets, and who are then placed in the position of cross-subsidising those who are paid for by cash-strapped councils, themselves unable to pay the full going rate as set by the providers). Depressingly, this does not even address the issues around quality that are shown to arise time and time again in services that have been outsourced (which is essentially what the private provision of social care is really all about) – just look at the parlous state of many of our privately provided (but publicly funded) prisons, immigration centres, probation services and primary healthcare services. The only difference is that social care is a hybrid form of outsourcing – private payers and publicly supported clients coexisting side-by-side within the same privately provided service. Gillian Dalley London • If dementia is a disease needing NHS treatment why, apart from care costs, is it singled out as a condition to which normal NHS care processes should not apply? My concern is that a dementia tax is a slippery slope down which other elderly needs will eventually slide. This government’s idea that such costs are unfair between generations ignores the fact that younger generations have a tendency (thanks to the NHS) of turning into older generations. Second, there is great unfairness between persons who are unlucky enough to need dementia care and thereby have to suffer a charge on the value of a property and those who are lucky enough not to need care. The only fair way of affording good elderly care is by a ringfenced “death tax” – a percentage death duty on the value of estates. This would be proportionate to an individual’s wealth and those with no residual wealth would rightly pay nothing. As with all tax, the lucky ones in life will be those who only have to pay the tax without ever having the need to claim a benefit. David Herriott London • Your editorial’s conclusion, that successive governments have failed to “think clearly” about the crisis in health and social care, making it “a bleak indictment of short-termist democracy”, sadly can be applied to all aspects of government policy. Short-termism leads to all sorts of apparently unforeseen problems; did no one see that cutting council grants would bring about quality reductions in public services? Was no one in authority able to predict recruitment crises in nursing and teaching, through overwork and a pay freeze? That tax reductions for the rich would not lead to increased inequality and decreased revenue for the Treasury? Selling weapons to the Saudis would bring in revenue, but the longer-term effects of the weapons on human targets, let alone on the government’s ethical standing, mattered not a jot. Promising £350m a week for the NHS might lead to a Brexit vote, but with drastic consequences later. Similarly, short-termism in business has led to companies focusing more on immediate profits, rather than the benefit of improved productivity from longer-term investment in technology and training. With the effects of such policies now coming home to roost, is it any wonder principled politicians, with plans to transform the way our society is managed, are on target to win the next election?

Henda Ayari, 40, who heads the women’s organisation Les Libératrices, filed a complaint on Friday with prosecutors in the Rouen, France, alleging rape, sexual violence, harassment and intimidation by Ramadan, who is a professor of contemporary Islamic studies at Oxford. Ayari’s lawyer, Jonas Haddad, said she had not previously reported the alleged attack in 2012 out of fear. She named Ramadan on social media on Friday after women began using social networks to talk of sexual harassment and assault in the wake of allegations against the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. “After revelations over the past few days of rape and sexual assault claims in the media, Henda has decided to say what happened to her and take legal action,” Haddad told Agence France-Presse. Ayari wrote on Facebook on Friday that she had been the “victim of something very serious several years ago” but had not until now given the alleged assailant’s name because of “threats” by him. She said she had described the rape in a chapter of her book, I Chose to be Free, published in France in November 2016, giving her attacker a made-up name. In the book, Ayari describes a sex attack by an intellectual in a Paris hotel room after a conference, saying she fought back but was “insulted”, “slapped” and treated violently. On Facebook on Friday, she named Ramadan as her attacker. Ramadan’s lawyer, Yassine Bouzrou, told the French paper Le Parisien on Saturday that he denied the allegations and would file a complaint of defamation with Rouen prosecutors on Monday morning. Bouzrou told Le Parisien: “The complainant says she did not name my client in her book in order not to be sued for defamation. When you’re telling the truth, it’s surprising to fear being accused of defamation.” Swiss-born Ramadan is the grandson of Hassan al-Banna, who founded the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. It now falls to the Rouen prosecutor’s office to decide whether to open an investigation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/oct/22/human-sciences-at-oxford-could-change-politics-to-a-degree","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T17:26:14Z","webTitle":"Human sciences at Oxford could change politics … to a degree | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/22/human-sciences-at-oxford-could-change-politics-to-a-degree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/oct/22/human-sciences-at-oxford-could-change-politics-to-a-degree","fields":{"headline":"Human sciences at Oxford could change politics … to a degree","bodyText":"Mike Elwood (Select political leaders on EQ, rather than IQ, Letters, 18 October) may be unaware that Oxford University does offer a course that produces graduates who are trained to think across the field from science to humanities. It is called human sciences. It was set up in the early 1970s by a group of academics from zoology, sociology and anthropology as a deliberate attempt to bridge the “two cultures”. Unfortunately, the university has never provided financial support in terms of staff salaries and the course depends on the commitment of lecturers who believe in the value of a broad perspective to solve today’s problems. An early adopter remarked that the course would have come of age when there was a prime minister who was a graduate. It has always been my opinion that such an outcome is unlikely since the ethos of the course is directly contrary to the notion of one view being right in all cases. Politics, on the other hand, appears to require the practitioner to hold only one personal conviction regardless of all “expert” opinion.

The communities secretary revealed there could be an announcement about the move in next month’s budget. Javid drew a distinction between tackling the deficit and using low interest rates to invest in infrastructure, an idea more associated with Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party. He said there was an urgent need to build up to 300,000 homes a year. “We have a housing crisis in this country, I’ve been very open about that, the government has been very clear about that, and there’s a lot that needs to happen,” he said. Javid said on BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show that the aim was for “a big increase in all types of home”, including social housing, so-called build-to-rent properties and shared equity homes. “We are looking at new investments, and there will be announcements – I’m sure the budget will be covering housing,” he said. “What I want to do is make sure that we’re using everything that we have available to us to deal with this housing crisis. Where that means, for example, that we can sensibly borrow more to invest in the infrastructure that leads to more housing, take advantage of some of the record low interest rates that we have, I think we should be absolutely considering that. “I would make a distinction between the deficit, which needs to keep coming down, and that’s vital for our economic credibility. But investing for the future, taking advantage of record low interest rates, can be the right thing if done sensibly.” While councils “have a big part to play” in the plan, as do housing associations, the “biggest role” should be taken by the private sector, Javid said. Asked if Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was signed up to the idea of more investment in housing, Javid said: “Let’s wait and see what happens in the budget.” Making a distinction between everyday government spending and the need for new infrastructure, for example to assist new homes to be built, is a notion which has been argued by Labour. The opposition party has called for a big boost to long-term economic investment. However, Javid indicated the government would not relax protections for the green belt. “I don’t believe that we need to focus on the green belt here, there is lots of brownfield land, and brownfield first has been a policy of ours for a while,” he said. He said one big issue was density, noting that even London was less densely built up than many other European cities. The government’s recent efforts to help tame the housing market have brought limited success. The help-to-buy scheme has been accused mainly of raising property prices even further. At the Conservative party conference this month, Theresa May announced an extra £2bn for affordable housing. But the planned centrepiece of the prime minister’s speech was instead dominated by an intruder and her cough. Labour’s shadow housing minister, John Healey, said the government should pledge to invest in more council homes rather than “set more targets they can’t meet”. He said: “If hot air built homes, ministers would have fixed our housing crisis. Any promise of new investment is welcome, but the reality is spending on new affordable homes has been slashed since 2010 so new affordable housebuilding is at a 24-year low.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/oct/22/f1-us-grand-prix-live-gp-lewis-hamilton-sebastian-vettel-formula-one","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T21:03:24Z","webTitle":"F1: Lewis Hamilton wins US Grand Prix 2017 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/oct/22/f1-us-grand-prix-live-gp-lewis-hamilton-sebastian-vettel-formula-one","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/oct/22/f1-us-grand-prix-live-gp-lewis-hamilton-sebastian-vettel-formula-one","fields":{"headline":"F1: Lewis Hamilton wins US Grand Prix 2017 – as it happened","bodyText":"Right, well how about that? Thanks for your company during a brilliant race. Bye! Tom Dart’s race report from Austin will follow here: Sebastian Vettel talks. “At the start it was looking good but fairly quickly we realised we couldn’t go at his pace,” the German says. Then Raikkonen has his say before Hamilton asks Usain Bolt to show him “how to do the Bolt”. You know what happens next. And yes, it’s a little bit painful. Lewis Hamilton speaks after his fifth win in Austin. “Since 2012, this crowd has been growing year-on-year. I think now this track is my favourite track. I loved the swing of the corners today. A big congratulations to the team, who have worked so hard at the factory.” Red Bull’s team boss, Christian Horner, is not a happy chap. “They have been driving off track all weekend, Max made a fair move,” he says. “It is an appalling decision. They have robbed all of the fans here. It was a great grand prix and they have screwed it up.” The 20-year-old Red Bull driver is absolutely fuming as the national anthems play out on a Verstappen-less podium. Hamilton, meanwhile, beams with Bill Clinton and Usain Bolt for company. The champagne sprays off in every direction and the celebrations are in full flow for Mercedes. Wow! Max Verstappen has lost third place to Kimi Raikkonen. He is thrown out of the podium room and demoted to fourth. Why? The Red Bull was deemed to have won an unfair advantage by leaving the track, and gets a five-second penalty for his troubles. That sees him down to fourth. It’s never dull when he’s involved, is it? Lewis Hamilton has a splendid 66-point lead in the drivers’ championship and a fifth-placed finish in Mexico next Sunday is all he needs to wrap up an inevitable fourth title. “The team has done such an awesome job the last couple of years,” Toto Wolff says. “Now it’s about finishing the season strong for Lewis, and for Valtteri.” Hamilton speaks down the team radio. “Great job guys,” he says. “That was so much fun out there today.” Mercedes are world champions. Meanwhile, Verstappen feels like one. “Max Verstappen. You. Are. Brilliant,” is the message from his Red Bull team. And oh my, Max Verstappen squeezes up the inside to steal third! Mercedes have won the constructors’ championship! Vettel takes second. Lap 56/56: Hamilton leads Vettel. Can Verstappen nip in ahead of Raikkonen to take third? “You get one shot at it Max,” Red Bull say down the team radio. Aaah, lovely ... Lap 55/56: Two laps remain! Lap 54/56: Hamilton looks to have this in the bag and Ferrari are on for a double podium, with Vettel and Raikkonen. Max Verstappen, though, has had a superb evening. Can he snatch another place late on? Lap 53/56: Vettel trails Hamilton by 14.296secs ... Lap 52/56: Verstappen digs away at Bottas and he moves up in to fourth. A bad couple of minutes for Bottas, who falls to fifth. As it stands, Hamilton leads Vettel. Raikkonen is third, Verstappen’s fourth and Bottas is in fifth. Three to go! Lap 52/56: Raikkonen allows Vettel past, into second. A few of the drivers, namely Bottas, seem to be getting a little nervy. But not Hamilton, who continues to dictate the pace from the front. Lap 51/56: “It’s too late to pit now, Mercedes are going to have to hang on as best they can,” emails Stephen Cooper re: Hamilton. Another reader, Steve, simply emails “Go Hamilton!” And some heart-in-mouth drama, as Verstappen has Bottas in his sights. Lap 50/56: Vettel is within DRS range of Bottas in the battle for third ... Lap 49/56: Sainz continues to toy with Ocon, but the Force India has a stiff upper lip and is going nowhere. And Ericsson has been blamed for that incident with Magnussen, and he’s been slapped with a five-second penalty, which will be added at the end of this race. Lap 48/56: Sebastian Vettel sets a new fastest lap of 1.37.957. Lap 47/56: Raikkonen’s making lots of noise down the team radio; he’s moaning, swearing and just generally unhappy about something. Meanwhile, out in front, Hamilton extends the gap. Elsewhere, Vettel storms past the back markers, and Ericsson and Magnussen clash! The latter is left in a spin, but the Sauber ends up losing a place or two for his efforts. “He turned in on me,” he says. Lap 46/56: Raikkonen trails the race leader, Hamilton, by 11.6secs ... Lap 45/56: Ricciardo is shaking his head down in the paddock. Meanwhile, Nic Hamilton’s taking a selfie or two. Quite the juxtaposition. “I hope the front left is not going to explode,” Romain Grosjean says. “There is no more rubber.” Crikey ... Lap 44/56: “How are they so close?” Hamilton asks, told of Raikkonen’s pace. He does have a nine-second cushion at the moment, but will perhaps need to pit again. Lap 43/56: “Nice work, nice work,” is the message from Ferrari to Raikkonen, after the Finn overtook Bottas. Further down the grid, Carlos Sainz continues to chase Sebastian Ocon. It has been a great debut. Has he got anything else left in the tank? Lap 42/56: Raikkonen has a go at Bottas, and he has just enough grip to slide in front of the Mercedes. Bottas put up little fight and Raikkonen obliged, to take second. He’s around 8secs behind the race leader, Lewis Hamilton. Lap 41/56: “He is effectively battling for a podium here,” Christian Horner, the Red Bull chief, says of high-flying Verstappen. “Unfortunately it was an engine failure [for Daniel Ricciardo]”. So, 15 laps to go! Hamilton leads, Bottas is second. Then its Raikkonen, Vettel and Verstappen. Lap 40/56: Hamilton, a little nervously, checks in with his Mercedes team. “Keep me up to date with what you want me to do,” he says, “the tyres are still good”. Meanwhile, Massa is up into 10th after a little scuffle with Romain Grosjean. Lap 39/56: And ah, just look who it is: Sebastian Vettel. He’s out of the pits into fourth, narrowly in front of Max Verstappen, who remember started 16th on the grid. Lap 38/56: An interesting move from Red Bull, with the worst-case scenario probably a fifth-placed finish, given how far behind sixth-placed Sebastian Ocon is. Lap 37/56: More from Fernando Alonso. A missed opportunity for some decent points? “We were seventh, we fought for that seventh, it was not a gift,” he says. “But unfortunately we have now missed 25 or 30 points in the last few races. We have to change the engine for Mexico, and it’s probably an investment for the last two races in Abu Dhabi and Brazil. Meanwhile, Verstappen pits. “You know what we’re up to,” say Red Bull, “it’s going to be a big lap”. Mouthwatering stuff ... Lap 36/56: “We need to think about Plan B ...” Vettel suggests down the team radio. He’s 6.5secs off Hamilton, the race leader. Lap 35/56: The gap between sixth-placed Ocon and fifth-placed Verstappen? Almost 46 seconds ... Lap 33/56: Max Verstappen is in fifth, he’s had a ruddy good race so far. Meanwhile, Sainz continues to close on Perez, but the Renault cannot get the better of the Force India. Until, Sainz moves on to the kerb, on Perez’s outside and he eventually bypasses the Mexican. A wry smile from Alain Prost. A dream debut for Sainz, it seems. “Brilliant job,” is the message down the team radio. Lap 32/56: Perez wants to nip in ahead of Ocon, “because I have a lot more pace than this” and he has Carlos Sainz looking over his shoulder. Behind them is Danil Kvyat. “We need more management,” is the reply from Force India. Lap 31/56: Vandoorne zooms into 13th, ahead of Hartley and Ericsson. Good stuff from him. Hamilton leads Vettel out in front, with Bottas third. Lap 30/56: A beautiful three-way fight between Massa, Ocon and Perez very nearly ends in tears. Both Force Indias try to slip in past the Williams but Massa stands his ground before pitting. And just like that the fun is over and he’s on to those quick, ultrasoft tyres. Lap 29/56: Ocon and Perez, the two Force Indias find themselves together. This should be good ... And, a fun fact, this is Lance Stroll’s last Grand Prix as a 18-year-old. The Canadian turns 19 next Sunday. “We need to start to pick up the pace,” Perez is told. Lap 27/56: Daniel Ricciardo speaks. “I was racing with a full heart, as always,” he says. “I had to try to [overtake] Valtteri. If I didn’t try, I wouldn’t be able to pass him. I was never going to sit and wonder what could have been. After so many attempts, we then pitted, and I thought I was done, because [it was] way too hot.” Lap 26/56: So, that’s Alonso, Ricciardo, Wehrlein and Hulkenberg who are all spent and out of the race in Austin. Meanwhile, Verstappen pits and he flies back out into fifth, ahead of Felipe Massa. Hamilton leads Sebastian Vettel. Lap 25/56: Perez zooms in front of Alonso, who looks in trouble ... “I think I have an engine issue,” he says, before his team tell him to back off. “I can’t believe it!” Lap 24/56: Hamilton uses the grip of those fresh tyres to re-take the lead at the US Grand Prix! Verstappen looked to have held him off but then the Mercedes came back for more, after biding his time. And the Red Bull had no reply off the next corner. Lap 23/56: Perez is 2.4secs behind Alonso. “We will see, I don’t care,” Alonso moans. As it stands, Verstappen leads Hamilton, with Vettel in third. Bottas is fourth, ahead of Kimi Raikkonen. Lap 22/56: Max Verstappen leads the Grand Prix, after starting 16th only half an hour or so ago. Raikkonen is in and out of the pits, and is now fifth. “Why did you allow him to get so close?” Hamilton asks, with Vettel going looming in his mirrors. Lap 21/56: Vettel has just set a new fastest lap and he’s closed the gap between he and Hamilton. He goes for the undercut on Hamilton and, despite momentarily running wide, he is right at the base of Hamilton’s car. “It’s crazy,” Usain Bolt, of all people, says down in the pits. Lap 20/56: Hamilton flies into the pits, and he, too, is on to the soft tyres. For now, Raikkonen leads the US Grand Prix. Hamilton rejoins the race in third, with Vettel breathing down his neck. Lap 19/56: Ah, and now Bottas comes into the pits. He moves on to the soft tyres and flies back out into fifth, in front of Carlos Sainz. “It would be nice to know which strategy we are doing,” Alonso says. “Are we still strategy B,” he asks. Plan B does not sound as good as Plan A, but he’s content – for now. Lap 18/56: A gentle reminder that the front three, Hamilton, Bottas and Raikkonen are yet to pit, and are all on the supersoft tyres. Meanwhile, Ricciardo trudges back into the paddock. He and his Red Bull team are absolutely gutted. Lap 17/56: Vettel comes into the pits, and he’s back out in no time on the soft tyres. He rejoins the race in fifth, with Bottas up into second behind his team-mate, Hamilton. “The tyres are good,” the race leader booms. He sounds very relaxed, and is driving comfortably from the front. Lap 16/56: Daniel Ricciardo is out! He suddenly grinds to a halt during the third sector, pulling off the track as he did in Australia. “Engine’s gone,” he says, miserably. And that’s Raikkonen up into fourth. Lap 15/56: “100% pace,” Renault urge Alonso over the team radio. He promptly races into the pits, as does Sebastian Ocon, who moves on to the soft tyres. Meanwhile, Ricciardo has set a new, shiny fastest lap. Lap 13/56: There will be no punishment for Ricciardo or Bottas after their hot wheel-to-wheel action earlier on a few laps back. Lap 12/56: Raikkonen has a go at Ricciardo but the Australian drives him wide, shutting the back door in the process. Ricciardo promptly comes in to the pits. So, Raikkonen never needed to try so hard to nip in ahead of him after all. Ricciardo flies out in front of Massa, to take ninth. Lap 11/56: “As soon as we get a gap, let’s go,” Ricciardo says. Verstappen is eight seconds behind his team-mate, whose in fourth at the moment. And, there’s some bad news for Vettel, who has some blistering on his front-left tyre. He sounds sad over the Ferrari radio. Lap 10/56: Verstappen has a look down the inside of Ocon, and he’s really up for this now. Verstappen has a little nibble and moves up into sixth. His Red Bull has surged up the grid and he’s an early contender for driver of the day. Brilliant stuff so far. Meanwhile, Lance Stroll exits the pits after moving to a soft tyre. Lap 9/56: Daniel Ricciardo’s not a happy bunny. Asked how the tyres on his Red Bull are treating him, he bemoans the “dirty air” and there are a few expletives to boot. Charming. Lap 8/56: “We are Plan A, Plan A,” Hamilton is told down the team radio. It’s all going to plan at the moment. Although to take home the title tonight, Hamilton would need Vettel to tumble down the grid. Lap 7/56: Verstappen makes another move, easily bypassing Alonso. He’s flying. The Red Bull is up to seventh, now on the tail of Sebastian Ocon. Meanwhile, Pascal Wehrlein’s race is over. It looks as though he took a reasonable whack from Magnussen, who has just pitted, during the first lap. Lap 6/56: Hamilton jumps back into the lead! Vettel has no reply as Hamilton passes him, with a little help from the DRS. Hamilton had just set a new fastest lap of 1.40.387 and it looks as though he has a pace advantage. The 32-year-old leads the US Grand Prix! Lap 4/56: Can Hamilton attack Vettel? Elsewhere, a few early strategic pit-stops, while Nico Hulkenberg’s race is over. The diagnosis is not clear just yet but that’s the fourth successive year he’s not finished in the United States. Crikey. Lap 3/56: Verstappen’s on the up again, he moves beyond Perez and he jumps into 10th. A very good start the Vs. “The pace feels pretty good,” Hamilton says. Meanwhile, it’s Ricciardo v Bottas Mk II. They are having a real tasty spat out there alongside one another. Lap 2/56: Max Verstappen has soared through the grid up into 12th. He started down in 16th. Vettel, the race leader, has established a 1.2sec gap between he and Hamilton, who had no answer to the Ferrari’s aggressive but measured start. Lap 1/56: Vettel has taken the lead on the first lap. Raikkonen lost out to Ocon as the drivers left the grid. Meanwhile, Ricciardo has a go at Bottas but the Mercedes fights him off. Brilliant driving from Bottas. Vettel steals in to move ahead of Hamilton at turn 1, while Alonso nips in front of Carlos Sainz. Hamilton attempted to shift the Ferrari wide but Vettel has made a dream start. It gets better. Usain Bolt waves away the drivers for the start of this formation lap ... and here’s a gentle reminder of the permutations this evening: Buffer’s back for more. He’s just boomed “let’s get ready to rumbleeeeeee!”. It’s painful but alarmingly effective. The race, the real action, will be upon us in no time. We are just a few minutes away from the off ... will Hamilton do it? And, no, not take a knee (he did not), but rather can he clinch a fourth title in Austin. After some boxing-style drivers’ introductions, it is down to business and time for the national anthem. “Your championship leader, he’s the only driver in history to win a grand prix in every year of racing,” booms MC Michael Buffer, “three-time world champion Lewissssss Hamiltoooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnn!” How is Hamilton feeling? “I feel the best I have ever been,” he says, before bigging up his plant-based diet. “I miss Nutella, I miss sweets.” As for Daniel Ricciardo, he’s confident too. “It has been super windy all weekend tricky,” the Red Bull driver says. “I have had a few podiums so would love to get a win here. The win is possible.” On the grid, Carlos Sainz, the Renault driver who starts from seventh, has been chatting. “The race will be a bit of a discovery for me,” he says. “It will be a good experience.” As for his countryman, Fernando Alonso, he says: “The goal is to be in the top 10, we need some points today. We need to execute the race well today.” Alonso begins his mission from down in eighth. Kevin Magnussen talks: “points are definitely possible today.” So Hamilton warmed up for this race by taking Usain Bolt for a spin. He almost lost control at one corner but it seems they both had bundles of fun. “This is my first time at F1,” Bolt said. “I have seen the work Lewis has put in over the years and I am just happy he is going to make history.” Usain’s feeling confident, at least. 1. Hamilton 2. Vettel 3. Bottas 4. Ricciardo 5. Raikkonen 6. Ocon 7. Sainz 8. Alonso 9. Perez 10. Massa 11. Kvyat 12. Grosjean 13. Ericsson 14. Wehrlein 15. Stroll 16. Verstappen 17. Magnussen 18. Hulkenberg 19. Hartley 20. Vandoorne The good news? It is all coming together rather nicely for Lewis Hamilton, so nicely that he could – in theory – take home a fourth championship title in a few hours time. He racked up his 72nd pole with minimum fuss in Austin yesterday, and his 11th of the season. The bad news? Valtteri Bottas, his Mercedes team-mate, lost second place on the grid late in qualifying to his foe and title rival, Sebastian Vettel. Hamilton has downplayed such an idea himself too, insisting the dream outcome is “highly unlikely”. “Sebastian is right there and unless he makes a silly mistake, which is unlikely – he is a four-times world champion – we will see it going on,” Hamilton said. “He is going to try to win and I’m going to try the same. I expect nothing but the best from him.” All in all, it points towards a cracker. Hamilton has a 59-point cushion over Vettel with four races to go, including this one. Put simply, a win in the United States combined with a Vettel slip-up so drastic that he would finish outside the top five and it would be a case of job done. Before the race, Hamilton spoke about the excitement of go-kart racing, his desire to ‘race’ Vettel for the title. He almost doesn’t want to do it tonight. Anyway, elsewhere Usain Bolt has talked up his chances of becoming a footballer – once he’s got a hamstring hiccup all sorted – and Bill Clinton’s in town too. As, unsurprisingly, is Chase Carey. Strap yourselves in.

The stars of some of the most famous children’s books of the 20th century, they have become deeply familiar in their incarnations as fridge magnets, soft toys, on the tail fins of Finnish planes and in a newly opened museum in Finland. They have also appeared in cartoon strips and animations, with a new film coming at Christmas and a new animated series promised in 2019 featuring the likes of Kate Winslet, Rosamund Pike and Will Self. The Moomins may not, however, have been how Jansson would have chosen her work to be defined. Their pottering around their flowery valley, and hibernating through the fierce Nordic winters until a messenger brings news of spring made her famous the world over, but they have completely overshadowed the reputation as a serious painter that she yearned for all her life, and which the Dulwich exhibition will try to rescue. “The pictures are wonderful,” said the gallery’s director, Jennifer Scott. “I’ve surprised myself at how drawn I feel to them. She fits perfectly into one of the things we do best at Dulwich, which is to take a very unfamiliar name, or a name people think they know, and show a completely different aspect of their work.” Despite the scores of paintings from private collections and Finland’s national gallery, the Ateneum in Helsinki, including a haunting last self-portrait painted years before Jansson’s death aged 87 in 2001, the Moomins have crept into half the exhibition space and taken over the final room. The first Moomin book was published at the end of the second world war and was clearly in its shadow, a surprisingly dark fantasy of a world almost destroyed by catastrophic flood. Other books followed, but it was only when one was translated into English in 1951, and her creations became a cartoon strip for the London Evening News, that she became internationally famous. Clare Simpson, the head of exhibitions at Dulwich, was helping Liisa Kantanen from the Ateneum set out the fragile models of the characters, beautifully made by Jansson’s life partner, the artist and craft worker Tuulikki Pietilä, and borrowed from a private collection. Directing the little figures to turn toward one another in conversation, she said: “I feel sorry for Tove really. The Moomins brought her fame and money, which bought her freedom, but they also cannibalised her time and creative energy and distracted her from what she considered her real work.” The exhibition includes original artwork for the strip, believed long lost, which turned up in an uncatalogued envelope in the collection of the Cartoon Archive in Kent. After seven years writing and drawing the strip, Jansson was so drained by the work she handed it on to her brother, who kept it going until 1975. Jansson was born into a family of hardworking artists in Helsinki in 1914 – her father was a sculptor, but most of the bills were paid by her mother’s illustration work – and earned money from magazine and book illustration from the age of 15. The exhibition shows her covers for the satirical magazine Garm, including a wartime Christmas number of a dancing Hitler roaring for cake. Some include tiny hippo like figures, the first appearance in print of the Moomins, which she had been drawing since sketching them on the wall of a childhood holiday home. The exhibition’s curator, Sointu Fritze, who is also chief curator at the Ateneum, said the Moomins had earned their place in the exhibition, even if they often made it hard for Jansson to be taken seriously as a painter at a time when hierarchies in art were still rigid. “Although Tove Jansson was sometimes tired of the Moomins or frustrated to be known primarily as the ‘Moomin Mamma who can also paint’, she did take the work on Moomins as seriously, with a strong devotion, as her painting,” Fritze said. “I think she was herself able to see her ouvre as a continuum and a whole, the sources of inspiration being very much the same for everything she did.” Tove Jansson 1914 - 2001, Dulwich Picture Gallery, 25 October 2017 - 28 January 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/media-blog/2017/oct/22/niveas-latest-white-is-right-advert-is-the-tip-of-a-reprehensible-iceberg","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T12:08:51Z","webTitle":"Nivea's latest 'white is right' advert is the tip of a reprehensible iceberg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/media-blog/2017/oct/22/niveas-latest-white-is-right-advert-is-the-tip-of-a-reprehensible-iceberg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/media-blog/2017/oct/22/niveas-latest-white-is-right-advert-is-the-tip-of-a-reprehensible-iceberg","fields":{"headline":"Nivea's latest 'white is right' advert is the tip of a reprehensible iceberg","bodyText":"“Now I have visibly fairer skin, making me feel younger,” declares the Nigerian actor Omowunmi Akinnifesi in an advert for a new face cream. The ad, for the global skincare brand Nivea, was only ever intended to reach a west African audience, but predictably – has Nivea heard of the internet? – it has been watched and shared millions of times around the world including in the UK, where most of us live in blissful ignorance of the fact that some of our most popular brands openly promote the idea in other markets that white is right. Nivea says the ad was not intended to offend, but offence is not the point. The global market for skin lightening products, of which west Africa is a significant part, is worth $10bn (£7.6bn). Advertising has a long and unbroken history of promoting and normalising white beauty standards, and if Britain built its empire as a geopolitical and ideological project, the advertising industry commodified it. Soap brands such as Pears built a narrative that cast Africa as dark and its people as dirty, the solution to which – conveniently – was soap. Cleansing, lightening and civilising in one handy bar. These days the marketing has become much more sophisticated. Ads speak of “toning” as code for whitening. Lancôme, which a few years ago got in trouble for using Emma Watson’s image to market its Blanc Expert line in Asia, emphasised that it does not lighten, but rather “evens skin tone, and provides a healthy-looking complexion … an essential part of Asian women’s beauty routines”. Social media has become a new battle ground. The photography industry only bothered developing the technology to lighten black skin historically because of complaints over poor light calibration from makers of brown furniture. Today, Snapchat’s retouching tools, whether adding flowers, bunny features or Frida Kahlo filters, can make your skin several shades lighter too. Facebook apologised for a similar innovation earlier this year. Shadism, pigmentocracy – the idea of privilege accruing to lighter-skinned black people – and other hierarchies of beauty are a complex picture in which ads such as Nivea’s are only the obvious tip of an insidious iceberg. Celebrities with darker complexions, such as the Sudanese model Nyakim Gatwech – nicknamed Queen of the Dark – and actors such as Lupita Nyong’o, are so often discussed in the context of having achieved the seemingly impossible by being both dark and beautiful, that they become the exceptions that prove the rule. It is often observed that light-skinned black women are more likely to become global superstars, the Beyoncé-Rihanna effect. They are, however, still black women and therefore not immune from the pressure to lighten – most recently by fans following a new Photoshopping trend of posting pictures of whitened versions of their faces and remarking upon the improvement. In countries such as Ghana, the intended audience for the Nivea ad, and Nigeria – where an estimated 77% of women use skin-lightening products – the debate has so far, understandably, focused on health. The most toxic skin-lightening ingredients, still freely available, include ingredients such as hydroquinone, mercury and corticosteroid. It’s not unusual for these to be mixed with caustic agents ranging from automotive battery acid, washing power, toothpaste and cloth bleaching agents, with serious and irreversible health consequences. There is no suggestion that global brands such as Nivea or Lancôme are using any of these illegal and harmful ingredients, and African countries are moving towards greater regulation of the products themselves. Ghana, for example, has banned hydroquinone. These powerful corporations are, however, still freely operating in a context where millions of low-income women experience the high-end messaging of their glossy billboards, but can only afford to opt for cheaper, black market products. Advertising standards have been enforced against beauty conglomerates for adverts that are overly retouched, but only India, another of the biggest markets for skin lightening products, has banned adverts depicting people with darker skin as inferior. Maybe it is time that changed. This is an industry expected to reach $31bn by 2024, as growing awareness of dangerous, toxic products drives extra demand for a “fairness solution with natural, herbal and organic ingredients”, according to market analysts. As such, Nivea’s ad with its clever Natural Fairness branding is bang on trend. The product itself may be safe to use, but the messaging that sells it is as deeply poisonous as ever. ***** I am an audiobook evangelist. It’s no exaggeration. I reckon I convert an average of two people a week to my new way of life, often busy working parents like me who lament the radically altered ratio of domestic tasks to time spent reading. I’m not on commission – though maybe I should be – but this week I discovered that I am part of a new subculture I didn’t know existed, the “ultra hardcore” reader. This new identity of mine is described, rather appealingly, as a restless tribe of millennials which “optimises intellectual consumption by utilising transitional moments” to consume books. In other words, we listen to audiobooks while cleaning the sink. It’s less original than I thought. The audiobook industry is booming. A report last December estimated the industry was worth £91m, based on almost 11m units sold in 2015. The Publishers Association puts the value at less, but says that audiobook downloads in the UK increased by more than a quarter in 2016. No surprise perhaps then that this week the Canadian company Audiobook is launching into the UK market with a catalogue of 70,000 titles, providing the Amazon-owned Audible with some much needed competition. Audible makes so many audiobooks that, at one point, its founder boasted that it was the biggest employer of actors in the New York City area. As the New York Times put it, today’s actors don’t read for the part, reading is the part. When I looked up why audiobooks are so popular, Google thought I wanted to know why they are expensive – and they are, often double or triple the cost of the average e-book. I can’t help wondering how much those actors are getting paid. ***** I often find myself advocating a better vocabulary for discussing issues of race and identity. It’s not about political correctness, but rather accuracy, appropriateness and sophistication. “BAME” serves a useful purpose in the media and public policy as a way of talking about black and minority ethnic people, but it’s worth remembering that no one brushing their teeth in the morning looks in the mirror and sees a BAME person gazing back at them. When someone describes a TV show, as I heard this week, as including “two white people and one diverse person”, then I know we have a problem. Diversity is not an identity and being white is not its opposite, but that’s obviously not clear to everyone. Now that “what is diversity” is one of most frequently searched phrases online, I reckon – when it comes to understanding the concept – a bit of homogeneity is in order."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/24/death-malta-journalist-linked-fuel-smuggling-network-says-italian-prosecutor","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T09:19:52Z","webTitle":"Death of Maltese journalist 'linked to fuel smuggling network' says Italian prosecutor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/24/death-malta-journalist-linked-fuel-smuggling-network-says-italian-prosecutor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/24/death-malta-journalist-linked-fuel-smuggling-network-says-italian-prosecutor","fields":{"headline":"Death of Maltese journalist 'could be linked to fuel-smuggling network'","bodyText":"There are possible links between the murder of the investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed by a car bomb in Malta last week, and an Italian investigation into an illicit fuel-smuggling network, according to a senior Italian prosecutor. Carmelo Zuccaro, a chief prosecutor in Sicily who is leading the fuel-smuggling inquiry, told the Guardian he “could not exclude” the possibility that some of the men targeted in his investigation – which spans Libya, Malta, and Italy, and allegedly involves an organised crime network in Sicily – could be behind Caruana Galizia’s murder. “[She] worked in the past on articles about the fuel trafficking between Libya and Malta,” Zuccaro said, adding that some of the people involved in his inquiry had been named by her in several articles. While the investigation into the multimillion-euro fuel-smuggling ring has been under way for months, Italian authorities made a series of arrests days after Caruana Galizia’s murder. None of those arrested have been formally accused of any involvement in the journalist’s death. Darren Debono, a Maltese, was arrested on the Italian island of Lampedusa on Friday and charged with being part of the illegal Malta-based network, which allegedly has ties to Libyan militia leaders and has smuggled tens of millions of euro in fuel from Libya to markets in Europe. Debono has not been accused of any crimes in connection with the journalist’s murder. It is not clear how long he was in Lampedusa before his arrest or how he got there. Police in Malta said they were “investigating all possible avenues” related to the journalist’s killing and had made contact with their counterparts in Italy immediately after Debono’s arrest. Debono, a former Malta football player, was among the subjects of Caruana Galizia’s journalism. In blogposts she published in February 2016, she said Debono was a restaurant owner and fisherman who did “a lot of ‘business’ with Libya”. She also claimed to have received an email threat from a relative of Debono who was allegedly upset by some of her earlier work on the family’s activities. Caruana Galizia wrote in her blog that Debono was at risk of getting “blown up” after the murders of two other “fishermen” with business ties to Libya who had “been blown up in their cars”. The Guardian contacted two of Debono’s former lawyers but both said they had not been in touch with him and declined to comment. Attempts to collaborate with Maltese authorities on the oil-smuggling investigation had not been fruitful, Zuccaro said. An international request for information submitted to investigators in Malta had gone unanswered for 18 months. Malta was “becoming a sort of crime haven for all kinds of mobsters”, he said. Malta authorities said any claim that they were deliberately failing to cooperate with other jurisdictions on the case was “completely untrue and unjust”. The attorney general initiated court proceedings to gather evidence and hear witnesses within three months of Italy’s request in October 2016, a government spokesman said; two sittings have already been held and a third is scheduled. Italian prosecutors alleged in court documents that the criminal organisation at the heart of the fuel-smuggling case had trafficked €30m (£26.7m) worth of fuel in the last 12 months. According to investigators, who made use of wiretaps, the fuel was smuggled from a refinery in Zawyia, Libya, and shipped to Malta, before being moved to Italy, Spain, and France. Fahmi Bin Khalifa, a resident of Malta who was arrested in Tripoli in August, was the alleged mastermind of the group. Prosecutors said Bin Khalifa was imprisoned under the Gaddafi regime but released after the dictator’s death. They believe he became the leader of a militia group with connections to Libya’s national oil company and has smuggled weapons and people. The illicit funds used in the operation were transferred through Tunisian shell companies and ended up in the United Arab Emirates, prosecutors said in court documents. Investigators have alleged that the network also has ties to the Santapaola mafia crime family in Catania, Sicily, which was blamed for the 1984 murder of a Sicilian journalist, Giuseppe Fava. Prosecutors did not name Caruana Galizia in their 284-page indictment of Debono and others linked to the crime syndicate. But they described how Debono had “expressed rage” against a panel of United Nations experts in 2016 after they told the security council how fuel was being smuggled from Libya through Malta. The indictment records that Debono was overheard on wiretapped conversations expressing anger about aWall Street Journal article on the topic, which he was convinced had influenced the UN experts’ findings. “They are just copying and pasting what that asshole of a journalist wrote on the Wall Street Journal,” he allegedly told a friend. Caruana Galizia had posted the WSJ article on her own blog, called Running Commentary. Roberto Montalto, one of Caruana Galizia’s lawyers, said the late journalist had never specifically mentioned Debono, but generally did not pay much attention to threats she received. Authorities in Malta, he said, were working on the understanding that the murder had been commissioned by a “local person” but that it was likely to have been committed on behalf of an international criminal organisation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/22/uk-business-chiefs-unite-urgent-brexit-transition-deal-david-davis","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T14:11:38Z","webTitle":"UK business chiefs unite to demand urgent Brexit transition deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/22/uk-business-chiefs-unite-urgent-brexit-transition-deal-david-davis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/22/uk-business-chiefs-unite-urgent-brexit-transition-deal-david-davis","fields":{"headline":"UK business chiefs unite to demand urgent Brexit transition deal","bodyText":"UK business leaders have united to urge David Davis to quickly establish a Brexit transition deal that mirrors existing arrangements or risk losing British jobs and investment. In a letter to the Brexit secretary seen by the Guardian, five of the UK’s biggest business lobby groups said time was running out for the government to strike a transition deal before firms start to rein in spending plans as they finalise budgets for 2018 and prepare to implement contingency plans for Britain’s departure from the EU. “We need agreement of transitional arrangements as soon as possible, as without urgent agreement many companies have serious decisions about investment and contingency plans to take at the start of 2018,” the business groups wrote. “Failure to agree a transition period of at least two years could have wide-reaching and damaging consequences for investment and trade, as firms review their investment plans and business strategies.” The joint intervention is a sign of the mounting anxiety among UK businesses about the lack of progress in Brexit negotiations, almost seven months after the prime minister, Theresa May, triggered article 50. Insiders said business groups wanted to present a united front in their key priorities for Brexit. The letter follows last week’s meeting of EU leaders in Brussels, where there was a more conciliatory tone but ittle in the way of solid progress. There is still no agreement on transition arrangements after March 2019, when the UK leaves the union, and discussions on a long-term trade deal have not yet begun. It is understood that in recent days Treasury officials have started asking business groups whether they are preparing to offer their members advice on what to do in the event of no deal. The CBI and British Chambers of Commerce were among the signatories warning Davis of the potentially dire consequences for the UK economy if he failed to agree a transition period of at least two years with the EU. The bosses of the manufacturing trade body EEF, the Institute of Directors and the Federation of Small Businesses also signed the letter on behalf of their members, who employ millions of UK workers. They stressed that a transition period before new long-term arrangements came into force should be “matched as closely as possible to the current UK relationship”, to limit disruption to firms. A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the European Union said: “The prime minister proposed a strictly time-limited implementation period in her Florence speech and was clear in her article 50 letter that agreeing this principle early in the process would help minimise unnecessary disruption to businesses in both the UK and the EU. “We are making real and tangible progress in a number of vital areas in negotiations. However, many of the issues that remain are linked to the discussions we need to have on our future relationship. “That is why we are pleased that the EU has now agreed to start internal preparatory discussions on the framework for transitional arrangements as well as our future partnership.” The letter is the latest in a string of warnings to the government that without an urgent breakthrough in Brexit negotiations, businesses are likely to take jobs and investment elsewhere to avoid as much uncertainty as possible. Earlier this month, Sam Woods, a deputy governor at the Bank of England, said banks and other City firms would activate their Brexit contingency plans if there was no deal on a transition period by Christmas. The boss of Goldman Sachs, one of the world’s biggest investment banks, signalled his intention last week to relocate jobs out of the UK to Germany in a provocative tweet while May was at the EU summit, underlining the pressure on her government to protect British jobs. Lloyd Blankfein said he expected to be “spending a lot more time” in Frankfurt from now on. The lobby groups called on the government to publicly state its position on an implementation phase, sending “EU negotiators a strong positive signal of the government’s readiness to discuss this economically crucial issue”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/oct/23/stephen-hawking-1966-thesis-cambridge-university-properties-of-expanding-universes","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T23:01:04Z","webTitle":"Stephen Hawking's 1966 doctoral thesis made available for first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/23/stephen-hawking-1966-thesis-cambridge-university-properties-of-expanding-universes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/oct/23/stephen-hawking-1966-thesis-cambridge-university-properties-of-expanding-universes","fields":{"headline":"Stephen Hawking's 1966 doctoral thesis made available for first time","bodyText":"Anyone in the world can now download and read the doctoral thesis of a 24-year-old Cambridge postgraduate student, written in 1966; how many will fully understand Properties of Expanding Universes is another matter. Stephen Hawking hopes that giving free access to his early work will inspire others, not just to think and learn but to share research. He said: “By making my PhD thesis open access, I hope to inspire people around the world to look up at the stars and not down at their feet; to wonder about our place in the universe and to try and make sense of the cosmos. “Anyone, anywhere in the world should have free, unhindered access to not just my research, but to the research of every great and inquiring mind across the spectrum of human understanding.” Cambridge University, which calls the thesis “historic and compelling”, says it is already the most-requested item in its open access repository, Apollo. “In just the past few months, the university has received hundreds of requests from readers wishing to download Prof Hawking’s thesis in full.” The work considers implications and consequences of the expansion of the universe, and its conclusions include that galaxies cannot be formed through the growth of perturbations that were initially small. The thesis is now freely available to all, to mark Open Access Week 2017. Hawking said: “Each generation stands on the shoulders of those who have gone before them, just as I did as a young PhD student in Cambridge, inspired by the work of Isaac Newton, James Clerk Maxwell and Albert Einstein. It’s wonderful to hear how many people have already shown an interest in downloading my thesis – hopefully they won’t be disappointed now that they finally have access to it.” Hawking’s thesis, with a typed dedication to his supervisor, and a handwritten “this dissertation is my original work – SW Hawking”, set him on the path to becoming one of the most famous scientists in the world. He remains a commanding figure decades after a form of motor neurone disease – diagnosed soon after his 21st birthday – left him confined to a wheelchair and dependent on a computerised voice system for speech. His 1988 A Brief History of Time became one of the most successful popular science books ever published, with more than 10m copies sold worldwide in more than 40 languages. At Oxford he studied physics though his father wanted him to take medicine, because his own original choice of mathematics wasn’t available. According to his website, “after three years and not very much work” he was awarded a first-class honours degree – he now holds 12 honorary degrees – and then moved to Cambridge to undertake research in cosmology. From 1979 to 2009 he was the Lucasian professor of mathematics at the university – a post once held by Isaac Newton – and he retains an office in the department. The university hopes that Hawking’s thesis may encourage other scholars to make their work freely available online. From this October all PhD graduates will be required to deposit a digital copy of their theses, and will be urged to make them open access. Cambridge will also be trying to persuade all its former academics, who include 98 Nobel prize winners, to follow Hawking’s example. The university library has 8m books and periodicals, and a million maps, on 125 miles of shelving expanding by two miles every year. The treasures in the Apollo archive, which together have been downloaded a million times from all over the world in 2017, include 15,000 research articles, 10,000 images and 2,400 theses. However, the university says it is often a struggle to give free access to historic theses. Arthur Smith, deputy head of scholarly communication, said more open-access research could lead to major breakthroughs. He said: “By eliminating the barriers between people and knowledge we can realise new breakthroughs in all areas of science, medicine and technology. “It is especially important for disseminating the knowledge acquired during doctoral research studies. PhD theses contain a vast trove of untapped and unique information just waiting to be used, but which is often locked away from view and scrutiny.” Hawking, whose original medical diagnosis more than half a century ago gave him two years to live, continues to work and and lecture internationally. Richard Branson has offered him a free place on his Virgin Galactic spacecraft, and his website says “he still hopes to make it into space one day”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/22/written-on-skin-review-george-benjamin-melos-sinfonia-west-road-concert-hall-cambridge-opera","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T12:52:53Z","webTitle":"Written on Skin review – spare staging highlights richness of Benjamin's opera","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/22/written-on-skin-review-george-benjamin-melos-sinfonia-west-road-concert-hall-cambridge-opera","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/22/written-on-skin-review-george-benjamin-melos-sinfonia-west-road-concert-hall-cambridge-opera","fields":{"headline":"Written on Skin review – spare staging highlights richness of Benjamin's opera","bodyText":"In the five years since its premiere at the Aix-en-Provence festival, Written on Skin has travelled widely. In Britain alone, there have been two runs of the original Aix production, at Covent Garden, and in a concert performance at the Barbican in London – all with more or less the same cast. But this concert staging put on by the Melos Sinfonia, conducted by Oliver Zeffman and directed by Jack Furness with a outstanding cast of young, up-and-coming singers, offered a wholly different perspective on George Benjamin’s second stage work. Like all of the best operas, it is dramatically and musically rich enough to reveal more and more facets of itself with every new interpretation. Furness’s staging of this medieval tale was spare – a few chairs, essential props, and casual modern clothes for the protagonists. The style of Martin Crimp’s libretto, in which characters regularly describe their actions in the third person, and often deliver lines as reported speech, can seem arch and contrived in a full staging, but seems much more involving when the dramatic trappings are minimised. The concert hall presentation also emphasised connections between Written on Skin and Benjamin’s only previous “opera”, Into the Little Hill, in which the packaging is even more spare. The sense of detachment, of keeping the action at arms’ length, may be sharper in the earlier work, but it’s there in Written on Skin, too, despite the intensity and horror of the emotions portrayed. Hearing the work in concert makes the score itself seem even more miraculous. Zeffman’s impressively lucid conducting and the Melos Sinfonia’s totally assured playing ensured that the rainbow of colours that Benjamin conjures from a large orchestra containing exotica such as glass harmonica, two mandolins and bass viola da gamba, were vividly conveyed. The West Road Concert Hall perhaps confined some of the biggest climaxes, but the singers coped superbly. Ross Ramgobin was a smouldering Protector, a walking time-bomb; Patrick Terry was the Boy, the artist employed by the Protector to create the illuminated manuscript intended to celebrate his power, with such horrifying results, while the simplicity of the staging allowed the two angels, Bethan Langford and Nick Pritchard, to become a more telling part of the action than they were in the original production. Most thrilling of all, Lauren Fagan’s gleaming, intense performance showed what a extraordinary dramatic creation the character of Agnès is, one of the great operatic heroines of the past 100 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/22/rosemary-leach-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T13:18:08Z","webTitle":"Rosemary Leach obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/22/rosemary-leach-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/22/rosemary-leach-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Rosemary Leach obituary","bodyText":"The talented and accomplished actor Rosemary Leach, who has died aged 81, reminded an interviewer in 2012 that she had never been invited to appear with either the National Theatre or the Royal Shakespeare Company. “I’m as good as Judi Dench, I’m sure I am,” she added, before saying how lucky she had been to have had such an extensive and all-consuming career on television. Viewers had warmed to her expansive features, beautifully modulated voice and emotionally truthful acting on screen since the mid-1960s. She appeared in such notable series as The Power Game (1965-69), as the lover of a ruthless building tycoon, John Wilder (Patrick Wymark), The Jewel in the Crown (1984), as Aunt Fenny in the hit adaptation of Paul Scott’s twilight-of-the-Raj quartet and as the victimised widow who falls for a murderous conman and total cad (Nigel Havers) in The Charmer (1987), an acrid 30s drama based on a Patrick Hamilton novel. She moved effortlessly across the class and social divide, playing royalty – a starchy, porcelain-voiced Queen Victoria in Claude Whatham’s fine four-part Disraeli (1978) and arguably the best of all Queen Elizabeth IIs, in three separate BBC dramas, Prince William (2002), Tea With Betty (2006) and Margaret (2009) – as well as “ordinary” mums: she was luminous as Laurie Lee’s mother in Cider With Rosie (1971) and heartily earthy as David Essex’s in That’ll Be the Day (1973). Her true valour was rarely seen on stage, though when it was she was unforgettable. In 1982, she won the Olivier best actress award for her performance as Helene Hanff, the eccentric Manhattan bibliophile, in 84 Charing Cross Road, an enchanting two-hander, adapted and directed by James Roose-Evans, based on the transatlantic correspondence of Hanff and an antiquarian bookshop manager, who never met each other. On the first night, Hanff – small intense, bird-like – appeared on the stage of the Ambassadors theatre alongside her counterpart. Leach looked nothing like her, but had brilliantly distilled the very essence of her charm and character, and made her story profoundly moving. Born in Much Wenlock, Shropshire, Rosemary was the second daughter of teachers, Sidney and Mary (nee Parker). Her father was headteacher (as well as organist and choirmaster) at the village school in Diddlebury, near Ludlow. Rosemary was educated at Oswestry girls high school, where she excelled in plays. After a brief spell selling shoes in the Reading branch of John Lewis, she went to London, aged 18, to train at Rada. She graduated in 1955 and immediately plunged into the dying days of small regional repertory companies in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, then Coventry, for two years. Her roles grew bigger at the larger reps in Liverpool and Birmingham, where she worked with Bernard Hepton (a lifelong friend and colleague) and Derek Jacobi. But while the National and the RSC were getting under way in the early 60s, Leach was establishing herself as a permanent member of what she described as “a sort of television rep”, making her debut in two episodes of the police series Z Cars in 1962. The TV die was cast – and she would be nominated, in all, five times for a Bafta award, never winning one – when she signed up for The Plane Makers in 1963 with Wymark and Barbara Murray. It was a prequel to The Power Game, set in a fictional aircraft factory with trade union struggles, an infighting management and political and personal chicanery at every turn. These were significant TV dramas, and the six years of them ended only because Wymark died in 1970. From this point, Leach was in demand. She was Laura, the amenable wife to pint-sized (“male chauvinist piglet”) Ronnie Corbett in No, That’s Me Over There (1967), Now Look Here … (1971) and The Prince of Denmark (1974), with scripts by Barry Cryer, Graham Chapman and Eric Idle. She figured prominently, as lover and mistress, respectively, in Zola’s Germinal (1970), which charted the brutal suppression of a miners’ strike in northern France, and Sartre’s Roads to Freedom (also 1970), an utterly gripping 13-part series set in the period around the start of the second world war. She returned to the stage in the mid-70s, playing a (then) fashionably bedenimed journalist, a hilariously unlikely amalgam of Jilly Cooper and Jill Tweedie, in Don Taylor’s Chekhovian Out on the Lawn at the Watford Palace (with marvellous performances, too, from TP McKenna, Dinah Sheridan and Edward Hardwicke). She joined the founding company in 1976 at George Murcell’s St George’s theatre, Tufnell Park, which stuttered on for a decade, with a programme devoted to Shakespeare; the opening season comprised Twelfth Night, Romeo and Juliet and Richard III. Her next (and last) brush with Shakespeare came as Emilia in Jonathan Miller’s richly textured BBC television Othello in 1981, with Anthony Hopkins “blacking up” in the lead, just about before it became impossible to do so, Bob Hoskins as her husband, Iago, and Penelope Wilton as Desdemona. Although she had been prominent in television films of The Adventures of Don Quixote (1973), with Rex Harrison and Frank Finlay, and Brief Encounter (1974) which gloriously miscast Richard Burton and Sophia Loren in the Trevor Howard/Celia Johnson roles, her most “prestigious” film was Merchant Ivory’s star-laden A Room With a View (1985), in which she ticked off another notable mum, Mrs Honeychurch. She appeared in two television adaptations of Edith Wharton novels, The Children (1990), scripted by Timberlake Wertenbaker and directed by Tony Palmer, and The Buccaneers (1995) directed by Philip Saville, in which she made a marvellous meal of Selina Marable, snobbish Marchioness of Brightlingsea. In between the Whartons, she materialised in Stuart Urban’s An Ungentlemanly Act (1992) as Mavis Hunt, holding the fort in the Falklands during the invasion alongside her husband, the governor, Rex Hunt (later knighted), played by Ian Richardson. There was more quality work in Jack Rosenthal’s scripts for an early suburban sitcom with Hepton, Sadie, It’s Cold Outside (1975); his adaptation of Stanley Houghton’s Hindle Wakes (1976) for Laurence Olivier – the only television show Olivier ever directed; and Day to Remember (1986), on Channel 4, in which she struggled through Christmas with George Cole as her husband with dementia. Hepton was alongside, too, in The Charmer, as her “white knight” admirer. A full decade after 84 Charing Cross Road, she returned to the West End in a superb revival by Peter Hall of Terence Rattigan’s Separate Tables at the Albery, stretching the critical thesaurus to fully appreciate her magnificent Mrs Railton-Bell, righteous defender of public morality shading into bigotry. The Rattigan revival was safe in her hands, and those of Peter Bowles, Patricia Hodge, Ernest Clark and Miriam Karlin. She toured in some creaky revivals of Emlyn Williams and William Douglas-Home before joining one of the longest-running sitcoms of the new millennium, My Family, starring Robert Lindsay and Zoë Wanamaker, dropping in between 2003 and 2007 as Wanamaker’s “difficult” alcoholic mother. Her last movie was Stuart Urban’s may i kill u? (2012), a low-budget black comedy in which a policeman is transformed into a vigilante killer on the night of the Tottenham riots of 2011. Leach lived quietly with her husband, the actor Colin Starkey, whom she married in 1981, in Kew and, later, in Teddington. After making The Jewel in the Crown without ever having visited India, she became a devoted traveller to that subcontinent thereafter. She is survived by Colin. • Rosemary Anne Leach, actor, born 18 December 1935; died 21 October 2017 This article was amended on 26 October 2017.

The Industrial Development Authority has rejected reports that Dublin is losing out in the European-wide race. Bloomberg claimed earlier this month that the Irish capital has fallen behind cities such as Amsterdam and Frankfurt in the competition to woo the EMA, which evaluates medical products. Tommy Fanning, the head of the development agency’s bio-pharmaceuticals division, denied the claim that Ireland has “no natural allies” in the process. Fanning said Ireland’s “natural allies” include the presence of the world’s top 10 “big pharma” corporations in the Republic. The sectors in Ireland employ about 125,000 people. “The pharmaceutical giants based in Ireland already generate €1bn per annum in the Irish economy. The top ten are here in Ireland already and many of the new drugs being brought onto the market are manufactured here in Ireland,” Fanning said. “So it makes sense that the EU-wide agency tasked with testing and evaluating these new generation of drugs – many of them blockbusters that take on serious diseases like cancer – should be based in the country where they are being developed,” he said. Fanning said a Dublin-based EMA could also test and evaluate the new generation of medical devices being made in Ireland to deliver the new drug treatments. Nineteen cities ranging from Stockholm to Bucharest are seeking to woo the EMA after the UK leaves the EU. A final decision is expected on the EMA’s new headquarters next month. The EMA has warned that the damage caused by its relocation would at best take two years to fix and at worst lead to its complete breakdown and a major public health crisis for the continent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/oct/22/everton-v-arsenal-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T14:59:24Z","webTitle":"Everton 2-5 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/oct/22/everton-v-arsenal-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/oct/22/everton-v-arsenal-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Everton 2-5 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened","bodyText":"Time to wrap this blog up, but be sure to join Rob Smyth for Spurs v Liverpool, which is kicking off now. Thanks for joining me. Cheerio! If you don’t feel like clicking on that link, because it’s Sunday and all, how’s this for an opening paragraph? Yowza! It was a lone voice but loud enough for Everton’s power-brokers, Farhad Moshiri and Bill Kenwright, to hear at the front of the directors’ box at Goodison Park. ‘Taxi for Koeman’ came the cry from one disgruntled Evertonian. Others around him laughed. Most others left. Arsenal then scored their fourth. And their fifth. Here’s Andy Hunter’s match report: Here’s Ronald Koeman: “The final result is very disappointing. I need to say Arsenal were the better team, but at 1-2 we were OK. After Gana’s sending off, they had the quality to break us down. Jordan Pickford stopped a lot in the first half, but it was really difficult to keep them out, particularly after the red card.” “I don’t know. I told the players I believe in them, but if you take everything in a negative way... we were 2-1 down until the red card. I feel like the players are working for me. We played nine games, the top five from last season, but this is not the position Everton should be in. But I don’t think it’s too late.” That was a bit of a mess, with Koeman appearing to want credit for his team being only 2-1 behind before the sending off. Will he be in charge next week against Leicester? Time will tell. Here’s Mesut Ozil: “We knew it would be difficult against Everton... we’re happy to win the game. In training [Sanchez, Lacazette and me] show our quality together – today, we played well and all three of us scored.” Ozil is awarded man of the match – I think that late goal might have swung it for Sanchez myself, but the front three were a fearsome proposition. After that frantic final few minutes, the outcome remains the same – Everton fell apart in the second half and are in the bottom three, while Arsenal are up to fifth, level with Chelsea, after making them pay with an excellent attacking performance. If Ronald Koeman was hoping to claw back some respectability, Alexis Sanchez has other ideas. He picks up the ball in the D and with Everton defenders afraid to go near him, he drifts further and further right – before slamming a shot inside the far post from a narrow angle. Magnificent. Oumar Niasse gets on the scoresheet, but he has Arsenal’s hapless defence to thank. Monreal underhits his back pass to Cech, allowing Niasse to pounce, getting a fortunate bounce off the keeper and rolling the ball in. He should really have got on his knees and headed it in, to complete the five-a-side feel... Ha, this is a lot of fun. 91 mins: Niasse wins a free kick on the edge of the area, which Sigurdsson lifts well over the bar. Five minutes added time, met by collective groans from the stands. Everton’s misery is complete as Jack Wilshere spins and slides a through ball in to Aaron Ramsey, who takes a touch and tucks the ball beyond Pickford. 89 mins: Icing on the cake time – Lacazette’s goal means that Everton drop into the bottom three on goal difference. 88 mins: Vlasic is unlucky to give the ball away in midfield, and Kolasinac cuts into the area, but steers his header wide. 86 mins: Koscielny picks up a booking to be filed under ‘needless’, standing on Niasse’s heel for no apparent reason. 85 mins: Everton have given up, and as the home defence watches on, Sanchez plays in Wilshere who skips round Pickford, but can’t pick out a team-mate with his cross I think at least a handful of Everton fans are 84 mins: Xhaka rattles the bar! Without an option for a forward pass, he scuttles past Davies and cracks an effort off the crossbar from 25 yards. Ramsey battles with Pickford for the rebound, the keeper pawing the ball away. 83 mins: Sanchez has a golden chance to make things even worse for Everton, but nods the ball wide from Bellerin’s cross. 82 mins: Arsenal substitution as the impressive Ozil is replaced by Francis Coquelin. Arsene is shutting up shop. Up after this one, a second helping of Merseyside v North London fare, as Liverpool take on Spurs at Wembley. Rob Smyth is watching that one: 79 mins: Kudos to Tom Davies for not throwing in the towel, unlike the vast majority of his team-mates. He fires a shot at Petr Cech, then scampers back to deny Ozil at the other end. “It’s a few years since I’ve been to a PTA but I don’t recall anyone chanting ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning’ at the head teacher,” says John Peters. 76 mins: Jack Wilshere is on, making his first Premier League appearance for Arsenal in 14 months. He replaces Lacazette, and is swiftly serenaded by the away fans. 74 mins: Two changes from Everton – Ademola Lookman replaces Rooney, and Calvert-Lewin goes off, a decision roundly booed by the home faithful. He’s replaced by Oumar Niasse. Vlasic gives the ball away in midfield and Sanchez tears Everton asunder with a through ball on the half-turn. Ozil races onto it down the left and pulls it back to Lacazette, who cracks a first-time shot beyond Pickford. 72 mins: Arsenal knock the ball around a while, before Everton win a free kick. Baines plays a long-distance one-two but miscues his cross, and Arsenal threaten to break. Lacazette can’t pick out Ramsey, but how long can Everton keep them out? A painful recreation of Everton’s best moment of the match, as Gueye steps in to try and take the ball from Xhaka – but he lunges in and stands on his opponent’s foot. It’s a second yellow card, and Gueye trudges off without complaint. 67 mins: A couple of dangerous crosses, from Baines and then Vlasic on the opposite flank, go unrewarded, perhaps because Everton’s only striker is currently shaking off a kick to the face. 65 mins: Sigurdsson has a half-chance, but can’t steer his header on target from 12 yards out. 62 mins: Arsenal look to have found an extra gear that’s currently beyond their opponents. Ramsey, played onside by Jonjoe Kenny, scoots clear down the right but Davies gets back to block his cross. 61 mins: Calvert-Lewin has needed plenty of treatment, in the form of cotton wool stuffed up his nose, but should be OK to carry on. 59 mins: Calvert-Lewin is down after Monreal accidentally caught him with his boot. A chance for Everton to regroup. 57 mins: “Sacked in the morning” is the predictable chant from the away end. The atmosphere around the ground is weird – it sounds more like a tetchy PTA meeting than a football match. 55 mins: Ramsey could have made things even more comfortable, picked out in acres of space 12 yards out, but thuds his shot high and wide. Sanchez motored down the left and linked up with Lacazette, before whipping a cross in from the left flank with his right boot. Ozil got the run on a static Everton back line, and flicked the ball beyond Pickford. Vlasic sees his shot blocked and Arsenal break, with that all-new AOL frontline combining for Mesut Ozil to head the visitors into the lead! 52 mins: Everton fans are grumbling at a high volume after perceived fouls on Davies and Rooney aren’t penalised... 50 mins: ...Everton regroup, and Calvert-Lewin darts ahead of Kolasinac on the right, but his cut-back is cleared by Koscielny with Sigurdsson closing in. 49 mins: Everton fans turn their ire on Pawson as Koscielny goes unpunished for a high boot on Baines... 48 mins: Arsenal win a free kick 35 yards out, from which Sanchez blasts the ball into poor Nikola Vlasic’s solar plexus. 47 mins: Davies is caught by Lacazette, who has struggled to get in the game after that early miss. Sigurdsson has another chance to wang one in, but Michael Keane can only head over from an awkward angle. Tom Davies is on for Everton, replacing the booked Ashley Williams as Koeman switches to a back four. Even better, Arsenal comes from the Arabic word ‘dar-as-sina’, which means ‘house of industry’. “A Wenger funk is amplified when deep down he must know he’s in the wrong,” writes Niall Mullen. “Is Xhaka really the sort of player for the Arsenal defence to give the ball to when he’s under pressure? Clearly not. So why sign him if you want to play that way?” To be fair, Xhaka always looked a good fit in that position at Monchengladbach – but it’s not suited him in the Premier League so far. Still, he redeemed himself with the shot that led to Monreal’s equaliser. Some half-time viewing sent in by Alex Bellios, who is one half of Football School alongside Ben Lyttleton: “It’s our YouTube channel for children, in which we explain the pressing football issues of the day. Here we ask: who is the oldest player to have played in the Premier League?” A lively old first half, and this game is perfectly poised at the break. Back in a mo. 46 mins: Sanchez is penalised for a high boot on Keane, and Sigurdsson will have a chance to whip one in from some 40 yards out. Calvert-Lewin climbs with Koscielny, who gets the last touch as it loops behind – but it’s a goal kick. 45 mins: Ozil has a go from 30 yards, but it’s a long way wide. Two added minutes. 43 mins: Pickford rescues Everton again, making himself big after Sanchez is played in by Ozil. Everton will be keen to hear the half-time whistle... 42 mins: Monreal is furious with Calvert-Lewin after a shove sends the Arsenal defender into the front row of the crowd. Calvert-Lewin lucky not to become the third name in Pawson’s book. 41 mins: Baines dallies in defence and is almost dispossessed by Bellerin. Keane is on hand to bail him out with a hoofed clearance. 40 mins: Suddenly, it’s as if the last half-hour hasn’t happened, with Arsenal tearing forward and Bellerin shooting wide when crossing looked the better option. Replays show that Xhaka’s shot took a deflection, wrongfooting Pickford who pushed the ball back into danger. Arsenal had begun to turn the screw on Everton and after Sanchez’s shot is blocked, Xhaka fires low from distance. Pickford parries it but Nacho Monreal, lurking in the area, follows up, blasting the ball inside the near post! 37 mins: After a Pickford clearance swirls in the wind, Arsenal regain possession and Ramsey makes a run into the box – but Sanchez opts to lift rather than slot his pass, and Pickford collects, much to Ramsey’s chagrin. 35 mins: Sanchez, being booed by the home fans for a dive that wasn’t, finds Lacazette, who has been let off the hook. His cross drifts out for a goal kick as the wind picks up. 33 mins: Gueye has been excellent, but has too much to do in front of the back three, and catches Sanchez 30 yards from goal. He’s booked, and will face a long final hour at this rate. Two wrongs from Pawson making a right, there – if he thought Williams had fouled Lacazette, it should have been another booking, given their positions. 30 mins: Rooney’s pass from the centre circle rebounds towards Lacazette, who goes over with Williams in close proximity! Craig Pawson blows up for the free kick, and Williams has already been booked – but replays show it was a pretty shameful dive from the Arsenal striker. 29 mins: After a patient spell of possession, Sanchez steps infield and has space to shoot – instead, he rolls the ball wide to Bellerin, whose cross is collected by Pickford. 27 mins: Vlasic dances around a couple of challenges and almost picks out Calvert-Lewin with a through ball. Koeman could do with getting the lone striker some support – Arsenal are firmly on the back foot. 26 mins: Mertesacker had kept Calvert-Lewin quiet but gets the run on him from a Rooney cross. His header towards the back post drifts several feet wide. 24 mins: Bellerin gets wound up and dives into a challenge on Gueye. Free kick, and he’s lucky not to get a booking. Sigurdsson takes the free kick, but his delivery towards Rooney is dealt with. 23 mins: Guess what? That Ramsey/Xhaka double pivot in midfield looks a bit flimsy, Gueye again intervening to start a counter-attack. Vlasic runs onto a diagonal long ball and lifts a cross towards Calvert-Lewin, but Mertesacker is on hand to head it away. 22 mins: A lovely touch from Sigurdsson finds Rooney on the right, and his cross is steered towards Baines at the far post – but Bellerin is on hand to block. 20 mins: Gueye does well as Arsenal press forward, harrying Ozil and winning a cheap free kick. The tempo has dropped a touch after a frantic first 20 minutes. 18 mins: Lacazette takes on Williams as he cuts in from the right, and the Everton defender does well not to dive in, or start a fight, instead deflecting the striker’s shot into the side-netting. Another Arsenal corner, and another that comes to nothing. 16 mins: Ashley Williams is booked for stopping a counter-attack in the agricultural style, and Arsenal have a free kick 30 yards out. Sanchez shoots and Pickford is behind it – but spills the ball and has to race out to gather it! 14 mins: Now it’s Cech’s turn to dawdle, and he’s caught by Calvert-Lewin – the ball could rebound anywhere, but squirts away from goal! Yeesh. Arsene Wenger is in a funk, arguing with the official that Gueye fouled Xhaka. Replays show a little contact from the Everton man, but Xhaka was dawdling and got what was coming to him. Remember the name, Wayne Rooney. Xhaka hands Everton an opening, stumbling and allowing Gueye to nick the ball 25 yards from goal. It runs through to Rooney who shuffles, takes aim with his right foot and curls an unstoppable shot into the top corner! And then of course, this happens. 9 mins: The best chance yet falls to Lacazette, after Everton are pulled apart once again! Ozil sidefoots to Bellerin, who puts Ramsey in behind again. His cut back finds Lacazette who turns but fires at Pickford from six yards! The keeper was out quickly, but Lacazette had to score. Based on the early evidence, trouble could be brewing for Everton. Sorry. 7 mins: Sanchez again in the thick of it, sliding a pass to Lacazette who fires a shot from an impossible angle. It has enough power to force Pickford to turn it behind, and from the corner, Ozil is offside. 6 mins: Rooney is indeed playing deeper, but not alongside Gueye, who is left to marshal central midfield by himself with Rooney and Sigurdsson (sort of) buzzing ahead of him. Rooney tries to thread a pass to Calvert-Lewin, but it’s overhit. 4 mins: Sanchez looks up for this, again cutting a swathe through the Everton defence and forcing Pickford off his line, before Williams bundles the ball behind. Everton deal with the corner, just about. 2 mins: Everton are sliced open, Sanchez cutting in from the left and finding Ozil, whose first time pass puts Ramsey in on goal. He tries to curl his shot inside the far corner, but Pickford gets a fingertip to it! 1 min: Baines whips in a cross that’s cleared away, before Gueye wins the ball back and hits a hopeful long ball towards Calvert-Lewin that runs through to Cech. Arsenal, wearing their black away kit for some reason, kick off to a throaty roar from the home crowd. Kick-off is moments away, the teams are out and hands are being shaken vigorously. It gets worse, Gary – outside the ground, there’s no tea at all! That’s not going to help the home fans’ collective mood... Speaking of Rooney, here’s some pre-match reading: Everton’s nifty Twitter team-sheet has Vlasic in midfield, but on their big touchscreen at Wembley, Jamie Redknapp and Thierry Henry have slotted Wayne Rooney in alongside Idrissa Gueye. That could be... interesting. So, Wayne Rooney starts up front as Mason Holgate and Morgan Schneiderlin drop out of the team that drew at Brighton. Nikola Vlasic is preferred in midfield to Davy Klassen or Tom Davies, who are both on the bench. Arsène Wenger brings out the big guns, with Mesut Özil replacing Alex Iwobi in the front three. He starts alongside Alexis Sánchez and Alexandre Lacazette as the AOL front three is finally unleashed. Jack Wilshere, impressive in the Europa League, is among the substitutes. Everton (3-5-2): Pickford; Keane, Jagielka, Williams; Kenny, Gueye, Sigurdsson, Vlasic, Baines; Rooney, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Robles, Mirallas, Martina, Klaassen, Davies, Lookman, Niasse. Arsenal (3-4-3): Cech; Koscielny, Mertesacker, Monreal; Bellerín, Ramsey, Xhaka, Kolasinac; Özil, Sánchez, Lacazette. Subs: Macey, Wilshere, Giroud, Walcott, Holding, Iwobi, Coquelin. Referee: Craig Pawson. Both managers arrive here under pressure but if you think Arsène Wenger looks ruffled, you should see the other guy. During Thursday’s grim defeat to Lyon, Ronald Koeman looked every inch a manager on the edge – dishevelled, raging at the officials and his own players as he fumed under a cartoon cloud of drizzle. Barely two months since he was widely tipped to steer Everton towards the top four, Koeman faces the very real prospect of dropping into the bottom three, and potentially being bundled out of a back door at Goodison Park, with defeat here today. If that seems premature, the Dutchman hasn’t helped himself, with his expensivey refurbished side stodgy going forward and dodgy at the back. By contrast Wenger, who has a season ticket for this particular rodeo, had largely muddled along under the radar before Arsenal’s late capitulation to Watford last weekend. Last season, Koeman kickstarted Everton’s campaign with a similar comeback victory over Arsenal – do so again and he can pass the pressure on to his opposite number, who can at least be expected to handle it better. Arsenal come here as favourites but, well, we’ve heard that one before. Whatever the result today, the volume will be turned up in boardrooms and fan forums for one of these coaches. Kick-off is at 1.30pm British Summer Time, and the heat is on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/21/usa-under-17s-england-under-17s-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T21:02:34Z","webTitle":"Rhian Brewster hat-trick sends England into Under-17 World Cup semi-finals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/21/usa-under-17s-england-under-17s-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/21/usa-under-17s-england-under-17s-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Rhian Brewster hat-trick sends England into Under-17 World Cup semi-finals","bodyText":"Liverpool’s Rhian Brewster scored a hat-trick as England beat the USA 4-1 in Goa to secure their first place in the U17 World Cup semi-finals.

Wolves’ Morgan Gibbs-White added a third on 64 minutes, before Josh Sargent pulled one back for the USA – but Brewster made sure with a penalty in added time.

We’ve already created a little bit of a history back in England, but we will just recover tomorrow and stick to our processes.” His team’s performance extends a brilliant run for England’s development teams in recent months, following the U20 World Cup victory and the Under-19s’ European Championship win."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/26/princes-paisley-park-brought-to-london-in-o2-show","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T17:03:34Z","webTitle":"Prince’s Paisley Park brought to London in O2 show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/26/princes-paisley-park-brought-to-london-in-o2-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/26/princes-paisley-park-brought-to-london-in-o2-show","fields":{"headline":"Prince’s Paisley Park brought to London in O2 show","bodyText":"In August 2007, Prince began the first of 21 sellout nights at London’s 02 arena, a record-breaking run of sexy, swaggering, intensely purple shows that have gone down in the annals of musical history. It seems fitting that the first exhibition celebrating the life, music and wardrobe of the singer who died in April last year is being held in the very same London venue. The show, My Name Is Prince, showcases hundreds of items from Paisley Park, the compound that the performer built in Minnesota where he lived, recorded music and played live shows. The exhibition is set against a deep purple backdrop throughout – the colour most famously associated with Prince Rogers Nelson. It takes viewers through the various transformations – and accompanying outfits – that characterised his ever-evolving style, from the 1980s Purple Rain phase, through to Sign of the Times, his Lovesexy and Dirty Minds tours, Third Eye Girl and many more. Prince was one of the most successful and celebrated artists of his generation, selling more than 100 million records worldwide. Prince’s sister Tyka Nelson, who was involved in shaping the show, said the exhibition gave his fans a space to both celebrate the singer and to say goodbye. Prince was found dead in the elevator of Paisley Park last year after an overdose of the addictive painkiller fentanyl. “I think he would have liked this show because it’s Paisley scaled down, like a doll’s house of Prince’s world,” said Nelson. “It has been emotional, it was extremely hard yesterday to see it all here but today it just feels kind of fun, the music’s going, it feels like a celebration.” Speaking about Prince’s legacy, Nelson said: “The Prince I knew was different from Prince the performer. To me he was always just a little kid up there doing what he always did since we were little at home, playing music with Mum and Daddy, no different. “But he just always did his own thing and he encouraged me, other people, all of his friends, all of the world to be themselves. Black, white, skinny, fat, tall, thin, he wanted everyone to have that I-don’t-care attitude, if you like it then I like it. “I think he got that from my mother,” she added. “She would paint and we’d come in and ask, ‘what the heck is that?’ and she’d go, ‘it’s an abstract,’ because that was her interpretation of it and she felt that was as legitimate as anything.” The centrepiece of the show is a stage shaped like the distinctive Love symbol, which he decided to change his name to in 1993 – becoming known as The Artist Formerly Known as Prince for the next seven years. Some of his most famous outfits, including those he wore in his O2 arena shows are displayed on the stage in all their opulent, sequinned glory, as well as footage from his tours. Also featured in the exhibition, which took a year to curate, are pages where he pencilled the lyrics to songs such as Erotic City, the Third Eye sunglasses from 2014, and a diamond-studded cane and waistcoat. Prince had already done much to preserve his own legacy, with Paisley Park serving as a living monument to his endless creativity. Nelson’s last words to Prince were three days before he died when he called her up to ask her to produce some tracks. She described how difficult it had been to walk back into Paisley Park in April last year “and realise that my brother wasn’t there. Every time I go back it still feels like he’s in there,” she added. “It almost feels like he’ll come round the corner any time.

But extraordinary interest payments can mean a £600 computer at Currys costs more than £2,000 at BrightHouse, while an easy-looking £7.50-a-month TV spirals into a bill of £1,100. Lisa Brady, 30, who lives in Hamilton, Scotland, and has four children, is typical of the company’s customers, often young single mums. She tells Guardian Money: “I’m on benefits and it has been my lifeline, but the payments are just shocking.” She went to BrightHouse to buy her autistic son a computer which, she said, would have cost about £600 at Currys. But with repayments, that turned into £2,287 over 26 months. “My advice to other mums is to look about first, avoid BrightHouse,” she says. This week BrightHouse was ordered to repay £14.8m to nearly 250,000 customers after the Financial Conduct Authority found it had not been a “responsible lender”. The regulator said that, in many cases, BrightHouse had not properly assessed a customer’s ability to repay – and they would now be compensated. The weekly payments advertised in big letters throughout the stores appear affordable – £7.50 for a Beko steel cooker or a Baird 43-inch UHD smart TV. But the small print underneath reveals that the cooker costs £1,132.50 at an APR of 69.9% over 151 weeks, including a £95 delivery and installation fee; the TV £1,170 over three years. Laura Hutchison, who lives with her daughter Ellie in Galston, Scotland, and is on benefits, was paying off an L-shaped sofa from BrightHouse over several years but, she says, only managed £1,800 out of £2,500, so never ended up owning it. She reckons it would have cost £500-600 on the high street. “I’d never buy anything from BrightHouse again,” she says. She has since found Fair For You, a not-for-profit credit provider that funds household goods. Hutchison has bought a bunk bed, double bed and vacuum cleaner and says it took no more than six months to pay off an item. “They cost £20 or £30 more than a high street shop.” BrightHouse is keen to stress that items in the store can be bought for less if they are paid off more quickly. Despite these sky-high costs, many say it can be the only way to get the sort of electrical goods they want. When we visited its Elephant &amp; Castle shop in south London, several customers told us the weekly payments were affordable and convenient. Pauline and David Heat, a retired couple, come in every Thursday to make their weekly payment of £116.92, to pay off eight items, including a sofa, freezer, vacuum cleaner and two TVs. David gets monthly pension payments of £859 while his wife receives £578. Isata Sillah, who works in a nursing home, has paid off 23 items over 15 years, and is now paying £35 a week for a sofa and a Nintendo games console. “It’s easy to pay weekly,” she says. But “rent to own” providers remain deeply controversial. An all-party parliamentary group on debt and personal finance, which conducted an inquiry two years ago, found customers easily pay three times as much as the high street, and many never even get to own the goods as they fall into arrears. Around 400,000 households use it and have amassed debts of £500m. They have an average annual income of £16,100 and are likely to have other high-cost debt. The typical rent-to-own customer is a young single mother who lives in social or private rented accommodation and is wholly or partly reliant on benefits, according to a 2016 report by the Financial Inclusion Centre thinktank. Gareth Evans, co-director of the thinktank, says: “We are talking about the poorest and most vulnerable of society. The threat of having essential household goods repossessed when they may have already made many months or even years worth of payments can often lead to users prioritising these repayments over food or other priority bills.” The compensation scheme at BrightHouse comes after the firm was forced to introduce stricter affordability checks. It lost 44,000 customers, closed 29 stores and racked up an £111,000 loss in the year to March. BrightHouse said it has introduced more flexible repayment terms and made its own insurance and repair cover non-mandatory. A spokesman for BrightHouse said: “We seek to offer choice and give respect to people who are excluded from mainstream credit. As long as it’s affordable and people are making an informed decision they should be allowed to choose how to spend their money.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/26/a-tricky-centenary-for-theresa-may-to-celebrate","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T17:17:00Z","webTitle":"A tricky centenary for Theresa May to celebrate | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/26/a-tricky-centenary-for-theresa-may-to-celebrate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/26/a-tricky-centenary-for-theresa-may-to-celebrate","fields":{"headline":"A tricky centenary for Theresa May to celebrate","bodyText":"Theresa May said at prime minister’s questions this week that she thinks it is important that we mark the centenary of the election of the first female MP next year.

In this generally secular world, is it any wonder that we have tried superstitiously to stuff children into little vacant God-shaped holes, or that they are doomed to frustrate expectations?) – one thing is increasingly clear: there’s a coming generation of truly fine young actors out there. Twice in glorious evidence this week. The second series of Stranger Things kicked off, appropriately enough, on a Halloween theme: kids riding choppers in a small American town in 1984; loving moms and pops dressing them in Ghostbusters outfits and filming them on early videocams with their cardboard plasma guns; pumpkins in fields rotting, savagely and raw-reeking maggotishly; kids with telekinesis hurling squirrels against trees brain-first. If you haven’t seen the first series, it’s basically 80s small-town America where, thanks to a military/scientific facility, Something Goes Wrong. It’s every Stephen King novel, ever, and done with immense style. Also The Goonies, and every Spielbergian/John Hughes trope ever offered during that decade, but with a dose of John Carpenter’s acidic horror thrown in: the 80s revisited, but for people who like to start drinking at 10.30 in the morning. It’s thrillingly moreish, for folk who like that kind of thing, and lovingly done. The galloping popularity of the first series (largely unadvertised, this was all by word of mouth) saw Netflix bump its budget from $6m to $8m per episode, and this has allowed the flixsters to employ some serious 80s nerds who might wish to get out a little more: the branded soap (Ivory, which actually floated in water!); the old arcade games magically working once more. And the second series seems to be settling into a serious exploration of what happens when a traumatised community starts to piece itself together, and the acting’s terrific, especially, as I say, from the youngsters… there’s a great deal to shiveringly love, if that’s your bag. What captivated more, however, was an easily missed programme on Channel 4. Despite its asterisk-heavy title – I had inwardly sighed; not another wacky dystopian angry youths road trip – The End of the ****ing World was mesmerically fine. Blackly and bleakly comic in parts, this adaptation of a graphic novel had grand scripting, production, filming, locations and the rest, but all were utterly outshone by the two young leads. Alex Lawther, best known for his phenomenal young Alan Turing in The Imitation Game, haunted throughout as the confused maybe-psycho with a fat knife down his sock. Jessica Barden, as the gobby, sweet, foul-mouthed innocent, was never less than convincing, either in her beyond-her-years cynical wisdom or sudden wee-girl vulnerability. These two runaways, from boredom, from adults, from actually having to manage to tackle sex, had so many winning ways about them I was almost physically urging them on toward the sunlit uplands, where of course it all went wrong. A dirty, hard watch, and wonderful. So how, actually, should we bring up our children? It was a subject vaguely tackled in Feral Families, which despite its clickbait title at least attempted an honest exploration of the rise in no-rules home schooling, in which children are free to dance among the daisies – or nettles – all day long. That the programme sought neither to applaud nor condemn was both its strength and its greatest weakness: I could have done with a couple of warring educational panellists to explore further; in fact I could have done with a whole series of this. No British law obliges anyone to have their children educated but, as usual, class was at the heart. I could almost engage with the Rawnsleys from Halifax, whose son Finlay suddenly decided he did want to go to school – and, after a bit of welcome order, vouchsafed that most of the teaching was “pointless, restricting”… and went back to dancing among the daisies with a polite “Are we done now? Can I go back?” to the camera. Archie from Salisbury, on the other hand, can’t read, count or write, and more crucially doesn’t see the point, ever. Despite grandad Mick’s desperate funding for a private tutor, I suspect Archie never will. I do wonder where Finlay and Archie will be in 10 years’ time, and also wonder whether so many of us, and our children, should count simply “being happy” as the sine qua non of existence. “Yes, I make this all the time for my kids,” twinkled the splendidly dry Noel Fielding, in answer to an anguished contestant’s plea on last week’s Great British Bake Off. “Who don’t exist.” This show’s semi-final also went a little retro, in terms of outcome. You’ll possibly remember the Star Trek of the 70s, and how it often (always?) opened with four eager chaps beaming down on to some benighted planet. Kirk, Spock, McCoy… and one anonymous crewman in a red onesie. Guess who was always the first to serve as monster munch. Something similar was always destined to befall Stacey Hart, who had erred only in not opting for Sophie’s nine-layer coffee opera cake inside a corseted tutu. Bake Off just gets better and batter, but they must do something about the air-con inside that stupid tent: if this is truly about baking, rather than ratings, which it obviously isn’t, surely a constant indoor temperature for three hours might be a given. I was appalled to watch Steven’s chocolate hot air balloon basket literally melt into his meringue. Appalled, and also laughing uproariously. Never been a fan of Bear Grylls, with his Boy Scout stuff and appalling eagerness to drink his own wazz. Ray Mears looks as if he might still pant a little going uphill. But, annoyingly, it was Bear, not Ray, who gave us the survival highlight of the week. In Bear’s Mission he took heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua up and down the Commando cliffs in Cornwall, and “AJ” did awesomely well, seriously well, despite Mr Grylls’s commentary. “The guns are really working now.” Guns, in Bear-talk, or moron-talk, means biceps. Uurgh. I actually felt a little for the 43-year-old Bear, having struggled, albeit rather skilfully, with a 200ft rope crossing, until he landed, and shouted: “Oof! I’ve still got it! Still got it!” Penicillin didn’t work then? Twenty-eight-year-old nice guy AJ, on the other hand, hauled himself to climbing victory, abseiling victory, and rope-cross victory with grim determination and cloying vertigo. A lovely man of few words, but he chooses them wisely. This column goes to press awkwardly early, so I can’t tell you the result of his showdown against Carlos Takam in Cardiff last night.

It’s been a long time coming. My own melasma – which appeared in my 20s and stepped up several gears when I became pregnant, spreading across my forehead and down the sides of my face – has never responded to treatments, either cosmetic or medical (NHS dermatologists told me nothing could be done), so I’ve focused instead on the art of cover-up. In fact, when I began using DCL’s C Scape High Potency Night Booster 30 (£108) six months ago, I was interested primarily in vitamin C’s antioxidant, firming and brightening effects. C Scape is a very high 30% concentration vitamin C paste with a gritty, sticky, not entirely pleasant texture, massaged into the face after cleansing at night. The results have been extraordinary. My forehead, previously 70% covered in a jagged brown patch, is now almost entirely melasma-free. The patches down my cheeks remain, but I’m persevering by using C Scape in month-on, month-off spells to avoid plateau (there’s been no regression during the downtime). Each spell of usage brings noticeable improvement. This isn’t a perfect product – its potency means I become itchy and mildly irritated around my chin and mouth after a week (so I now skip the area altogether), and I’m not the sensitive type. The other obvious issue is the cost, which is prohibitively high for many. The Ordinary offers a 23% Vitamin C Suspension for just £4.90, which must surely be worth a try first (though it didn’t work as well for me) and a 30% Suspension (£5.80), but the latter’s silicone base isn’t conducive to keeping the active ingredient directly on the skin’s surface (always apply any vitamin C product first, with nothing between it and you). By day, I use Dr Dennis Gross C + Collagen Serum (£72) or Drunk Elephant C-Firma serum (not available here, but shipped, tax-inclusive, to the UK via Sephora; $80), both of which brighten dullness instantly and have a makeup-friendly consistency. I don’t make such costly recommendations lightly, but in my direct experience, these work.

Analysis by the doctors’ union, shared exclusively with the Guardian, projects that the number of people attending emergency wards and waiting more than four hours to be treated could reach 3.7 million in three years’ time, up from 2.6 million in the year ending September 2017. The forecast assumes numbers increase at the same rate as the average over the past five years and a “do-nothing scenario”, in which funding remains at its current level and the proposed measures to address pressures have little or no effect. If accurate, it would mean 84.8% of patients being seen within four hours between October 2019 and September 2020, down from 89% in 2016-17 and significantly short of the 95% target, which was effectively scrapped by Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, in January. The BMA chair of council, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said: “These alarming figures show the scale of the challenge facing the NHS. As demand increases and waiting times rise, many more patients are left waiting longer for care. It is clear from this analysis that we need urgent action to close the gap between investment and rising demand on the NHS.” The union also predicts that “trolley waits”, where patients are left waiting more than four hours for a hospital bed after a decision to admit, will more than triple by 2019-20, from 566,000 last year to 1.78 million. It says there could be an average of 5.2 million patients on the elective treatment waiting list by then – up from 3.9 million – for operations such as cataract removal, hernia repair or hip or knee replacement. Significant increases are forecast over the next 12 months, with the number of people waiting more than four hours at A&amp;E predicted to hit 2.95 million in by September 2018, and the number of trolley waits expected to rise 44% to 816,000. Leading doctors have said that already overstretched emergency departments in England could struggle to cope in the event of a major flu outbreak, such as that seen in recent weeks in Australia and New Zealand. They have cited high bed occupancy rates caused by lack of funding, especially in social care, and staff shortages as contributing pressures. There could be as many as 300,000 people a month waiting more than four hours at A&amp;Es by December, according to the BMA analysis. This could exceed 400,000 by 2020, meaning more than a fifth of patients attending emergency wards waiting more than four hours. The highest monthly figure in 2016-17 was 281,612, in January. The problems are being partly driven by an expected surge in attendances, predicted to hit 23.8 million over the next 12 months, up 345,000 on 2016-17, and 24.5 million – more than two million a month – in 2019-20. Nagpaul said: “With the budget less than a month away, the government needs to address the fact we spend about £10bn less per year on health that other leading European economies. Plugging this gap could fund, for example, another 35,000 hospital beds or 10,000 doctors, which could transform patient care.” A Department of Health spokeswoman described the research as “rudimentary” and said that it oversimplified the trajectory of waiting lists. “Doing nothing was never an option for the NHS – we have given an extra £8bn investment by 2022, including £2bn for social care and £100m for A&amp;E and last year, the NHS treated 2.2 million more people in A&amp;E within four hours than it did a decade ago,” she said. “The BMA is wrong to say we spend less per year on health than other leading countries; in fact spending on the NHS is in line with other European countries and our health service has, once again, been independently judged to be the best and most efficient health system in the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/26/rhian-brewster-england-liverpool-under-17-world-cup-final","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T16:10:57Z","webTitle":"Rhian Brewster: England U17’s natural finisher on the fast-track at Liverpool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/26/rhian-brewster-england-liverpool-under-17-world-cup-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/26/rhian-brewster-england-liverpool-under-17-world-cup-final","fields":{"headline":"Rhian Brewster: England U17’s natural finisher on the fast-track at Liverpool","bodyText":"They were the goals of a natural finisher and no surprise to anyone at Liverpool’s academy. The background to Rhian Brewster’s World Cup semi-final hat‑trick for England Under-17s against Brazil, however, brought extra satisfaction and encouragement to those charged with realising the striker’s potential for Jürgen Klopp. Liverpool tailor individual training programmes for their “talent group” – the academy prospects who are judged to have taken the next step and who travel weekly from Kirkby to Melwood for training sessions with the first-team development coach, Pep Lijnders. Brewster, the London-born forward whose two consecutive hat-tricks have swept England into Saturday’s under-17s World Cup final against Spain in Kolkata, has been on the fast-track since Klopp arrived at Anfield. The 17-year-old striker’s training programme has included working with Steve McManaman. The former Liverpool and Real Madrid player is not a full-time coach at the academy but delivers specific sessions for the club’s young wingers and forwards. With Brewster’s encouragement the pair have worked on anticipating a variety of crosses and losing his marker early to find the space to finish. His first and third goals against Brazil in particular, therefore, when Brewster peeled away from defenders to convert crosses from Callum Hudson-Odoi and Emile Smith Rowe respectively, were reward for the teenager’s dedication on the training ground as well as his instinctive eye for goal. A combination of the two explains why Klopp, Lijnders, Steven Gerrard, the academy director, Alex Inglethorpe, and many others at Liverpool are convinced they have another genuine article coming through. Not that any public proclamations will be forthcoming from Anfield, where there is patience to accompany promise such as Ben Woodburn, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Brewster. Steve Cooper, the England Under-17s manager and former Liverpool academy coach, said: “It is an amazing achievement to score a hat-trick in a quarter-final and a semi-final. “I am not normally one to talk about individuals but to do that needs a special mention. There is no doubt about that. He deserves it and the team deserves it. If you see the way Rhian speaks to the rest of the players in the dressing room about the service he is getting then it says a lot about him. And it is not just his goals but the effort he is putting in for the team. We want to win the ball back as quick as we can and we want to press and that starts with your No9. “Rhian is a goalscorer but he is more than that. He is a fantastic character. The feeling is pride and satisfaction in the way we did it.” Brewster attended Chadwell primary school and Chadwell Heath Academy in Romford. He played for the Shield football academy before joining Chelsea as a seven-year-old under the guidance of Michael Beale, who is in his second stint at Liverpool’s academy following a brief spell as the assistant manager of São Paulo in Brazil. Beale, now Liverpool’s head of coaching for the foundation phase (the youngest new arrivals), remains a close friend of the Brewster family although it is John Barnes who unwittingly played an instrumental role in the striker’s move to Anfield. Rhian’s father, Ian, is an obsessive Liverpool fan and Barnes was his hero, ensuring there was no doubt in his mind where his son should go when he decided to leave Chelsea at the age of 14. Twenty years after leaving, Barnes is still providing assists for Liverpool. “I didn’t see a pathway to become a first-team player at Chelsea,” Brewster has said, mirroring Dominic Solanke’s decision to swap Stamford Bridge for Anfield this summer. Ian Brewster said: “When he was at Chelsea, I didn’t see anybody get through right to the top level. I asked Rhian: ‘If you got £10,000 at Chelsea or £5,000 at, let’s say, Watford but played in front of big crowds, which would you choose?’ He said ‘Watford’ straight away. That told me he wanted to play football at the highest level, no matter where. He’s loving Liverpool and everyone loves him there. People say he’s always smiling when he’s playing. That’s because I used to say to him to go and enjoy himself. Win, lose or draw, he’s done me proud, his family and friends proud and the country proud.” Brewster was 16 when he caught Klopp’s attention during an academy training session. He was immediately invited to train with the first team and scored a hat-trick in a behind‑closed‑doors friendly against Accrington Stanley last November in front of the Liverpool manager. “I got a ‘well done’ from the boss, which was amazing,” he said. “My confidence was sky-high.” An appearance as an unused substitute followed against Crystal Palace in the Premier League in April – he might have got on but for a 2-1 Liverpool defeat – and he featured in an end-of-season friendly in Australia before a foot injury delayed further senior appearances in the summer. Delayed being the operative word. Brewster has confidently handled the step up from Liverpool’s Under-18s to the Under-23s this season while also impressing for Gerrard’s team in the Uefa Youth League. “He’ll finish the season with big numbers,” the former Liverpool captain has predicted. A rare disappointment for Brewster came in the Under-17 European Championship final in May when he missed a penalty in the shootout defeat by Spain. The World Cup final offers England an opportunity to avenge that loss. For the Liverpool striker, for Manchester City’s Phil Foden and hopefully several more, there may be much more to follow. • This article was amended on 27 October 2017 to correct the name of Chadwell primary school from Chadwell Heath primary school, as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/27/my-artner-will-noyt-stop-watching-conspiracy-theory-videos","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T11:18:44Z","webTitle":"My partner won’t stop watching conspiracy theory videos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/27/my-artner-will-noyt-stop-watching-conspiracy-theory-videos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/27/my-artner-will-noyt-stop-watching-conspiracy-theory-videos","fields":{"headline":"My partner won’t stop watching conspiracy theory videos","bodyText":"My boyfriend of eight years is a stay-at-home artist who is disabled.

Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri won the top prize at the Toronto international film festival for its depiction of a mother, played by Frances McDormand, fighting to bring her teenage daughter’s rapist and killer to justice in a rural backwater. Directed and written by Martin McDonagh, of In Bruges fame, the film is as bleakly funny as it is harrowing. Sam Rockwell plays the dumb, bigoted cop who initially appears so infuriating that you almost wonder if he is the guilty party, only for his character to travel in quite a different direction by the film’s end. Such is the subtle power of his shape-shifting transformation that there are now whispers this might be the film that finally sees the undersung Rockwell get noticed by the Academy, and be nominated for an Oscar. Is he excited about that? “It’s very thrilling,” says the 48-year-old American actor, who has almost three decades of work to his name. We are sitting in a London hotel room, where he has gallantly ensured I have the most comfortable seat. “I’m hearing a lot of stuff – we’ll see what happens. We really worked our hump off on this film, so it’s very exciting – but really it’s an excuse to to celebrate that with free booze.” His red shirt is brightly patterned; his hair has grown back to its usual scruffier length, compared with the “almost military” cut he wore as Officer Dixon. With his fun-dad-on-holiday aesthetic, he couldn’t look less like the “rednecks, racists, ex-Confederates. Cowboys. A KKK guy!” he has spent years playing. “I’m playing so many hicks and it’s not where I come from. I’m really a concrete creature,” he says, “but they keep throwing me on a horse.” Rockwell grew up in inner-city San Francisco, brought up by his father after his mum left home. He went to a performing arts high school where he met his best friend, Leroy, after the pair realised that they were both giggling in a lesson “because we were both high”. Leroy, an African-American, took the young Sam to parties where he had to learn how to dance to impress girls, a scene he vastly preferred to hanging out with the white kids at his school, “the Nazi youth,” as he calls them. This explains how he became “a damn good hoofer” – chuck his name into YouTube and you’ll find endless fan medleys of all the film scenes in which he dances. Indeed, a friend who lives in Brooklyn tells me she once spotted him at a public Soul Train dance-off competition. “She did?” he says, before recalling it. “Oh, yes, I was with Marisa Tomei! We were drunk, it was a blast. I think they gave us celebrity nepotism so we came second. It was a funky after-hours place – you know, south London 20 years ago kind of thing.” He says he likes going out drinking, but can’t find many dancing spots like that nowadays. “It’s all techno in the clubs now – I can’t stand that shit. Ugh, it’s awful,” he says, looking quite disappointed with the modern world. He shares an East Village, Manhattan, loft with his long-term girlfriend, the actor Leslie Bibb, and rides a lightweight 10-speed bike that he has to lug up several flights of stairs. Unless he takes the subway, where people do sometimes spot him, “but I do pretty good, I shift between the cracks a little bit. It’s funny when people recognise you though, because they look very pensive and sometimes a little angry” – he furrows his brow comically – “like they know you, but they don’t know where from, so they’re trying to figure it out.” This is surely because Rockwell is that guy who has been in everything, yet somehow isn’t a household name. His big breakthrough was arguably Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, the Harvey Weinstein-produced, George Clooney-directed film in which he played the TV gameshow host who became an unlikely CIA assassin. Then came Matchstick Men, Choke and Seven Psychopaths. He played the racist convict in The Green Mile, the flamboyant Zaphod Beeblebrox in the film of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and the solo, struggling astronaut in Moon. We don’t see his love life in magazines, even though he was rumoured to have dated Drew Barrymore, his co-star in Charlie’s Angels. He and Barrymore share a dramatic scene filmed in The Chemosphere, a futuristic hillside, spaceship-style house in Los Angeles, and I ask if it brings back memories every time he drives past it. “Well, I have a lot of memories all over LA, a lot from being a broke struggling actor, too, sleeping on couches. Auditioning for ER, Noah Wyle’s part, I think, and turning up in a white lab coat that I’d found somewhere, to make me look more like a doctor, and holding a hypodermic syringe.” Sorry, I ask, you turned up to the audition in full costume, clutching a syringe? “Only the plastic part, it didn’t have a needle,” he stresses. “They did think I was crazy though,” he adds, looking mortified. I ask if he is limited by being a character actor; a category that can impose a cap on success. Agreeing to an extent, he points out that he has also been a leading man several times, “although I’m never gonna play a traditional romantic lead”. He says character actors do get noticed – just very slowly. “Gary Oldman finally got nominated for Tinker Tailer. Jesus Christ, that guy’s been doing it since State of Grace, Sid and Nancy – he was the guy we all looked to, you know? The fact it took that long for Gary Oldman to get nominated for an Oscar!” I ask how it feels to be promoting a film about exposing rapists, at a time when the film industry is exposing the ones in its own midst? “Yeah, the film has a lot of timely themes, doesn’t it? It feels to me like there’s a lot going on in this film, even though it was written before any of that stuff. Trump, Weinstein, before the Ferguson thing as far as [police] racism goes, too – [Martin] wrote it eight years ago. But I think, because of what’s been going on in America lately, it’s just shedding a new light on that, in a way. This feels like The Year of the Woman to me – Wonder Woman’s a hit movie about a woman with sexuality, but she’s strong and she kicks ass. Directed by a woman. And then I think Greta Gerwig just directed a movie that’s supposed to be great, and there are a few others.” But it must feel like Hollywood is in crisis as well? “How do you mean?” Well, the Weinstein Company. “Well, they’re in crisis, for sure,” he says. “I don’t know about Hollywood.” Obviously, Rockwell himself is an innocent bystander, accused of nothing. But when I try to get him to acknowledge that men in the Hollywood system have perhaps benefited from a culture that keeps women down, he isn’t overly convinced. “The allegations are awful, and it’s brave of these women to come forward and talk about it,” he says, sounding a bit formulaic. “It’s a horrible thing. I only had one encounter with him [Weinstein] years ago and I didn’t see any of that.” But how does it feel to have had your big break from someone who destroyed so many other people’s careers? “Well, Confessions [of a Dangerous Mind] didn’t do very well. Harvey dropped it like a bag of wet hammers after it didn’t get a Golden Globe nomination. It was George Clooney who fought for me to be on it,” he says, somewhat defensively. “It feels good that I got to play the part.” He is shooting Adam McKay’s biopic of Dick Cheney, in which he plays George W Bush. “I’m watching Dubya now,” he says, “I’m watching and listening to him constantly and I find him very likable, I have to tell you.” Have you looked at his art? That’s my only guilty Dubya pleasure. “Of course! It’s not bad! He’s very charming. I mean, in spite of Iraq and everything, Guantánamo …” They’re quite big things, I say – I imagine they horrified you at the time. “It’s pretty horrifying. The impression I get is that he really thought there were WMDs, and he felt bamboozled when there weren’t, but he’d already gone in there. There’s a real sense of regret in some of the interviews I’ve seen – that he really had thought he was doing the right thing. You do have to develop empathy to play someone, because otherwise you judge your character.” As for being told he had the face to play him, he laughs. “It’s funny. You’re the canvas, you have to take it. I never thought of it myself, but when the phone call came, I was like, yeah, that does makes sense actually. Especially opposite Christian [Bale] as Cheney. And Steve Carell being Rumsfeld – that’s great!” It must be interesting to work in a gang when one of his most lauded roles was as Sam Bell in Moon, an astronaut who is entirely alone apart from a robot. The film was directed by Duncan Jones, and Rockwell’s performance was described by the New York Times as “intriguingly strange”. “Yes – that was a very isolating experience,” he remembers. “We shot it during the writers’ strike so Shepperton [Studios] was a ghost town and consequently we got this amazing crew who were not working – people who worked on the original Alien, a set designer who had worked with Ridley Scott. We got lucky with that movie, it just came together. I think of it as an extended episode of the Twilight Zone. Or that British show, you know, where the prime minister has to fuck the pig?” Oh, that wasn’t a show, that actually happened. “What do you mean, that actually happened?!” I tell him that David Cameron was forced to deny putting “a private part of his anatomy” into a dead pig’s mouth while studying at Oxford, before realising that Rockwell is in fact referring to a curiously prescient episode of Black Mirror. “Get out of here! That didn’t happen! Come on!” Moving on – does Rockwell ever worry that he is going to run out of the meat inside him to act with? “Never!” He barks. “I guess that’s why Daniel Day-Lewis goes and makes shoes or something,” he says, slightly amused. “I could never do that. Or why Sean Penn goes to Haiti. I guess you have to refill a little bit – but I’m kind of a workhorse. It takes a toll. It took a toll on my friend Phil [Philip Seymour] Hoffman. He never wanted to phone it in, on stage especially. He was a dear friend and I think he demanded an awful lot from himself.” Was Hoffman’s death a wake-up call to step back? “Well, it was a lesson – you have to have a giggle at the end of the day. This film is important to me, it’s important to Frances [McDormand], because it needs to be life and death when you’re doing it, otherwise nobody’s going to give a shit unless it’s important to you. But you can’t take yourself too seriously. You’re not curing cancer.” • Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri will be released on 10 November in the US, 1 January 2018 in Australia, and 12 January 2018 in the UK"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/nov/02/mischkas-war-by-sheila-fitzpatrick-review-nazi-germany","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-02T13:59:56Z","webTitle":"Mischka’s War by Sheila Fitzpatrick review – my husband in Nazi Germany","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/02/mischkas-war-by-sheila-fitzpatrick-review-nazi-germany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/nov/02/mischkas-war-by-sheila-fitzpatrick-review-nazi-germany","fields":{"headline":"Mischka’s War by Sheila Fitzpatrick review – my husband in Nazi Germany","bodyText":"‘Show yourself as you are, make the readers like you,” Fitzpatrick pleads with Mischka, the subject of her new biographical-historical investigation. It’s an unusual situation for any writer to be in. Mischka is her dead husband, yet she’s telling his story as a historian, reconstructing his early life from largely written sources. Theirs was a late marriage. She was successful, known for her revisionist work on the Soviet Union; he was a successful physicist. They met on a plane in 1989, when she was 48 and he 67. “Five years if you must, but please, if you possibly can, 10 years,” she pleaded at the time. He died 10 years later. Now Fitzpatrick has decided to make the most of “the power to bring the dead back to life by writing about them”. As a historian, she isn’t interested in his recent past. She wants to explore his life before they met, finding out about his childhood in Latvia and young adulthood in wartime Germany. Superficially, it’s a classic émigré tale. He had a relatively prosperous childhood and adolescence in Riga, where his mother Olga left his financially chaotic father and successfully assumed responsibility for the family finances by starting a fashion atelier. He ended up as a displaced person in postwar Germany, and then emigrated to America. It’s a story, however, with more than the usual share of good luck. When the Russians occupied Latvia in 1940, the lives of many of Mischka’s contemporaries deteriorated rapidly, but he had experience in radio so he started a job at the State Electrotechnical Factory. He gained permission to enter the University of Riga as an engineering student in 1941 and then, just as conscription was introduced by Latvia’s new German occupiers in 1944, he pulled off the unlikely feat of being transferred to Germany as an exchange student. This strange move to Nazi Germany is at the heart of Fitzpatrick’s book. Implicit is the question of how a man she loved and respected could have made a voluntary decision to move to Hitler’s Germany four years into the war, apparently unperturbed by the racial situation there. It becomes even more odd when we learn that she discovered after his death that his Hungarian father was a Jew by bloodline, though he’d claimed throughout his adult life to be Catholic. And it takes on an eerie quality when we read that in winter 1944, Mischka took a tourist trip around his adopted homeland, which he described to his mother as “positive in the highest degree”. He visited Innsbruck, Garmisch and Munich, falling in love with the mountains. Despite her pleas to her husband to be likable for his readers, Fitzpatrick doesn’t soften the peculiarity of all this. But she records her own realisation that “individuals are not statistical averages. Once you have real individual people in your sights, you constantly notice anomalies.” As a historian devoted to nuancing the totalitarian view of the Soviet Union, she had assumed that living under the Nazis would be worse than living under the Soviets, because they had the “nastier ideology”. In fact, when Mischka was faced with the likely reoccupation of Latvia by the Russians, Germany called, because it offered a better chance to train as a physicist. Once there, he was too preoccupied to pay much attention to what was happening, though his mother did her best to employ Jews in the state-sponsored tailoring business she had meanwhile set up in Riga, making suspenders and straw sandals for the German army. Mischka’s self-centred oblivion seems to have been in large part the product of his youth. On 16 June 1944, as the Germans bombarded the British with V1s and the Allies advanced into Italy, he informed his mother that he’d come to see that logic was just one of the “humanly generated systems for the consistent ordering of observed phenomena”. He paused in his musings to complain that his status as a foreigner had prevented him from participating in Dresden’s regional sports meet and that when they did finally let him join in, they’d produced an inadequate pole for his pole-vaulting. Olga, though equally bent on survival, was less forgetful. “Once I had a family. Five people, for whom I was the fulcrum,” she wrote in her diary, worrying about her other two sons. It wasn’t until February 1945 that Mischka was forced to pay attention to the war. On the night of 13 February, he hosted a goodbye party as he was heading to Flensburg, determined to escape Soviet control of East Germany when the war ended. He’d made Russian fruit jelly for his guests. Suddenly the door keeled into the room and they heard a distant noise of explosions. He set out to walk a girl from the party home and confronted a city on fire. “The sight is mesmerising,” he wrote afterwards; “I stand there hypnotised, a 20th-century Nero.” The account of the Dresden bombing would alone be enough to make this fascinating book worth reading. There are few narratives published in English that record the experience on the streets that night in this much detail. Mischka was one of many witnesses of bombing raids who appreciated the spectacle at the same time as confronting the horror. He noted the “luminescent parachutes” in his diary: “They hung like grapes in the air and came down very slowly.” But, as he came upon rows of collapsed houses, he became conscious of the reality of suffering. “Then there is visible the hair, the back of a human head, then again a leg sticks out.” In the midst of this, a young giraffe approached and walked through the rubble, “without haste, her head held high”. He made it to Flensburg. He even had time to fall in love before he left, observing a month after the raid that “life is still beautiful”. He survived life in postwar Germany with relative ease, registering as a displaced person in both the British and American zones and receiving British army rations in exchange for helping them revive the radio network. After the war, Olga wanted to go to Argentina but he was determined to go to the US. Once again, he wished to get as far away from the Russians as he could. It’s one of the pleasurable quirks of fate recorded here that it was in America that he met the Australian historian of the Soviet Union who made it her business to document his peculiar, sometimes maddeningly triumphant life. • Lara Feigel’s The Bitter Taste of Victory: Life, Love and Art in the Ruins of the Reich is published by Bloomsbury. • Mischka’s War is published by IB Tauris.

Girardi announced Thursday that he won’t be returning to the Bronx club after a 10-year stint at the helm, which included a World Series championship in 2009. “With a heavy heart, I come to you because the Yankees have decided not to bring me back,” Girardi said in a statement Thursday morning. Yankees general manager Brian Cashman confirmed the move in a statement, saying: “Everything this organization does is done with careful and thorough consideration, and we’ve decided to pursue alternatives for the managerial position.” New York do not have an obvious candidate to replace him. The Yankees are the third of the 10 postseason teams to remove managers, joining Boston and Washington. Girardi, who was chosen over Don Mattingly to succeed the beloved Joe Torre in 2008, overcame a tepid first season to win the club’s 27th world championship in 2009. They’ve fallen short every year since. This year, the 53-year-old took a young Yankees team to within one game of the World Series before falling in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series on Saturday. It was an exhilirating end to a postseason that saw Girardi’s managing came under withering criticism, no worse than during and after Game 2 of the division series against the Indians when he failed to call for a review of a hit-by-pitch call that enabled a Cleveland comeback. “I screwed up. And it’s hard. It’s a hard day for me,” he said then. “But I got to move forward and we’ll be ready to go tomorrow.” New York won the next three games to advance, lost the first two games of the ALCS at Houston, then won three in a row to move within a victory of reaching the World Series for the first time in eight years. But the Astros swept the final two games. Cashman said he and owner Hal Steinbrenner had spoken directly with Girardi this week. Girardi’s 910-710 regular season record with the Yankees is sixth in victories managing the team behind Joe McCarthy (1,460), Torre (1,173), Casey Stengel (1,149), Miller Huggins (1,067) and Ralph Houk (944). “He has a tireless work ethic, and put his heart into every game he managed over the last decade,” Cashman said. “He should take great pride in our accomplishments during his tenure.” Of active managers, only the Los Angeles Angels’ Mike Scioscia and the San Francisco Giants’ Bruce Bochy had been with their teams longer. Previously, Girardi played 15 seasons as a catcher in the majors with the Cubs, Rockies, Yankees and Cardinals, winning World Series titles with New York in 1996, 1998 and 1999. He said last weekend he had to speak with his family before deciding whether he wanted to return. New York made the decision for him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/oct/27/secret-portrait-of-mary-queen-of-scots-lost-for-centuries-goes-on-display","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T05:00:21Z","webTitle":"Secret portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots lost for centuries goes on display","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/27/secret-portrait-of-mary-queen-of-scots-lost-for-centuries-goes-on-display","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/27/secret-portrait-of-mary-queen-of-scots-lost-for-centuries-goes-on-display","fields":{"headline":"Secret portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots lost for centuries goes on display","bodyText":"A ghostly image of Mary, Queen of Scots has been found under a portrait of a Tudor aristocrat that has been hanging on the wall of a historic house in outer London. Her portrait may have been considered dangerous, left unfinished and then overpainted by the nervous artist, in the political turmoil after she was executed in 1587. Her blurry image, recovered through an x-ray, will be on display at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery together with the portrait of Sir John Maitland, a courtier who became lord chancellor of Scotland, which has hidden it for almost 450 years. The resurrection of the image of Mary was described as “a fascinating discovery” by Christopher Baker, the director of the gallery. The lost painting was recovered through a major research project between the National Galleries of Scotland and the Courtauld Institute of Art, which brought together a group of portraits by Adrian Vanson and Adam de Colone, two artists who came from the Netherlands to work in Scotland in the late 16th century. The concealed portrait was revealed when Caroline Rae, from the Courtauld, x-rayed the painting and saw outlined in the lead-white paint that blocked the rays the shadowy figure of a woman, which, from the outline of her face and dress and the pose of the figure, closely resembled other near-contemporary portraits of Mary. Despite the fascination with Mary in her lifetime and since, there are few authentic contemporary images, probably because long before her execution she was a controversial figure, embroiled in the religious upheavals of the day, and implicated in her husband’s murder. She was forced to abdicate in 1567, then imprisoned in England by her cousin Elizabeth I, and executed when she was implicated in plots for a rebellion. The portrait of Maitland is dated 1589, just two years after her execution. It normally hangs in Ham House, a National Trust mansion on the Thames near Richmond in south-west London. David Taylor, a curator at the National Trust, said: “Vanson’s portrait of Sir John Maitland is an important picture in the National Trust collection, and the remarkable discovery of the unfinished portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots adds an exciting dimension to it. It shows that portraits of the queen were being copied and presumably displayed in Scotland around the time of her execution, a highly contentious and potentially dangerous thing to be seen doing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2017/oct/28/sao-tome-principe-islands-africa-new-eco-hotel-wildlife","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-28T06:00:51Z","webTitle":"São Tomé & Príncipe: a travel adventure that's great, green and diverse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/oct/28/sao-tome-principe-islands-africa-new-eco-hotel-wildlife","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/oct/28/sao-tome-principe-islands-africa-new-eco-hotel-wildlife","fields":{"headline":"São Tomé & Príncipe: a travel adventure that's great, green and diverse","bodyText":"Nelito, the boatman, took one look at the rocks and the swell smashing over them and shook his head. A clutch of tropical birds looped overhead, their long white tail streamers dancing in the wind. Ahead of us a cliff with a skirt of steep jungle ended in a maelstrom of rock and surf. Landing looked a horrible prospect. We motored around the coast a little and came to a quieter place. Nelito made a face: “You can try.” I dived overboard, my camera in a drybag on my back. Marina, my expedition companion, came with me. We had no idea what to expect, having deliberately chosen to visit the most remote and unvisited part of the island. Príncipe still retains the atmosphere of an undiscovered place, which it was until Portuguese mariners arrived in about 1470. And, although we had come from a small beach resort in the north of the island, this southern shore remains uninhabited until today. Getting ashore was tough: big swells surged and I was swept through a gap between boulders. When I finally escaped the sea, I was amazed to be in one piece. Marina, scrambling ashore, looked equally relieved. Ahead of us was a steep, crumbling slope of slippery rotten vegetation and loose boulders. It was only when we were about 30 metres up that I began to notice the birds. They were watching us. There were several little finches perched on branches not two metres away, and a golden-winged weaver noisily clattering about on a palm leaf. I could have fed them all by hand. Then a bat came and did a few sweeps around our heads. Marina touched my arm and pointed. “Look! None of them is afraid.” There was a kingfisher silently examining us from a branch a few feet away. And another. And it was true: none of these creatures showed the slightest fear. I suddenly had the most extraordinary surge of excitement and adrenaline. It was like the world was new and we had come stumbling from a time machine and discovered it. Before I visited São Tomé and Príncipe, a two-island African nation 140 miles off the coast of Gabon, I told everyone where I was going. Just 13,000 tourists a year visit and only one person knew where it was, a naturalist, who expressed extreme envy. “They have more endemic species per square mile than anywhere on Earth. It’s the African Galápagos,” he said. I did my homework. These two volcanic islands had never been part of the mainland, nor had they been inhabited until the Portuguese arrived. Subsequently São Tomé, which is about 30 miles by 20, proved a little easier to colonise with plantations and slaves. Coffee would grow, and cacao thrived (the islands were once the world’s largest producers of cacao). Almost a century ago, Principe was where British astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington first demonstrated Einstein’s theory of general relativity, during a 1919 solar eclipse. Even now, you have to fly in to São Tomé and then on to its smaller partner. The entire island of Príncipe, with its steep mountains covered in thick jungle, is a Unesco biosphere. Just nine plantations were started on the island and, as there were no villages or towns outside the tiny port of Santo António, they became the centres of population. Everything revolved around the plantations. Each had a big house for the manager, opposite some simple quarters for workers. Between them would be a few drying sheds and storage rooms. Eventually the slave workforce became bonded labour, often recruited from Cape Verde. Otherwise life did not change much for 500 years, not until 1974, when, quite abruptly as far as Príncipe was concerned, the Portuguese empire collapsed. After that the plantations slowly declined into quiet villages, occupied mostly by people surviving by subsistence agriculture. It was the conversion of one of those large plantation houses into a new hotel that had brought me to the island. Roça Sundy is the brainchild of South African entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth, famous for being the first African to travel to space. It’s his second venture after Bom Bom, a lovely small beach resort on the northern tip of the island, where I was staying. A third luxury property, Praia Sundy, opens in December. Shuttleworth has seen the potential of Príncipe, and also its desperate need for development, but development of a kind that doesn’t threaten its unique selling point: the pristine environment. Working with the government, he has invested millions in infrastructure and hopes to attract visitors who are interested more in people and wildlife than in lazing on beaches. The emphasis is on contributing to the community; local staff are trained on site and guests are encouraged to visit local families or help on conservation projects. Though the rooms at Roça Sundy were not quite ready when I visited just before the June opening, they were clearly going to be spacious, many with lovely balconies. The entire village seemed to be engaged in painting and decorating, with a huge amount of enthusiasm and expectation – 21-year-old Alexander could not believe his luck at finding work. “They have taught me English and how to make cocktails,” he told me, before insisting I try his own invention, called jaja. “It’s a blend of whisky, jackfruit and lemon.” It was delicious. From a nearby room came the hum of an English class under way – I could almost feel the determination to succeed. At least I was able to sample the cooking: familiar dishes like smoked fish and chicken curry, but always with bizarre local twists – strange leaves in the salad, sudden, compelling bursts of unknown flavours. There’s no doubt that many of Príncipe’s 5,000 inhabitants are poor by most standards, but as I discovered, they don’t really see it that way. “How can you be poor here?” said Yodi, a local guide who was taking me on a hike to a waterfall with the unusual name of Vagina Falls. (I was getting used to everything being a little bizarre on Príncipe.) “There are so many mangoes, breadfruit and bananas – you don’t need to work to grow them; you just pick them.” He reached out and grabbed an odd triangular scarlet fruit, and presented it to me. “Try this. We call it mangongo.” The taste was one of the strangest I’ve ever encountered: sweet at first, followed by a liquorice-type tingling that deepened into something savoury. Our trek had turned into a gourmet jungle-food tasting session in which nothing was familiar. The waterfall proved rather strange too: at the base was a pool of cool, clear water; at the top a plume of spray through which flocks of birds were diving, taking sips of water. “Spinetails,” said Yodi. In fact, they were São Tomé spinetails, one of around 25 birds found only here. You could add to that dozens of fish, amphibians, snakes and bats. New species turn up regularly – the Príncipe shrew in 2015, the São Tomé cobra in 2017 – while several unique fish spotted by a National Geographic expedition in 2006 are still waiting to be caught and categorised. The tag African Galápagos does not seem inappropriate, although a little unfair on São Tomé and Príncipe, as they are about an eighth of the area, far less studied and currently have almost the same number of known endemics. Returning to the nearest plantation, we went to visit Zinha, a lady whose house doubles as a restaurant, Vida Custa é Feliz, which translates roughly as “life is hard and happy”. With Zinha I began to realise how the extraordinary local flora had shaped the island diet. “This is azagão,” she said, serving a dish that looked like meat and beans in a rich sauce. “It uses over 100 different plants.” Other tastes came fast and furious; some familiar, like fried fish, rice and manioc, others downright weird – ìzaguente, for example, made from fermented rotten fruit, a dish that Yodi wolfed down with gusto. To drink there was micôco, which Zinha assured me with a straight face was “very good for the penis”. Beyond the food and wildlife, the great pleasure of Príncipe was to walk the quiet lanes, chatting to anyone I met. On Paciência plantation I bumped into Leandro, who had come from Cape Verde as a bonded labourer in 1958 and was now scraping a living making baskets. The plantation community here was making big efforts to create jobs, running a large market garden and starting to produce a range of essential oils, spices and preserves, as well as the traditional cacao. For them, the new hotel was a welcome possible source of customers. In other places, however, sheer isolation makes development a real challenge. Next day I took the boat from Bom Bom island and motored anti-clockwise. There were some fabulous beaches, all deserted, then several great towers of rock loomed up. Beneath a spectacular pair of them was a village. “That is Lapa,” said the boatman. “They have nothing.” I could see a few pigs running along the beach and a handful of simple wooden cabins with dugout canoes drawn up. “Can we land?” I asked. The boatman pulled a face. “It’s too shallow for our boat,” he said. “That’s why they never get visitors.” I had a sudden desire to go there, even if, once again, the only way was to swim. Once again I donned my backpack and set off, arriving to a rather surprised village community who were just distributing the fish catch from a dugout canoe. “There are 30 people here,” said one man, Paulo. “It’s a good place. We call the big mountain João Dias Pai [father], and the little one is João Dias Filho [son].” They all looked healthy and strong, but threadbare poor. Did they need anything? Paulo shrugged. “The fishing is good. We have our pigs.” There was a pause. “A road would help. It’s a three-hour walk to the market.” On the way back to Bom Bom I jumped ship at a remote beach and met up with Yodi, who wanted to show me a ruined Portuguese town, Ribeira Izé, the first settlement on the island. There, just behind the jungle’s facade, were the centuries-old ruins of a port, its walls slowly being strangled and destroyed by fig trees. Some local lads shinned up a pair of coconut trees and chucked down the fruits for us to drink. “Do they want some money?” I asked Yodi, who looked astonished.“What for?!” Like many young people their hope was to leave and get a job on Saõ Tomé. Would they consider a job here, on their home island? They laughed. It wasn’t only about jobs; they wanted to see the big city. At dawn on my last morning, I walked along the beach then sat down on a log. A Príncipe kingfisher, unique to the island, sat a few metres away, studying the beach for tiny crabs. Behind me the wings of a Príncipe sunbird thrummed as it zipped arounda hibiscus bush. Somewhere far away I could hear a woman singing. The threats and benefits of development loom large in such a place, but the people of Príncipe had left me feeling optimistic. When Yodi appeared, I asked him if he would like to live elsewhere. “No! I went to São Tomé and also to Libreville in Gabon, but I didn’t like them.” He laughed. “Those coconut-collector boys will go, but in a year they will be back. I prefer to be here on my island, with the flowers and birds.” Zinha got it exactly right when she named her restaurant: life here is hard, but happy. Way to go The trip was provided by HB, which owns Roça Sundy (doubles from €210 a night half-board). Flights were provided by TAP Air Portugal, which flies from Gatwick to São Tomé via Lisbon from around £650 return (including an optional stopover of up to three nights). Inter-island flights from São Tomé to Príncipe start at £150 return"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2017/oct/30/cancer-nurse-30-years-things-have-never-been-so-bad","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-30T10:20:28Z","webTitle":"I’ve been a cancer nurse for over 30 years – things have never been so bad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2017/oct/30/cancer-nurse-30-years-things-have-never-been-so-bad","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2017/oct/30/cancer-nurse-30-years-things-have-never-been-so-bad","fields":{"headline":"I’ve been a cancer nurse for over 30 years – things have never been so bad","bodyText":"This morning, we had nine new patients on the ward. They will all need support to manage the rollercoaster that is having cancer. Nine may not seem like many, but I’m already seeing 80 patients this week. Every single one needs to be treated as an individual – as a person first, and a cancer patient second. This takes time – which, as the only clinical nurse specialist in my department, I’m finding harder and harder to find. GPs and nurses are struggling with growing caseloads. I’ve been a cancer nurse for over 30 years and, believe me, things have never been this bad. The numbers of patients being seen means it is often hard, if not impossible, to spend the time necessary to support patients through treatments. Recruitment is becoming increasingly difficult; nobody wants to work with these pressures especially if unsupported. As experienced nurses leave or retire, like-for-like replacement is a struggle, and this further depletes the quality of care that patients receive. It’s all got me seriously worried about the future of the NHS. When I finally retire, will I be leaving a sinking ship? Cancer has changed so much and the NHS isn’t catching up with it. People are living longer, the cancer population is growing, and patients who once had no treatment options now have a lot of choice. Don’t get me wrong, this is a really wonderful thing. But what is good news for patients is, ironically, piling more pressure on staff who are already run ragged. Understaffed wards are full of exhausted nurses. When I take time off, there is no one to cover my work. I used to not take any holiday because I’d feel too guilty. But everyone needs a break. No one is an endless resource. I regularly work through the day without a break and I am not alone in this. The NHS depends on goodwill. Nurses do not turn their backs on patients in need, however, this often means there is no thinking or planning time, and certainly no personal respite. With all this pressure, it takes all my strength and experience not to let the stress show in front of my patients. When you know people are spending hours in a waiting room, it’s hard not to try and rush your tasks and see more people. Thirty years of experience helps me stay calm in these situations. But what about the new generations of nurses joining the service? If I’d had this level of pressure earlier in my career, I wouldn’t have been able to cope. It’s heart-breaking to see the younger generation of nurses struggling. I know it’s not just nurses who are dealing with this. Overburdened medics pass on tasks to us, so you’ll often get a nurse doing a medical procedure which isn’t our job. This takes the pressure off the medic, but who is picking up my task? It all has a knock-on effect and at the receiving end of that are the patients. I’ve given so much of myself to the NHS and to caring for people with cancer. I am so proud of the difference nurses make at some of the hardest moments of a person’s life. But I wish NHS and government leaders would listen to nurses more. Sometimes I feel so powerless. We nurses are on the frontline and in the best position to know what’s right for the patients, but we often feel unable to change anything. Despite everything, I love my job. While I’m not always appreciated by management, I always feel appreciated by the patients. Only recently I was with a patient who said, “I wouldn’t have got through any of this without you” – it’s those moments that remind you why you keep going. That’s what we do – we get people through the worst time of their life. But will we be able to do this much longer? Not if the same pressure that’s on me keeps getting handed down to future nurses. Being a good nurse requires thinking time. You need to be able to put patients first. That’s all we want to do.

But eventually, Republicans did as well. They just found out about Gangnam Style.” Colbert then addressed Trump’s lunch on Wednesday with Republican senators, after which he sent out three tweets boasting that he was greeted with a standing ovation. “Don’t you get it? You’re the president,” Colbert responded. “They have to stand up when you walk in the room. That’s like saying my proctologist loves me so much he stuck his finger right up my butt, no co-pay.” The host then showed footage of Trump’s post-lunch press conference outside the White House, where he “assured everyone that Senator Jeff Flake’s recent comments will not hurt him in Arizona”. “Trump also addressed the recent reports that he couldn’t remember a fallen soldier’s name,” Colbert said, showing clips of the president insisting that, in his phone call with the widow of La David Johnson, he said the soldier’s name, as he had a sheet in front of him with his name on it. “Trump explained why he was able to remember the name that was written on the chart in front of him.” On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee used her monologue to discuss the country’s recent string of weather disasters, including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and the wildfires in northern California. “This week we are taking a break from talking about the president attacking Gold Star families and instead talk about something else: our planet constantly attacking us in every way imaginable,” Bee began, showing news coverage of recent natural disasters. “Despite all these disasters, climate change is never the top story,” she explained. “I get it, who has time to read a thoughtful Times explainer about hurricanes when you yourself are on fire? But we can’t avoid the subject any longer. 2017 is the first year in recorded history when the US was hit by three category-4 hurricanes. Even a complete idiot can see there’s something unprecedented going on here.” “So what makes strong hurricanes more and more frequent?” Bee asked. “According to our government the answer is none-of-your-fucking-business-stop-asking-so-many-damn-questions.” The host then showed a statement from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) secretary, Scott Pruitt, in which he claimed it was “insensitive” to discuss the causes of these disasters, like climate change, while its victims are still suffering. “Well, if we can’t talk about climate change I guess it’s finally time to have that gun control conversation we’ve been putting off, right?” Bee replied. “Scientists aren’t saying climate changed caused these disasters, but they do think it made them considerably worse. Warmer temperatures raise sea levels, warmer oceans strengthen hurricanes, and warmer air holds more moisture, so when it rains it rains hard. Which is great news for sexy movie posters but bad news for everything else. “I get it, it’s hard to remember that climate change is slowly destroying the world maybe because it doesn’t have a Twitter account to remind us of our mortality every five minutes,” Bee concluded. “Climate change isn’t some far-off threat in the distant future like Beyoncé ageing. It is upon us.” Trevor Noah of Comedy Central discussed the several Republican senators who have openly defied Trump. “A senator in open revolt against a president from his own party,” Noah said. “And not just disagreeing with him: Bob Corker is saying that the president of the United States is incompetent and cannot be trusted in the Oval Office.” “Corker wasn’t the only GOP senator to speak up yesterday,” Noah continued, showing clips of Jeff Flake’s Tuesday speech on the Senate floor. “What he said in 140 characters, Arizona senator Jeff Flake expanded on old-school style.” “Right now, the Republican party is not having a good time,” Noah said, adding that senators McCain, Murkowski and Collins, too, have criticized Trump openly. The host then went on to detail Steve Bannon’s response to Flake and Corker’s comments. Bannon reportedly said “another day, another scalp”, regarding their retirements as an opportunity to elect politicians more in line with Trump. “Bannon wants all Republicans who go against Trump to quit so that he can replace them with Trump loyalists,” Noah said. “In fact, Bannon even said he plans to challenge every single Republican politician except for Ted Cruz. Which is so sad for Ted Cruz. He even gets left out of threats.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"law/2017/oct/26/crowdfunded-high-court-challenge-against-tory-dup-1bn-deal-fails","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T15:48:19Z","webTitle":"Crowdfunded high court challenge against £1bn Tory-DUP deal fails","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/oct/26/crowdfunded-high-court-challenge-against-tory-dup-1bn-deal-fails","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/oct/26/crowdfunded-high-court-challenge-against-tory-dup-1bn-deal-fails","fields":{"headline":"Crowdfunded high court challenge against £1bn Tory-DUP deal fails","bodyText":"A crowdfunded bid at the high court in London to challenge the government’s controversial parliamentary deal with the Democratic Unionist party has failed. Two judges rejected an application made on Thursday by Ciaran McClean, an unsuccessful Westminster candidate for the Green party in Northern Ireland in the general election, to bring a judicial review of the legality of the £1bn deal. The claim alleged the deal breached the landmark 1998 Good Friday agreement and the Bribery Act. McClean, who raised tens of thousands of pounds for the legal action via crowdfunding, accused the government of “buying DUP votes” to hold on to power. He was in court to hear Lord Justice Sales, sitting with Mr Justice Lewis, rule against him. Sales said neither of the two grounds relied on by McClean in his application was “properly arguable in a court of law”. He said: “Permission to apply for judicial review should be refused.” McClean, who pursued the legal action as a private individual and not in conjunction with the Green party, claimed the agreement breached the Bribery Act 2010 and described it as a “corrupt bargain”. During the hearing, his lawyer tried to persuade the two judges that he had an “arguable” case, which should be given a full airing in court at a later date. Dominic Chambers QC told them that, under the 26 June agreement, the government had “purchased” the political support of the DUP for £1bn, “and that sum will come from public money”. He argued the agreement was made for an “unlawful purpose” and said that it was “on its face unlawful because it makes provision for the expenditure of public funds for party political advantage”. The application was contested by two defendants, the first secretary of state and the attorney general. Their QC, James Eadie, submitted in written argument before the judges that the criminal law of bribery “plainly does not apply to a confidence and supply agreement between political parties”. He stated: “The allegation that the agreement entails public expenditure which is unlawful at common law and/or without parliamentary authority is misconceived in particular because the expenditure contemplated by the agreement will have appropriate parliamentary authorisation.” The parliamentary deal – branded “shabby and reckless” by Labour – saw the DUP’s 10 MPs agree to support the Conservatives’ minority government in a series of key Westminster votes. In exchange, Northern Ireland’s largest party secured £1bn of new Treasury investment in the region. Under the “confidence and supply” arrangement intended to last until 2022, the DUP guaranteed that its MPs would vote with the government on the Queen’s speech, the budget and legislation relating to Brexit and national security. The DUP has insisted the Westminster arrangement will provide stability for the UK at a time of uncertainty while offering much-needed investment for the whole of Northern Ireland. A government spokeswoman said: “We believe the claim is groundless and the court has agreed with that view. The government is very clear that making funding available under the agreement is lawful and is for the benefit of all parts of the community in Northern Ireland.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/30/when-good-tv-goes-bad-bo-selecta","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-30T13:00:01Z","webTitle":"When good TV goes bad: how Bo’ Selecta! became proper boring","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/30/when-good-tv-goes-bad-bo-selecta","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/30/when-good-tv-goes-bad-bo-selecta","fields":{"headline":"When good TV goes bad: how Bo’ Selecta! became proper boring","bodyText":"The component parts never made a lick of sense: a popular UK garage artist, a 1960s Ken Loach film, congenital incontinence, a deranged neckbeard who stalks celebrities. Yet for two years, beginning in 2002, Bo’ Selecta! was Friday night’s unmissable twisted freakshow, a riotous riff on fame that appalled as many as it thrilled. Leigh Francis’s warped take on celebrity culture featured him in a series of sketches, wearing a series of unconvincing latex masks, playing a series of celebrities. Rory Bremner it was not. Francis’s grotesques were impressionistic impressions that barely looked like, and sounded nothing like, their targets. UK garage phenom Craig David was now a blunt Yorkshireman with a urostomy bag and a plastic falcon, Michael Jackson was a jive-talking badass and Spice Girl Mel B was a leery, drunken sex oaf. Stringing it all together was Avid Merrion, an unhinged celebrity stalker – a Transylvanian Rupert Pupkin in a neck brace. Bo’ Selecta! coincided with the peak years of Big Brother and the celebrity gossip magazines such as Heat, Now and OK! that fuelled its rise. As celebrity ate itself, regurgitating non-stories about non-notables in a seemingly neverending cycle of hook-ups, bust-ups and breakdowns, Bo’ Selecta! was the demented Greek chorus commenting on the action. There had never been anything quite like it and it mixed the gut-punch of relentless toilet humour with a surreal satire of celebrity culture that is still relevant. How terrible, then, that it got starstruck itself. Having earned a little fame of his own, Francis became increasingly willing to let celebrities in on the joke. The real Craig David appeared in the last episode of series two and from there things became way too cosy. The Proper Crimbo Christmas single the show produced had a video packed with real-life stars. Who invited the enemy? It felt like a cessation of hostilities. As if to confirm this, the Office Christmas special that year had David Brent impersonating the Bo’ Selecta! Michael Jackson. An endorsement from the Brent-Meister was the kiss of comedy death. It was now the chosen show of unfunny office jokers, a point from which few return. The joke wore thinner in the third series. The real Patsy Kensit became a series regular, flatsharing with the unreal Mel B. It was becoming apparent that Francis now just liked hanging out with famous people. “It’s weird when some of the people I’ve done a homage to have ended up as friends,” he said, apparently not considering it a problem. Series three also introduced Merrion’s manager Keith Lemon, a black hole of a character whose longevity would go on to baffle an entire generation of light entertainment fans. Two more series followed with Merrion and the horny Bear character doing a lot of the heavy lifting, but the magic of the early days was gone. The very appearance of a famous person was now a punchline. Whereas it had once lampooned the cult of celebrity, it was now assimilated, an integral part of the famous-for-being-famous circuit. Bo’ Selecta! had become another branch of the monster it set out to destroy and no amount of gurning or catchphrases could save it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/26/the-specials-review-brilliant-docusoap-special-needs","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T15:30:02Z","webTitle":"The Specials review – it's more than a TV show, it's a voice for unrepresented young people","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/26/the-specials-review-brilliant-docusoap-special-needs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/26/the-specials-review-brilliant-docusoap-special-needs","fields":{"headline":"The Specials review – it's more than a TV show, it's a voice for unrepresented young people","bodyText":"What is it? A homemade web series about five youngsters sharing a house in Brighton. Why you’ll love it: A docusoap lives or dies on the strength of its cast and The Specials is no different. Which is perhaps why Rosie O’Donnell, Oprah Winfrey and the producers of Game of Thrones went nuts for this terrifically absorbing series about a group of friends with special needs who strike out on their own, away from their families, and chipped in to help. Lewis, Hilly, Megan, Lucy and Sam are the stars and narrators of this story, filmed over several years by director and producer Katy Lock and her partner Daniel May. The two ploughed their life savings into the project, determined to get the everyday stories of their cast out into the world, despite being unable to find a UK broadcaster. They stream it themselves on a homemade website, relying on the modest subscriptions they charge to keep the whole thing afloat. The 20-minute webisodes offer simply presented storylines of love, friendship and the rocky transition into adulthood: the difficulties of dating someone you share a house with, loneliness, looming graduation, romantic rejection, the hunt for a job. And all the while, standing back and giving the stories room to unfold instead of relentlessly prodding their subjects to hype the drama, as is so often the case with this genre. It’s one of those shows that forces you to lean in and rewards you with the kind of careful storytelling that should win wheelbarrows of awards. Lewis is gawky, Jarvis Cockeresque with a wit dryer than sand. Sam and Megan function, without any forced narrative messing, as the Ross and Rachel of the piece, drawn to each other but never quite hitting the same life stage at the same time. Lucy admits she has basically never been single as she smudges blue eye shadow on to her lids before yet another date. And Hilly rides the rollercoaster of serious commitment as she and fiancee Paul try to work out what being engaged actually means, and whether that’s what they both want after all. It’s no wonder those US big-hitters offered to help. Winfrey is screening it on her OWN network in America and Thrones execs Carolyn Strauss and DB Weiss are joining the show as executive producers for series two. It’s a shining example of what can happen when something made out of love gains internet traction and winds up in front of the right people. You have to pay to watch The Specials and it’s worth every penny. I heartily recommend spending the £16 it costs for an access-all-areas pass, allowing you to explore the two series and the Xtra Special Zone, which features outtakes, films about the cast members’ siblings and beautiful, powerful testimonies from parents all over the world talking about having children with intellectual disabilities. It’s more than a TV show now and has given a voice to young people all over the world who have never been presented on screen in this way before. More power to its totally brilliant elbow. Where: the-specials.com (various subscriptions available). Length: Two seasons and a host of extras, available to stream now. Standout episode: Every 20-minute slice is packed with so much warmth, life and humanity it’s impossible to choose. If you liked The Specials, watch: Love You More (coming soon in Amazon’s autumn pilot season), The Undateables (All4)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/26/man-shot-dead-in-accrington-named-locally-as-lee-holt","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T15:01:37Z","webTitle":"Man shot dead in Accrington named locally as Lee Holt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/26/man-shot-dead-in-accrington-named-locally-as-lee-holt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/26/man-shot-dead-in-accrington-named-locally-as-lee-holt","fields":{"headline":"Man shot dead in Accrington named locally as Lee Holt","bodyText":"A Lancashire man who was shot dead – allegedly by a 14-year-old boy – has been identified by locals as 32-year-old Lee Holt. Holt was hit once in the chest at a house in Accrington on Wednesday night. He was taken to Royal Blackburn hospital, where he died a short time later. Police have arrested a 14-year-old boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, on suspicion of murder. It is believed Holt, who is thought to have a young daughter, was killed when he visited the address to discuss bullying allegations between children at a local school. Holt is understood to work for a local firm painting road markings. Neighbours said it was well known that the father of the arrested boy kept guns at the property. One neighbour said she heard a woman screaming “blood, blood!” after Holt was shot, and another resident attempted to resuscitate him before paramedics and police arrived shortly after 8.25pm.

High in the Swiss Alps, before an audience of the super-rich gathered for their annual shindig in Davos, China’s Xi Jinping delivered a powerful defence of globalisation. Protectionism, he said, was like locking yourself in a dark room. “While wind and rain may be kept outside, that dark room will also block light and air.” On that January day nine months ago, the target for Xi’s comments was more than 4,000 miles away on the other side of the Atlantic, preparing for his inauguration as president a couple of days later. The message was simple: if Donald Trump is going to turn his back on the world, China will fill the vacuum. The Davos elite lapped it up, putting to one side any misgivings they might have had about Xi’s increasingly authoritarian rule, the purges of his opponents and the tightening of censorship. Xi might be the leader of an illiberal one-party state, but he talked the language of open markets and free trade. Unlike Trump, with his walls and punitive tariffs, this was a man with whom they could do business. Both sides of Xi have been in evidence in the months since. This week he tightened his grip on power in Beijing, becoming the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. But his tough line on anything that smacks of dissent at home has been matched by a much softer approach overseas. Where Trump has said the US will pull out of the Paris climate change deal, Xi has said China will stick by its commitments. While Trump has cut the US aid budget, Xi is delivering big infrastructure projects to poor countries with no questions asked. Trump has rejected the World Bank’s plea for more money, but Xi’s shiny new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (of which the UK was a founder member) has deeper pockets and is only too willing to lend. Trump wants to kill the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico; Xi says the global economy is a big ocean from which no country can escape. China has some serious problems. A pollution crisis helps to explain why it is backing action to tackle global warming. The one-child policy, which ended in 2015, means its population is ageing long before it has completed its transition from developing to developed status, a trend that will slow long-term growth. In the short term, China has only been able to sustain annual growth rates of 6-7% by pumping the economy full of debt. The International Monetary Fund has identified the pricking of China’s credit bubble as one of the big risks to the global economy, but it is also a domestic threat to Xi because a marked slowdown in growth would lead to rising unemployment and political unrest. But the US has its weaknesses too, and Trump’s tough guy act should fool nobody. It is unlikely to impress Xi. Seventy years have passed since the IMF opened its doors for business and France became the recipient of the first loan made by the World Bank. Washington took the lead in constructing a series of multilateral institutions designed to prevent a repeat of the economic collapse and extreme nationalism of the 1930s. American economic muscle meant that, by and large, what the US wanted, the US got. That is less true today, but America still has real clout at the three big multilateral economic institutions: the IMF, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation. But only if it chooses to use it. Trump has chosen not to. In 1947 the US also announced the Marshall plan to help to rebuild the devastated economies of western Europe. America was much more generous with its aid 70 years ago, but the plan was not just about charity. American companies needed consumers overseas to have enough money to buy their products, and Harry Truman wanted to tie the recipient countries in western Europe into a military alliance to counter the threat from the Soviet Union. The modern version of the Marshall plan is Xi’s Belt and Road initiative, which finances infrastructure projects across Asia. The belt runs along the old Silk Road and the maritime road stretches across the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean via the coast of Africa and the Suez canal. As with the original, this is not pure altruism. China’s recovery from the financial crisis of a decade ago involved the state spending money on industrial capacity the country did not really need. Sending steel and cement overseas keeps Chinese factories open and workers happy. The Belt and Road initiative is a massive commitment, dwarfing the Marshall plan in size and scope. Countries do not have to join a military alliance with China to benefit, but the expectation is that they will inevitably develop stronger trading and political links as a result. Under Trump, the US appears to have lost its knack for deploying soft power; Xi has shown how to do it. America is not finished as a global power, or even close to being finished. China has a long way to go before it can match the US on income per head of population and military spending – the indicators that really matter. Those who have predicted the demise of Uncle Sam down the years have been proved consistently wrong. But nor is this a repeat of the late 1950s, when Nikita Khrushchev’s space programme prompted needless panic in the US that the Soviet Union’s economy was forging ahead. China’s stupendous growth means it has been able to deliver the improvements in living standards that were denied to Russians during the cold war. More than 500 million people have been lifted out of poverty since Deng Xiaoping began China’s economic transformation in the early 1980s. Bicycles have been replaced by cars; consumption of dairy produce is up because people can afford fridges. Pictures this week of young women in Tiananmen Square taking selfies with their smartphones made the point: Beijing in 2017 is not Moscow in 1957. China, after transforming itself from an agrarian into an industrialised economy, is now eyeing up opportunities in the hi-tech sectors that the rich countries of the west once considered their own. In America, the days when John F Kennedy could boast that a rising tide lifted all boats are long gone. Trump is president because the economy grows only half as quickly as it did in the immediate postwar decades and the fruits of that growth have been captured by a privileged few. It is not as easy as it once was to make the contrast between an authoritarian regime that doesn’t deliver prosperity and a liberal regime that does. China is mounting the first global challenge to the US since the collapse of the Soviet Union more than a quarter of a century ago, and a far more meaningful one at that. Trump, a throwback to America’s isolationist past, is making that threat more potent by rejecting the multilateral system that previous occupants of the White House had crafted and dominated. For four decades, China has focused on the domestic challenge of growing the economy. During that time there has been endless speculation about when it would start to claim a bigger role on the world stage. That moment has now arrived. • Larry Elliott is the Guardian’s economics editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"law/2017/oct/26/stop-and-search-eight-times-more-likely-to-target-black-people","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T14:09:47Z","webTitle":"Stop and search eight times more likely to target black people","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/oct/26/stop-and-search-eight-times-more-likely-to-target-black-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/oct/26/stop-and-search-eight-times-more-likely-to-target-black-people","fields":{"headline":"Stop and search eight times more likely to target black people","bodyText":"The racial gap in the use of stop and search by police has grown in the past year, leaving black people eight times more likely to be targeted by officers than white people. Official figures released on Thursday show the racial disparity in stop and search has increased, despite government pressure for the gap to close. The figures show overall use of stop and search has fallen by 21% in the past year to just under 304,000 incidences across England and Wales, the lowest number since 2002. But stops of white people dropped by 28%, while for minority ethnic people the fall was just 11%. People classed as black British were eight times more likely to be stopped than white people, while those from all minority ethnic communities were four times more likely to be stopped than white people. The Labour MP David Lammy, who chaired a government review of racial disparity in the criminal justice system, said the figures were shocking. He told the Guardian: “We cannot continue to have different policing for different communities – it is inherently unfair – and so these figures suggesting that we are actually going backwards are deeply alarming.” The data shows that 17% of stops led to an arrest, up by 1% on the previous year. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said: “Figures show stop and search reforms are working. The stop-to-arrest rate has risen and once again is the highest on record, and the new ‘best use of stop and search’ scheme data shows that over two-thirds of searches result in some kind of police action. “However, no one should be stopped because of their race or ethnicity. Chief constables will need to explain disparities in their force areas, because if stop and search powers are misused it is counterproductive and damages confidence in policing.” The Home Office says it will continue to press police chiefs for reform on stop and search. Lammy, the MP for Tottenham in north London, said: “The disproportionality that I found throughout the criminal justice system begins with stop and search. For so many young black men in Britain today, the frequency at which they are being stopped and searched means that, from their perspective, they feel as though they are living in a police state. As I found in my review for the government, the disproportionate use of stop and search drains trust in our justice system. “As we speak there will be a young, white middle class man smoking a joint at a campus university and the police will be nowhere in sight. If someone rang the police, the assumption would be that they were wasting their time. But a young black man walking through Brixton or on Tottenham High Road will be stopped and searched, and end up with a criminal record that blights their life chances for ever.” The figures show that the Metropolitan police, which covers London, is the heaviest user of stop and search powers. It used the powers against 16 in every 1,000 people in its area, while The rate for Greater Manchester police was one in every one thousand of population, and the average for England and Wales was five stops per thousand people. Rising violent crime levels have led some to call for more stop and search, and Met commissioner Cressida Dick has backed its greater use, if it is deemed necessary by police. Despite changes by police, the racial disproportionality in the use of stop and search remain high and of concern. The feeling is that it damages community relations with trust and confidence for the police lower among black Britons. DCC Adrian Hanstock, the national strategic lead on stop and search, said: “It is clear that officers are being more precise in their use of this power, with the total number of stops falling, the arrest rate continuing to rise and six in 10 stops resulting in an outcome. “Sadly, we are seeing young black men disproportionately reflected in knife crime, both as victims and suspected offenders. We are equally concerned that people from BAME [black, Asian and minority ethnic] backgrounds are generally overrepresented in stop and search figures and in the criminal justice system as a whole. Chief constables will be examining any local disparities in stop and search data and will work directly with local communities to explain the reasons. “We know that trust in the police is lower among some communities, and so we have made greater efforts to include those communities in our scrutiny of stop and search, and to build confidence in policing and address the issues that are most important to them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/29/antoine-reicha-reicha-rediscovered-vol-1-ivan-ilic-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-29T06:15:20Z","webTitle":"Reicha Rediscovered Vol 1 CD review – a revolutionary mind","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/29/antoine-reicha-reicha-rediscovered-vol-1-ivan-ilic-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/29/antoine-reicha-reicha-rediscovered-vol-1-ivan-ilic-review","fields":{"headline":"Reicha Rediscovered Vol 1 CD review – a revolutionary mind","bodyText":"Antoine Reicha (1770-1836) knew everyone. Youthful friend of Haydn and Beethoven, he later taught Berlioz, Gounod, Liszt and César Franck. His influence on European music is immense, so why is he not more well-known? Perhaps because the compositions of a great teacher and author of treatises on harmony and improvisation do not necessarily translate easily to the concert platform. The Serbian pianist Ivan Ilić introduces us to Reicha’s revolutionary mind, bringing together works from about 1800, some springing directly from his theoretical writing on composition. Ilić intersperses startlingly original fantasias with two sonatas, one built entirely around a theme from Mozart’s Magic Flute. It’s perhaps a little too academic for one sitting, but individually the works hold a genuine fascination."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/26/rangers-sack-pedro-caixinha-as-manager","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T14:37:04Z","webTitle":"Rangers sack Pedro Caixinha as manager after seven months in charge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/26/rangers-sack-pedro-caixinha-as-manager","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/26/rangers-sack-pedro-caixinha-as-manager","fields":{"headline":"Rangers sack Pedro Caixinha as manager after seven months in charge","bodyText":"Rangers are on the hunt for a manager for the second time this year after Pedro Caixinha’s turbulent tenure was unsurprisingly brought to an end on Thursday. The 1-1 draw with Kilmarnock on Wednesday, in which Rangers conceded the equaliser five minutes into injury time, proved too much for the club’s board in the immediate aftermath of the League Cup semi-final defeat by Motherwell on Sunday. During a short and hastily arranged meeting, it was decided to sack the Portuguese. Aberdeen’s Derek McInnes, Tommy Wright of St Johnstone, the Northern Ireland manager, Michael O’Neill, plus Alex McLeish, who managed Rangers between 2001 and 2006, have been named as early candidates. “The decision to part company with Pedro was taken after careful consideration and the search for a new manager will begin immediately,” the club said in a statement. “Pedro was appointed in March this year but results have been disappointing and not commensurate with the level of investment that was made available. “The priority is to appoint a new manager as quickly as possible but the board will take as much time as is necessary to secure the right person capable of representing Rangers and providing the brand of football [our] supporters rightly expect.” Graeme Murty, who also took on the role of caretaker before Caixinha’s appointment, is expected to take charge for Saturday’stmatch with Heart of Midlothian at Murrayfield. Three of Caixinha’s coaches – Hélder Baptista, Pedro Malta and José Belman – have also left. Before his arrival from Qatar to succeed Mark Warburton, Caixinha had failed to hold down any coaching position for a concerted period of time. He won 14 of his 26 games in charge, which represents an ominous ratio for a Rangers manager. The 46-year-old also presided over some humiliations – Celtic cantered to a 5-1 win at Ibrox in April, and his side were bundled out of Europe by Progrès Niederkorn, of Luxembourg, to start this season. Nonetheless, Caixinha was given relatively substantial sums to try to close the gap with Celtic. Despite the arrivals of Bruno Alves, Graham Dorrans and others, Caixinha leaves with the team fourth in the top flight and eight points adrift of the champions after 10 games. There was also a recent and curious standoff between Caixinha and one of his most senior players, Kenny Miller. The manager had informed Miller, Lee Wallace and Niko Kranjcar not to attend the Kilmarnock match as they were not part of the first-team squad. Murty will have support in some quarters in respect of taking the position permanently. However, and notwithstanding financial pressures, a more experienced manager is likely to be appointed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/26/m-butterfly-clive-owen-review","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T02:00:17Z","webTitle":"M.

Butterfly review – Clive Owen impresses in Julie Taymor's revision","bodyText":"Most theater is a seduction. Bodies and lights, words and clothes, they all tempt us to embrace what’s unreal. David Henry Hwang’s M. Butterfly, now revived on Broadway, starring Clive Owen, is a play that uses the tools of theater to both celebrate and question how we give ourselves over to fantasy. Nearly 30 years on, it’s still clever, tender and formally daring. But Julie Taymor’s staging and Hwang’s rewrites unbalance the delicate poise between illusion and truth. M. Butterfly is based on the unlikely history of Bernard Bouriscot, a low-level French foreign service worker who began a sexual relationship with a playwright and former actor, Shi Pei Pu. The relationship lasted more than a decade and led Bouriscot to commit espionage. In all that time, he believed that Shi, an anatomically normative male, was a woman. As M. Butterfly opens, Gallimard, the Bouriscot figure played by Owen, is in a prison cell, compelled to revisit the events of his past. He describes an adolescence as the boy voted “least likely to be invited to a party” (coming from Owen this is tough to believe) and a young adulthood spent in a mercenary marriage to an older woman (Enid Graham). He is newly settled in China when he attends a performance of the final aria of Madama Butterfly and meets its singer Song Liling (Jin Ha). Song and Gallimard tussle over the aria. “It’s a very beautiful story,” Gallimard says. “Well, yes, to a westerner,” Song replies. Though Song clearly excites his sexual interest, Gallimard believes him to be a man. But as their friendship deepens, Song reveals that though constrained to live as a man, she is actually a woman. Gallimard takes Song as his mistress. The action of the play is built on a series of opposites – western and eastern, man and woman, life and art, experience and innocence. Hwang’s script is intent on showing how easily these binaries attract and repel and blur together, most bluntly on the body of Song, who dominates Gallimard even while seeming to submit to him. Taymor’s set, which manages to be both bare and busy, is also a study in sameness and difference. At the top of each scene, eight or so panels rotate in and out, often with a wobble, forming offices, homes, the stage of a Beijing opera house, sometimes offering too much detail and sometimes too little. Owen was a long-limbed pleasure in his previous Broadway outing, Old Times, and here he is again a captivating presence, even playing a man without allurements. (Hwang and the producers aren’t blind. They’ve cut the lines where other characters complain about Gallimard’s ho-hum looks.) Jin Ha, a young actor poached from the Chicago Hamilton cast, makes a nicely spiky Song. Ha and Owen can’t equal the chemistry of John Lithgow and BD Wong, who originated the roles, nor does Ha appear as feminine as Wong did. But this is somewhat beside the point. Song is less concerned with embodying a real woman than with fulfilling Gallimard’s lotus blossom fantasy. As Song says, “Only a man knows how a woman is supposed to act.” In revising the play for Broadway, Hwang cut some speeches and added others, providing several specifics designed to pull the events of the play closer to the real story. The most sensational addition is probably Song’s clinical description of faking female genitals by manipulating his own penis and testicles and slicking his thighs with cooking oil. Of course details like this are pruriently fascinating, but they push the play toward realism. Less butterfly, more caterpillar. The original version, which edged closer to epic theater, dealt heavily in metaphor and symbolism. This new version does too, but it’s more grounded in fact, which leaves one hungry for particulars of the real story, particularly Song’s own desires, which are hinted at, but never fully articulated. There’s an aria still to write. How strange that such an audaciously imaginative play couldn’t imagine these, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/26/eu-under-mounting-pressure-to-ban-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T15:38:28Z","webTitle":"EU under mounting pressure to ban arms sales to Saudi Arabia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/26/eu-under-mounting-pressure-to-ban-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/26/eu-under-mounting-pressure-to-ban-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia","fields":{"headline":"EU under mounting pressure to ban arms sales to Saudi Arabia","bodyText":"The European Union is under mounting pressure from MEPs to ban arms sales to Saudi Arabia in response to the Gulf state’s bombing campaign in Yemen. The leaders of four political groups in the European parliament have urged the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, to propose an EU arms embargo on Saudi Arabia, because of the devastating war in Yemen that has left nearly 20 million people in need of humanitarian aid. In a letter to Mogherini, seen by the Guardian, the MEP leaders accuse the EU of flouting its own rules, by selling weapons to Saudi Arabia in defiance of a 2008 common code on military exports. Mogherini has the right to propose an arms embargo, but would need to win the backing of EU member states, including the UK, one of the biggest arms exporters to the Gulf kingdom. The latest call for a ban would run into immediate opposition from the British defence secretary, Michael Fallon, who urged MPs on Wednesday not to criticise Saudi Arabia in the interests of a fighter jet deal. The EU code on arms exports lists eight grounds for turning down an arms export licence, including respect for the obligations of international organisations, such as the UN. In particular EU member states must show “special caution and vigilance” when issuing licences to countries where serious violations of human rights have been established by the UN or other bodies. The UN has described Yemen as the world’s largest humanitarian crisis: in September it agreed to send war crimes investigators to the devastated country to examine alleged human-rights violations committed by both sides during the two-and-a-half year civil war. After Saudi Arabia launched a bombing campaign against the Houthi rebels in March 2015, at least 10,000 people were killed in the first 22 months of the conflict, the UN humanitarian office said, almost double other estimates. At least 2,100 people have died from cholera, while thousands more are being infected with the disease every week following the collapse of water supplies and sanitation. Bodil Valero, Swedish Green party MEP, said the EU could not continue to sell arms to Saudi Arabia when faced with “the biggest humanitarian crisis in the world”. “We have our common European values, we have a common position [on arms sales], we shouldn’t sell arms to a country that doesn’t respect humanitarian law or human rights,” said Valero, who drafts the parliament’s annual arms control resolution. “I think it is clear we are breaking the common position, at least when it comes to new products, new licences,” said Valero. “We should say no to selling weapons to Saudi Arabia because the common position wouldn’t allow it.” France, followed by the UK, issued the most valuable arms-export licences to Saudi Arabia in 2015, according to the latest EU arms export report, which shows that 17 EU member states sold arms to the Gulf state The UK issued licences to Saudi Arabia worth €3.3bn (£2.9bn), but did not reveal the value of weapons shipped to the country that year. France issued licences worth €16.9bn, but the value of shipments was €899m. EU member states refused seven arms export licences to Saudi Arabia, but the report does not name the country or countries that did so, or why. The letter to Mogherini states: “It is our view that any such [arms] exports to Saudi Arabia are in direct violation of at least criterion two of the common position in regard to the country’s involvement in grave breaches of humanitarian law as established by competent UN authorities.” It is signed by the leaders of the Socialists, the Liberals, the European United Left and the Greens, who together have 48% of MEPs in the European parliament. The parliament passed a symbolic resolution in favour of an arms embargo in February 2016, but member states, which hold the levers of EU foreign policy, have so far ignored calls for action. As the EU’s foreign policy chief, Mogherini can put the issue on the agenda, but is reluctant to do so unless it is likely to succeed. The UK will no longer be bound by the EU’s arms export code after Brexit, but could align itself with the bloc. Norway, Canada and Albania are among eight non-EU countries that have chosen to sign-up to EU arms export policy. A spokeswoman for Mogherini said:“The final decision whether to authorise or deny an export remains at national discretion of member states. Decisions on issuing an arms embargo lie fully with the council [of foreign ministers]; deciding an arms embargo would require political agreement by unanimity within the council.” On Yemen, she added: “our position is that a political solution is the only way out of this conflict... The EU continues to support the peace process, to supply humanitarian assistance and will play an active role in a coordinated response of the international community to address post conflict needs of the Yemeni population.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2017/oct/27/plagiarism-is-rife-in-academia-so-why-is-it-rarely-acknowledged","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T06:30:22Z","webTitle":"Plagiarism is rife in academia, so why is it rarely acknowledged? | Anonymous academic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/oct/27/plagiarism-is-rife-in-academia-so-why-is-it-rarely-acknowledged","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2017/oct/27/plagiarism-is-rife-in-academia-so-why-is-it-rarely-acknowledged","fields":{"headline":"Plagiarism is rife in academia, so why is it rarely acknowledged?","bodyText":"I always assumed plagiarism to be mainly committed by a few lazy students and over-ambitious politicians. But ever since discovering plagiarism of my own work, I’ve come to see it as more pervasive. Three years ago, I was reading up on recent research in my field, when I stumbled on a sentence that read quite familiar. Re-reading the entire paragraph, I realised these were my words – I’d published them on an academic blog two years before. It turned out a whopping 285-word chunk in the article was copied verbatim, just minimally changed, but several other sections in the article used my arguments without credit. No footnote or reference acknowledged my work. I was stunned because I couldn’t believe a full professor of high global standing – a respected leader in their field – would do this. I was also flattered because, of course, imitation is a form of praise. Mostly I was angry because an important article of mine had recently been rejected, but here was another person getting my half-baked blog thoughts published under their name. But I was also worried, because I now had to prove the originality of my work. Even now, I still fear reprisals if I were ever to publicise the incident; I avoided my institution while the plagiarist recently visited. As a first step, of course I consulted the internet, and, bizarrely, I found numerous sources of advice for plagiarists – but not for those who have been plagiarised. These included tongue-in-cheek advice for academics, such as the “top five law-proof strategies when busted for plagiarism”. I decided to take the case up with the high-ranking economics journal in question. The editors handled it very professionally. They chased the author for several months, and finally managed to elicit a limp response: the plagiarist acknowledged that they had “indeed (inadvertently) relied heavily” on my work, and suggested that the publishers revise the online version of the article by rephrasing the paragraphs in question in their own words. I insisted the 285 words be set as a block quote, which the journal did. The editors also printed a corrigendum in the next issue. But not once in the process did the author or the editors concede that the issue was, in fact, plagiarism. Retraction should have been discussed. Despite this having happened three years ago, something still rankles: the plagiarist got away scot-free. We try to instil in our students a deep respect for source material and referencing. But if an established academic tries to pass off other people’s work as their own, and gets caught, is a retroactive citation the only consequence? Of course anyone who reads the article now will find my work cited. The corrigendum will perhaps have alerted a few readers of the next print issue to something fishy, and the board of editors may place a question mark over a certain peer. But I’m left wondering whether such breaches of academic integrity typically have minimal consequences. I’ve also realised I was very lucky: I actually found the infraction, was able to prove it, and suffered minimal damage since blog entries, rather than an entire book or paper, were used. From other senior academics I’ve heard far worse cases. One told me about how, as a member of an editorial board, they were presented an article by a professor, which they recognised as work stolen from a PhD student. The student’s luck was that the editor had seen them present this work at a conference. Perhaps the academic pecking order is a contributing factor. Both cases involved senior academics ripping off lesser-known junior scholars. I doubt they would plagiarise another professor’s work so thoughtlessly, for fear of reprisal and reputation loss. Having spoken to colleagues over the years, I’ve gained the impression that the unattributed use of others’ ideas is something widely known and strongly resented, but rarely talked about or openly problematised. In academia, kudos for original analysis should be a key to success, and we need to be forthcoming about acknowledging others’ contributions. A simple plagiarism check should be mandatory for any respectable journal – as it is for student term papers. A few minutes running software could have prevented this entire mess, because my articles were easy to find on the internet. However, I’m not sure about how to fight the more insidious appropriation of juniors’ intellectual labour, as with the professor who submitted the student’s article, or with those who use assistants to do the heavy lifting without acknowledging their work. Perhaps the most practical advice I can give would be to always self-publish: even the most rough-edged working paper, discussion paper, or blog thrown onto the internet is proof that the ideas were yours first.

The women are being advised by the City law firm Mishcon de Reya but other law firms are also understood to be working with BBC employees about pay. Those talking to law firms include presenters whose names were included in the list of top earners published by the BBC. Mishcon is helping them to establish whether the BBC has failed to pay people equally for doing the same job. Legal action could potentially take place through an employment tribunal on sex discrimination or a high court case. There is an urgency to the talks between the BBC and female staff because equal pay claims have to be lodged in the employment tribunal within six months of the discrimination. The BBC’s pay list was published on 19 July, meaning the corporation effectively has until mid-January to resolve disputes. The pay list revealed that just a third of its highest paid on-air stars were women and the top seven were all men. This led to more than 40 of the BBC’s highest-profile female presenters, including Clare Balding, Fiona Bruce and Emily Maitlis, to publicly call for the BBC to ensure equal pay for equal jobs. Some BBC employees are understood to have been frustrated by a series of reviews the corporation published on pay this month. The reports stated that men were being paid 9.3% more than women at the BBC on average – the UK average is 18.1% – and concluded there is “no systemic discrimination against women” at the corporation. The reviews did not include the vast majority of on-air presenters, editors and senior managers. They also found there was a lack of women in senior roles and that in almost one in 10 occasions where there was substantial difference in pay between men and women doing similar jobs, there was no clear reason for the disparity other than gender. Jennifer Millins, a parter in the employment department at Mishcon, said: “The figures from the BBC highlight the need for businesses across all sectors to seriously consider their diversity and makeup. The reputational fallout of any significant pay gaps is likely to be what costs businesses most dearly.” The BBC has pledged to publish a report on the pay of on-air presenters later this year. It has said it is taking equal pay seriously, but also that the issue is complex. Tony Hall, the BBC director general, said this month: “Fairness in pay is vital. We have pledged to close the gender pay gap by 2020 and have targets for equality and diversity on our airwaves. We have done a lot already, but we have more to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/26/paddington-bear-to-front-ms-christmas-advertising-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T14:38:12Z","webTitle":"Paddington Bear to front M&S Christmas advertising campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/26/paddington-bear-to-front-ms-christmas-advertising-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/26/paddington-bear-to-front-ms-christmas-advertising-campaign","fields":{"headline":"Paddington Bear to front M&S Christmas advertising campaign","bodyText":"Marks &amp; Spencer has signed up Paddington Bear for its Christmas advertising campaign.

You spend years working on policy, hammer it into the manifesto, sometimes force it through parliament, then, inevitably, junk it in a cataclysmically embarrassing U-turn. This week’s volte-face was a partial U-turn on the local housing allowance (LHA) cap for supported housing. Plenty of housing professionals had warned that capping the amount of support available for schemes such as sheltered accommodation, women’s refuges and extra-care facilities would mean they would cease to function. Supported housing costs more because it relies on far more than simple bricks and mortar: slashing the money available meant many housing associations announced they would have to mothball plans for such schemes. The announcement that the cap will not be applied to social housing is welcome to those who’ve spoken up about the dangers, but for millions of people in the private rented sector, LHA cuts continue to bite and rents continue to rise. In a recent report by the homelessness charity Shelter, it estimates that by 2020, one million people will have been made homeless by the cuts. The report also warns that the biggest single cause of homelessness right now is when a private tenancy comes to an end. So while this feels like a victory for some, in the long-term the problem remains for millions. As with the removal of the fee for the universal credit phone line , this change by the government is tinkering with a broken system, rather than making the large scale overhaul needed. But it’s also worth examining precisely what the Conservatives have done for housing: very little. The Housing Act has been hollowed out, with U-turn upon U-turn, so that no council or housing association can now categorically say whether the plan to force sales of high value homes and extend right to buy to housing associations will come to fruition. Since the Conservative party conference, the Tories have tried, again and again, to put forward a bold solution to the housing crisis. The sputtering and stalling started with the announcement of the extension of help to buy. Rightly, the press and public pointed out this subsidises developers and artificially inflates house prices, rather than being actively useful. Then, Theresa May announced that she would put £2bn into building homes for affordable rent, only for journalists to do the sums and point out that amount willdeliver only 5,000 homes a year. Now, rumours are swirling that communities and local government secretary, Sajid Javid, is pushing to include a major housebuilding programme in the upcoming budget, causing a rift with chancellor Philip Hammond. We’ve yet to see an announcement from the Tories that hasn’t turned out to be a damp squib, so caution is advised before getting excited about that one. The Conservative problem with housing remains that for many Tory MPs and for their core supporters, the housing crisis has not fully affected them, either because they are private landlords or because they bought when homes were cheap and are now wedded to the ideological belief that they have earned the massive uptick in their assets. But now, even core Tory supporters are being hit. Their children can’t buy or, often, afford to rent, and the housing crisis has massively impacted the turnout of Tory voters under 50. If the party wants a future in government, it will need to attract new, younger voters. Scrapping LHA for social housing may not affect the core Tory vote, but the number of people unable to afford to rent privately might.

In a new assessment of housing need, Sadiq Khan said the pace of construction should increase from 29,000 homes a year to 66,000, adding that 65% of these homes needed to be affordable, far higher than the current rate of 38%. “The housing crisis is a major factor in the high cost of living in the capital, as well as putting home ownership out of the reach of many young Londoners who fear they will never get a foot on the property ladder,” Khan told the Guardian. “In the worst cases, it can affect social cohesion, cause poor health and plunge residents into poverty. I cannot overestimate how terrible a situation we inherited.” City Hall calculates that a new approach will require a major shift in strategy, switching the emphasis from building blocks of luxury apartments in central London to constructing more family housing in the cheaper suburbs. Between 1997 and 2016, London’s population increased by a quarter – an extra 1.7 million people – but only 370,000 homes were added to the stock. One result has been a rise in the number of families sharing with other families, which now affects 470,000 households. The figures are contained in a stark assessment of housing need that will form the basis of the London Plan, a five-year planning strategy due to be published next month. Khan said: “Successive prime ministers have failed to invest anywhere near enough in building new affordable homes. The previous mayor [Boris Johnson] stopped investing in homes for social rent altogether and cut the number of new affordable homes he funded to the lowest level since records began.” Khan revealed that no homes for social rent – the cheapest available – were built in London in the last year of Johnson’s mayoralty. Just 29,000 homes a year of all types were built between 2013-14 and 2015-16. The mayor is using the figures to pile pressure on the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to include in next month’s budget a dramatic increase in state subsidies for affordable housing in the capital from £500m to £2.7bn a year. The new strategy is set to focus on building more homes in outer London and will include a presumption in favour of development on small sites in suburban town centres. Khan is also pushing for greater powers from the government to force unused sites, including public land, into use for housing, including speeding up compulsory purchase orders. Despite City Hall’s assessment that 65% of all new homes must be “affordable” – which Khan defines as being rented for no more than a third of average earnings, or under shared ownership schemes – insiders concede this is unlikely to be possible. Khan is expected to set the target for affordable housing at a more achievable, but still highly ambitious, 50% in the London Plan. There has been a growing anger at the number of luxury developments, especially among people struggling to afford starter homes or to rent cheaply. One totemic example is the 50-storey St George’s Wharf tower beside the river Thames at Vauxhall where two-thirds of homes were last year revealed by the Guardian to be in foreign ownership, with a quarter held through secretive offshore companies based in tax havens. Concern spread to the suburbs earlier this month when it emerged that the London borough of Redbridge had agreed to allow the supermarket firm Sainsbury’s to build 683 homes, only 4% of which are guaranteed to be affordable. Last month, Theresa May announced an extra £2bn for council housing nationwide, but was accused of tinkering when it emerged that it would only result in an extra 5,000 homes a year being built. In common with town halls across the country, Khan is lobbying for councils to be allowed to borrow to invest in homes. The communities secretary, Sajid Javid, said on Sunday that the government might authorise extra public borrowing to fund infrastructure to deliver more housing. According to some reports, his department believes £50bn is needed. However, Hammond told the Commons this was not government policy. Andrew Boff, the Conservative deputy chair of the London assembly’s housing committee, warned that Khan’s approach of increasing the proportion of affordable homes needed in each development was putting developers off building any housing. He believes increasing the whole housing supply would result in lower prices and therefore greater affordability. “He would see more homes built if he had a lower figure for affordable homes,” Boff said. “If you increase the number, the price will go down.“Despite the rhetoric, he has managed to start 20% fewer homes a year than his predecessor after 18 months in office. This directly goes against his promise in his manifesto that each year would be an increase in the number of homes being built.” City Hall insiders point out that this is a result of the low number left in the pipeline by the previous Conservative administration. Jonathan Seager, the executive director of housing at London First, the business lobby group, said: “These new figures show us that the housing crisis is worsening. It is now one of the most serious challenges facing business, preventing firms from recruiting and retaining the talent they need to grow and succeed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/19/the-guardian-view-on-internet-security-complexity-is-vulnerable","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T18:39:37Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on internet security: complexity is vulnerable | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/19/the-guardian-view-on-internet-security-complexity-is-vulnerable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/19/the-guardian-view-on-internet-security-complexity-is-vulnerable","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on internet security: complexity is vulnerable","bodyText":"This week’s security scandal is the discovery that every household with wifi in this country has a network that isn’t really private. For 13 years a weakness has lurked in the supposedly secure way in which wireless networks carry our information. Although the WPA2 security scheme was supposed to be mathematically proven to be uncrackable, it turns out that the mechanism by which it can compensate for weak signals can be compromised, and when that happens it might as well be unencrypted. Practically every router, every laptop and every mobile phone in the world is now potentially exposed. As the Belgian researcher who discovered the vulnerability points out, this could be abused to steal information such as credit card numbers, emails and photos. It is not a catastrophic flaw: the attacker has to be within range of the wifi they are attacking. Most email and chat guarded by end-to-end encryption is still protected from eavesdroppers. But the flaw affects a huge number of devices, many of which will never be updated to address it. Since both ends of a wifi connection need to be brought up to date to be fixed, it is no longer safe to assume that any wifi connection is entirely private. The story is a reminder of just how much we all now rely on the hidden machineries of software engineering in our everyday lives, and just how complex these complexities are. The fact that it took 13 years for this weakness to be found and publicised shows that no one entirely understands the systems that we all now take for granted. Also this week, a flaw was discovered in one of the widely used chips that are supposed to produce the gigantic and completely random numbers which are needed to make strong encryption truly unbreakable. Even the anti-virus systems that many users hope will protect them can be turned inside out. First the Israeli and then the Russian intelligence agencies appear to have penetrated the Russian-made Kaspersky Anti-Virus, a program of the sort which must have access to all the most sensitive information on a computer to perform its functions. And then there are the known unknowns: the devices which most users do not even notice are connected to the net. It is estimated that there will be 21bn things connected to the internet by 2020, from baby monitors and door locks to cars and fridges. Billions of these are unprotected and will remain that way. But this kind of technological failure should not blind us to the real dangers of the digital world, which are social and political. The information about ourselves that we freely give away on social media, or on dating sites, is far more comprehensive, and far more potentially damaging, than anything which could be picked up by a lurking wifi hacker. The leak of millions of user accounts from Equifax, the credit reference agency, is only the most recent example of the plundering of personal information by criminals. Such hacks might be regarded as the outcome of technical wizardry, but are dependent on human shortcomings in recognising and fixing security flaws. Others would be impossible without tricking real users out of their passwords first. In criminal hands, social engineering beats software engineering every time, and the problems of the internet cannot entirely be solved by technical means. Until we design for human nature, no perfection of machinery can save us."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/oct/22/ilya-and-emilia-kabakov-tate-modern-london-review","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T07:00:45Z","webTitle":"Ilya and Emilia Kabakov review – Russia’s great escape artists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/22/ilya-and-emilia-kabakov-tate-modern-london-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/22/ilya-and-emilia-kabakov-tate-modern-london-review","fields":{"headline":"Ilya and Emilia Kabakov review – Russia’s great escape artists","bodyText":"Down a murky corridor hung with old overcoats is a narrow gap in the wall. You stand sardine-tight with your neighbour to see into the cramped chamber beyond. Here the walls are papered with optimistic posters of Soviet life, but the furnishings are abysmal and the floor thick with old rubble. Whoever lived here has gone, leaving nothing but a strange contraption of springs and straps dangling from the roof. Look up and you realise it must be some kind of makeshift ejector, for there is a spectacular hole in the ceiling. The Man Who Flew Into Space from His Apartment is based on the communal Moscow flat where Ilya Kabakov once lived. It is a one-room catharsis. All the deprivation endured by millions of Russians through the 20th century is crowned with an exhilarating vision of escape (and a jab at the Soviet space race too). If only it was not so impossible, this collective dream. Kabakov was born in the former Ukrainian SSR in 1933. He is a poet of a painter, a storyteller of a sculptor and, with his wife, Emilia (born 1945, also in the Ukraine), a pioneer of the total installation. This famous piece, from 1985, grew into a historic masterpiece called Ten Characters, shown when the Kabakovs had managed to emigrate to New York in 1988. Each character had a room in what amounted to two walk-through apartments: the man so short he wanted everybody else to hunch over; the talentless artist who got masses of official work; the tenant who never threw anything away. You can see his cell at Tate Modern, every object labelled and displayed in case he lost the memories associated with a lifetime’s junk, into which he has vanished. Ilya Kabakov is almost as much a writer as an artist. His characters exist in words too, very often in tense monologues hammered out on old typewriters. Madmen from Gogol, as written by Chekhov. Sometimes these people are artists, or would-be artists, like Sedykh, who sees little white men walking around his apartment night and day. He builds a tall glass cabinet strung with wires, in the hope of enticing them to linger long enough to be seen for more than a moment. He succeeds. It’s a marvellous sight: strings of tiny figures, some ascending, some descending, like a modernist vision of the afterlife. Other little men appear throughout the show, dotted in corners, or becoming suddenly visible through telescopes in a darkened chamber apparently glowing with planets. Look closely into outer space, however, and what do you see: a parallel universe of crowded Soviet apartments. This art is tragicomic, and often mordant. Forced to work under a pseudonym in the 1970s, when his art had become too controversial, Ilya Kabakov began to invent alter egos. Most piquant is the official socialist realist painter commissioned to produce thriving scenes of collective farms and modern high-rise cities. Alas the commission falls through and the canvases decline in storage. Years later, to cheer himself up, the artist tries gluing flowers to the pictures and calling them the Holiday series. But the flowers are just fading sweet wrappers that can’t conceal the banality beneath. The result is absurd and yet sinister too, invoking the fate of the many Soviet painters who fell out of favour. Kabakov’s own career as a painter fills many rooms of this enormous show, starting with a self-portrait from 1962 in aviator’s headgear, in which one senses both the tribute and the sardonic rebuke to the sky-high aspirations of the Russian avant garde. It’s not long before his painting turns conceptual. A football player kicks a bright yellow suprematist disc into a halcyon blue expanse above the place name “Uglich”, in 1964; Uglich’s hydroelectric plant was built by starving gulag prisoners: art versus reality. In the 70s he paints text-based parodies of party documents and Soviet literature, as well as Masonite works where nameless faces and objects appear buried beneath the surface. In one work, the objects have broken free. Two builder’s shovels emerge from a realist depiction of a vast construction site. Lettered across the canvas is a long list of all the promised schools and hospitals that will be completed by December 1979. Kabakov’s picture was painted four years later. The shovels are here, and not there; work, by implication, hasn’t even begun. Lately, Ilya Kabakov has been playing games with paintings that fuse trompe-l’oeil collage with Soviet visual cliche. Too many of these canvases weaken a survey – the Kabakovs’ first in this country – which could have been epochal. And although they are geniuses of theatrical mise-en-scene, there are only four large-scale installations here and none of the Kabakov’s magnificent films. Still, even their smallest scenarios are potent. Look down, God-like, into the roofless model of a Russian apartment and you see that all the rooms incorporate doorless toilets. So plausible is this miniature reconstruction that people have asked the artists whether it is some sort of ethnographic record, rather than a metaphor: most Russians live in a toilet. In one cavernous gallery the red tail-lights of a lifesize train give the illusion of departing along tracks disappearing into darkness. We’ve missed the train. Abstract paintings lie shattered along the route, again invoking all those artists purged by Stalin. Soviet horror bleeds into universal nightmare. A glowing sign on the back of the train repeats the show’s title: Not Everyone Will Be Taken Into the Future. And this train has frightening associations with other crimes against humanity. Ilya Kabakov’s mother was Jewish. The show’s centrepiece – its soul – is a tribute to this beloved woman in the form of a labyrinthine corridor, hung with nostalgic photographs of Mother Russia alongside typed extracts from her harrowing autobiography. The contrast between landscape and life – the starvation, antisemitism, homelessness, violence and penury she endured – is shattering. The journey through this dim maze, increasingly narrow, is both melancholy and profoundly compelling, until at last you come upon the source of the low requiem that fills the air. Or so you think. For the cramped cell at the heart of this apartment is empty too. All that’s left is an old cleaner’s broom. • Ilya and Emilia Kabakov: Not Everyone Will Be Taken Into the Future is at Tate Modern, London, until 28 January"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/oct/26/columbus-crew-move-austin-texas-mls","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T08:30:00Z","webTitle":"Where can an owner move their football club 1,000 miles on a whim?

America","bodyText":"Coming off the United States’ failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, Major League Soccer fans needed good news. What they got instead was a blindside. Last week, Sports Illustrated’s Grant Wahl published a story detailing how Anthony Precourt, the California-based owner of Columbus Crew since 2013, had plans to move the team to Austin, Texas, over 1,000 miles away, in 2019. The stated purpose was to force the city of Columbus, Ohio, into giving the club a sweetheart tax deal on a new stadium in a downtown location. But the language of a press release from Columbus’ front office made the move sound like a done deal. In the release Precourt said that “despite our investments and efforts, the current course is not sustainable”. MLS Commissioner Don Garber doesn’t seem keen to stop any move either. “Crew SC is near the bottom of the League in all business metrics and the club’s stadium is no longer competitive with other venues across MLS,” he said in a statement. “The league is very reluctant to allow teams to relocate, but based on these factors, we support PSV’s efforts to explore options outside of Columbus, including Austin, provided they find a suitable stadium.” The surprise nature of the announcement is unusual for owners attempting to stay in their city, as they often encourage fans to influence their legislators to push a deal favorable to the club along. (On Tuesday, the mayor of Columbus revealed he had reached out to Precourt and Garber for meetings exploring options to keep the Crew in Columbus, which both accepted. The meetings are to take place in the coming weeks.) The thought of one of MLS’s founding clubs suddenly moving rattled the fans in the Nordecke, the supporters group coalition for the Crew. The Nordecke called for a #SavetheCrew Rally and they have enjoyed broad support from fans across the league. It’s easy to see why the developments may scare fans of other clubs, who could find themselves in a similar situation one day. Season ticket holders who wish to claim a refund will be able to do so until 3 November at 5pm ET. The faithful who are able to overcome the betrayal to attend a game in Austin would find themselves facing a 36-hour road trip or a $250, four-hour flight with at least one layover. The news is remarkable for a team that was dominant from the mid- to late-2000s under the ownership of the Hunt Family. From 2004 to 2009 they won three Supporters’ Shields, and added an MLS Cup to a Shield in 2008 for a double. There has been success more recently too. Since Precourt took over, the Crew made the 2015 MLS Cup final, where they lost 2-1 to the Portland Timbers. This season, they finished fifth in the Eastern Conference and made the playoffs. While Columbus’s Mapfre Stadium, the supposed focus of Precourt’s decision to move is hardly Camp Nou, it was only built in 1999. And the stadium is something of a sacred site. It was the first soccer-specific-stadium in MLS history and laid out a blueprint for financial feasibility, leading the league out of situations in which teams played in huge, largely empty, NFL arenas. It is also the home of arguably the most memorable matches in US soccer history. After losses to Mexico in the US to largely pro-Mexico crowds, US Soccer took a chance on the stadium and the city’s ability to sell out the game in frigid temperatures for a true home field advantage. The result was the beginning of a US soccer legend, a string of four World Cup Qualifiers against Mexico that ended as 2-0 victories, entering the phrase “Dos a Cero” into American Soccer fans’ lexicon. Of course, teams moving in US sports is by no means new. In the past two years in the NFL alone, the Rams have relocated from St Louis to Los Angeles, the Chargers from San Diego to Los Angeles, and the Raiders will move from Oakland to Las Vegas. The NBA also moved the SuperSonics from Seattle to Oklahoma City in 2008, and rebranded them as the Thunder. And the MLS itself has moved the San Jose Earthquakes to Houston and changed their name to the Dynamo after the end of the 2005 season, but San Jose would gain its team back in time to begin play in 2008 as part of MLS expansion. It’s easy to see why Precourt wants to move. According to Forbes, Crew are valued at $130m, lower than any other MLS franchise. A move to Austin, one of the United States’ fastest growing cities – and a city without an NBA, NFL, NHL or MLB team – would instantly boost its valuation. There’s no guarantee that there’s an appetite for an MLS team in the college sports crazed city where the University of Texas Longhorns reign supreme. But maybe it doesn’t matter, and Precourt is looking to pull a move similar to Dean Spanos, who is said to have upped the value of his Chargers team by a minimum of $500m simply by moving his team from San Diego to the more attractive market of Los Angeles despite their failure to properly fill the Stubhub Center, where the Los Angeles Galaxy are the primary tenants. Perhaps MLS felt insulated from this as part of soccer, where team moves are so rare that almost everybody who follows soccer knows the name of MK Dons for the club’s 2003 move from Wimbledon to Milton Keyes. Or perhaps it’s because MLS has always seemed progressive, if only because its fans have been. It’s not uncommon to go to a match and see an assortment of flags in the supporters sections championing LGBT Pride, Black Lives Matter, and other progressive movements. While some stadiums have removed these flags, the enforcement of what qualifies as too political seems to be left up to the front offices of the clubs themselves. Notably, MLS was home to the first openly gay professional athlete playing on the field in the US, Robbie Rogers. Now MLS has made it clear that it supports progressive values only as far as they help their checkbook. And maybe soccer fans should have seen it coming. The MLS owners have continued an American tradition, despite overwhelming evidence publicly funded stadiums are a poor investment, as John Oliver memorably explained. The backlash against public funding has caused MLS its own headaches for stadiums that aren’t using tax cuts. Miami has been slow to warm to David Beckham’s forever-coming-soon team despite a private-funding promise after the nightmare of Marlins’ Ballpark financing. In that instance, Miami-Dade County pitched in $500m to construct that stadium, money they took loans out to get and will eventually cost the county billions. Even deals that are in the team’s favor don’t alway ensure compliance down the road. In the years following the opening of Red Bull Arena, the Red Bull organization failed to pay dues on land that the small town of Harrison, New Jersey, had purchased for them at the cost of $40m to the town. Millions of dollars in back taxes were owed, and a compromise came years later. The area’s regeneration that Red Bull promised is still incomplete with empty lots dotting the landscape around the stadium. With all this history, there’s a sense of inevitability to the Crew’s story. The Crew fans will protest, MLS fans everywhere will join in. The city of Columbus won’t and shouldn’t give in, and in all likelihood, the move to Austin was finished before fans knew about it. FC Cincinnati – who average crowds of more than 20,000 in the second-tier USL – will likely be one of the league’s next expansion choices, and Garber will offer that as an MLS “return” to Ohio. And eventually the league will feel like that’s the way it always was. But the era of innocence in MLS will be over."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/19/donald-trump-john-kelly-military-deaths","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T21:05:05Z","webTitle":"Emotional John Kelly lashes out at Trump critics over military deaths","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/19/donald-trump-john-kelly-military-deaths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/19/donald-trump-john-kelly-military-deaths","fields":{"headline":"Emotional John Kelly lashes out at Trump critics over military deaths","bodyText":"The White House chief of staff, John Kelly, has delivered an extraordinary rebuke to critics of Donald Trump’s interactions with the families of fallen US military heroes. Kelly made an unannounced appearance at the White House podium on Thursday afternoon amid an unprecedented feud between Trump and Frederica Wilson, a Democratic congresswoman who overheard the president tell the widow of Sgt La David Johnson that her husband “knew what he signed up for” before he was killed on duty in Niger. Breaking years of silence over the death of his own son in Afghanistan, Kelly said he was “broken-hearted” by the politicization of troops who died on the battlefield. “It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation, absolutely stuns me,” said Kelly, while adding he was so incensed by the episode that he “walked among the stones” at Arlington national cemetery for an hour and a half on Wednesday. “I thought at least that was sacred … but it [was] eroded a great deal yesterday by the selfish behavior of a member of Congress.” Kelly, however, he failed to acknowledge that this week’s furor began when Trump launched an unprompted attack on his predecessors Barack Obama and George W Bush over their outreach to bereaved military families. Kelly went on to offer a protracted justification for what he said was Trump’s attempt to offer his condolences to Johnson’s wife, Myeshia. Kelly said there was “no perfect way to make that phone call”. Also on Thursday, in a sign of a possible fight ahead over the ambush in Niger, which left four US soldiers dead, Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Senate armed services committee, said he might consider issuing a subpoena because the White House had not been forthcoming with details of what happened. “It may require a subpoena,” McCain said when asked what steps his committee might need to take to determine what happened to the four troops. Questioned about what information the committee still needed, he said: “Everything.” Asked whether the White House had been forthcoming with the information the committee needed, he added: “Of course not.” Kelly, recounting the day when he was informed of his son’s death, recalled his close friend Gen Joseph Dunford arriving at his doorstep. Dunford had told him his son “was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed”, Kelly recalled. “He knew what he was getting into by joining that 1% [who serve in uniform],” Kelly said, seeking to convey the nuance lacking in Trump’s own reaction to the controversy. “He knew what the possibilities were, because we’re at war.” Kelly added: “That’s what the president tried to say to the four families the other day.” Describing Trump as “brave” for making the calls, Kelly said the president had sought his counsel on how to handle them. Kelly said he told the president that those who were not family, had never worn the uniform, and who did not serve, “can’t even imagine how to make that call”. Wilson was not alone in her interpretation of the call. Johnson’s mother also took issue with Trump’s tone, telling reporters on Wednesday: “President Trump did disrespect my son and my daughter and also me and my husband.” Trump claimed this week that former presidents did not contact the families of fallen troops. In particular, Trump said Obama did not call Kelly after his son Robert was killed in Afghanistan in 2010. Trump’s remark prompted former Obama administration officials to reveal that six months after his son’s death, Kelly and his wife had been invited to a White House breakfast for bereaved Gold Star military families and sat at Michelle Obama’s table. Kelly confirmed on Wednesday that he had not received a call from Obama, but clarified that presidents did not always reach out by phone to grieving families and often chose instead to write letters. “That was not a criticism,” Kelly said of Obama. “That’s not a negative thing.” A visibly emotional Kelly focused his initial comments on what happens when a service member dies, explaining in heart-wrenching detail the process of bringing the body home and notifying the next of kin. “I appeal to America – let’s try to keep that sacred,” he said. However, he became increasingly angry as he deplored the politicization of military deaths. Although speaking from personal experience, Kelly was undeniably operating simultaneously as the White House chief of staff – cleaning up a political mess created by his boss. He proceeded to take questions only from reporters who personally knew Gold Star families, telling the room an investigation into the attack in Niger was under way. “The fact is they need to find out what happened and why it happened,” Kelly said, before reverting back to his role as a retired four-star marine general by concluding his remarks with a plea to members of the media. “Understand there’s tens of thousands of America’s kids, mostly, doing the nation’s bidding,” Kelly said, observing that unlike in his day, when there was a draft, those serving today were doing so by choice. “They don’t have to be in uniform. These young people today, they don’t do it for any other reason than their sense of selfless devotion.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/31/heather-the-totality-review-matthew-weiner-thrilling-nihilism","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-31T10:00:13Z","webTitle":"Heather, the Totality by Matthew Weiner review – thrilling nihilism from Mad Men creator","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/31/heather-the-totality-review-matthew-weiner-thrilling-nihilism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/31/heather-the-totality-review-matthew-weiner-thrilling-nihilism","fields":{"headline":"Heather, the Totality by Matthew Weiner review – thrilling nihilism from Mad Men creator","bodyText":"In an interview a few years ago, Matthew Weiner said that, as a child growing up in a bibliophile family, he “always thought” he would be a novelist. Though his route to this destination has been unusually roundabout – first, there was the small matter of becoming a screenwriter and creating the hit TV series Mad Men – he has finally got there, aged 52. Heather, the Totality may be a slender work (technically more novella than novel), but it packs an impressive amount of drama and excitement into its 138 pages. A bleakly elegant tale of ennui and class envy, it reads – perhaps not altogether surprisingly – less like a novice effort than the work of a highly accomplished fabulator. Mark and Karen Breakstone are a couple from Manhattan who meet, and get married, “a little late in life”. He works in an unspecified area of finance (which, not irrelevantly, gives him the “potential to be rich”); she has a job in publicity that she is only too glad to be rid of. While theirs is a not entirely cynical union, Weiner makes it plain that the emotions involved aren’t earth-shattering. Karen nearly calls off the wedding when Mark is passed over for a promotion, but eventually reconciles herself: “She knew that what she had come to know as love had become love when she was around him.” Mark, less convolutedly, considers Karen “beautiful” and thinks he will “never tire of having sex with her” – a realisation he takes “very seriously”. Time passes rapidly in Heather, the Totality. Whole years and even decades are swept up in its rigorously honed paragraphs. Mark and Karen have a baby – Heather – and she becomes their all-consuming focus. (They are a couple with few friends or social aspirations, despite their steadily increasing affluence.) Weiner captures well the way that this shared infatuation gradually gnaws away at their contentment. (If, as a parent, your love for your child is partly a compensation for other failures, this can unleash its own destructive dynamics.) As Mark and Karen slide joylessly into middle age – him continuing to get passed over at work, her finding little beyond the minutiae of her daughter’s life to absorb her – Heather increasingly functions as a kind of marital tug-ball, a repository of her parents’ frustration and bitterness. She becomes, as the title suggests, “the totality” of their existence. Despite being set in the present day, this is a novel that owes much atmospherically to those American works of the 1960s – notably Richard Yates’s Revolutionary Road and John Williams’s Stoner – that treat family life, and especially marriage, as one unfolding catastrophe. Weiner complicates matters, however, by introducing a more noirish element: a subplot about an amoral and dangerous young man named Bobby, who becomes entangled in the narrative when he gets a job as a construction worker at the Breakstones’ apartment block. In some ways, Bobby’s presence makes sense: he allows Weiner to set up thematic contrasts (poverty v privilege, anarchy v order), and the crush he develops on Heather helps move the plot along. Nonetheless, I found him psychologically unconvincing, and Weiner himself seems unsure at times whether Bobby is a real character or more of a figurative projection of Mark and Karen’s marital woes. Yet overall, this novel captivates, despite the grimness of its preoccupations. Weiner has a knack for writing sentences that grab and grip, and he knows a lot about pacing and structure. Although it has none of Mad Men’s surface glamour, Heather, the Totality offers its readers a not dissimilar pleasure: that of an addictive, even thrilling, nihilism. • Heather, the Totality by Matthew Weiner is published by Canongate (£14.99).

Five minutes from the end of a Europa League encounter that scored higher on atmosphere than intrigue, Arsenal produced the game’s defining moment and for a few seconds the sound cut completely as the home crowd took in the blow. What a blow it was. The move of the night was carved out by Jack Wilshere, who changed gear to burst into dangerous space and exchanged passes with Theo Walcott, who picked out Olivier Giroud. It had been one of those nights where Arsenal’s hulking frontman looked a bit tortured, nothing going for him, touches astray, movement on the leaden side. But in that moment he adjusted his body to send an overhead kick arcing into the net. Giroud’s status as a great goalscorer has been a source of debate over the years but he sure is capable of scoring a great goal. The finish was glossed with spectacular flourish. Arsène Wenger chuckled afterwards as he confessed that Giroud had come over to the dugout during the game with a special message. “He came to the touchline and told me: ‘We will score.’ He knew more than I did. That’s Olivier Giroud. He keeps belief when it is tough. That’s why he scores at moments you didn’t expect him to score.” The Europa League is fast turning into a tonic for Arsenal. While the Premier League slips create fretful anxiety, this competition has been an escape of sorts. Giroud’s matchwinner ensured a maximum nine points out of nine and they hold a five-point lead halfway through the group stage. Next month they play the return game with Red Star. Another win would see them safely qualified with two games to spare. Resting key players with wholesale rotation can backfire, but so far Arsenal’s B-siders have proved able to enjoy the Europa experience. All in all they handled a tricky night well. Wenger had tried to brush off the atmosphere effect, suggesting his team were used to a similar ambience in the Premier League. But this was no run of the mill vibe. The Marakana, packed an hour before kick-off, crackled with energy, the colourful choreography and bouncing fans shuddering behind the goal as the teams emerged and the decibels never dropped. If the Emirates is a smart and boring uncle, the Marakana was like a punk cousin turning up the attitude. It was a night for cojones, to borrow the word of the week. Arsenal’s hotchpotch side, with a handful of kids and experienced fringe players thrown together, settled admirably enough. The defensive compilation was on the eclectic side. Rob Holding had unfamiliar partners in Mohamed Elneny, a midfielder by trade, and Mathieu Debuchy, a full-back who has been injured for most of the past two and a half years. In the circumstances, reappearing all of a sudden after so long away from first-team football, the Frenchman found an impressive performance that potentially gives Wenger another defensive option. “I am pleased for him, he survived 90 minutes without any setbacks,” the manager said. “He had only one half with under-23s on Monday night. Overall it’s a positive performance for someone who has been out for such a long time.” Wenger was also particularly pleased with how the teenagers on show rose to handle the test. “They showed a lot of character. It’s not easy to express that at 18. To play in such a heated atmosphere shows how much resistance to stress they have, which is an important quality at this level.” Interestingly, the sense of occasion got to Red Star. At times they were almost overenthusiastic and as they bounded into the box they had a tendency to be too breathless to make cool decisions. Turning gallons of desire into the hard currency of shots on target was the challenge, and it was unfortunate for them that they came up against Petr Cech in dominant form. The Czech goalkeeper made an excellent save to deny Nemanja Radonjic’s slammed shot, and late in the game kept out two more promising Red Star efforts. Arsenal were wasteful, too, until Giroud’s late intervention. Although the striker took the grandest bow, Wilshere’s enterprise and eye for a killer pass again shone. Wenger said that the midfielder is edging closer and closer to inclusion in the first string. “He will get a chance in the Premier League, don’t worry for that. At the moment it is going that way. He got a big kick in first half on his ankle but managed to get through the 90 minutes. Games of that intensity will help him a lot.” Late on Milan Rodic was sent off for a second bookable offence when he caught Francis Coquelin in the face with a stray arm. Vladan Milojevic, the Red Star coach, felt it was a game-changer and reckoned he sees worse in the Premier League without punishment. The 10 men could do nothing to stop Giroud making the most important noise of the night."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/nov/01/by-the-skin-of-his-teeth-learning-to-walk-again-without-health-insurance","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-01T09:00:13Z","webTitle":"By the skin of his teeth: a bull rider learns to walk again without insurance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/01/by-the-skin-of-his-teeth-learning-to-walk-again-without-health-insurance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/nov/01/by-the-skin-of-his-teeth-learning-to-walk-again-without-health-insurance","fields":{"headline":"By the skin of his teeth: a bull rider learns to walk again without insurance","bodyText":"In the weeks after professional bull rider Joseph Dewey suffered an injury that left him paralyzed from the waist down, an outpouring of support kept him buoyed above the undertow of hopelessness and despair. A friend set up a GoFundMe page to help pay his mortgage and care for his family, while another threw a benefit to provide money for costly leg braces. Prayer and encouragement flowed fast in those days and steeled his spirit, so much that when doctors informed him he’d never walk again, Dewey – a stubborn cowboy and a Christian – replied “You don’t know the God that I know,” and pointed them to the door. Now two years after his injury, Dewey is without health insurance. After being dropped by one provider while he was still riding, he relied on Oklahoma’s state Medicaid program to pay for his hospitalization and treatment, only to have it cancelled and denied once it was up for renewal. Dewey says the reason was that his income was too high, even though the previous year, before receiving disability, he’d earned far below the federal poverty level. (The monthly income limit for the type of Medicaid he used is $2,111 for one single adult, which he says is far higher than what he was earning.) Plans under Obamacare, he was told, were also out of his reach: his income was too low. And although he qualified for another state plan called Insure Oklahoma, which offers subsidies to low-income people who fall between the gaps, Dewey had no way of knowing about it. Navigating the confusing system from his smartphone, with no internet connection at home, all he managed to find was a private plan for $250 a month, which he couldn’t afford. * * * Oklahoma has one of the highest uninsured rates in the nation, some 14% of its residents, second only to Texas. It’s also one of 19 states that has refused to expand Medicaid to the poor under the Affordable Care Act. Premiums are some of the highest in the country. Online, different websites lead to a tangle of private plans with seemingly conflicting prices and information. The result is a Byzantine system much like the rest of US healthcare that’s daunting to residents like Dewey, who often don’t know where to turn for advice. After hitting the wall again and again, Dewey eventually grew so frustrated that he gave up trying. Without coverage, he stopped going to his weekly therapy sessions that were vital to his rehab. It’s been seven months since his last visit. Ever since his accident, doctors and therapists warned Dewey about his two-year window of recovery. After a year, only 2% of people with spinal cord injuries like his regain basic motor function. Each year that follows, the window closes even more. And rehab can be crucial to becoming one of that 2%. “Joseph would definitely benefit from continued therapy,” said Kelly Clifton, the aquatic therapist who once worked with Dewey. “But what people do on their own also matters a lot. Motivation is key to the healing process.” So Dewey, who’s 26, does what roughly 28 million other Americans who don’t have health coverage do when faced with long-term illness and injury: he guts it out on his own. Each morning before dawn, Dewey wages a private and fevered battle to walk again using his own DIY devices: a $35-a-month gym membership and his carbon-fiber wheelchair, which he uses to “run” through the streets of Blanchard until the point of exhaustion – a friend’s Facebook page shows Dewey’s blister-gnarled hands. And inside his single-wide trailer on the outskirts of town, he drills on a set of homemade parallel bars, pushing legs to move that had once danced in sync with 1,800-pound beasts. A battery of supplements help combat atrophy and bone loss, while a pencil-marked Bible fends off the depression that carries with it more wreckage than any bucking bull. Little by little, Dewey says his regimen is working. Neural roadblocks are being breached, allowing sensation to pass through: hot and cold, the brush of his dog against his leg. Each week is a celebration of small, minuscule victories. With only his disability benefits and a meager income from working as an artist, Dewey often struggles to get by. It helps to stay focused on the bigger picture. “This is my mission in life,” he says. “It’s also my greatest blessing.” * * * To hear Dewey tell it, a lifetime of being thrown from bulls might be the best preparation for learning to get up and walk again. For it takes a certain level of toughness to endure that much punishment and keep coming back. And in towns like Blanchard, toughness is a virtue in a child. In a place where rodeos often outdraw Friday night football, no one looks askance when an eight-year-old kid mounts an animal eight times his weight and nods his head “go”. Anyway, it was Dewey’s grandmother who put him up to it; he was too big to ride sheep. The junior bull dispatched the boy in one second flat, leaving him with a mouthful of dirt and head pulsing with adrenaline. By 15, he was a journeyman on the junior rodeo circuit. Around that time, he met Cody Webster, a cowboy his age who lived in nearby Wayne. Webster was earning his reputation bullfighting, an equally dangerous sport that entails protecting the rider once they get thrown, usually by slapping the bull between the eyes and running like hell. The two of them began rodeoing together across four states, home-schooling to better travel on the fly. In 2013, at age 22, Dewey joined the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association and hit the big leagues. For his debut in Lake City, Florida, he paid the entry fee and drew a bull named “Highly Favored”, which let him go seven seconds before crushing him against the chute gate. Out $95, he drove 24 hours back to Blanchard nursing three broken ribs. A year earlier in Rush Springs, a bull had stepped on his humerus and snapped the bone in half, leaving his arm dangling. In Kellyville, another had pounced on his chest and cracked his sternum, collapsing both lungs. There was also the concussion in Guthrie, one of many, two cracked vertebrae in Wayne, the broken jaw in Jones, and a fractured wrist at a rodeo he can no longer remember. A year after turning pro, he experienced a bad scare in Medicine Park when a bull knocked him unconscious for nearly a minute and mauled his limp body. Bullfighters managed to pull him free and got him to his feet. He spat teeth as he wobbled back to the gate and had to be medevacked to a hospital. The massive concussion kept him in bed for two weeks. * * * Back in 2012, Dewey became a father. His fiancee’s health insurance through her job covered their son. And now that Dewey had more responsibility, he got his own plan, which covered many of his injuries with little question. That’s because Dewey listed his profession as “construction worker” when he’d signed up. Which was true – in between rodeos, Dewey worked for his grandfather’s roofing and remodeling company. But after the helicopter ride from Medicine Park, the company “started piecing things together and said I was too accident prone”, he says. They sent him a letter terminating his coverage. The hospital bill for $40,000 eventually destroyed his credit. Meanwhile, Dewey’s top row of molars, or what remained of them, looked as if someone had cracked them with a hammer and chisel – the poor choice of having used bubble gum instead of a mouthpiece. Once he could get out of bed without puking, he found a cheap dentist on Google who pulled them for $1,000 cash. In early September 2015, after winning second place at a rodeo in Texas, something didn’t feel right. “I felt like something was missing, that maybe that part of my life was done,” he says. Already fatherhood and his battered body had led him to start considering other careers. His grandfather had recently retired and given Dewey the family construction business. In addition, a hobby of sketching rodeo scenes had grown more serious. People were now commissioning portraits and offering real money. But still, was Dewey ready to quit riding? “I remember praying that night, telling God that I didn’t think bullriding was what I was supposed to be doing any more,” he says. “I prayed for His will to be done. But I also remember saying, ‘God, I don’t need to get hurt to let this go.’” * * * Two weeks later, Dewey was playing paintball at his friend Cody Webster’s ranch near Wayne. He was climbing down from a tall blackjack oak when a branch, 30 feet up, snapped and sent him hurtling toward the ground. He landed square on his back, buckled over the lip of a creek. His eyes filled with terror as he looked at Webster, standing nearby. “I can’t feel my legs.” A medevac chopper picked him up in a pasture and rushed him to OU Medical Center in Norman. X-rays revealed a broken L1 vertebrae that severed the flow of blood to his spinal cord. The result was complete and permanent paralysis from the waist down. After 15 years of riding bulls, breaking nearly every bone in his body except for his legs, Joseph Dewey met his Waterloo by falling out of a tree. He spent three weeks in ICU and another month doing inpatient therapy. Dewey had no health insurance when he arrived at the hospital, so a counselor enrolled him in Oklahoma’s Medicaid program, SoonerCare, that covers “medically necessary” procedures for residents who need assistance. To his doctors and therapists, Dewey was mulish and obstinate, refusing to believe their lies. A custom wheelchair? I’ll be walking before you can deliver it, he told them. Webster’s wife Ashley started the crowdfunding page that raised over $15,000 to help pay the bills. When Dewey maxed out his Medicaid coverage for outpatient therapy and needed $4,000 leg braces, also not covered, Webster – by then a renowned bullfighter – hosted a barrel-racing event and auctioned off memorabilia to raise thousands more. Webster and his father also built Dewey’s parallel bars, welding together the lengths of pipe. But the confidence he showed in the hospital withered once he got home. His tiny trailer felt like a cell. He had no skills to navigate the hopelessness that seized him, no vocabulary to describe the despair, so he chose to say nothing. For three months, he hardly spoke at all. “As a bull rider you’re used to your body breaking down and having to build back up,” he says. “But this was an emotional and spiritual breakdown that was very difficult to recover from. Most mornings, I just woke up and cried.” At his lowest point, he turned to his faith. He began spending hours reading his Bible and meditating in prayer, negotiating with God as one does in the wilderness. Little by little, the depression loosened its grip and he found the tools to move on. Being paralyzed was to be humbled before the Lord. And believing that he could walk again, that he could be healed, was God’s ultimate test of his faith. “When I finally realized that this was a blessing rather than the end of my life, things changed,” he says. “And now I had to find who I really was beneath that identity.” Soon after starting his regimen, he said, his legs began responding to pressure and touch. He could feel discomfort, such as when he sat the wrong way. At his weekly aquatic therapy sessions in the pool, loosed from gravity, he could even walk with a little help, shuffle from side to side, and for a brief hour, be a man who stood on his own two feet. At the same time, word of mouth was spreading about Dewey’s artwork. It had mostly been a hobby, drawing portraits of rodeo cowboys, matadors, and other western themes. People paid $400 for the drawings, which often took him two weeks to complete. A few months after the accident, he had enough commissions to work as a full-time artist. Last September, Dewey finally got approved for government disability – he now receives a monthly check for $750. Coupled with the small income from his artwork, it’s barely enough to pay bills and help support his son. After losing insurance, he scraped bottom to continue swim therapy, paying $130 out of pocket for each session. But the cost, plus the gas to Oklahoma City, became too much. In March, he stopped going. “The whole process of finding a plan just got to be overwhelming,” he says. “In the end, I just cut my losses. I figured I could rehab on my own.” * * * A few weeks ago, Dewey and his son were eating in a restaurant when he felt the boy kicking him under the table. “I sure wish you’d stop that,” he told him. The boy’s eyes grew wide. “Dad, you can feel!” Losing his therapy has pushed Dewey even harder. His workouts are more intense and leave his legs feeling exhausted. Whenever he’s in town, Webster joins Dewey for workouts and says his friend’s drive has never wavered. “We’ve always had to do things on our own, the cowboy way,” Webster says. “Dewey’s the hardest-working guy I know. There ain’t a doubt in my mind that he’ll be back up and walking.” Dewey now travels to local rodeos to give his testimony. He explains how God took him away from bullriding to use him for something greater, took the blinders from his eyes and made him see what was truly important. And while he’s at peace with his journey, he still holds out for that one miracle, when God is finally done using him and tells him to get up and walk. I tell Dewey a similar story about a boarder who once lived with my great-grandparents. He was a soldier who’d been shot in the back during the war and was paralyzed. Shortly after arriving, my great-grandfather Clem, an old prayer warrior, drove him to their Pentecostal church and began laying on hands, the congregation backing him up with fire. At one point, it happened – the soldier stood up, kicked away his chair, and began to walk. That night he refused to sleep, just paced the floor muttering a steam of hallelujahs. Miracles already come to Dewey in dreams. “There’s one where I’m in my chair and it just hits me,” he says. “I can walk! So I stand up and start walking, just like that.” In another, he’s walking through a cafe and seeing the world again at his full height. His legs are robust and steady. In each dream, there isn’t a bull in sight.

In fact, diversity is even worse","bodyText":"In 2010, I submitted freedom of information requests to every Oxbridge college to get to grips with the reality of access to these elite institutions, away from whatever spin is written in a prospectus or on admissions pages online. The picture that the data painted was of two institutions that are wholly unrepresentative of the country at large and taking the overwhelming majority of their students from a small, privileged minority in the south of England. I have repeated this exercise to see what – if any – progress Oxbridge has made in improving access and I am afraid that very little has changed. If anything, things have got worse. Seven years ago, both Oxford and Cambridge granted 79% of offers to children in the top two social classes – the sons and daughters of barristers, doctors and chief executives – a figure that rose to 82% and 81% respectively in 2015. There are more offers made to students from one school – Eton – than students on free school meals across the whole country. Only one in four Cambridge colleges made offers to black British students in every year between 2010 and 2015. Of those, many made just one or two offers apiece. And each year over that period, a quarter of colleges failed to make any offers at all to black British applicants. After rejecting multiple FoI requests, Oxford only begrudgingly provided the data showing how many offers each college made to students from ethnic minority backgrounds on Thursday. Oxford had originally rejected my FoI request for fear of inadvertently revealing students’ identities, which tells its own story about how many ethnic minority students are offered a place at Oxford. During this period, an average of 378 black students per year got 3 A grades or better at A-levels. With this degree of disproportionately against black students, it is time to ask the question of whether there is systematic bias. The geographic divide is especially shocking. At a time when London and the south-east represent a bigger share of our national economic output than at any other point in our history, Oxford made more offers to applicants from five of the home counties (Surrey, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Kent and Oxfordshire) than the whole of the north of England. At Cambridge, applicants from eight areas in the south of England received almost 5,000 offers, whereas students in eight local authority areas across the Midlands, the north and Wales received just eight. Richmond sent eight times as many students to Oxford as Salford, Middlesbrough, Hartlepool, Blackpool and Stoke combined. Applicants from Fulham were four times more likely to get into Cambridge than their contemporaries living at the other end of the District line in Barking. Oxford and Cambridge are national universities, the recipients of more than £800m of taxpayers’ money each year – paid for by people in every city, town and village; yet the government demands nothing in return. If Oxbridge can’t crack this, why should the taxpayer continue to foot the bill? The seaside towns and “left behind” former industrial heartlands that voted for Brexit are almost invisible when it comes to who is offered a place to study at our most fabled seats of learning. Is it any wonder that there is a deepening sense of detachment from the political class and the establishment across swathes of our country? Oxbridge are quick to blame everyone but themselves – it is the schools that aren’t good enough, or the teachers that don’t encourage their students to apply. Or it is simply the fact that the talent is not there in under-represented parts of the country and our society. None of these excuses stand up to scrutiny. In 2011, 103 state-educated students in Sunderland got 3 A grades or better at A-levels, yet only four offers of a place at Oxbridge were made to applicants from Sunderland. Over the course of four years (2011-14 inclusive), 851 students in Wigan got 3 As or better – so why did only 29 get offered a place to study at Oxbridge in that same period? The underprivileged kid from a state school in Sunderland who gets straight As is almost certainly more talented than their contemporary with the same grades at a top public school – they far outshine their peers and would benefit most from an Oxbridge education. Oxbridge currently flag contextualised data that shows an applicant is from a low-performing school or postcodes that traditionally have low levels of progression to higher education. What do they do with this data to support such applications? It is unclear how this contextual data is being put to any meaningful use. Oxbridge should follow the lead of top colleges in the US who are proud to be “needs-blind” and routinely give weight to an applicant’s class rank to ensure that talented young people who have succeeded against the odds are recognised. Oxbridge should be taking the initiative and writing to every single student who gets 3 As in August each year, encouraging them to defer their university place if they have one and apply to Oxbridge, as well as students getting straight As at GCSE and AS-level. One in five Harvard students are from families with an income less than the national average and they pay nothing for their studies. Yale employs staff in every single state to connect with talented but hard-to-reach students who may lack the confidence or support networks to apply to the Ivy League. Excluding bursaries, Oxbridge are spending around £10m a year on outreach. It’s clear that whatever they’re doing isn’t working. Placing admissions in the hands of a college system prevents any real progress. It is all well and good for the university to sign an agreement with the Office for Fair Access and make worthy commitments to widen access, but in reality the admissions process is run by over 70 autonomous colleges. While some colleges are doing great things, many appear to be fiefdoms of privilege, the last bastions of the old school tie with admission dependent on highly subjective interviews overseen by academics recruiting in their own image. It is time to move away from the highly subjective college-based system and centralise admissions. Is it really any wonder that the elite is in crisis, fatally out of touch with the people it purports to serve, when the Oxford colleges that educated the last prime minister, the chancellor of the exchequer, the foreign secretary and the health secretary – Brasenose, University, Balliol and Magdalen – still draw over 80% of their students from the top two social classes? Cambridge is doing much better when it comes to the proportions of state school and privately educated students, yet Christ Church, Oxford, alma mater of 13 prime ministers, draws more than half of its students from private schools in a country where just 7% are privately educated. We know what works – Lady Margaret Hall, headed by former Guardian editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger, has launched a foundation year and all but one of the first cohort of students were offered a full place. If there is money for after-dinner port then there is money for foundation years, and let’s not forget that Oxbridge are sitting on endowments worth well more than £11bn. For as long as an Oxbridge degree is the golden ticket to a job in our top professions, its opaque admissions process will determine who the next generation of cabinet ministers, high court judges and newspaper editors will be. It is right and proper that our top universities are elite. But for too long they have been allowed to be elitist as well, drawing up the ladder to success underneath them and reinforcing centuries of entrenched privilege. • David Lammy is Labour MP for Tottenham and the former minister for higher education"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/nov/02/country-diary-mighty-oaks-and-many-many-doomed-acorns","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-02T05:30:46Z","webTitle":"Country diary: mighty oaks and many, many, doomed acorns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/02/country-diary-mighty-oaks-and-many-many-doomed-acorns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/nov/02/country-diary-mighty-oaks-and-many-many-doomed-acorns","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: mighty oaks and many, many, doomed acorns","bodyText":"This wood was last clear-felled in 1799, then replanted with beech and oak. Silver birch, horse chestnut, sycamore and holly have since found their own way in. On the southern slopes the oldest trees, straight-trunked with lofty crowns, tower above the understorey like the pillars and vaulted roof of a cathedral, inspiring a sense of reverence. The raised voice of a distant dog-walker seemed almost like sacrilege, breaking the stillness of a tranquil afternoon. I sat on a fallen branch under an oak, to listen to the sounds of the woodland. A breeze, stirring the canopy, sent a gentle rain of leaves spinning down. I could hear the “clonk” of falling acorns bouncing off branches on their way to a soft landing in the deep layer of leaf litter. When I brushed aside the decaying foliage, releasing its humic aroma of autumn, I found some that had already germinated. A stout root pierced the end of each nut, then turned sharply downwards into the soil; once they reach the ground acorns waste little time in anchoring themselves. A mature oak can produce tens of thousands of acorns in a season, millions during a half-millennium lifespan. It seems profligate, but their chances of survival make lottery odds look attractive. Nut-feeding insects can destroy 40% of them; of the rest, most will be consumed by birds and small mammals such as wood mice and voles. Those that germinate in autumn and are overlooked by grazing deer when they resume leafy growth in spring must wait for their parent tree to fall before inheriting its place in the sun. I could not find any regenerated oak saplings around me. Settling down to listen again I could hear the rustling of a grey squirrel digging among the leaf litter, and, in the distance, the clattering wings of a flock of wood pigeons settling to feed. Both are major consumers of acorns; a pigeon can accommodate more than a dozen in its crop. From above came the nerve-jangling screech of a jay, most likely collecting its own acorns to bury as a winter larder in a field somewhere. A lucky few will be forgotten, germinate and might survive to become trees.

Perhaps the grandeur of the rising sun, as I watched it lifting deep shadows from the valley cut by the river Wear, moved its founders to build here. I wandered around the churchyard, reading names on tombstones carved by stonemasons whose own identities have long since been forgotten. In the earliest, dating from the mid-18th century, I could almost hear accents in words chiselled freehand, in elegant script. “Buri’d William Rutter May 20th. 1767 Aged 48,” read one, with unsentimental matter-of-factness and an inexplicable use of an apostrophe. Perhaps the carver of Ralph Hodgson’s simple headstone in 1758 was distracted as he cut his higgledy-piggledy letters. He forgot to capitalise the deceased’s surname and ran out of space on the sandstone slab, so the final two letters, “on”, sit above “hodgs”, teetering on the edge of oblivion, as an afterthought. As I walked outwards from the church, the years passed, the graveyard filled and headstones became more formal, pious and decorative, until I reached the full glory of the memorial to William Simpson (died 1876). The finely hewn dove on the headstone exemplified the sentimental symbolism enshrined in nature that is such a feature of the Victorian attitude to mourning. Below, gothic script, machine-carved and thus perfectly aligned and spaced, reflected the precision and wealth that came with the industrial revolution and swept aside the jobbing rural stonemason with his chisel and idiosyncratic spelling. Cemeteries are full of mysteries, of stories hinted at that can only be guessed. In this little Christian churchyard there is one headstone that defies explanation. Why does the memorial raised by Christopher Parkin to his granddaughter Alice Parkin, who died aged 12 in 1815, bear the Muslim inscription “Allah Kerim, The Providence of God is Great”? And why is there no mention of her parents? There must be a story buried with her.

The prime minister made the appeal over dinner with 27 other EU leaders but did not offer any fresh financial concessions to help break the deadlock in talks, which have been stuck on the issue of Britain’s divorce bill for months. Speaking on Thursday night, the prime minister said both sides needed an “outcome that we can stand behind and defend to our people”, hinting at the political difficulty she would have in selling a deal that involves handing over a large sum to the EU. May’s promise to honour the UK’s financial commitments amounts to about €20bn (£18bn) but she has not come up with a specific figure and EU negotiators believe Britain’s liabilities are at least €60bn. Arriving at the summit in Brussels, EU leaders stood firm on the idea that trade talks could only begin once the UK offered more detail on the Brexit bill but some continental leaders appeared to offer hope that the impasse over money could be broken in the coming weeks. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, put her stamp on the established EU position when she said Brexit negotiations could move on to trade by December. “From where we are now, [progress] is not sufficient enough to enter the second phase, but it is encouraging to move on with the work so that we can reach the second phase in December,” she said. The upbeat tone was echoed by Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, who said: “We were friends, we are friends and we still will be friends; I am sure we will find an agreement.” He noted the change in tone between May’s speeches, including her latest overture to EU citizens living in the UK. “Times change and even Theresa May’s Facebook post went in the right direction.” But there was a less positive analysis from the Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskaitė, who said May had “not yet” come up with a good proposal. In typically caustic remarks, she said: “Theresa May needs to persuade herself and her government to be more forthcoming and realistic.” The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said he had asked May last week to offer more detail on the Brexit bill. “Theresa May has to come up with more clarity on what she meant with other commitments in her Florence speech. I phoned her last week and tried to encourage her to do that and so far she hasn’t,” he said. In her address over dinner, May avoided putting a number on how much the UK was willing to pay to Brussels, stressing that she had already promised to honour the UK’s financial obligations, including paying into the EU budget until 2021. She claimed to have made the first concessions and called on the EU to do the same, saying she made her Florence speech after she “recognised the difficulty the process was in”. “I took stock, listened to what people in UK were saying and what my friends and partners in Europe were saying and I made a step forwards,” she said. Arguing the EU leaders must make the next move when they meet without her on Friday, she said their “clear and urgent imperative must be that the dynamic you create enables us to move forward again”. The aim should be moving on to talk about a future relationship between the EU and Britain that “sets rights and obligations in a new and different balance”. Although May made no fresh offers, the tone of her address to EU leaders was intended to be conciliatory. She made no mention of the threat of leaving with no deal, which both sides acknowledged was a growing possibility after the fifth round of talks made little progress. The prime minister spoke for about five minutes during coffee at the end of a meal that had been focused on EU foreign policy challenges, including Iran, North Korea and Turkey. “As expected, nobody reacted,” an EU source told the Guardian. Speaking to journalists after the dinner, Merkel rejected suggestions the EU negotiating mandate was too strict. “I don’t think so,” she said giving an upbeat assessment of the prospects for a breakthrough. “Both sides have to move. We are going to achieve a good result, there will be a good outcome.” But she made clear the next stage of Brexit talks would be tougher than the current one, which is focused on divorce issues, including money. Merkel said the second, trade-focused round was “undeniably going to be more complicated than the first stage”. The EU would also find it “more difficult” to formulate a mandate to guide those talks she said. Rightwing Conservative Eurosceptics, including former cabinet ministers Owen Paterson and John Redwood, are suggesting May should walk away from talks rather than offer more cash, but the prime minister’s spokesman said the focus was on getting on with the talks. Damian Green, her deputy and first secretary of state, played down calls for a “no deal” Brexit on Thursday: “I think it’s hugely desirable that we get a deal. I think it will be good for Britain. I think it will be good for the other EU countries as well. And because of that fact, I think it is likely that we will get a deal.” However, Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, issued a much starker warning that the Tories talking up the idea of “no deal” were threatening the economic security of the UK. “I’m bemused by this argument that if you threaten to jump over a cliff that is a good negotiating tactic,” he said. “Going over the cliff is what will happen in March 2019 if we have not reached an agreement: we are going over that cliff... “That would be very serious situation, as well. You’ve only got to run through tariffs whether in agricultural, meat products, textiles or cars. I think there would be a crisis of confidence in the economy.” Despite their focus on getting an agreement, the government is stepping up preparations for the possibility of not achieving one, as it emerged that the Brexit secretary, David Davis, will present cabinet with an assessment of the potential benefits of such a scenario in the coming weeks. The EU leaders will gather for discussions on Brexit without May on Friday morning, where they are expected to say they will start making preparations for trade talks among themselves in readiness for the possibility of negotiations from December. So far, the UK’s desire to start negotiating a trade deal has been stymied by the EU’s strict negotiating timetable, which demands “sufficient progress” in settling Britain’s EU divorce first. Shortly before the summit began, footage showed the British prime minister in earnest conversation with Merkel and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. As he arrived at the summit, he said the EU’s unity was “very strong on Brexit … we are all united behind one negotiator, Michel Barnier”. The German chancellor also revealed that she had been talking about the Iran nuclear deal with Macron and May, as the three arrived in the summit room deep in conversation. For the EU, Brexit is a sideshow at the summit, which has a heavy agenda of foreign policy issues. May acknowledged this as she arrived at the summit, saying: “This council isn’t just about our exit negotiations, it’s also about various other really important issues: defence, security, counter-terrorism, migration, and I am going to be showing how the UK can continue playing a full role.” The prime minister has repeatedly attempted to go over the heads of the EU’s Brexit negotiators by appealing to European leaders to jump start the talks. This week, No 10 tacitly admitted this gambit had failed when it signed up to a joint Brussels statement that “both sides agreed that [Brexit] would be discussed in the framework agreed between the EU27 and the United Kingdom”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/23/the-good-doctor-freddie-highmore-abc-biggest-new-show","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T11:00:15Z","webTitle":"How The Good Doctor became the year's biggest new TV hit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/23/the-good-doctor-freddie-highmore-abc-biggest-new-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/23/the-good-doctor-freddie-highmore-abc-biggest-new-show","fields":{"headline":"How The Good Doctor became the year's biggest new TV hit","bodyText":"Ever since Grey’s Anatomy went haywire and hits like House, Nurse Jackie, and ER completed formidable seasons-long runs, folks have been clamoring for the next great medical procedural. This fall, it seems they got their wish with ABC’s new drama The Good Doctor, created by House’s David Shore and based on a Korean series of the same name. Is The Good Doctor “great”? Well, not exactly, but it does enough to fill the void in a genre that’s always been less about medicine than the often galactic, always dramatic goings-on at our favorite fictitious hospitals. Last week, after just three episodes, The Good Doctor became the most-watched show on US television, surpassing The Big Bang Theory, which has held that title for quite some time despite running on pseudo-comic fumes. Yes – “most-watched” is a superlative that’s both widely appropriated and, in the age of multi-platform viewing increasingly irrelevant – but 18.2 million viewers, which The Good Doctor reeled in last week, is nothing to scoff at, especially as it trounces flashier fall debuts like The Orville, The Gifted and Seal Team and runs neck-and-neck with CBS’s Big Bang Theory spinoff Young Sheldon. It also received a full-season order at ABC after only two episodes and has found a quietly passionate fanbase on Facebook (the show’s official page already boasts over 650,000 likes), where fans praise its depiction of autism and attest that the soapy medical plotlines have reduced them to tears. There’s even talk of an Emmy nod for its star Freddie Highmore, of Bates Motel fame. The premise is simple: Shaun Murphy, played by Highmore, is an autistic surgeon with savant syndrome. His stream of consciousness speaks the language of anatomy, and when the show’s particularly keen on calling attention to his genius, organs and veins and glands float above his head like illustrations ripped from a med-school textbook. “He’s not Rain Man,” says his main advocate at the prestigious St Bonaventure hospital in an attempt to convince the board that Murphy is hirable and high-functioning. To those in the autism community, the show has deftly done just that. “The Good Doctor does a fine job of navigating this razor’s edge,” wrote Kerry Magro on the website Autism Speaks, noting that it shows “several characteristics that can accompany an autism diagnosis such as social awkwardness, lack of eye contact, playing with his hands during stressful situations”. He adds: “Freddie’s take will resonate with many in the community.” As for its entertainment value, The Good Doctor proceeds the way most medical dramas do: each day brings a new patient in need of life-threatening surgery; the doctors fight for stature and opportunity while romancing one another in the process; we discover that Shaun’s childhood was marred by the gruesome deaths of both his little brother and pet bunny, and he’s disciplined for behaving poorly or erratically in front of patients before saving the day with surgical heroics. It’s schmaltzy and sentimental, and it’s probably no coincidence that as hitmaker Shonda Rhimes (of Scandal, Grey’s and How to Get Away with Murder fame) prepares to leave ABC for Netflix, the network has pushed a new drama to the forefront of its programming. And like Grey’s Anatomy, The Good Doctor has accrued a wide fanbase in just a few episodes by weaving the day-to-day tasks of surgeons into the larger framework of its protagonist’s story. In its first season, Grey’s brought in roughly 18.5 million viewers per episode, and so far The Good Doctor, with more than half of its audience watching the show live and the rest on DVR, is outperforming both that show at the same stage and others in the same lineage, like House and Private Practice. But before The Good Doctor and last year’s network breakout This is Us, a non-linear tearjerker about a family with three children who share a birthday, it had been a while since a debut series on either CBS, ABC, NBC or Fox became a ratings powerhouse. Network television was mostly underwhelming or, like The Big Bang Theory, stagnant and formulaic, and so viewers flocked instead to cable (HBO, AMC, FX) or streaming services (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu). In that sense, network dramas are the new underdogs, at least in relation to the Game of Thrones and Walking Deads of the world. But perhaps they won’t be any longer, since both The Good Doctor and This is Us provide the guilty pleasures many people look for in their TV diets: earnest storytelling, very attractive actors doing very noble things, and characters who tug at our heartstrings. Both shows, too, have diverse casts and optimistic outlooks, debuting as the collective national mood called for encouraging, beat-the-odds entertainment in the vein of La La Land, Hidden Figures and Wonder Woman. The recent popular network dramas of the pre-Trump era – Empire, Madam Secretary, How to Get Away with Murder, Chicago Med and The Good Wife – were somewhat less uplifting in spirit and tone. As David Shore told Indiewire: “There’s an honest, unabashed emotionality to this show that I think is very refreshing. It will make you cry in an unembarrassed way.” So far, fans agree. “Find myself crying every episode,” one YouTube commenter wrote. “I was kind of getting sick of so many medical dramas but this one stole my heart,” says another. In its promotional campaign, too, The Good Doctor, like This is Us, has embraced its emotional resonance: “We’re not crying. You’re crying,” reads the caption to its episode three trailer. As one might expect, what’s made The Good Doctor a hit has made it divisive among critics: despite its ratings, it has a meager 43% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Maureen Ryan, writing in Variety, called it both “preposterously tragic” and “a third-rate Grey’s Anatomy ripoff”. That discrepancy between the show’s critical reception and its popularity among audiences is one of the most extreme in the website’s history, and like last year’s blockbuster film Batman v Superman, which spawned a wave of think-pieces about the dissonance between critics and audiences, reviewers like the show about half as much as the 18 million who watch it. Ultimately, critics may be of little significance to The Good Doctor: it’s now ABC’s most-watched Monday drama in 21 years. Unseating The Big Bang Theory alone brought the show a good deal of press, and should it continue to handle autism as deftly as viewers think it does, The Good Doctor will join This is Us as that rare network hit in the age of streaming supremacy.

The shadow leader of the house had this silly idea that a government was meant to govern, that it ought to be coming up with some constructive ideas on things such as housing, education and the NHS. Or even, God forbid, Brexit. She went on to question the government’s record on opposition day debates. The previous day it had been defeated 299-0 after its whips had ordered Tory MPs to abstain on a motion to pause the rollout of universal credit. Surely the least that was called for was a minister to make a statement on the government’s position to show it took parliament seriously? To do nothing and ignore the vote was just disrespectful and disorganised. “Parliament isn’t meant to be a school debating society,” Vaz observed. Several Tory MPs looked astonished. That’s precisely what they imagined it to be. “You’ve been speaking a bit too quickly for me,” Leadsom replied. Everyone speaks too quickly for the leader of the house, whose brain often seems to be on a 30-minute delay. “So please forgive me if I forget to answer some of your points.” It’s been a Conservative tradition for a while now to find the dimmest person possible to put in charge of scheduling government business. Leadsom is a more than worthy successor to Andrew Lansley and Chris Grayling. Leadsom glanced at her notes. The government wasn’t bound by the previous day’s resolution, but the opposition shouldn’t see its inactivity as a sign it wasn’t listening. Rather Labour should take its complacency as a mark of respect. It had listened so hard that it was completely exhausted. Besides, hadn’t the government showed some willing by ditching its premium rate helpline? To prove her point, Leadsom took out her phone and dialled up the leader of the house helpline. Press one for “hopeless”. Press two for “dim”. Press three for “you’re fired”. As for the EU withdrawal bill, Leadsom couldn’t see why the opposition was getting so worked up about its non-appearance at the committee stage in the Commons. OK, so she knew she had promised it would see daylight weeks ago, but it wasn’t as if there were any pressing time concerns in relation to Brexit. One of her front bench colleagues gently reminded her that the prime minister had triggered article 50 back in March and that the government had less than 18 months to sort out something that would take most people at least seven years. “Oh,” said Leadsom, sounding a bit taken aback at this piece of news. She took out her diary once more. Hmm. It wasn’t looking good, what with both the recess and the important upcoming legislation on cutting badgers’ toenails to a regulation length. There was an outside chance the EU withdrawal bill might make it before parliament before Christmas, but she couldn’t make any promises. But look on the bright side. Its non-appearance was yet another sign of just how seriously the government was taking its responsibilities. All of this was too much even for some Tories. Edward Leigh observed that it was outrageous for the government to take no notice of opposition day debates. “The road to tyranny is paved by executives ignoring parliament,” he said. Peter Bone was equally insistent that the government needed to be democratically accountable. If the Tories are losing the backing of hardline rightwingers like Leigh and Bone, they are in even more trouble than anyone imagines. With Leadsom drowning in her own sea of incompetence, Labour’s Chris Bryant went for sarcasm. As the government had no real ideas of its own, perhaps she could bring forward his private member’s bill? Like most things, this passed straight over Leadsom’s head and she promised to see what she could do. Soon everyone was suggesting pointless legislation to fill government time. How about a bill allowing ferrets to self-identify as dogs? Brilliant, said Leadsom getting out her 2018 month-by-month planner. Anything to delay universal credit and the Brexit bill."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/oct/24/sacked-school-headteacher-alevel-results","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T06:10:39Z","webTitle":"‘Sacked from the school I loved’: a headteacher’s story","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/24/sacked-school-headteacher-alevel-results","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/oct/24/sacked-school-headteacher-alevel-results","fields":{"headline":"‘Sacked from the school I loved’: a headteacher’s story","bodyText":"It was the first day of term – usually my favourite. Fresh faces, returning colleagues, a new year and a sense of optimism. This time, though, I knew that at the end of that day, I would be leaving my keys, phone and laptop in the school safe and going home for the last time. I wasn’t ever going to return to the school I loved, had built up and spent more time at than home. The following morning someone from the multi-academy trust (Mat) would be explaining to my staff that I’d decided to leave to pursue a new “consultancy”. It was a lie. Like heads all over England, I am one of the disappeared. I’d not been sacked exactly – but told my time was up. If I kept my mouth shut I could walk away with a reference that would get me another job (maybe) and a chunk of money to prevent immediate panic. Looking back at my job interview, someone from the Mat had warned me that I’d have three years to make a difference. I believe this is a common period that new heads get when taking on a school needing to change. My school was a challenge, in a deprived area. But I was ambitious, I thought I could do it. I was promised all sorts of support from the Mat and, I now realise, the money was too good to be true. Results went up. The quality of teaching, learning and leadership improved hugely. Every agency that came to look at our challenging school – Ofsted, the local authority, the representatives from the regional schools commissioner – all thought we were doing well. However, as far as the Mat was concerned, only a miraculous overnight improvement would do. I had not been prepared to achieve this by their desired methods. Unlike the high performing school down the road, I would not prevent year 12s returning to year 13 who had failed to attain particular grades in AS exams. While other schools either didn’t respond to certain parents’ inquiries about places, or lied and said they were full, we always invited them in for a look. If the child had special needs we never said no, even if we’d have to magic up resources. When members of the Mat team put pressure on my middle and senior leaders to behave unethically – “helping” to rewrite coursework, persuading parents to home school their year 11 children – I backed my team and said this was not how we would play. My superiors were unhappy but I believed that sustained change was possible using honest methods, even if it wasn’t as fast as they wanted. On A-level results download day I was pleased so many students had done well. A couple who had been distracted, who had not attended as well as they could, got Us, but overall our pass rate improved, our average point score rose. Greater numbers than ever before had the grades to get into university. We were getting there. Or so I thought. When I arrived the following day to celebrate the opening of envelopes with the students, the Mat’s HR manager was waiting in my office. The following 10 minutes ended my employment. He was smiley. He conveyed compassion and suggested I phone my union. He made it sound as if he was doing me a favour. After he left, I put on my smile and headed out to see the students opening their envelopes, celebrating their successes, listening to the teachers’ relief that the results had improved. A couple of heads of department hugged me, said they were pleased with the small gains but the real improvements would be this coming year. While the union and the Mat fought over the details of the settlement, as I worried about how my wife and children would react to my being out of work, the Mat simply assumed I would carry on as normal. And when I walked out of the door on that last day, absolutely no one knew I was off, or that anything had been going on. For those children and those teachers, the results had been excellent news, time to celebrate. For me, my time was up. In today’s school system competition is all, improvement must be rapid or it’s seen as failure, and the headteacher must use whatever method is required for the sake of the academy chain. Otherwise you disappear."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2017/oct/19/academy-stand-harvey-weinstein-trust-judgment-hollywood-sexual-harassment","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T17:10:55Z","webTitle":"The Academy takes a stand on Weinstein – and we trust its judgment completely","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2017/oct/19/academy-stand-harvey-weinstein-trust-judgment-hollywood-sexual-harassment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2017/oct/19/academy-stand-harvey-weinstein-trust-judgment-hollywood-sexual-harassment","fields":{"headline":"The Academy takes a stand on Weinstein – and we trust its judgment completely","bodyText":"Comic levels of self-regard from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who expelled Harvey Weinstein last Sunday after an emergency sitting of its board. However, according to a letter sent to members a couple of days later by its president, John Bailey, “The Academy cannot, and will not, be an inquisitorial court”. That’s a relief. This is, after all, the collective body that awarded Crash with best picture and judged Kevin Costner a better director than Martin Scorsese. Of course it can’t be an inquisitorial court. That would be like ceding judicial process to Torquemada’s pet goat. What he’d like, the Oscars president continued, is for the whole horrid business to serve as “a turning point in our industry – and hopefully in our country, where what happens in the movies becomes a marker of societal zeitgeist”. And yet, does it really? I am already hugely enjoying all the movies they aren’t even going to try to develop that might illuminate this difficult time, despite the fact that it is a story in which many people are feverishly interested, and to which so many can – even in the dowdiest of our civilian workplaces – relate. I suppose there’s an outside chance they’ll search the furthest reaches of the Marvel back catalogue and unearth some guy – it’ll be a guy – whose superpower is wrestling hot lady actors out of taxis so some monstrous blob can’t feed on them. Then again, it’s been just the 37 years since 9 to 5, so perhaps Hollywood doesn’t want to look like it’s obsessed with the subject matter. And frankly, how would it ever be possible to better Disclosure, the town’s seminal piece on sexual harassment in the workplace? If you haven’t seen this 1994 classique, you should probably know that the abuser is a woman. Demi Moore harasses a mildly reluctant Michael Douglas, and – if you like your markers of societal zeitgeist served with an eyeball roll – you may care to know the movie also doubles as an “erotic thriller”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2017/oct/21/couple-lose-120000-email-hacking-fraud-legal-sector","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T06:00:15Z","webTitle":"‘We lost £120,000 in an email scam but the banks won’t help get it back’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/21/couple-lose-120000-email-hacking-fraud-legal-sector","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/oct/21/couple-lose-120000-email-hacking-fraud-legal-sector","fields":{"headline":"‘We lost £120,000 in an email scam but the banks won’t help get it back’","bodyText":"It is the worst case of email intercept fraud that Money has ever featured. An Essex couple have lost £120,000 after sending the money to what they thought was their solicitor’s bank account, but which instead went to an account in Kent that was systematically emptied of £20,000 in cash every day for the next six days. Peter and Alice Scott (not their real names), who live near Chelmsford, say they are “simply staggered” at the lack of response by the banks and the police after they unwittingly became the latest victims of email hacking fraudsters who have been targeting solicitors across the UK. The couple’s story will serve as a warning to anyone about to send a large sum of money to a solicitor. It also exposes systemic flaws in the banking system that make it easy for fraudsters to operate unchecked and banks’ indifference to customers who have lost life-changing sums of money. The extraordinary story started in late August when Peter telephoned his family’s long-used firm of solicitors, Steed &amp; Steed, based in Braintree, Essex. He rang because he was due to pay his grandmother’s inheritance tax bill to HM Revenue &amp; Customs and needed the law firm’s bank details. Later that morning, an email duly arrived with the firm’s account and sort code detailed in a Word file attachment. This was the first contact he had had with anyone at the law firm, he says. Three days later, Peter went to the Braintree branch of Lloyds bank where he instructed staff to make a Chaps electronic payment for £120,000 to Steed &amp; Steed, handing over the account details he had been sent in the email and his debit card. Eight hours later he received a text message from Lloyds to say the funds had been transferred to the receiving account. “When I got home I emailed Steed &amp; Steed to confirm I had made the payment and later received a reply from it confirming the funds had been received. A week later my wife asked me why we had not yet received a receipt from the solicitor so I called the firm and, to my shock, I was told it had not received the funds. At first I thought it was an error and went straight to the Lloyds branch,” he says. Within a few hours the true horror of what had happened emerged. The email from Steed &amp; Steed had been hacked and what Peter had been sent was the fraudster’s account details, to which he had sent the £120,000. Through his contacts he was able to establish that the account the money had been sent to was a NatWest business account in the name of Graceak Ltd. He was also able to establish that all of his £120,000 had gone from that account, as £20,000 had been withdrawn over six days. The company has since been dissolved, according to Companies House. “The Lloyds bank manager called the fraud team and later apologised for what had happened,” Peter says. “I felt it was a bit of an ‘Oh well, I’m really sorry, but there’s nothing we can do’. He advised me to call Action Fraud and the police. I left the branch feeling physically sick.” Since then he says he has been staggered at the lack of interest in the theft of what is a considerable amount of money. “We feel let down by everyone involved. We have heard nothing from the police or Action Fraud even though we have the name and address of the woman who ran the company account to which my money was paid. Action Fraud told me there was no guarantee that the police would even look at my case, and if they did it may take up to eight weeks to start their investigation. I could not believe my ears.” Peter says Lloyds, which took eight hours to make the payment, did not carry out any checks to ensure the name of the firm to which the payment was to be made matched the account numbers, even though staff would have been aware that fraud in this area is rife. Lloyds did not appear to notice that it was paying Steed &amp; Steed £120,000 in a NatWest account in Kent. He says he has since learned that the Steed &amp; Steed account was held at that very branch in Braintree. The bank has declined all liability and told the couple they must to go to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS). They have been forced to borrow the £120,000 to make the original HMRC payment. When staff at FOS look at this case, which could take months, they are likely to examine Lloyds’ liability to the couple. UK Payments, the body that oversees banking payments, pointed us to the regulations that govern this area. These state that a bank has to “have made clear to their customer how a Chaps payment will be processed” and that the bank “will make a payment solely on the basis of a unique identifier and will not execute it on the basis of the intended recipient’s name”. Meanwhile, the security or otherwise of Steed &amp; Steed’s email system is also likely to be investigated. In December 2016, regulatory body the Solicitors Regulation Authority warned that email hacks of conveyancing transactions had become the most common cybercrime in the legal sector. Firms are duty bound to inform the SRA if a client’s money is lost in this way. Steed &amp; Steed declined to tell Money what steps it had in place to prevent email fraud. It said it would be “inappropriate for us to provide any comment due to reasons of confidentiality and the fact that this matter is under police investigation”. Lloyds similarly said it would not be commenting while the FOS investigation is ongoing. NatWest said it had tried to help recover the couple’s funds but that none had remained when Lloyds advised it of this case. Richard Emery, an independent bank security expert who has helped previous victims featured in Money, has offered to look at the case. Money will be passing on his details to the Scotts. Banking flaw that puts consumers at risk The Scotts’ story is a timely reminder to never trust an email containing bank or other payment request details and to always phone the person you want to pay to check the information before you send a significant sum. In recent years Money has featured many cases of email interception fraud and the sums lost have been eye-watering. In January, Howard Mollett lost £67,000 after hackers gained access to his solicitor’s email account. As a result, he sent his house purchase deposit to an account used by fraudsters. Last year, a north London couple lost £25,000 after conmen intercepted emails between them and their builder. They thought they had sent him a deposit allowing him to buy materials. Instead, the money was lost. In each case the fraudsters exploited a little-known but significant flaw in the banking system – the name on a bank account does not have to match an online or Chaps payment request. A person can put Mickey Mouse in a transfer mandate and the money will be paid to the account with that sort code and account number, irrespective of whether the name matches or not. Campaigners have described this flaw as a “fraudster’s dream”. Despite the fact that bank fraud is out of control, the Financial Conduct Authority, which oversees banks, has shown little interest in forcing them to match payment requests to account names. Experts say such a move would halt most of these frauds overnight. Over a year ago, the consumer body Which? lodged a “supercomplaint” with financial regulators demanding banks do more to protect customers tricked into transferring money. So far no concrete measurers have emerged and consumers’ losses grow every week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/oct/20/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T07:18:03Z","webTitle":"Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/oct/20/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/oct/20/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend","fields":{"headline":"Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend","bodyText":"1) Upbeat Watford can pick at Chelsea’s frailties After Watford’s victory over Arsenal, and Troy Deeney’s typically forthright reaction to it, the big question as we approach this game concerns the condition of Chelsea’s cojones. Defeat at Crystal Palace last week certainly brought them into doubt, and they followed that by, in Antonio Conte’s words, “totally losing our style of football” in the draw against Roma on Wednesday, when the Italian side battled back from 2-0 down to lead 3-2 and Chelsea “were never in control of the game”. It appears at the moment that, in comparison with last season, Chelsea are somewhat cojone-light. Add to that the injuries affecting Conte’s squad and the wild optimism coursing through Watford’s and this starts to look like a potentially troublesome home fixture for the champions, who will surely be hoping that, having come off the bench to transform the game against Arsenal, Deeney is only a substitute again on Saturday. This is only the second time these teams have ever met in the month of October, the first having ended in a 3-2 away win for Watford in 1984. SB Sachin Nakrani: Conte among the malcontents at uneasy Stamford Bridge Hazard double earns Chelsea a draw against Roma Premier League opts against Christmas Eve fixtures after backlash 2) Another City goal feast for Match of the Day viewers? Burnley have conceded only six league goals this season, a defensive record that is likely to be seriously tested at the Etihad – after all, 25% of Manchester City’s opponents have conceded at least as many in that game alone. The visitors will hope that their day goes better than their trip to City on this weekend in 1925, when, to quote the Guardian’s match report, “the weakness and stupid tactics of their defenders would have lost the game for any side, particularly against such fleet raiders and accurate marksmen as the City forwards”. That match finished 8-3 in City’s favour, an unusual tally rendered even more remarkable by the fact that in their next game, against Sheffield United two days later, City lost by precisely the same scoreline. As they continue to bury opponents under an avalanche of goals, City are without doubt the team everyone wants to watch at the moment, which makes it odd that we are so infrequently getting the chance to do so. This will be the fourth time in five league games that they have kicked off at 3pm on a Saturday, when matches cannot be broadcast live in the UK. They are one of only four teams yet to play a league fixture on a Sunday. City’s first four league games, before they really started purring, were all televised, but only one of their next seven has been or will be. This is, to be clear, an observation rather than a complaint, and they are certainly keeping Match of the Day interesting. SB Paul Wilson: long ball need not be the wrong ball for City Manchester City rely on early goals to see off Napoli 3) Big decisions for Wagner as United come to town Huddersfield were soundly thrashed by Tottenham in their first major test at home against one of the big six and they’ll get a chance to show what, if anything, they learned from that humbling when Manchester United come to town. José Mourinho was roundly criticised for the negative manner in which he set out his stall at Anfield last weekend but will not be as cautious against comparative minnows. With so much smoke currently being blown up the nether regions of his opposite number at Manchester City, personal pride may dictate he demands a statement performance from players who ought to relish playing with the handbrake off after being shackled last weekend. “If you play too high you leave them space in behind, if you play too deep you give them too many opportunities to cross and they are strong in the box as well,” said the Huddersfield manager, David Wagner, before the match against Spurs and he’ll face a similar dilemma here. Huddersfield have failed to score in their past four matches and Wagner will be hoping their record signing, Steve Mounié, will be available after missing five games with a heel problem. The 23-year-old scored twice on his debut against Crystal Palace and has been sorely missed. His return will give us some idea of just how well equipped Wagner’s side are to stay in the top flight. What Huddersfield have shown so far has been occasionally impressive, but will not be enough to keep them up.

The transformation in the performances of Leicester’s players following the dismissal of Claudio Ranieri last season was little short of remarkable, so it will be fascinating to see how the occupants of the dressing room react to the sacking of the Italian’s successor when Leicester visit Swansea. Craig Shakespeare was, by most accounts, very popular and the cabal of senior players who were – correctly or incorrectly – blamed for downing tools and getting Ranieri sacked remains largely intact. The righteous indignation with which various Leicester players greeted even the merest suggestion that they might not have been giving their all for the Italian was little short of comical and their reaction to the forced departure of a man they all liked could shed a little more light on who exactly it is that wields the power at Leicester. BG Stuart James: Leicester opt to twist rather than stick once more Players are unhappy over Shakespeare sacking, says Appleton 5) Heat to become unbearable for Koeman in the Meltdown Derby Welcome to the Meltdown Derby. Two teams, going head to head, knowing defeat will lead to a chunk of their support base unleashing fury across social media, radio phone-ins and good old-fashioned pub tables. In Arsenal’s case it will also lead to some of their fans shouting loudly and angrily to a bloke called Robbie outside Goodison Park, yet ultimately it will mean nothing – Arsène Wenger is going nowhere. That is something that cannot be said of Ronald Koeman. Despite the Dutchman insisting he has the full support of Everton’s major shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, and chairman, Bill Kenwright, there is only so long he can survive while results and performances continue to underwhelm. Following Thursday’s 2-1 defeat to Lyon in the Europa League, the Merseysiders have won just two out of 12 games in all competitions and, in general, operated with little obvious tactical plan and collective belief. Some Everton fans (when not attempting to punch opposition players) have called for the former Holland defender to be sacked and that demand will only intensify should they lose again at the weekend. Lose heavily and it may prove impossible for Moshiri and Kenwright to ignore the ‘fume’. SN Everton set to face disciplinary action after brawl Match report: Everton 1-2 Lyon Giroud magic earns Arsenal late victory in Belgrade 6) A repeat performance from rejuvenated Palace? After last weekend’s shock triumph over Chelsea, Crystal Palace will almost certainly travel to Newcastle United feeling little short of invincible, with the weight of the world lifted from their shoulders. Their win over Chelsea was no fluke and they were still on the front foot as the match approached its final knockings, although it should be noted the reigning champions were missing key players and played with uncharacteristic atrociousness. As if the return of Wilfried Zaha was not heartwarming enough for Roy Hodgson, the new lease of life his reintegration to the Palace first team appeared to give Andros Townsend was another cause for celebration. The duo wreaked havoc with their direct running at the Chelsea defence and the Newcastle manager, Rafael Benítez, will need to formulate a plan to stop them doing the same to his rearguard. As well as the action on the pitch, Newcastle fans at St James’s Park will no doubt be keeping their eyes peeled for prospective new owners. BG Jacob Steinberg: impressive Zaha plays with nothing to be scared of Amanda Staveley signs Newcastle NDA before likely bid 7) Liverpool still have goalscoring problems to remedy The last thing that should be said about a team that have just won 7-0 is that they have a problem scoring goals – but Liverpool have a problem scoring goals. It wasn’t evident during their hammering of Maribor on Tuesday, but in general it has been this season. Jürgen Klopp’s side have created plenty of chances but taken only a small percentage, seen most starkly in their back to back 1-1 draws with Spartak Moscow and Newcastle United, which was then followed by that dullest of stalemates with Manchester United, when Liverpool struggled badly to carve open stubbornly defensive opponents. This has led to a debate regarding whether or not Klopp needs to recalibrate his attacking lineup, specifically moving Roberto Firmino out of a false No9 position in order to bring in a genuine No9. The manager is unlikely to do so for this match given that Firmino scored twice against Maribor, and it will be intriguing to see if the player can build on that display against Tottenham at Wembley. There is also an onus on others in red to contribute, particularly the midfielders – Jordan Henderson, Emre Can and Georginio Wijnaldum have scored only three times between them this campaign.

The battle between 10th-placed West Bromwich Albion and 11th-placed Southampton is almost certainly the one they’re all talking about. Early indications suggest these two teams are neither good enough to trouble the top six nor bad enough to flirt with the bottom three. This match between hosts who find it difficult to score and visitors notorious for their parsimonious defence looks a good bet to receive bottom billing on Match of the Day. Against Leicester on Monday, West Brom conceded a late equaliser for the third time this season in the Premier League, a state of affairs that infuriated Tony Pulis. The West Brom manager bemoaned his team’s lack of a killer instinct and inability to “pick teams off”. Having failed to score in eight of their previous nine Premier League home games, Southampton got two against Newcastle last weekend. Manolo Gabbiadini scored both, more than he’d managed in his 15 previous Premier League appearances. West Brom will need to be on their guard against a notoriously streaky striker who has endured similarly barren spells punctuated throughout his career by nine goals in seven games, three in three twice, four in five and eight in 13. Anyone still bothering to update their fantasy football teams could do worse than select the Italian. BG West Brom pegged back by Mahrez equaliser Gabbiadini strikes twice as Saints draw with Newcastle 9) Bournemouth at risk of stoking a backlash Having played the roles of largely innocent bystanders in the face of one of the most accomplished Premier League performances ever seen last weekend, the manner in which Stoke react to their mauling at the hands of Manchester City will be intriguing. They were the first team to score twice against City this season, but Stoke’s confidence must still have been dented by their utter helplessness in the face of such a mesmerising attacking performance. They are at least unlikely to ship seven against a struggling Bournemouth side that have yet to win a point on the road this season. Eddie Howe’s team will hope to stick a couple of boots into a team whose heads are down, but could instead find themselves on the end of a furious backlash. BG Stoke hammered as De Bruyne leads the way Bournemouth sunk at Wembley by Eriksen winner 10) Bilic relying on a Hernández revival With Andy Carroll suspended for Friday night’s visit of Brighton and Diafra Sakho suffering from back pain, Slaven Bilic will desperately be hoping Javier Hernández shakes off a hamstring injury to spearhead West Ham’s attack. Hernández has struggled since scoring twice in the Hammers’ 3-2 defeat at Southampton on 19 August, with only one goal in his past nine showings – also coming in a 3-2 defeat, against Tottenham. Exactly a year ago the Mexican striker began a 16-match goalless streak for Bayer Leverkusen, ending in late January; right now his under-pressure manager cannot afford something similar and needs Hernández to spark into life at the London Stadium.

Trump has been vocal in his criticism of NFL players who have chosen to kneel during the national anthem to highlight racial injustice in the United States. In September, the president said: “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’” The NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, said this week that players should stand for the anthem but would not be forced to. That led to Trump tweeting that the league has shown “total disrespect” for America. But Khan suggested that rather than patriotism, Trump’s anger may stem from his failure to buy the Buffalo Bills in 2014. “He’s been elected president, where maybe a great goal he had in life to own an NFL team is not very likely,” Khan told USA Today Sports on Wednesday. He added: “The attacks on Muslims, the attacks on minorities, the attacks on Jews. I think the NFL doesn’t even come close to that on the level of being offensive. Here, it’s about money, or messing with – trying to soil a league or a brand that he’s jealous of.” Trump was also the owner of the New Jersey Generals in the United States Football League, a rival competition to the NFL. Trump led an attempt with fellow USFL owners to force a merger with the NFL in 1984, but he was unsuccessful and the league folded in 1986. Khan is originally from Pakistan, and also attacked Trump’s immigration policy, which he said is far more sinister than the president’s scuffle with the NFL. “That’s one aspect that you can imagine – someone is getting a visa that will change their life is from a Muslim-majority country – and, now, boom, that dream to change lives, they get locked out,” Khan said. “That’s a hell of a lot more significant than fighting some sponsors or people who want their money back because they’ve been riled up.” Khan’s voice is slightly undermined by the fact that he gave $1m to Trump’s inauguration fund, although he told USA Today he had no regrets about his donation and had been attracted by the president’s economic policies. “This ugly, toxic side sours the whole experience,” Khan said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/06/from-bush-doof-to-clowncore-your-favourite-underground-music-scenes","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T11:00:14Z","webTitle":"From bush doof to clowncore: your favourite underground music scenes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/06/from-bush-doof-to-clowncore-your-favourite-underground-music-scenes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/06/from-bush-doof-to-clowncore-your-favourite-underground-music-scenes","fields":{"headline":"From bush doof to clowncore: your favourite underground music scenes","bodyText":"At the outset of this series on underground music, we asked you for your suggestions of where to find it today – and nearly 800 of you responded. In this final chapter, we cover some of the most exciting scenes you uncovered across the globe, from Dartmoor to Slovakia, Queens and Luton. Thanks to everyone who took part, and who contributed to the series as a whole. Dr. Pop: The Wyrd West Country scene: broken electronics and “slurfolk”. A very loose collective of individuals including Ekoplekz, Kemper Norton, IX Tab, REEL (Rapid Eye Electronics Ltd), Swine (featuring ex-Hacker Farm and Coil members), Assembled Minds, The Other Door, Pi-R-Tan – most of them refugees or children from the Psychedelic Duelling bouts of the 80s. Anon: In Bandung, Indonesia, you can find all kinds of music: pop, hardcore/punk, jazz, folk and extreme metal. It originally started in the 90s when some bands ventured to bring music that is not mainstream, for example Pas Band, Puppen, Pure Saturday and Koil. Burgerkill, a metal/hardcore outfit from Bandung have since crossed over and won a Metal Hammer award in 2015. But since the mid-2000s, underground performances have become increasingly difficult. Corporations are an inevitable scourge; the DIY ethos is getting harder to put forth. It’s hard for young bands to get bigger – they always lose out to their seniors in terms of sharing the stage or getting more exposure from the media. Fortunately, problems can be somewhat overcome with social media and streaming. Anon: There are at least 40 performances in Lancaster per week, mostly from local musicians who also work for a living. We don’t have an Academy or an arena, and the university does very little in terms of music. As a result, much of what we get here is homegrown, and yet there seems to be a high percentage of hugely talented musicians. Acts come and go, but some leave a mark. Most recently these would be Divide &amp; Conker, The Lumberjack Cowboy Heartbreak Trucking Co, Lowes, Dohnut (formerly known as Eating Disorder), Hiroshima Twinkie, Greenheart, Dead Man’s Hand, Molly Warburton, Philip James Turner and the Crow Mandala, Atomic Brass, The Low Countries, Words About Space, The Lovely Eggs, 3D Tanx – and that’s just to name a few. Anon: The improvised, experimental, and free music community in the Bay Area in California – there is a site for it here. This is a very rich scene playing adventurous stuff in the midst of one of the most tumultuous times in the area due to rapid gentrification by the tech industry. As more and more artists are forced out of the traditionally very left-leaning, radical Bay Area, there is still a strong community of artists who support each other and sacrifice everything to continue to play this marginalised music. We play music as a way to understand ourselves and the world – we are not products! Reenz: Candelo, New South Wales, Australia. It’s a tiny town, but the music that comes out of it is amazing: Melanie Horsnell, Heath Cullen, Kate and Ruth, Pete Wild, Daniel Champagne from nearby Bega, David Ross MacDonald. There is a songwriting club and some bands have formed from that, such as the Novellas. There are only 300 people in the town, but it’s more exciting than any city – it’s pure creativity coming out of the bush. Bobby Bloomfield: The best UK underground music at the moment is from almost glam-style bands. Costumes, and dark lyrics about society, but with a big dose of humour added in; a mixture of alternative rock and electro. Bands like The Working Man, Petrol Bastard, All Hail Hyena, Kringer and the Battle Katz, and the Performance Enhancing Suppositories. Anon: There’s a local DIY punk scene in Slovakia, with gigs in garages just outside of the city centre. Mostly these are unsigned bands, touring out of their own pocket and getting paid for their show in spaghetti. They play hardcore punk, D-beat, thrash metal, death metal, stoner sludge – and much, much more. Some guy cooks up vegan burgers, too. It’s pretty sweet. Jimmy Bricks: The global psychedelic trance/techno/ambient scene – the 1960s scene 50 years on, where the hippies still hang out. In this country it is derided by the mainstream, and sidelined by the death of venues, the officious licensing of the remaining ones (who wants to to risk their licence by putting on parties for hippies to take drugs at?) and the outlawing of squatting. However since its birth in the mid-90s it has continued to grow worldwide. Festivals such as Ozora in Hungary, Boom in Portugal and Antaris Project in Germany all attract 40,000+ people, and it is also huge in places like Brazil and Mexico. There are many British artists who now ply their trade mainly overseas due to the lack of opportunity in this country – check out the Nano Records roster for psytrance; Ott or Ott &amp; the All Seeing-I for psychedelic dub and ambient; and Nanoplex for psychedelic techno. Nick: New Chicago punk, primarily anything touched by the genius of uber-dweeb Mark Winter. High point is The Coneheads’ album LP 1 Aka 14 Year Old High School PC-Fascist Hype Lords Rip Off Devo For The Sake Of Extorting $$$ From Helpless Impressionable Midwestern Internet Peoplepunks LP. Anon: The undiscovered indie scene in Brighton is phenomenal, whether powerpop dudes like Mum Dad and the Kids, lo-fi self-conscious sadcore like Porridge Radio, political electropop like Dog in the Snow, or alt-folk mega band Sons of Noel and Adrian, or countless others. Check out the Brighton Music Blog or Brighton Noise websites. Anon: The underground music scene is alive and well in Bristol! The genres that most fit the underground label revolve around the various “teks”, ie hardtek, raggatek, gabbertek and clowncore. There is a regular night in the Black Swan called Bris-tek which normally showcases these styles of music, along with underground drum’n’bass, and also some bassline. Its also worth checking out Ed Cox who makes clowncore – he has a cult following in Bristol. Bassline is also the predominant music at Devon free parties. Anon: The Dartmoor music scene. It doesn’t have a name, and perhaps it shouldn’t. All the work is unified by the landscape. None of the musicians, projects or creations will ever be picked up or heard – local radio is playlisted, national radio doesn’t know about it, and very little even reaches the internet, and so a great deal gets lost. It crosses ages, and genre borders – there are limited numbers of musicians, unlike big cities, so you’ll find unlikely collaborations. There is deeply original, challenging, sumptuous, stark, detailed, soft, heavy, intense, progressive or tuneful music here, which is so far from the mainstream that if music might be considered a solar system, this non-scene is the Oort cloud at the edges. Anon: Rhythmic noise – I’ve loved it since I was 18, though it’s not something you’d easily encounter in normal life. Most of it comes out of the industrial scene, or more experimental harsh techno or drum’n’bass, and it’s not got much presence at gigs and clubs in the UK. The best you’ll get is a few tracks at goth/industrial nights usually, and a couple of bands at the annual Infest festival. It can be pretty offputting, seeming like techno turned up until the speakers break, and with what comes across as unbridled aggression. However, with some bands, the sheer volume and distortion creates a great adrenaline-fuelled dancefloor energy, and for other artists it’s an aggression that is used to express messages you might not expect to find in music like this. ESA is one of the best UK rhythmic noise acts, while Winterkälte are rhythmic noise scene legends (and run one of the key labels in the scene). When you realise that they are using their music to convey an angry environmental message, enraged about what we have done to the world and what we could do to save it, the aggression suddenly makes more sense. It’s both medium and message. Anon: Anglo-Japanese hyper pop! British artists that have a taste for Japanese culture/music and incorporate it into their own music. Best examples: Kero Kero Bonito, SaNTINO, En, Jelly BonBon. There isn’t sustainable income in this niche, though – British audiences aren’t quick to come around to world music unless it’s championed by Justin Bieber! Angela Owen: A loose affiliation of musicians in Denver, Colorado make incredible music, spanning styles that don’t even exist yet. Bodymeat (arrhythmic pop); Killd By (non-hierarchical eco-dance); French Kettle Station (post-punk for the nonhuman); and Midwife (post-life rock). Also the various projects – from Petit Garcon to Preteen OD – of Ben Donehower. As diverse as it is, it is catchy, resilient, annoyed and oppressed by the market, and isolated in the way cloud forests are isolated. Matthew Wilson: Queer pop-punk is a huge underground scene that hasn’t yet been discovered by the mainstream. Bands like ACM, which I’m a member of, or Dream Nails, Charm Pit and Militant Girlfriend, are all making music that narrates the queer experience of being outside normative structures through feminist, queer utopian or working-class female lenses. All of these bands rehearse rigorously, and build albums from Kickstarter funding or out of their own pocket. Fronted by female and gender-nonconforming musicians, these bands are commenting on worlds from which they are excluded, through catchy lyrics and brilliant hooks. These messages of queerness and feminism come in the accessible package of pop songs, aiming for inclusivity rather than academia. Sarah El Miniawy: Scottish hip-hop. With the explosion of idea-sharing and democratising power of the internet, the past few years have seen a new generation of young artists find a platform for their own voice. Great acts to check out include Shogun (a young Dundee grime artist), MOG (a spoken word and hip-hop veteran) and Werd (Edinburgh-based rapper and producer). With Brexit and a second independence referendum being discussed, British identity is once again under the microscope. The latest generation of Scottish acts and the varied scenes that accompany them are a must for anyone looking to bring that identity into focus. Anon: Popical Island in Dublin, Ireland. A collective of artists that make highly uncool, underground pop music – in the K Records/Flying Nun/Sarah Records mould. They put on gigs and even had their own venue for a while. For a crash course, check out Squarehead’s 2025 (whose video was made by Domhnall Gleeson), Skelocrats, So Cow, Paddy Hanna, Oh Boland, Ginnels, and Lie Ins. Anon: Crowdsourced musical collaboration, facilitated by websites like Kompoz. Places where dads from Dundee can write and record tracks with rappers from Rio, bassists from Belarus and lead guitarists from Latvia. Some of the tracks are excellent, some are dismal. If early indie was more fun to make than listen to, then this is very similar. Anon: While London, where I live, is overflowing with non-mainstream talent that centres around a bunch of lively and fascinating musical venues (DIY Space for London, Lewisham Art House, Cafe Oto, Rye Wax, Total Refreshment Centre, The Windmill, The Five Bells, to name but a few), the output of the contemporary innovators is pluralistic. The experimenters of today pursue such a range of styles that there is little stylistic overlap to glue them together. Now that even the most badly-behaved punks and radicals have been accepted under the wing of establishment culture it becomes difficult to see how underground movements can develop in the traditional way. We are too well acclimatised to odd and novel styles, and it is increasingly difficult to see what else can be done that is genuinely new and subversive. Small-scale labels still spring up and die (some favourites include Goaty Tapes, Post-Materialization Music, Zero Qualms and Curl Records), ludicrously small runs of tapes and 45s are still made and swapped extensively at tape fairs and record shops (Tome Records being a stellar example), there are often brilliant riot grrrl, punk and post-punk, indie, art rock, experimental dance and avant-garde bands aplenty (some current London favourites of mine being Merlin Nova, Mollusc, Business Lunch and Primordial Soup) making genuinely original and thought-provoking music and performing in energising ways. But the pluralism, self-awareness and nostalgia of the age, as well perhaps the jadedness and cultural overexposure of the audiences, makes it harder for them to really push the envelope. I mean, in 1976 you could shock the nation just by saying “fuck” on the telly. I would consider the genuinely underground musicians of today, in my experience, are often simply hidden away in their bedrooms, swapping and making away from any kind of label or crowd – they don’t need them anymore to make and share. Often they don’t even share! This is one reason I think the musical underground of today can seem invisible. It really is buried. There is a brilliant book (I think there are only a couple of hundred risograph-printed copies in existence) about a bunch of underground musicians working in this way called Casual Junk by Zully Adler of Goaty Tapes. In it, he documents a number of dispersed artists who overlap in their practice and sound enough to be considered a scene in some sense, despite the fact that they are separated by oceans and often have never met. The bands are: Breakdance the Dawn, Tracey Trance, Mad Nanna, Son of Salami, Russian Tsarlag, Orphan Fairytale and Sea Urchin. All are brilliant, weird, and unquestionably underground. And it is a movement of sorts, but not in the traditional manner. Another artist who seems hellbent on wilfully defying the accepted conventions of songwriting, production and distribution while still trying to remain both listenable and relatable are Cool Greenhouse. Their debut EP The Pyramid Scheme is being distributed in a unique fashion. The only way to get a copy of the CD is to promise to reproduce two more copies of it and its accompanying booklet and distribute them to people on a waiting list (a kind of pyramid scheme). Listeners are also encouraged to add to the accompanying artwork. This purposefully laborious distribution method means the record can’t be commodified and is unusually difficult to hear. It also forces audiences to interact directly with the record in a way that obviously goes against the usual passive channels of musical consumption. Kris Nelson: Microtonal or alternative tuning scenes, aka the xenharmonic community. From the arbitrary tunings of the groundbreaking electronic Radionics Radio project (2016), where tunings contained “thoughts” within them, to King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard’s Flying Microtonal Banana (2017) where the octave was subdivided and used on electric instruments. These are just two albums – off the top of my head – that indicate microtonal music becoming more accessible. Bartira: Luton indie, punk and metal at The George II or The Castle most weekends. Hazard, Rogue, the Adenoids, the Kindred, Arnika, Descend, Swank, Kamikaze Avon Ladies, Cerberus, Ribeye, iseefourfingers and many more. Raucous annual festivals Cerberfest, Lutonaid and Castlefest are all put on by local people with no public funding and completely ignored by the local council and Arts Council-funded organisations. Marrkyd: Here in Australia we have a scene that organically grew from the bush around cities: awesome parties that combined the natural landscape with the lights and pounding music of a nightclub. Events called bush doofs host a varied amount of electronic music, from funky house to dark psytrance. Imbibing whatever psychedelics that can reveal the true self, twirling poi or light sticks while dancers move, and lasers and LEDs create an amazing visual experience as the music pounds. Massive events like Earthcore and Rainbow Serpent hold sway. Yet smaller ones emerge and even private parties for friends where enterprising people fund the whole shebang for a night or two of doofing. It’s about getting away from the mainstream and having a deep, visceral, friendly and alternative experience with friends. cdog: Minneapolis has a vibrant psychedelic/space-rock/shoegaze scene that is yet to be uncovered. Bands in the scene include Flavor Crystals, Magic Castles, Panther Ray, Another Heaven, Ghostmouth, Brilliant Beast, Chatham Rise, DIIE, The Chambermaids, Good Doom, American Cream, Old Moon, Basement Apartment, Seafarer, Comets Ov Cupid, Dead Gurus, Paris 1919, Transcendental Strangers and many more. Anon: Far Rockaway, Queens, is perhaps one of the most disconnected communities from the hustle and bustle of New York City, but take the A train to the very last stop, and you’d be hard pressed if you didn’t see someone out front of the station slinging their mixtapes. In its heyday, the community was home to many musicians, including the late Sharon Jones. Unfortunately, the hip-hop community in Far Rock has a history to it as well, one that is scattered with blood and bullet casings. The first artist to make it really big, Stack Bundles, was shot and killed outside of his apartment building by an unknown assailant in 2007. Several years later, an associate of P Diddy and French Montana by the name of Lionel “Chinx” Pickens was shot and killed on his way back to his home in Far Rock. In the years that have followed, his cohorts Cau2g$ and Bynoe, two former members of the Rockaway Riot Squad, have continued to put out music with limited success; Donald Bradley, aka Porche Boxx, is beginning to make a name for himself. Anon: Radical marching bands, such as those you see at HONK! festival or the TriBattery Pops Tom Goodkind Conductor. Jan Lamonte: Preston, Lancashire, has always had a disproportionately vibrant local music scene given its size. Two bands have been receiving quite a bit of national attention (Evil Blizzard and Ward XVI) but they’re only the tip of the iceberg, with other acts including Heavy Fluid Addicts, Sometimes The Wolf, Zvilnik, Polypores, Grandfalloon, All That Fall, Massive Wagons and Cat Called Dog. Manny Faces: Salt Lake City has had an incredible music scene for decades, yet has always been dismissed by outsiders. They hear you’re from Salt Lake and automatically think you’re Mormon (some are, and still kick ass). In the early 00s there were wonderful indie rock and goth scenes, where everyone worked with each other and challenged others to be better. Though many of those bands aren’t around anymore, the mythos and the infrastructure that was built has spawned a new generation that is doing it all over again, but this time it’s doom metal. There are so many amazing metal bands in Salt Lake. A large warehouse turned rehearsal space called Downtown Music is the epicentre – walking in, you will hear a cacophony of various metal hybrids. Any number of these bands could be the next Gojira or Mastodon if anyone knew about them. Salt Lake City has been racked by the scourge of gentrification, which has caused a drought of live music venues. Only the wealthy can live in the city, and they like their music to be in the background while they Instagram their $14 cocktails. Metal demands attention, so we’re pushed to the outskirts and to other cities to find places to play, which is not easy when the next city is an eight-plus hour drive away. Yet the scene flourishes. Maybe it’s a response to the oppressive dominant culture here, but against all odds, these bands are creating something special. Dan: Trashmouth Records are the nearest thing to an underground scene in the UK. Fat White Family are well known; Warmduscher, Bat Bike and Madonnatron are bands who would have survived and thrived on punk/post punk era audiences. None of these bands seemingly give a monkey’s about rock stardom as it is understood in 2017, and most embody thought-through anti-establishment principles. Mainstream media should pretty much leave them alone, although the occasional piece praising them could help regarding food, clothing and shelter. Neil Crud: The vocaloid scene is such an unconventional, tech-driven way of making music – no human singer required, only virtual “idols”, for whom anyone can make a song. Bill Russell: The CD-R-driven freak folk scene of the previous decade has been transformed by the increase in bandwidth access, leading to the streaming revolution, with sites like Bandcamp, Free Music Archive and Soundcloud hosting a lot of underground music. Bands like Pinkwench, IX Tab, Rail Yard Ghosts and XAMBUCA on Bandcamp for example. Where I live in Stockholm, the concept of the microvenue is huge. Small shop fronts, people’s lounge rooms and small basement cafes are now venues for underground performances; streaming sites such as Periscope make concerts and performances accessible from wherever anyone is located. Anon: The scene of musicians recording with mobile devices is a small vibrant place. Fiercely creative and, compared with most other groups of artists, very prolific. Notable artists include PantsOfDeath, Frozen Lonesome, Jesper Jones, Supersonic Tartan Death Machine, JinxPadlock, Carbonates on Mars, Bad Satellites. Don Romeo: You will never find it, you aren’t meant to find it, nor are you meant talk or write about it. Nobody wants you to write about it, nor do we want to be found.

Two-thirds of those deaths are accounted for by prescription painkillers such as Percocet and OxyContin and the street drugs heroin and fentanyl. The number of opioid pills prescribed in the US has quadrupled since 1999, as has the number of opioid overdoses, the interim report of the presidential commission on combating drug addiction and the opioid crisis noted in July.

Dermot Nolan, the Ofgem chief executive, said companies had failed to act quickly enough and should move faster to take customers off the standard variable tariffs which about two-thirds of households are on. British Gas and SSE, the two companies that have the highest percentage of customers on such tariffs, were accused of failing to move users on to a better deal. “They have not made progress or initiatives in the way that perhaps some other companies have announced,” Nolan told MPs. He said that while 2m fewer customers were on standard variable tariffs than a year ago, the market was still not working as well as it should. On the prospect of setting targets to mandate the energy companies to move people off such tariffs, he said: “We are still likely to do that.” Recent plans by E.ON and ScottishPower to phase out the tariffs were “not perfect”, he said, but were signs of progress. Centrica, British Gas’s owner, told the business select committee that it wanted to see the death of the standard variable tariff rather than the implementation of a price cap as planned by the government. “In our view there is an issue with engagement but we don’t think the solution is price caps, we think price caps will hinder competition,” said Sarwjit Sambhi, the managing director of Centrica’s home unit, which includes British Gas. “Our proposal is to end the evergreen nature of the standard variable tariff.” Sambhi denied that British Gas was subsidising its cheapest fixed deals by overcharging customers on its standard variable tariff. But under questioning he admitted that 70% of its supply business’s £550m profits last year were from standard variable tariffs, despite them accounting for 65% of its customer base. He was asked five times by Rachel Reeves, the committee’s Labour chair, whether he would mount a legal challenge against Ofgem if a cap was not backed up by legislation. He would not be drawn on the question, and did not rule out a challenge. But Sambhi said that a narrower cap which came into effect in April did not reflect the costs energy suppliers faced, in particular for fitting smart meters in millions of homes. Ofgem said last week’s publication of draft legislation for the cap would not be enough to see off such challenges on its own, and the law would need to be passed before a ceiling was imposed. “Before setting any final cap I’m afraid we would need royal assent to have that degree of certainty,” said Nolan. Smaller energy companies told the MPs that, contrary to what Centrica argued, a cap was “essential” for stopping suppliers exploiting customers. “After 19 years of deregulation, nothing has worked,” said Stephen Fitzpatrick, the chief executive of OVO, one of the biggest challenger companies. “By far and away the simplest way to protect consumers … is to have a well-set, regulatory price cap,” he said. Greg Jackson, the chief executive of small supplier Octopus, said: “We’ve already heard the usual argument of the big six, essentially blaming consumers for not engaging. The idea that you should have to switch supplier every year, in order to avoid getting literally ripped off, is absurd.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/oct/17/maribor-v-liverpool-champions-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T20:55:28Z","webTitle":"Maribor 0-7 Liverpool: Champions League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/oct/17/maribor-v-liverpool-champions-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/oct/17/maribor-v-liverpool-champions-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Maribor 0-7 Liverpool: Champions League – as it happened","bodyText":"And I’m going to leave you there. You’ve been wonderful. Here’s a farewell gift – Andy Hunter’s match report from the Stadion Ljudski vrt: And so has Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain! I think we started with the right intensity. The manager said we can’t be complacent and we have to give our 100% effort, and the boys did that right from the off. Ultimately we got everything we deserved, and we were more clinical today and put away all our chances, or pretty much all of them. Every week it feels like we’ve got a lot of goals for us, but it’s not clicking at the final moments. If we keep creating chances and keep trying hopefully they’ll come off for us, and tonight they did. We’re in an important part of the season. Everyone’s fighting for their place and I’m just ready for whenever I get the opportunity. I need to keep learning a new style of play and then whenever I get an opportunity do as well as I can. Mo Salah has spoken! I think it was a great game and we did good. I think it’s a good and important result for us. We need to keep looking forward and we have to win our next games. They gave the goal for me but it doesn’t change anything, the team did good and we had a good result, and that’s the most important thing. The most important thing for us is to improve the results in the Premier League. We need to carry on, keep looking forward and win the next games. [Asked about recent disappointing results] We had bad luck. The last three, four games we missed many chances. We had bad luck. Everyone had confidence the good result was coming, and now we are in a good position. That was laughably one-sided. Maribor, needing to keep things tight for a while and hope Liverpool got frustrated, conceded in the fourth minute, and for them it all went downhill from there. Liverpool kept trying to play passes to someone running down a flank who would then slam in a low cross for someone else to tap in, and most of the time they succeeded. Maribor might have coped with the width, and they might have coped with the pace, but couldn’t cope with width and pace at the same time. They also gave away a couple of goals with silly nonsense in their own half, which didn’t help. Liverpool scored seven, and could easily have hit double figures. As it stands, Liverpool lead the group on goal difference from Spartak, with Sevilla a point behind and Maribor three points further back, now with horrible goal difference and surely destined for the wooden spoon. The other game in the group is also turning into a hiding: it’s Spartak 5-1 Sevilla. 90+3 mins: Liverpool have won this game. 90+1 mins: There will be two minutes of stoppage time, or thereabouts. A great last few minutes for double-barrelled players. Alexander-Arnold lets fly from 30 yards and it hits the arm of a sliding defender and screams past a wrong-footed Handanovic and into the net. 90 mins: Milner taps back to Coutinho and then turns and runs into the area; Coutinho chips the ball back into his path. It’s a lovely, lovely pass and it should have led to a goal, but Milner’s first-time cross is poor. 89 mins: Hotic gets booked for shoving Can as they both went for a header. One last goal for the collection. Suler tries to take the ball past Sturridge 10 yards outside his area and fails, Sturridge runs towards the area and passes to Oxlade-Chamberlain, on his right, who gets into the box and scores a very easy goal. 85 mins: Moreno has another of his shots from out on the left where he really shouldn’t be shooting. This one goes very high. 83 mins: Liverpool have eight men in the final 20 yards of the pitch, and Maribor at least as many defenders. There are just too many people for any of them to be able to do anything very much. Coutinho dances to his right, but it’s so crowded there he turns around and dances left again. 81 mins: Maribor’s last change is made, and Mesanovic has come on for Bohar. 80 mins: Yet another goal in Moscow, where the scoreline now reads: Spartak 4-1 Sevilla. 79 mins: Milner chips in a lovely ball from the right to the back post, but it’s well defended and Coutinho volleys against the legs of one of those pesky defenders. 77 mins: Save! Oxlade-Chamberlain slams a low shot goalwards, but it hits Handanovic’s leg and flies to safety. 76 mins: Liverpool’s final substitution sees Dominic Solanke replace Wijnaldum. 75 mins: Maribor’s fans are still impressively loud, despite having had desperately little encouragement. 73 mins: And another update from Moscow: it’s Spartak 3-1 Sevilla. 71 mins: Liverpool are still controlling the match, but they’re just not doing anything particularly exciting. Their last move peters out when a long ball to Lovren, who for some reason is pretending to be a left winger, bounces out of play. 68 mins: Further substitutional action: Firmino is off, and Sturridge is on. 67 mins: Bohar is picked out inside the penalty area, and for a moment it looks like Karius is about to be called into action. But then he isn’t. 65 mins: I get the feeling that the final half-hour of this game might not be the most gripping. 64 mins: Another goal in Moscow, where it is now Spartak 2-1 Sevilla. 60 mins: “I think the phrase ‘Bold Citrus’ is a typo,” writes Phillip Maskell. “It’s supposed to be old citrus. Like an orange that’s been left on the windowsill for too long and is starting to turn a peculiar colour.” 59 mins: A double substitution for Maribor: Pihler comes on for Ahmedi, and Kramaric is replaced by Hotic. 57 mins: He should have scored already! Moreno crosses from the left and it dips onto Oxlade-Chamberlain’s foot, 10 yards out, but he hits over! 57 mins: This is just horribly one-sided. Liverpool have another shot, after spending a long while with the ball in and around Maribor’s area but unsure what to do with it, but it’s deflected behind. Before the corner, Oxlade-Chamberlain comes on for Salah. Another Liverpool free-kick – since I wrote that there had hardly been any there has been a constant stream – Coutinho crosses, and Firmino flicks a header off the top of his head at the near post, and in at the far! 54 mins: Which Coutinho sends goalwards, but Handanovic pushes it clear. 53 mins: Liverpool should have scored another then, but from Firmino’s low cross Wijnaldum scuffs his effort into a defender. It did, to be fair, come to him rather quickly. Anyway, now they’ve got a free kick just outside the area. 51 mins: Liverpool win a corner on the right, which is crossed to the far post, where Morales Tavares is very tightly hugging one Liverpool player and someone kicks the ball at shoulder height and just as Lovren was about to meet it with his head. Play on. 50 mins: Peter Oh sends me the link to the page on the website of Liverpool’s club shop where they describe their third kit: The kit is Bold Citrus in colour and is framed with a black collar and trims So “bold citrus” is a colour now? 48 mins: There have been hardly any free kicks in this game. Firmino’s just won one, out on the right wing, but it’s a real rarity. Perhaps because Maribor haven’t got close enough to Liverpool’s players to foul them. 46 mins: The players are back out and they’ve already kicked off! Marko Vrbranjak has been in touch with some linguistic assistance, firstly in translating that tweet from Maribor from earlier. “Google’s translation ‘Winding from the south does not start. Known songs continue to sound violently violet!’ is disasturous,” he says. “The tweet means ‘Cheering from the south isn’t ceasing. Familiar chants keep loudly inciting the violet team.’ He goes on: Slovenians often joke about football players’ use of the language.there’s even a word for it: fuzbalerščina - a colloquial term that would translate to footie-ish (language). Common expressions are: we left our heart on the field (we gave everything) the ball is round (a usual response to any question from a journalist) The most famous quote belongs to a former intenrational player Sebastijan Cimirotic who once aledgedly said: “I’d like to thank my parents, particularly my father and mother. I’ve now seen a variety of slow-motion replays, and still have no idea who scored the fourth. I mean, I have some idea: I’ve narrowed it down to two potential culprits. Here they are, both doing precisely the same thing to the same spherical object at the same time in the same place: The referee awards half a second’s stoppage time for each of the four goals scored and then blows his whistle. 45 mins: Martin Milec is booked for not really being good enough, and also for tugging Coutinho’s sleeve. 44 mins: Coutinho slams in a shot that Handanovic pushes out to Firmino, but the forward can’t control it smartly enough to turn it into a good chance. 43 mins: Liverpool run down the other end and Firmino nearly scores, shooting just wide from an acute angle. 42 mins: Chance for Maribor! Can gives away a free kick, which is nicely floated just beyond the back stick by Ahmedi and Suler, unmarked and eight yards out, heads wide! Liverpool keep the ball for a bit, looking like they’re not really bothered about scoring any more, but then suddenly Moreno bombs down the left and is picked out, and his hard, low cross finds Firmino and Salah competing with each other for the right to tap it in. Salah looks mildly the happier when it ends up in the net, so everyone gives it to him, though it’s unclear. 38 mins: Another Maribor shot, this time from Kabha, but it’s from 35 yards and is miserably slow. Still, it’ll go down as another effort on target. 38 mins: Coutinho runs with the ball into the area, turns back inside, tries to turn again, runs into a defender, gets the ball again and shoots, but a deflection takes all the pace off the ball and Handanovic saves. 36 mins: Liverpool pass the ball around the Maribor penalty area with casual ease. It ends, after an age, with Milner thumping a cross into Suler’s face and it flying off for a throw-in. 33 mins: Meanwhile in Moscow, it’s now Spartak 1-1 Sevilla. Liverpool still top the group. 32 mins: Liverpool haven’t nearly scored for a little while now, so Salah has a shot from 25 yards that Handanovic fumbles at first but clutches at second. 30 mins: What a night to be English: Elsewhere in the Champions League it’s Real Madrid 0-1 Spurs, and Manchester City 2-0 Napoli. 29 mins: A shot! From Maribor! Maribor have a shot! On target! It’s easily saved, mind. 27 mins: Salah is played in, but he’s a foot offside. 27 mins: Salah has another shot, trying to volley a ball bouncing over his left shoulder into goal from 18 yards and to the left of goal. It was, in short, wildly optimistic, but it was at least on target. Save. 25 mins: Nothing much comes of the corner, though the ball did drop to Salah inside the area only for him to mishit the volley into a thicket of players. 24 mins: Milner has the ball in the box, can’t decide what to deal with it, dances about a bit and then shifts it left, from where it’s worked across the edge of the box to Alexander-Arnold on the right, who whips in a fantastic cross that doesn’t pick out a team-mate, but does panic a defender into conceding a corner. 22 mins: Meanwhile in Moscow it’s Spartak 1-0 Sevilla, and Liverpool currently top the group with Spartak second. Maribor win the ball back in defence and move forward, but then they give it away again within a couple of seconds, Firmino doing well to win it back, and the Brazilian slides in Salah, who closes in on Handanovic before sliding it past him with his left foot. 19 mins: Salah attempts a pull-back, but it hits a defender’s toe and bounces up into his hand. There are some calls for a penalty from the away fans, but no interest on the pitch. 17 mins: Point of linguistic information, courtesy of Joel Smith: “Nah, he is known as Salah in Slovenia,” he writes. “‘Salaha’ simply means ‘of/by Salah’. In certain sentences, you’d be Simona Burntona.” Consider me educated. 16 mins: And nearly another! This time Moreno is picked out as he sprints into the box, and he shoots somewhat optimistically from an unpromising angle, wide of the near post. 15 mins: And nearly another! Milner crosses and Firmino, at the near post, tries to score with a backheel flick towards the back stick but misses the target. The first goal relied on a defensive mistake, but this was just excellent attacking, and Maribor were sliced open like some kind of footballing watermelon with a super-sharp cleaver. Salah receives a lovely pass from Firmino, approaches the area, slides a pass to Milner, running into the box, who crosses into the path of Coutinho, who hits a first-time shot from 15 yards that flies into the net. 10 mins: Liverpool have been a bit wild in some of their passing tonight. Can gives away another needless throw-in with a really astonishingly poor pass to Alexander-Arnold. 8 mins: Maribor mount a vaguely dangerous attack, though it ends with a ludicrously off-target shot from Vrhovec. 7 mins: After a corner is cleared the ball is worked back to Milner, who cuts onto his left foot and shoots low from just outside the area, but it’s an easy enough save for the keeper. 6 mins: This is not a spelling mistake: Salah is known in several eastern European countries as Salaha. Or, when he comically misses an easy chance, as he appears prone to do (though not tonight, it seems), Salahahaha. All about Salah’s speed, which allows him to beat Suler to the ball on the right flank and then speed into the box before laying the ball across goal to present Firmino with a tap-in! 3 mins: I feel duty-bound to translate this. Google tells me it says: “With the exceptional choreography of the fans, the hymn of this prestigious competition has just been taken off. Even moments have separated us from the start of the match!” 2 min: Liverpool kicked off, and have so far kicked the ball about a bit rather aimlessly, given it away, won it back, kicked it around a bit rather aimlessly, and then given away a throw-in for little obvious reason. 1 min: The game has started! Apparently it is orange – it has, to quote Liverpool’s website, a “striking orange colour scheme” – which given the way it looks on my screen – a king of awkward highlighter pink – suggests I really should adjust the colour on my TV. Liverpool are wearing their third kit. I know no word to describe its colour, just that it makes you want to immediately adjust the contrast on your TV. The players have exited the tunnel. The teams have entered the tunnel. Here’s Jurgen Klopp, asked first of all if Maribor’s declared intention to attack makes him happy: I’m not here to be happy before the game. My aim is to be happy after the game. Yes, I think it makes sense for Maribor because they’re quite an offensive-minded team, they’re used to this style. We expected it actually. But it depends on us. If we are at our best then of course they have to depend and will be a little bit deeper. That’s all clear. So yes, good. Jordan Henderson is OK, but he played now the last, pretty much all the games, so it makes sense to bring in fresh legs and rest him a little bit. Milner has had for sure enough rest and is for sure desperate for tonight. I don’t say we have to beat Maribor. We don’t have a lot of games any more. We went to Moscow and wanted to win, and should have won probably. It’s the same today. I don’t like these kinds of disrespectful thing. They deserve to be in the Champions League. Nobody should be in doubt about our attitude and hopefully we can show it from the first second. We have to work and I’m optimistic that we will. They appear to be playing You Win Again on the stadium PA, which is pleasingly optimistic. In which Roberto Firmino isn’t allowed into the stadium because he left his pass on the bus: “I am so pleased to see Milner start in midfield over Henderson,” writes Ian Copestake. “The latter’s penchant for four-metre sideways passes to Lovren (always completed, mind) as his main contribution until the final ten minutes of panicked vertical balls has seen me turn against him. It was time for a change and I am glad Klopp is open to it.” Not so much dropped as rested, I’m thinking. So three changes for Liverpool: Milner, Alexander-Arnold and Karius are in, Henderson, Gomez and Mignolet are out. The team sheets have been handed in, and the names upon them are these: Maribor: Handanovic, Milec, Rajcevic, Suler, Viler, Kramaric, Kabha, Vrhovec, Bohar, Ahmedi, Tavares. Subs: Obradovic, Billong, Pihler, Hotic, Vrsic, Mesanovic, Palcic. Liverpool: Karius, Alexander-Arnold, Matip, Lovren, Moreno, Can, Wijnaldum, Milner, Salah, Firmino, Coutinho. Subs: Mignolet, Gomez, Henderson, Sturridge, Klavan, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Solanke. Referee: Viktor Kassai (Hungary). Hello world! Manchester United last weekend, Tottenham away this weekend. Liverpool could probably have done without a 2,500-mile round-trip to Slovenia in the middle, but at least they get it out of the way early. Maribor are currently second in their domestic league, which they have won in six of the last seven seasons, and can’t be taken lightly even if they are currently at the foot of Group E with half of Liverpool’s two points. They have, after all, gone unbeaten in their last eight European home games (even if they have never won a home game in the Champions League). Liverpool, after consecutive irritating games-they-should’ve-won-but-didn’t, need points in the bank sharpish. Asked if he would make significant changes to the team, Jurgen Klopp raged: “No chance. This is the last place to do those things. This is a decisive moment in the group – we need to be confident and brave. We play Maribor twice now. We’ve already wasted points so we have to be very good again. It’s an important moment.” And so, the stage is set for an evening of goals (surely), nerves (possibly) and a lot of names that end in the letter C.

Born in Cape Town to an Orthodox Jewish family, he was the son of Maisie (nee Kahn) and Joseph Lurie, known as Yankie, who ran the fishery set up by his Lithuanian father, and who died when David was 11. David lived in the affluent Bantry Bay suburb and was sent to the Herzlia Zionist school. The experience quashed any interest in Zionism and he became an atheist. Intending to become a psychiatrist, he studied medicine at Cape Town University, but a visit to the Valkenberg psychiatric hospital prompted a realisation that asylum inmates were, as he said, “saner than the fascists running the country”. He switched to philosophy and, rejecting his family’s comfortable lifestyle, plunged himself into anti-apartheid activism, including guerrilla theatre. During a riot on the steps of the university in 1972, he met a fellow student, Yana Stajno, who was born in Zimbabwe to a Polish father and French mother. David and Yana married in 1974, had a son, Yabu, and moved to Knysia, where David built a traditional mud hut, designing an irrigation system for his vegetable plot. As activists they were in danger from the regime, and, recalled Yana, “violently racist farmers objected to us organising and housing the appallingly treated farm workers”. So the following year the family moved to London as political refugees. By day, David sold home-made pancakes outside Swiss Cottage swimming baths, studying Chinese medicine and language by night. He and Yana became practitioners of traditional Chinese acupuncture. Their north London practice attracted diverse celebrity clients. After seeing a tango show at the Roundhouse, Highbury in 1993, David was hooked on the dance form and its origins with the poor and dispossessed. He set up a string of tango communities across Britain, and when the Bosnian dancer and art student Biljana Lipić visited a tango salon he ran in the socialist club hall in Kentish Town, north London, she and David formed a dancing and teaching partnership, transforming the Dome, Tufnell Park, into a popular London salon that funded her studies. David’s favourite dance was the milonga, whose African origins inspired his own elegant and witty dance style. A passionately keen allotment-holder, he developed three plots behind his house in Bounds Green, north London, dispensing horticultural advice with gluts of produce that overwhelmed his kitchen table. His enthusiasms encompassed bonsai trees, koi carp, surfing, open-water swimming, Alfa Romeos and the beaches of Paleochora in Crete. He is survived by Yana, Yabu, his grandchildren Tillie, Bea and Dylan, and his sister, Ethel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/17/select-political-leaders-on-eq-rather-than-iq","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T16:20:53Z","webTitle":"Select political leaders on EQ, rather than IQ | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/17/select-political-leaders-on-eq-rather-than-iq","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/17/select-political-leaders-on-eq-rather-than-iq","fields":{"headline":"Select political leaders on EQ, rather than IQ","bodyText":"Perhaps it should not be the class of the degree obtained by which we should judge or select our leaders, but the subject (Letters, 14 October)?

His black eyes are full of trouble. One of them is a horrible round hole in the pink, red and white hunk of flesh that is his face. The same crimson gore that streaks it saturates his once-white smock. Behind him there is more blood, a sea of red. He is a man of meat, a glaring golem of animated flesh. Chaim Soutine painted this meat monster in Paris in about 1919-20. The first world war had left the French art world exhausted. Soutine’s Butcher Boy might be an image of the war’s psychological effects – perhaps this brutalised youth has come back from the front full of violence – yet for art dealers craving the latest new thing, Soutine’s directness was also a commercial godsend. For in 1919 the latest new thing was that old thing, unpretentious figurative painting, free from the taint of the avant-garde. The dealer Paul Guillaume cashed in on this conservative mood when he found a market for Soutine’s “traditional” portraits. Ever since, the place of Soutine in modern art’s history has been interestingly ambiguous. Visit museums in Paris and he is always there, slightly in the background, a curiosity of the École de Paris who moved to the city of light from Russia in 1913 and scrimped an existence before making it in the 20s. Yet for some he is a lot more important: a hero of artistic humanism, a missing link between Rembrandt and Frank Auerbach, who preserved the profundity of the old masters in the brittle age of Salvador Dalí. The Courtauld Gallery’s exhibition of Soutine’s portraits of restaurant and hotel staff in 1920s France doesn’t so much resolve the question of his ultimate significance as leave it ringing in your ears like a hot jazz tune that is both brilliant and cliched. The best paintings here – including that formidable, blood-soaked young butcher – had me coming back to look repeatedly, awed by the visceral life of them. Yet the curators’ claim that his portraits are richly individualistic doesn’t convince at all. I’m not sure if Soutine was really interested in anything outside his own emotions. He emerges here as a true expressionist, painting not the outer world but his own reaction to it. These people are meat for his artistic vision. He did love a man in uniform. The handful of women here are wretched figures, painted with pity. The men are something else. They cut dashing, colourful shapes, flamboyantly filling intensely hued costumes. The same red-haired man in the same suit with a vibrant red waistcoat and white dress-like apron appears in four paintings, displaying his broken nose in a variety of forbidding expressions as he sticks out his elbows proudly or puts his arms uncertainly at his sides. Owners of these paintings have identified the man as a waiter, a valet, a hotel manager. Soutine himself gave his portraits no titles, kept no record of the models’ names. Are they even real waiters? No doubt, but Soutine is playing a game. Uniform is a potent device in portraiture, from Renaissance paintings of patricians in regulation black silk to Lucian Freud’s pathos-laden portrait of Andrew Parker Bowles in officer’s dress. Uniform focuses attention on the parts of the body not covered by conformist garb. Here, we study the faces, thin and fat, ugly and handsome, poking out of their tight collars. Uniform also draws attention to the body beneath the cloth. In Bellboy (about 1925), one of the most brilliant paintings here, there is an acute sense of the youth’s bony form within his red uniform, as he sticks out his arms and legs to show the energy stuffed into that servile suit. Soutine is not interested in the identity of the people in these paintings. If he had been, he might have remembered their names. Instead, he is interested in the human condition. Crushed into uniforms, forced to play one part or another on the social stage, the vulnerable, meaty essence of humanity keeps spilling out. Painting between two European wars that reduced people first to cattle then to ash, Soutine celebrates the rawness of our shared predicament. This simple truth raises the paintings here from stylish caricatures to mighty acts of witness.

It’s 50 years since Ted Hughes started Poetry International. It’s nearly 30 years since it was resurrected on the South Bank Centre in London by the poet Maura Dooley. I worked with her on the festival in the 90s for several years. We met and heard some of the greatest voices in 20th-century poetry, from Hughes and Seamus Heaney to Derek Walcott, Sharon Olds and Octavio Paz. The “world poetry summit” had some of the new greats. The Icelandic poet Sjón has worked with Björk, and is one of the few poets to be nominated for an Oscar. Anne Carson is still writing brilliant, blazing poems 25 years after I first heard her read. Claudia Rankine’s bestselling Citizen: An American Lyric has changed the way many Americans (and Brits) look at race. These were voices from the frontline of poetry, reminding us of its ability to cross borders and break through barriers of culture and power. But the event that gave me the Full Dickinson (or something like it) wasn’t with the stars. It was a reading by Ten: Poets of the New Generation, all included in a new Bloodaxe anthology of the same name. These are poets from diverse and black and minority ethnic backgrounds who have been involved in a national mentoring scheme. And my God, they are the real McCoy. Will Harris, Ian Humphreys, Yomi Sode and Raymond Antrobus were among the poets whose work brought tears to my eyes. I have been to an awful lot of poetry readings in my life. Trust me, most don’t make me cry. Great writing – even very good writing – often does. Some of the fiction up for Wednesday’s Man Booker prize does. Writing good prose is hard; writing good poetry is even harder. It’s a craft you have to study and practise and hone. It’s the opposite of instant. It’s all about nuance and music and metre. It’s all about layering. It’s all about depth. We need fewer instant thoughts on everything. We need more complexity and more depth. We need this because opinions are not all equal and art is not all good. “Good poetry,” as Hughes’s good friend Seamus Heaney once said, “is not just expectoration or self-regard or a semaphore for self’s sake. You want it to touch you at the melting point below the breast-bone and the beginning of the solar plexus.” You need, in other words, to engage your brain if you want to capture the human heart. In praise of snowflakes Like everyone else in this country, I’ve read and heard a lot in the past few years about this strange new species, the millennial. I know, for example, that they’re delicate creatures who have to be wrapped in swaddling clothes as they face the shocking rigours of office life. Last week I was trained by some in a new digital skill. I got flustered, missed a deadline and felt like flashing a sick note from my mum. The young ’uns kept the office running smoothly as they nursed me through my ordeal. They were patient. They were efficient. They were kind. Time, perhaps to ditch the dissing and recognise that some people’s “snowflakes” are made from sour grapes. Now try washing your hands It used to be relatively straightforward to nip to the loo. Now washbasins seem to be masterpieces of minimalism. Somewhere, there is water. Somewhere there is soap. Somewhere, there is even air. Quite where is anyone’s guess. Perhaps you’re meant to say abracadabra as you scour the place for sensors and wave your hands. At the Olympic park the other day I went through the ritual. Soap. Good. I waved my hands again. No water. Not a drop. I’m afraid I couldn’t help blaming Boris Johnson as I tried to find somewhere to wash off the sticky slime. • Christina Patterson is a writer, broadcaster and columnist This article was amended on 23 October 2017 to clarify that the Icelandic poet Sjón was nominated for an Oscar."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/17/high-fiving-over-the-sobbing-form-of-sweden-manager-jan-andersson","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T15:53:59Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | High-fiving over the sobbing form of Sweden manager Jan Andersson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/17/high-fiving-over-the-sobbing-form-of-sweden-manager-jan-andersson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/17/high-fiving-over-the-sobbing-form-of-sweden-manager-jan-andersson","fields":{"headline":"High-fiving over the sobbing form of Sweden manager Jan Andersson","bodyText":"...

WHEN NORN IRISH AND O’IRISH EYES ARE SMILING After the battering they’d just been subjected to by Storm Ophelia, the citizens of Ireland woke up hoping for some respite from the gods today. The violent hurricane wreaked no end of havoc, bringing both the Republic O’Ireland and Norn Iron to a standstill and both sides of the border duly ground to another halt at lunchtime as supporters of both teams tuned in to the draw for Russia 2018’s European play-offs. Faced with the prospect of having to take on seeded sides Switzerland, Croatia, Denmark or Italy, both the Republic O’Ireland and Norn Iron had one main objective – the avoidance of Italy, who probably aren’t actually the best team in the draw but whose innate “Italyness” means that when it comes to qualifying for the World Cup finals they will Always Find A Way. The ones they all didn’t want were eventually foisted upon Sweden, whose representative in Zurich is still shoulder-deep in the official Fifa tombola, on the off-chance there might be another ball in there boasting the name of a team they might actually have a chance of beating. But back to the Irelands, both of whom ended up delighted with their respective draws. O’Ireland got Denmark and will play their second leg at home, while Norn Iron will travel to Switzerland with their qualification on the line after a first leg at Fortress Windsor Park. And while neither team could have asked for easier opponents, we can only assume their rapture was nothing compared to that of their opponents. “It was interesting to be the first team out,” mused Norn Iron manager Michael O’Neill, high-fiving his near-namesake and O’Ireland gaffer Martin over the sobbing form of Sweden manager Jan Andersson. “Switzerland have had a great qualifying campaign: nine wins, one defeat. We’ve only lost one competitive game in Belfast in four years, which was against Germany, so we intend to make it a very difficult night against Switzerland.” In the draw nobody is talking about, incidentally, Croatia were paired with Greece. Meanwhile, in the O’Ireland camp, as various fans fell over each other in the stampede to book their flights to Russia, The Fiver’s famously pragmatic, knobbly stick-waving, green felt hat-wearing Irish cousin, Theme Pub O’Fiver, could be seen shaking his head sorrowfully, while whispering in the ear of the pig under his arm. “Be de hokey, dem Danes will be no pushover,” he murmured. “Dem toora-looing eejits seem to have forgotten dey have one of de very best players in de world. And as well as dat Nicklas Bendtner fella, dey also have Christian Eriksen.” For the Irelands, it’s the calm before another storm.

FIVER LETTERS “Monday night football is great/The start of the week that I hate/Is lifted up high/By those nice chaps at Sky/Placing hope right back on my plate … Soon enough, though, the truth becomes clear/The teams to compete sour my beer/I may sound quite foolish but when watching Pulis/Ninety minutes can seem like a year” – Marten Allen. “After reading yesterday’s Quote of the Day I must say I am now almost compelled to purchase Shay Given’s autobiography if anything, just to inform myself on how it is at all possible that a manager who, Shay states, fell out with the players, the back-up staff, the physios, the kitman, the press officers, the canteen workers, the car park lads and (presumably) his own reflection, can actually still find time to drag a hugely underachieving football club to win their first league title in 44 years” – Flavio L’Abbate. “So Shay Given has joined the line of footballers (OK, I can only think of Tony Adams) who have dished the dirt on their former bosses. In the case of Given, Roberto Mancini is the target, saying that he fell out with almost everybody at Citeh. There are many who may think that this sort of behaviour is rather bad form. However, for me, the worst thing that Given wrote was pairing the preposition ‘to’ with ‘differently’. Some things are just unforgivable” – Robert Darby. “Surely this, from Sunday’s Said and Done, should have made it as Quote of the Day for whichever day it was from: ‘Australian sauce firm MasterFoods, reacting after their BBQ Sauce bottle mascot made ‘one-finger gestures’ at Newcastle Jets fans who taunted him. “The behaviour of the BBQ Sauce bottle is not reflective of the family friendly MasterFoods way”’ – Wai Ming Loh.

Since 1999, it has also been the location for Bruce’s tour rehearsals. But Bruce hasn’t been its most raucous resident: in 1956, it was famously the scene of a large-scale riot at a Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers show, after which the mayor threatened to impose a ban on rock’n’roll performances. These days it is crowned by a large illuminated sign reading Greetings From Asbury Park – a reference to the title of Springsteen’s 1973 debut. • apboardwalk.com Atlantic City Fabled for its beaches, boardwalks and casinos, Atlantic City was also the subject of a 1982 Springsteen single (from the album Nebraska), a slightly desperate, faintly seedy invitation to get dressed up and meet in the city as trouble appeared to brew on the horizon. The song captured the new feel of the city: in the late 1970s, when it sat in heavy decline, a referendum was passed to legalise gambling here, and it swiftly became a destination for gambling, boxing bouts and a kind of Vegas-lite air. Bruce’s accompanying video showed the demolition of the city’s old Blenheim Hotel and shots of the earliest casinos, including Caesar’s, Playboy and Harrah’s. 39½ Institute Street, Freehold This wasn’t Springsteen’s first home (that’s now a church driveway on Randolph Street) but this white wooden home with a porch is where the young Bruce moved in 1958. Fans may recognise it from its appearance as part of the Born in the USA album artwork: on the lyric sheet, the words run over a picture of Springsteen leaning against a sycamore tree in the front yard. In his autobiography, he remembers it had “no hot water, [and] four tiny rooms”. Today, perhaps a little weary of the Bruce pilgrims, there is a stern “no solicitors” sign on the door. E Street, Belmar Highway 71 is the main arterial route through Belmar, a small, ocean-side borough of Monmouth County. A few blocks east of here is E Street, a short, one-way street where Bruce’s one-time keyboard player Dave Sancious’s mother lived, and where they would practise in the earliest days. Springsteen duly named his band the E Street Band in its honour. When the band was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, Springsteen spoke of how “real bands – real bands are made primarily from the neighborhood. From a real time and real place that exists for a little while, then changes and is gone forever.” The Stone Pony, Asbury Park The Stone Pony has stood here at Ocean Avenue since 1973, a 1,000-capacity venue that is now one of the most well-visited destinations for Springsteen fans. Though Bruce actually launched his career at the Upstage Club, over on Cookman Avenue, it’s the Stone Pony to which his name is forever tied, playing here more than any other venue. He first stepped on stage here in 1974, playing with The Blackberry Booze band, led by Steve Van Zandt and Southside Johnny. Though he never played the Stone Pony with the E Street Band (aside from fundraising shows), in the early 80s he often jammed with the Sunday night band Cats On a Smooth Surface. • 913 Ocean Avenue, stoneponyonline.com 7½ West End Court, Long Branch In the year he lived in this cottage, a block or so from the beach in Long Branch, the 25-year-old Springsteen wrote the bulk of his album Born to Run. Springsteen has spoken of the Aeolian piano that once stood in the living room and the kitchen table, where he used to write his lyrics, now sits in the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland. In 2009, it was bought by three Springsteen fans determined to preserve the house for musical posterity but, two years ago, they put it up for sale once more for just under $300,000. Highway 9 Though you might expect Springsteen’s lyrics to be heavy on the New Jersey specifics, he is in fact quite restrained in this department, favouring instead a more general sense of the state. Several of the references that do stand, however, are to roads: the New Jersey Turnpike, which appears in Living on the Edge of the World, Open all Night and State Trooper, and Route 88, which pops up in Spirit in the Night. US Route 9 has its moment of glory in Born to Run in the line “Sprung from cages on Highway 9 …” Should you care to drive it, Route 9 runs largely parallel to the Garden State Parkway, up through the suburbs of Atlantic City, and leaves the state via the George Washington Bridge. Madam Marie When he was in his late teens, from time to time Springsteen would visit a fortune teller named Madam Marie on the Asbury Park boardwalk – allegedly it was she who told him he was going to be famous. In fact, Madam Marie was the stage name of Marie Castello, and her small booth was nicknamed The Temple of Knowledge. Springsteen would often sit outside it and, in 1973, he referenced her in his song 4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy): “Did you hear the cops finally busted Madame [sic] Marie for telling fortunes better than they do …” and she enjoyed widespread fame thereafter. Castello died in 2008 but her business continues on the boardwalk. • 4th Avenue, green space on the Boardwalk Maxwell’s, Hoboken Maxwell’s is a musical institution in New Jersey but it played a part in the Springsteen story in 1985 when it was used as one of several New Jersey locations for his Glory Days video, directed by Hoboken resident John Sayles. A wistful look back to his younger years, the song’s opening verse recalls a chance meeting Springsteen had with his former Little League teammate, speedball pitcher Joe DePugh, at a bar in 1973, and the video’s baseball scenes were shot at Miller Stadium in West New York, New Jersey. • 1039 Washington Street, maxwellsnj.com The Student Prince, 911 Kingsley Street, Asbury Park In the late summer of 1971, Springsteen would meet E Street saxophonist Clarence Clemons – later nicknamed The Big Man – here at this Asbury Park bar. Clemons was playing with Norman Seldin &amp; the Joyful Noyze at the Wonder Bar down the street and after his show walked up to see Springsteen’s set. The story runs that there was a heavy storm that night and as Clemons opened the door to the club the wind was so strong it blew the door off its hinges. Clemons too was thunderstruck – albeit by Springsteen’s performance. “It was so urgent, so real, and so exciting to me,” he told Springsteen biographer Peter Ames Carlin. “It was like I’d been searching for so long and now, thank God, I am finally, finally, where I’m supposed to be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/17/worlds-crisis-over-issue-of-borders-and-migration","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T16:22:13Z","webTitle":"World’s crisis over issue of borders and migration | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/worlds-crisis-over-issue-of-borders-and-migration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/17/worlds-crisis-over-issue-of-borders-and-migration","fields":{"headline":"World’s crisis over issue of borders and migration","bodyText":"I agree with Gary Younge that borders “exist, by definition, to separate us from others” and that the Berlin Wall was built with “the deliberate intention to trap people in a place they might not want to be” (Border controls are a sign we value money more than people, 16 October). However, let us not forget that the wall’s construction was initially met with considerable relief by the west. The US and UK saw it as an end to communist ambitions to retake the whole of Berlin; they felt that it would not have been built if such plans were in the pipeline. The western allies concluded that the possibility of a military conflict with the Soviet Union over Berlin had significantly decreased. The wall’s erection was therefore an important step in helping to de-escalate tensions between east and west at a time when the cold war was at its hottest. Joe McCarthy Dublin • Gary Younge’s otherwise excellent article omits one key fact. The reason he kept “butting into” the Berlin Wall on his trip to Berlin in the early 1980s was that the people it was primarily designed to confine were those living in the West Berlin exclave. The GDR’s term for it was the “antifaschistischer schutzwall” – the anti-fascist rampart – and it was deemed to be necessary to stop the then Federal Republic from undermining the economy of the new German Democratic Republic. Of course, it also brought East Berliners into very close contact with a border that impeded their free movement, but confinement was on both Germanys’ minds. Janet Fraser London • Gary Younge makes some valid points about the effects of national borders on the global poor. However, he should be careful what he wishes for. National borders can enable a welfare state to develop by limiting the number of people who can call on its services. I agree that there is an element of unfairness in the fact that I can use the NHS by having the good luck to have been born in the UK. However, if anybody in the world could come and use it I am not sure it would exist in its current form. Rebecca Linton Leicester • Gary Younge’s dystopian view of a world with no curbs on migration will increase the rise of the anti-immigrant right, as was seen on Sunday in Austria (Austrian elections won by conservative accused of playing the far right’s game, 16 October). It is time to stop always seeing migration just in terms of the rights of generally more affluent migrants. The rights of the original host country not to lose permanently their brightest and best must also warrant consideration, as should the views of the majority in the recipient counties who want less migration. The major cause of population growth in most rich countries is now immigration. This has led to well-founded public concerns about uncontrolled mass migration. A Gallup poll showed that about 630 million of the world’s adults would like to leave their country and move somewhere else permanently, with 42 million expressing a preference for the UK, a destination second only to the US. If net migration continues at about recent levels, then the UK population is expected to rise by nearly 8 million people in 15 years, almost the equivalent of the population of Greater London (8.7 million). Population growth is projected to approach 80 million in 25 years and keep rising. Younge is right that nation states are a recent phenomena and mass migration is as old as humanity. But because of domestic pressures, the nation state will increasingly make large-scale permanent migration a thing of the past. The question will be: will their governments inevitably be rightwing or will progressive politicians grasp this rational political inevitability. Colin Hines (Author of Progressive Protectionism), London • Gary Younge must be congratulated for proposing a brilliant method for controlling immigration. Removing all barriers to immigration will not only increase the supply of labour; it will also raise the return on capital investment, thereby increasing economic growth. However, soon there will be more workers chasing fewer jobs, as the rate at which jobs are created would be much lower than they are filled. This will push down wages. As there are no barriers to immigration, workers will continue to pour in, pushing down wages even further. This process of downward wage spiral will continue until wage difference in Britain and immigrants’ countries of origin becomes insignificant or zero. The immigration will then stop, but it would leave Britain with massive unemployment and a divided society. Randhir Singh Bains Gants Hill, Essex • Halfway through his utopian thought, Gary Younge mentions the free movement of capital. Through the wretched Brexit referendum all eyes were directed toward the free movement of people, while the other three principles of the EU were essentially ignored. Our public broadcasters did a poor job of raising questions about capital movement. The plutocrat-owned press had no interest in raising the matter – and they got their miserable, misanthropic way. The only possible positive aspect of our recent political hiatus is that it has, hopefully, given a lot of people a much-needed education in political science. Robin Le Mare Allithwaite, Cumbria • At last someone has the courage to declare the principle that “We should all be able to roam the planet and live, love, and create where we wish”. I hope Gary Younge will continue to develop his critique of restrictions on migration. He might start by pointing out the enormous waste of resources spent on passports, border guards and all the rest of the bureaucratic nightmare that is the UK Border Agency. He could then look at the enormous waste of human resources caused by refusing to allow refugees to find places where they can live safely and decently. How many potential Marks and Spencers are currently living in refugee camps, or in Yarl’s Wood? Go for it, Gary!
