That's all Brexit ever was","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“Fantasy” is the right word for British politics as spring sputters into summer, with Brexit’s chariot hurrying near. Not the good kind, mind you. Rather than a pleasant daydream, we’re dealing instead with collective delusion, in which cabinet ministers, walled off from reality, waste weeks debating customs plans that the EU has already rejected. So it’s not surprising that a senior EU figure has dismissed the government’s entire approach to the negotiations as make believe. “To paraphrase The Leopard by Tomasi di Lampedusa,” the official said, “I have the impression that the UK thinks everything has to change on the EU’s side so that everything can stay the same for the UK.” As if to underline the point, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, issued his own warning about the increasing likelihood of a “disruptive Brexit”. In one sense the paralysis on the UK side is understandable. All of the options are bad. The boss of HMRC told MPs this week that so-called “max-fac” would cost £20bn; a customs partnership would cost £3bn. The only no-cost solution – remaining in the customs union and single market – has already been rejected on the basis that the public hates EU regulations like the ban on mobile phone roaming charges, and loves free trade deals, with their promise of chlorinated chicken and expensive medicines for all. Even as they publicly trumpet the benefits of their preferred plans, it’s hard to imagine the ministers involved are not privately frightened to take the plunge. Every course of action will result in increased poverty and bureaucracy. Hence the deadlock, hence the retreat into fantasy. For some, however, Brexit isn’t the problem. It’s the helpless flapping of politicians that is ruining everything. If only they were less craven, less factious, less captured by the Whitehall system. Then everything might have been alright. Dominic Cummings, who led the official Vote Leave campaign, published an open letter to Tory MPs and donors this week. He took the government to task, accusing them of having “botched” Brexit by triggering article 50 without adequate preparation. “This immediately closed many positive branching histories and created major problems,” he wrote. He further complains that “The government promised … to do a number of things that are logically, legally and practically incompatible including leaving the single market and customs union, avoiding ‘friction’ and changing nothing around the Irish border (as defined by the EU), and having no border in the Irish Sea.” Cummings is an intriguing character – he was described by David Cameron as a “career psychopath” and has a reputation as an extremely clever but irascible free-thinker. (He’s going to be played by Benedict Cumberbatch in a film about the referendum). What’s less often recognised is that he is a utopian, someone for whom reality just isn’t good enough. And his “vision” of a revolution in governance played a not insignificant part in creating the dystopia in which we currently languish. He backed leave because he wanted to “break the system open”, and believed “alternatives to the EU and UN are vital if we are to develop the international cooperation on big problems that we need”. Britain could lead the way. Those “positive branching histories” are the possible routes to a new Jerusalem he believed Brexit could open up. The roads the country’s leaders could take if they were equal to the challenge and grasped the nature of the prize. The problem is they were always vastly outnumbered by “negative branching histories”. We have the system we have. That doesn’t mean it can’t be changed. But the chances of it being swept away in a tsunami of enlightenment are negligible. No matter how much you might wish it otherwise, many of our successful politicians will also be craven and factious. Faced with the complexity of unravelling 40 years of legal, political and economic cooperation, the UK government was always going to stumble. Theresa May, or whoever else became PM, would naturally come under intense political pressure to trigger article 50 quickly. A split vote was always going to mean there would be no mandate for revolutionary change. In other words: Brexit could only have worked as a utopian fantasy. As a project in reality, it was doomed from the start. I don’t know why Cummings et al failed to reckon with these realities. Maybe they thought the gamble, even with those odds, was worth it. But that’s reckless, and brings to mind Isaiah Berlin quoting Alexander Herzen: “Do you truly wish to condemn the human beings alive today to the sad role of caryatids supporting a floor for others some day to dance on?” Because we have been condemned – to lower standards of living, less consumer protection, less cooperation in the fields of science, the environment and diplomacy. And Cummings’ blame game seems a bit of a fantasy itself, given that it was his idea of “perfect” that turned out to be the enemy of what was good for the rest of us."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/25/yes-irish-pro-abortion-side-politial-class-media-illiberal-view","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T08:20:44Z","webTitle":"The Irish anti-abortion side will lose.

There’s nothing good about that","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Taoiseach Leo Varadkar – the Irish prime minister – has declared that he won’t be encouraging celebrations if, as seems inevitable, the yes side wins in the abortion referendum. We won’t, then, be treated to the same wild exuberance that met the gay marriage referendum vote, at least not officially. But he can be forgiven for a modestly self-congratulatory tone to his address to the Irish parliament on Wednesday, its last sitting before the referendum, in which he was joined by the leader of the opposition, Micheál Martin. They – the party leaders and ministers – have won it, along with the broadcasters who followed them faithfully through the campaign. It appears that at least a third of the electorate will oppose repealing the eighth amendment to the constitution, but those voters are not represented by the big political hitters – the sole party against repeal is tiny Renua, which has precisely no seats in parliament. Neither do they have any heavyweights in the broadcast or print media to express their views; I can think of two regular columnists for the main papers who are against repealing the abortion ban in the constitution – that’s it. Put it this way. Imagine a rerun of the Brexit referendum in which, as before, the big political hitters were lined up on one side; but with no equivalent of Boris Johnson or Gisela Stuart on the other side and no Daily Mail or Telegraph or Spectator either. I do realise that this may sound like rather a lovely idea, but this isn’t to equate the issues, just to convey a sense of the sheer imbalance in the campaign. Look at the ballot paper: Brexit offered a neutral choice between remain or leave, but in this referendum yes (positive!) is for repeal; no (negative, sad face) is for retaining the amendment. It’s loaded from the off. The church is (prudently) almost invisible in all this, though the archbishop of Dublin did let congregations know that he would be voting no, after admitting the church had in the past taken a narrow and moralistic approach to lone parents. The received take on the thing is as follows: backward, conservative, religious on one hand; comedians, U2, the Irish Times and #MeToo feminists on the other. Oh, and Mary Lou McDonald, Sinn Féin’s leader. Let’s not forget her. She’s suggesting that if the amendment is repealed and abortion is legislated for, women will travel from the north to the Republic of Ireland for abortions, an inversion of the present state of things, whereby nine or 10 women a day travel to England for them. But maybe the received wisdom is just wrong. An alternative reading of the amendment is that Ireland is ahead of the game in acknowledging the human rights of the foetus. Certainly, a foetus can be aborted if it poses a risk to the mother’s life, but what the amendment does is acknowledge that its humanity isn’t contingent on the mother. It has rights in the constitution by virtue of being a human – in the section to do with inherent rights. And that is a progressive thing. The alternative, that a foetus is a baby insofar as its mother says it is, is absurd. If Ireland votes for repeal, it will blot out, annul, prenatal human rights. It doesn’t seem liberal to me. • Melanie McDonagh is a freelance journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/25/football-transfer-rumours-tottenham-to-sign-wilfried-zaha","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T07:58:44Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Tottenham to sign Wilfried Zaha?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/25/football-transfer-rumours-tottenham-to-sign-wilfried-zaha","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/25/football-transfer-rumours-tottenham-to-sign-wilfried-zaha","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Tottenham to sign Wilfried Zaha?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Mauricio Pochettino sat down beside himself, draped his right arm across his shoulders and looked smilingly into the camera as Spurs staged another shoot to mark the signing of a big new contract. Then the manager ordered the club to get down to more business. And so, Spurs are preparing lucrative offers for Kayla the Eagle, the Crystals cheerleading ensemble and a bust of Roy Hodgson, all in an effort to make Wilfried Zaha feel at home at the new White Hart Lane. Then all Spurs will have to do is convince Crystal Palace to sell their prize asset, so we could be about to find out whether Daniel Levy likes being hardballed. The Spurs chairman is already wincing in anticipation, with £100m having been mentioned as a possible fee for Zaha. But Levy has promised Pochettino he will do his utmost to land the manager’s transfer targets so he might just have to grin and bear it. He does, at least, have alternatives: if Palace won’t cough up Zaha, Spurs will turn their attentions to Anthony Martial, whom Manchester United rated about as highly as they rated Zaha in the end. Spurs also have some leverage from the fact that United want to sign Toby Alderweireld. But there are doubts as to whether Martial wants to go to Palace, especially with Juventus also in the frame. And why are Juventus in the frame? Because they need a replacement for Douglas Costa, who excelled on loan from Bayern Munich last season but is not expected to return to Turin despite a purchase option because he is about to become the subject of a £75m transfer to … Manchester United. Circles within circles. But Pochettino doesn’t want to hear excuses. He has no truck whatsoever with people who promise big but then flop just short of the finish. No siree. So once Zaha and/or Martial are in the bag, he wants Spurs to lure Ryan Sessegnon from Fulham and the centre-back Matthijs de Ligt from Ajax. And he’s half-thinking about making a late attempt to attract Emre Can, even though the Liverpool midfielder has been fluttering eyelids at Juventus for months. Liverpool, meanwhile, are poised not only to strength their armoury by bringing Nabil Fekir from Lyon but are also plotting a swoop for the German striker Timo Werner. You heard it here 43rd. “The World Cup is not about auditioning for Barcelona, Madrid, Liverpool or whoever,” stormed the striker to Socrates magazine and he is of course quite right: Liverpool hope to have the deal done before the World Cup. Another striker potentially on the move is Samuel Eto’o. You thought he’d already retired, didn’t you? But the 37-year-old played in Turkey last season and still looks sharp enough to have aroused the interest of Lazio. The Italian club might also be interested in Frank Lampard if the ex-midfielder were not on the brink of becoming the new manager of Derby County. Finally, Arsenal are after the Roma midfielder Lorenzo Pellegrini."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/live/2018/may/26/irish-abortion-referendum-result-count-begins-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T17:53:15Z","webTitle":"Irish abortion referendum: yes wins with 66.4% – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/may/26/irish-abortion-referendum-result-count-begins-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2018/may/26/irish-abortion-referendum-result-count-begins-live","fields":{"headline":"Irish abortion referendum: yes wins with 66.4% – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The map shows the breakdown of results: an overwhelming yes to repealing the eighth. That brings our live coverage to an end. Thanks for reading and commenting. Our full report on today’s historic result is here. That’s it then: as those two shock exit polls predicted last night, by a margin of 66.4% for yes to 33.6% for no and on a record turnout of 64.51%, Ireland has voted to repeal the eighth amendment of its constitution, which since 1983 has effectively prohibited abortion in all bar exceptional circumstances. Here’s is Guardian Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald’s full story on the events of a historic day, what led up to them, and what they might mean. Here is Harriet Sherwood’s explanation of what will happen to Ireland’s abortion legislation now, and how the government’s planned new regime compares with the rest of the world. And here is her article about how the spotlight in the abortion debate is now likely to switch to Northern Ireland. The final three results have been confirmed, and as expected Donegal was the only one of Ireland’s 40 constituencies to vote no: Sligo-Leitrim 59.38% yes, 40.62% no Cork East 64.12% yes, 35.88% no Donegal 51.87% no, 48.13% yes My colleague at Dublin Castle Emma Graham-Harrison tells me that as the results were announced, the crowds in the courtyard began chanting, “Savita, Savita!” - the name of the Indian dentist who died of sepsis in 2012 after being refused an abortion during a protracted miscarriage. Here we are, the final result. Returning officer Barry Ryan is announcing the result: Yes: 1,429,981 NO: 723,632 A majority of 706,349 for yes That’s 66.4% for yes, and 33.6% for no Ireland’s eighth amendment has therefore been repealed. So while we’re all waiting patiently for the final result – it’s been an hour-and-a-half since the last constituency declared – it seems at least someone in the crowd at Dublin Castle has a nice sense of humour: Readers have been telling the Guardian about what they hope will happen next. Katie, film-maker: For both sides, this is a very difficult and emotional topic and I hope that people can be gentle and empathetic with each other. I hope that women are treated with respect. I hope that women are given compassion. I hope that women are given the ability to make the extremely difficult and painful decision about an unplanned pregnancy without needing to feel shame or facing barriers. I hope that women are given the option to have quality medical advice and facilities if they so choose. Lloyd Meadhbh Houston, student: In the short term, I hope that this result will improve the lives of women in Ireland and Northern Ireland, allowing access to free, safe, and legal terminations to women in the south, and a shorter, more manageable journey for women in the North. In the long term, I believe this result offers further evidence of the absurdity, hypocrisy, and cruelty of the prohibition of abortion in the North of Ireland. 26 counties down, six to go. The fight isn’t over. Louse Kinsella, mother: I hope the government will put in place legislation, with sufficient financial supports and recruitment to support the proposals. I also hope that there will be sufficient supports and education put in place with a target of Ireland having the lowest abortion rate in the world. Abortion should always be the last resort and I think targeting a very low rate through proper eduction and empowerment of women, men, and children combined with proper healthcare and social supports is something both sides of this campaign can support. Robert McCourt, retired: I think the government will move quickly to enshrine the result into law. I think it is necessary for society to build upon this result and that the people who voted no can be encouraged to understand the result and perhaps give it some form of support. Maeve Quinlan, student: I hope that we can move forward and bring in the proposed legislation without conflict. I hope the no side respectfully accept this democratic result, and do not engage in hurtful and distasteful protesting outside medical centres and clinics. These protests as seen in the UK and US are misguided and aim to shame those seeking medical support. Turnout has been confirmed at 64.51%, more than three points higher than in the same-sex marriage plebiscite in 2015 and a record in an Irish referendum. Rain has started at Dublin Castle, and people are fleeing to shelter at the edges or pulling out umbrellas, reports Sinéad Baker. But very few people are leaving. Everyone remains eager to hear the final announcement. Grainne Teggart, Amnesty International’s Northern Ireland campaigns manager, has written for the Guardian on the urgent need to now reform the abortion law there, which dates back to 1861 – literally from the Victorian era – and makes abortion illegal in almost every circumstance, even in cases of rape or fatal foetal abnormalities: With legislation soon to follow Saturday’s result in Ireland, we may soon see women in Northern Ireland catching trains over the border rather than planes over the sea for this healthcare. But we’ll still be forced on those lonely and difficult journeys. The UK government cannot continue to turn a blind eye to this absurd situation. Westminster has the power and responsibility to bring Northern Ireland abortion law in to line with human rights standards, but is choosing instead to be complicit in our harm and suffering and is continuing to deny us equality. For the past 16 months, Northern Ireland has been without devolved government. But this is no excuse - having a Stormont government in place would not relieve the UK government of its responsibility to ensure that women’s right to abortion is upheld. Devolution is no justification for the denial of women’s rights. A free abortion service in England is a helpful form of remedy, but it’s not the solution. In parallel with this, we must also see a process to bring about long overdue law reform in Northern Ireland. It is important to remember that it’s the most vulnerable and marginalised women who are unable to travel and left most at risk by the current laws. We’re talking about women who have experienced domestic violence, women without confirmed immigration status, young girls who can’t fly without an adult, and those with health complications. Sky’s Darren McCaffrey in Donegal has a similar report to RTÉ’s from East Cork: it looks like the results from the last three constituencies (Sligo-Leitrim is the third) will be announced alongside or after the final national result. The overall outcome, though, is not in any doubt: unofficial but generally accurate tallies suggest Donegal is the only constituency to have voted no, with yes looking a comfortable winner in East Cork and Sligo-Leitrim. Here is the Guardian’s full video report on the day that fully two-thirds of Ireland’s voters backed the repeal of article 40.3.3, which since 1983 has effectively prohibited abortion in almost all cases: The crowd at Dublin Castle cheers as Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald holds up a sign saying “The North is next ...” reports Sinéad Baker. We’re still waiting on the final three constituencies: Cork East, Sligo-Leitrim, and Donegal, which observers are predicting may be the only one to back no. RTÉ is reporting that the Cork County returning officer has closed the count centre in Ballincollig. The results for Cork East have reportedly been sent to Dublin Castle and will be announced after the national result. Peter Boylan, leading yes campaigner and chair of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, gets a hero’s welcome in Dublin Castle, with the crowd chanting “Peter, Peter, Peter”. Boylan came under fierce attack from some institute members when he claimed that the majority supported repeal, a claim he stood by earlier this month. Offered without comment: The 18-to-24 age group in Ireland has been strongly pro-repeal and many young people have contacted the Guardian. One of them, Olivia Malone, 18, a student from County Wexford, canvassed during her exams for the yes campaign: I graduated on Thursday, and was out with most of my year group till the early hours of the morning. I had a great time, but what worried me was whether my all girl’s school would drag themselves out to vote the next day. Yet on Friday morning I woke up to texts in the 6th Year group chat - the girls were all encouraging each other to vote. The youth involvement in this has been unlike any other election I’ve ever witnessed. I’m floating on cloud nine. I’m totally astonished by the massive landslide. The general feeling among strong yes campaigners recently was cautious hope, and I know most that I’ve talked to predicted a yes vote in the 50s, but this is beyond anything I can imagine. If you’d like to share your reaction, you can do so here. Dublin Bay South votes 78.49% yes, 21.51% no. That leaves three constituencies still to declare. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has just tweeted this picture of himself and the expectant crowd at Dublin Castle: The Irish comedian David O’Doherty is at Dublin castle for the announcement, reports Sinéad Baker. He remembers growing up in an Ireland where most parts of the country voted against permitting divorce in 1995: I always thought there was two Irelands ... but that died yesterday. It died with marriage equality and then it really died yesterday. Cork South West is 64.51% yes, 35.49% no Dublin Mid-West 73.27% yes, 26.73% no Kerry 58.27% yes, 41.73% no The crowd at Dublin Castle is cheering on the politicians that have been particularly active on the yes side of this campaign, including Leo Varadkar and health minister Simon Harris, says Sinéad Baker: Seven constituencies remain: Kerry, Sligo-Leitrim, Cork South-West, Cork East, Dublin Mid-West, Dublin Bay South and Donegal, which observers are suggesting might be the only one to vote against repealing the eighth amendment. With half a dozen constituencies left to declare, Ireland is turning purple: More results: Cavan-Monaghan 55.5% yes, 44.5% no Mayo 57.07% yes, 42.93% no And the Taoiseach has arrived at Dublin Castle, says RTE2’s man on the spot: Readers in Northern Ireland have been contacting the Guardian urging abortion reform there. Aoibhinn, who’s studying for A-levels in Belfast, says she’s relieved about the result in Ireland but feels isolated as a young woman in Northern Ireland: We are now poised to be the only place within these islands without access to abortion. I hope with all my heart that the forces that campaigned to repeal the eighth will now lend us a hand in dragging our laws into the 21st century. Pete Doughty, a civil servant from Belfast, would like to see legislation change too: Abortion is never, ever an easy option to choose ... I’ve seen friends of mine here in Northern Ireland having to take that decision – and then having to travel – alone, stressed, in comparative secrecy, and at great expense – to England and back, at the expense of their dignity and peace of mind. Women in Northern Ireland have always been under the same pressure as Irish woman, but after this result they will now, tragically, stand alone. That can’t be allowed to continue. Westminster must now step in and give Northern Irish women the right to be believed and trusted that our socially conservative politicians will always wish to deny them. If you’d like to share your reaction, you can do so here. Another couple of results, bringing us – according to RTÉ - up to 30 out of 40 constituencies: Cork North-West 60.10% yes, 39.90% no Longford-Westmeath 58.27% yes, 41.73% no Derek Mooney, a former Fianna Fáil government adviser, has an very interesting take on the scale of the yes vote and what lay behind it: The general assumption right up to the last week was that yes would win decisively, with a comfortable margin, leaving the no side in the low-40s nationally and tipping just over the 50% mark in the western, more rural constituencies. Not for the first time the voters proved the pundits wrong. And the movement to yes happened long before the first posters hit the lampposts. Many traditional, middle-ground voters – including those who still see themselves as pro-life - decided some time back that it was time to take the issue of abortion out of the Irish constitution. This referendum was about nuance, and Irish voters showed that they get nuance. So do voters in most countries. They know that very few issues are simply black or white. Many voters, including those who had real qualms about some aspects of what the government proposes in its legislation, accepted the nuances and complexities, considered them and – on balance – accepted the case for repeal. This is the seismic change that has happened in Ireland today. In a world that seems destined to rush to this or that easy populist position, Irish voters took the time to inform themselves. They listened to the expert opinions from all sides and weighed the arguments. The political system afforded them that opportunity by having a long pre-campaign period where arguments, for and against, were calmly made. If only the Brexit referendum had been handled so calmly and sensibly. Three more Dublin results are in: Dublin-Fingal, 76.96% yes, 23.04% no Dublin Rathdown 76.10% yes, 23.90% no Dublin South-West 74.91% yes, 25.09% no More from Sinéad Baker at the Together for Yes festivities in Dublin: Those who flew home to vote are well represented at the yes campaign’s official gathering to watch the results. I talked to Hannah Little, a co-founder of the London-Irish Abortion Rights Campaign, two weeks ago in London and then she spoke of the importance of the result for many of the Irish living abroad. “A lot of people have plans to go home and have a family,” she said. “I think this referendum will signal whether Ireland is a country we want to bring children up in.” Catching up with her at today’s event, she said that today’s result would “absolutely” hearten Irish women around the world. “It shows us the country has grown up and matured. It cares about women.” A lot women that I’ve spoken to today have expressed similar sentiments. “I’m proud to be Irish,” is a common refrain. Dublin West has voted 74.02% for yes, 25.98% for no Back in Roscommon, Lisa O’Carroll has met more cheerful voters – and one not so happy. The DUP has spoken, and it’s not happy about the prospect of abortion law reform in Northern Ireland: Another clutch of results, still all one-way traffic: Dún Laoghaire 77.06% yes, 22.94% no Dublin Bay North 74.69% yes, 25.31% no Dublin South-Central 74.79%, 25.21% Henry McDonald sounds a note of caution about abortion reform coming any time soon to Northern Ireland: It is not as simple as Theresa May and the British government deciding to impose or extend the 1967 Abortion Act to the region – the only part of the UK where terminations in most cases are illegal in local hospitals. Devolution is currently in suspended animation in a traditional orange-green row over an Irish Language Act and other cultural issues and even if the Northern Ireland assembly was restored, a majority of members oppose abortion reform especially on the unionist benches. Pro-abortion reform parliamentarians at Westminster such as Stella Creasy could move a private member’s bill in this hiatus period of de facto direct rule from London. But when this was tried recently by another Labour MP for gay marriage equality (another social reform blocked principally by the DUP), backbench Tories refused to cooperate and the private bill fell by the wayside. It is hard to see too how May’s minority Conservative government would agree to a free vote on introducing abortion into Northern Ireland given the power the DUP exercises at Westminster where its votes keep her in No 10 Downing Street. The DUP would be highly likely to exert its parliamentary muscle to pressurise the Tories not to back any Labour sponsored private member’s bill when it came to the abortion question. The abortion controversy on the island of Ireland will rage on, albeit only now on the northern side of the Irish border. Over half the constituency results are now in, and the count stands at 66% and 34%, on a record turnout of 63.9%. The national broadcaster RTÉ says the final national results should be announced within an hour. Two more: Meath West 63.95% yes, 36.05% no Galway West 65.95% yes, 34.05% no Some readers who’ve got in touch with the Guardian have described how difficult the referendum campaign has been because of the sensitivity of the issue. Michelle, a writer and mother of two young boys who lives in Dublin, says she was one of the “silent” yes voters: I was one of those women, partly because of the very conservative workplace that I am employed in of but also because I did not want to offend no voters, who did not discuss my opinions. Why, I wonder now, did I not feel comfortable to speak out, to be honest, to loudly shout how passionately I felt about the need for yes? Because I grew up in an Ireland that diminished the rights of women, punished women for being unmarried mothers and in some cases incarcerated those women and removed their children from them. When she heard the result, Michelle said: I felt like a weight had lifted, that shame and stigma surrounding so many women in my own family had been wiped away. It was acceptable at last for a woman to make her own decisions and live her life without judgment. Kate, a scientist and mother living in rural Ireland, said she voted yes, but reluctantly: Yes is the right decision but discussion needs to continue regarding support for women in Ireland. We need to examine our society at a deeper level and have more discussion about factors such as contraception, social housing ... mental health. Abortion is the last resort for women. I would like to see both sides working together now to make family life better in this country and abortion as rare as possible. If you’d like to share your reaction, you can do so here. It looks like Donegal is shaping up to be the only place to spoil the yes campaign’s party, reportedly by a very slender margin: More results, thick and fast. And once-conservative Roscommon confirmed as yes: Limerick City 66.87% yes, 33.13% Louth 66.55% yes, 33.45% no Meath East 69.21% yes, 30.79% no Kildare North 73.56% yes, 26.44% no Dublin North-West 73.08% yes, 26.92% no Roscommon-Galway 57.21% yes, 42.79% no Ireland’s children’s minister, Katherine Zappone, has stressed to Sinéad Baker the need to enact legislation the country’s new abortion legislation as soon as possible: The minister for health has promised to publish the bill before the summer and it would be our intention to ensure that we bring that forward before the end of this year. Until that happens women still need to travel or to take an abortion pill from online delivery that’s illegal or unsafe until we get the better law in place. Zappone also thanked the women who had shared their stories of how they were affected by the eighth amendment: It’s because of their willingness to tell their stories that they were able to change the hearts and the minds of the citizens but also many of the politicians too. Another result: Offaly 58.05% yes, 41.95% no. Calls are mounting for the British government to take steps to reform the strict abortion regime in Northern Ireland following the Republic’s historic decision. Labour MP Stella Creasy: This weekend 2.5 million Irish women won the basic human right to make choices themselves about their own bodies - those who fought this victory did so because these rights are at the heart of equality. Yet as we celebrate, we cannot rest knowing a million women in Northern Ireland do not have the same choice and that the UN has accused the U.K. government of cruel and inhuman treatment of their own citizens as a result. We cannot let Northern Irish women be left behind. Cara Sanquest form the London-Irish Abortion Rights Campaign: The result today shows that the people of Ireland want to provide care and compassion at home. This was a grassroots campaign, with women’s voices at the centre. Women in Northern Ireland, who do not have access to abortion in their own country, are at the forefront of our minds today. Eleven women from the island of Ireland boarded planes this morning to access abortion services abroad. We’re looking forward to a swift passing of the legislation, and that the momentum from this result will carry on with our campaign to decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland. Grainne Teggart, Northern Ireland campaigns manager for Amnesty International: The referendum result is a momentous win for women’s rights. This marks the beginning of a new Ireland - one that really does trust and value its women. The UK Government can no longer turn a blind eye and deny us equality, they must urgently legislate for reform which must include decriminalisation of abortion. We cannot be left behind in a corner of the UK and on the island of Ireland as second-class citizens. It’s becoming a procession: Wexford has voted 68.40% for yes and 31.60% for no. Limerick County 58.08% yes, 41.92% no Tipperary 59.15% yes, 40.85% no Kildare South 70.66% yes, 29.34% no Clare 64.28% yes, 35.72% no The president of March for Life, the US anti-abortion rally that backed the SaveThe8th campaign, has reacted with dismay to the projected result. The group’s president, Jeanne Mancini, said: We are deeply saddened to learn that many Irish people voted against love and life by repealing the 8thamendment. Americans know from experience that there will be many grave and irreversible consequences to this decision, including the loss of precious lives. A study released this week shows that legalising abortion greatly increases the number of children whose lives are terminated in the womb. Though they are the first, unborn children are not the only victims; abortion harms mothers too. Life is the empowering decision. We grieve for the great loss this beautiful country will endure and we pray that they find a way to reverse this unfortunate decision. Another result is in: Laois 61.35% yes, 38.65% no They’re having a ball down at Dublin Castle, too: Sinéad Baker is with the Together for Yes campaign who have gathered yes campaigners in a Dublin hotel to watch the results come in. A diverse crowd of hundreds of people have gathered. Local organisers from all parts of the country are here with their teams alongside the politicians and students who have been key to the campaign. Results coming in are met with huge cheers and some stunned disbelief. Listen to the delight as Carlow-Kilkenny votes 63.5% yes: And another. With seven constituencies declared, the vote now stands at 68.7% in favour of repeal overall. Waterford 69.43% yes, 30.57% no Two more results have come in, again in line with last night’s exit polls: Wicklow 74.26% yes, 25.74% no Carlow-Kilkenny, 63.50% yes, 36.50% no Orla O’Connor, co-director of the Together for Yes campaign, celebrates “a monumental day for women in Ireland”, saying the expected referendum vote is “about a rejection of an Ireland that treats women as second-class citizens”. Readers have been getting in touch to share their reaction to the result. Chelsea, a student teacher in Dublin, is very happy that the yes vote was so high. “I’m over the moon to know that Ireland has voted so strongly in favour of removing legislation that is potentially damaging to women and families in our country. I think it’s an overwhelming turn out for a referendum and proves the importance of making a change.” Philomena Mason, 62, from Galway says “it’s a wonderful day for Ireland”. Mason voted against the amendment being included in the constitution in 1983 and thinks the change has come about about because of the testimony of women during this referendum campaign. “A lot of women have told harrowing stories of crisis pregnancies where they had no option but to travel to the UK for terminations and felt strongly that this care should be made available in their own country.” Nick, a junior doctor who lives in Ireland, thinks that the result is a huge win for women, doctors and legislators so that it will now be possible “to provide healthcare, compassion and support at home rather than turning our backs on people in need”. Rossa Bunworth, 67, a retired public servant from Dublin says he’s “stunned and delighted as a parent and grandparent of women and girls who are trusted at last”. If you’d like to share your reaction, you can do so here. Sinéad Baker in Dublin has spoken to a proud and happy local: And here is an opposing point of view: The crowds are starting to assemble at Dublin Castle, where Ireland’s health minister, Simon Harris, is speaking, RTÉ reports: The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, has told the BBC that “action will now have to be taken” over Northern Ireland, set to be the only part of the UK and Ireland where abortions are outlawed bar exceptional circumstances: I believe in the principle of the right to choose - I think in the rest of the UK we have a sensible balance. The position in Northern Ireland is now highly anomalous and I think, probably, action will now have to be taken. Since there is, effectively, direct rule from Westminster, the government has responsibility and it can and should take the opportunity to deal with this issue properly. The official turnout has been given as 62.2%, an increase of 2% over Ireland’s referendum on same-sex marriage: Cork North-Central is in: 64.02% for yes, 35.98% for no. Here’s what the count looks like in Roscommon-Galway, and presumably a good many counting centres up and down the country this afternoon: We’ve had two more official results showing a clear lead for repeal: Dublin Central: Yes 76.51%, No 23.49% Cork South-Central: Yes 68.84%, No 31.16% The Guardian’s Henry McDonald is at Dublin Castle where the official results will be announced later today: Unlike the result of the same-sex marriage equality referendum three years ago, there will be no giant screens on display at Dublin Castle today broadcasting the overall national result of the vote to legalise abortion. Although no one is saying it too loudly, I understand “security reasons” have convinced the authorities at the former seat of British power in Ireland not to hold a giant screening of the main result this afternoon. These were based on concerns about possible ugly scenes emerging between yes and no camp followers arguing on the cobblestones of the ancient square. Which all seems a bit much given firstly that there appear to be few supporters of the no campaign around at present, and secondly, that despite some minor incidents the 2018 referendum has not been marred by ugly, fractious scenes on the campaign trail. The first official constituency result is in, from Galway East: The British government cannot ignore the expected massive endorsement for abortion reform in the Irish Republic while a near total ban on terminations remains over the border in Northern Ireland, Amnesty International has said. While describing the projected victory for the yes side as a “momentous win for women’s rights” the global human rights group said their counterparts in Northern Ireland were “still prosecuted by a Victorian-era abortion ban”. Northern Ireland is now the only region in the UK where the 1967 Abortion Act does not apply, said Grainne Teggart, Amnesty International’s Northern Ireland campaign manager: It’s hypocritical, degrading and insulting to Northern Irish women that we are forced to travel for vital healthcare services but cannot access them at home. The UK government can no longer turn a blind eye and deny us equality. We cannot be left behind in a corner of the UK and on the island of Ireland as second-class citizens. The UK’s supreme court is soon expected to make a ruling on a case considering whether the regional abortion ban breaches Northern Irish women’s rights. And in September the court in London will hear the case of a mother who is being prosecuted for buying abortion pills for her daughter. More from Lisa O’Carroll who has spoken to some overjoyed and tearful yes voters in traditionally conservative Roscommon: Ireland’s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has said he hopes laws to allow abortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy would be in place in Ireland by the end of the year, with the expected referendum results giving the government “a clear mandate” to do so. Vardkar told national broadcaster RTÉ the expected landslide for yes was the “culmination of a quiet revolution”, adding that the expected two-to-one backing for constitutional reform to liberalise abortion laws showed the country was not divided. “We are united,” he said, and the referendum “allows us as a nation to come of age”. Health minister Simon Harris, who was at the vanguard of the government campaign, said he always knew Irish people were “decent and compassionate”. In traditionally conservative Roscommon/East Galway, the first unofficial tally is showing 57% for yes and 43% for no, reports the Guardian’s Lisa O’Carroll. Lisa has spoken to one voter who explained that in this constituency, the “shy” vote was in favour of repeal in the eighth amendment, not saving it: Ireland’s minister for children and youth affairs has said she is grateful and emotional at voters’ apparent overwhelming decision to repeal the eighth amendment. Katherine Zappone said she was confident new abortion legislation could be approved by parliament and put in place before the end of the year: I feel very emotional. I’m especially grateful to the women of Ireland who came forward to provide their personal testimony about the hard times that they endured, the stress and the trauma that they experienced because of the eighth amendment. Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said the expected overwhelming win for the yes side was the “culmination of a quiet revolution in Ireland”. The taoiseach said this process of change for women had started over a number of decades. “We will have a modern constitution for a modern country,” he said, adding that the predicted outcome also demonstrated that Ireland was not sharply divided by the abortion issue any longer. Meanwhile his deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said the exit polls showed the result “was not a Dublin versus the rest” situation. Coveney said the predicted rural-urban split over the referendum had not materialised. Ireland’s health minister, Simon Harris, has said he will ask for formal cabinet approval as early as this Tuesday to turn the government’s draft abortion law into a formal legislative text, Sky News is reporting: While the yes camp appears to be decisively ahead in most constituencies, the vote appears to be neck-and-neck in rural Donegal. The ballot boxes have now been emptied but there is no decisive result as yet, the BBC’s reporter in Letterkenny, Erinn Louise Kerr, reports: Ivana Bacik, an Irish Labour party senator and leading light of the campaign to repeal the eight amendment, has written for the Guardian about her reaction to the anticipated referendum result and why she thinks it happened: How did we succeed? Over the many weeks of this long campaign, I have been out canvassing extensively for a yes, in Dublin and elsewhere. The growing public awareness of the immense harm and hardship caused by the eighth amendment became increasingly apparent to me over the campaign. In truth, many people in Ireland had already recognised the reality that the eighth amendment represented an absolute bar to any lifting of the prohibition on abortion, even in cases of rape, risk to women’s health or fatal foetal abnormality ... Over the years, public opinion had thus shifted towards supporting repeal. The government’s proposed legislation was vociferously opposed by no campaigners, who argued it would lead to “abortion on demand” and it was dangerous to leave the job of making law to elected legislators, on the basis that “politicians can’t be trusted” – a profoundly populist and anti-democratic argument. The resounding yes vote we appear to have now achieved shows that the majority of Irish citizens simply rejected the scaremongering tactics of the no side. It shows that as a society we recognise the need for our democratically elected legislators to introduce an appropriate legal framework for the regulation of lawful termination of pregnancy. As a student campaigner in the 1980s I was taken to court and threatened with prison for distributing information to Irish women on where to access abortion. I am very grateful to my fellow Irish citizens who appear to have voted so overwhelmingly for a more democratic, equal and progressive Ireland. You can read the full article here. Leading no campaigner John McGuirk, communications officer for Save the 8th, has posted a message on his Facebook page for all who voted to keep Ireland’s strict anti-abortion laws. Today will be a “hard and difficult day”, but he says no one should give up: Like many of you I am broken-hearted about the apparent result, and it’s many implications, which go way beyond abortion. I fear that over the coming years, more and more women and their families will sadly learn that it was never the journey that was lonely, but the decision, and that it was not the country that is cruel, but the decision. Thank you all, so much, for your work and your friendship. Today will be a hard and difficult day, but hold your heads high. It is never wrong to speak up for what you believe in. It is wrong to stay silent, and especially wrong to stay silent when the crowd is totally against you. I will never stay silent. I hope the rest of you will join me. If you voted no, be proud, and defiant. Now is the time when your voice is needed more than ever. Expecting a close result, one Dublin students’ union hosted a “chill village” that provided a “quiet space” where students could “de-stress” while watching the result, writes Sinéad Baker from Dublin. But after the hugely encouraging signs for yes, it appeared many students found that they didn’t need it. From those here, the results coming in are met with huge cheers. The welfare officer of the students’ union at Trinity College, Damien McClean, said the union had expected a closer result and a lot of stressed students: “It’s better that we have these spaces open and they’re not used and they’re not needed to be used rather than not have them in the first place,” McClean said. The leader of Ireland’s main Irish opposition party, Fianna Fail, has insisted his anti-abortion parliamentarians will “not stand in the way of the will of the Irish people” and block legislation leading to abortion up to 12 weeks. Micheal Martin gambled with his leadership by coming out in favour of a yes vote even though 32 of his Dail deputies were on the no side in the campaign. The RTÉ exit poll breakdown of political parties’ attitudes to the referendum also found that a small majority of Fianna Fail voters, 50.3%, backed the no camp in Friday’s poll. But speaking his native Cork City on Saturday morning, Martin said he believed that members of the Dail would have to “honour the will of the people” and allow for the passage of the government’s planned legislation. Martin said it was now clear from the two exit polls that Ireland had “emphatically passed” the referendum and that his party should back the Fine Gael-led government to legalise abortion. Roscommon, which was considered a bellwether for the “no” camp, has confounded all expectations with tallies currently showing a 57% victory for yes. MEP Luke Ming Flanagan, a former TD for the constituency said he always knew voters would come out in favour of repeal: “I always knew voters were not conservative – they are just a bit complicated.” Ireland’s health minister, Simon Harris, sums up for RTÉ Radio what the expected referendum result will mean for the successors of the tens of thousands of Irish women who have had to travel abroad for an abortion: The count began shortly after 9am and is now well under way, with ballots from the 40 constituencies being tallied at 26 centres around the country. At the same time, unofficial tallies – which give an accurate picture of the result, and are so far confirming the exit polls’ forecast of a landslide for yes – are being kept and released piecemeal through the day. First official results are expected from early afternoon, with local returning officers reporting their constituency results to the referendum returning officer who will will formally declare the national result at Dublin Castle when all 40 constituencies are in. In past referendums, according to the national broadcaster RTÉ, the overall result has been declared as early as 2.15pm, and as late as 7pm. More from the streets of Dublin from Sinéad Baker: The relief is palpable from those who were hoping for a yes victory. Signs are already been taken down at one Temple Bar shop, where manager Mark Ryan says the shop sold out of repeal mechanise before the vote. Andanappa Yalagi, the father of Savita Halappanavar, who died of sepsis in Galway in 2012 after being denied an abortion during a protracted miscarriage, said he was “very happy today”. Speaking to Harriet Sherwood by phone from his home in Karnataka, in south-west India, Yalagi said: We’ve got justice for Savita. What happened to her will not happen to any other family. I have no words to express my gratitude to the people of Ireland at this historic moment. Halappanavar’s death galvanised the movement to repeal the eighth amendment. Prof Sir Sabaratnam Arulkumaran, who chaired an official investigation into her death, called on voters this week to back the repeal, saying it tied doctors’ hands. She was 17 weeks pregnant when she died at the age of 31. Sinéad Baker is out and about on the streets of Dublin, where the mood is “very positive”, she reports: People are struggling to articulate exactly how they’re feeling, but relief seems to be the dominant emotion, particularly for those who have been campaigning for years. Sarah Brennan is celebrating in Temple Bar today with her sister and nephew. “I’ve been working towards this for quite a while,” she said. “It’s amazing. It shows that Ireland is moving on. Women don’t have to tell their stories anymore, and that’s important.” The eighth amendment – article 40.3.3 of the Irish constitution – will be replaced with a clause stating: “Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.” The Irish government is planning to bring legislation before the Dáil providing for abortion on request up to the 12th week of pregnancy with a three-day “cooling-off” period before abortion medication is administered. Between 12 and 24 weeks, abortion will only be available in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, a risk to a woman’s life or a risk of serious harm to the health of the mother. After 24 weeks, termination will be possible in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. There will be provision for conscientious objection among medical practitioners, although doctors will be obliged to transfer care of the pregnant woman to another doctor. How does this compare to elsewhere? Most European countries allow abortion on request up to 12 weeks. Iceland permits it up to 16 weeks, Sweden 18 weeks and the Netherlands 22 weeks. Abortion is banned in all circumstances in Malta, and in Poland and Cyprus it is only permitted in cases of grave risk to the health of the mother, fatal foetal abnormality, rape and incest. In the UK, abortions can be carried out up to 24 weeks with the agreement of two doctors. Abortions after 24 weeks are allowed only if the woman’s life is at risk or the child would be born with a severe abnormality. The conservative government of Poland, which already has one of the strictest abortion laws in Europe, has proposed tightening it further by banning abortion in cases of severe foetal disorders, including Down’s syndrome. Several US states are also tightening access to abortion. Abortion is completely prohibited in El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and highly restricted in many other South American countries. The projected yes victory looks like a foregone conclusion if social media mentions are anything to go by. The online data analysts Meltwater crunched two days’ of social media conversations around the world on Thursday and Friday – the day of the referendum – and found the Repealthe8th hashtag was 11 times more popular than the no hashtag: #RepealThe8th/#Repeal8th – total number of mentions: 335,373 Trending themes: Ireland, women, abortion, abortion pill, sink, jail sentence, vote, #hometovote, freedom, jail sentence Geographical spread: UK, Ireland, US, Australia, Canada #SaveTheEighth/#savethe8th – total number of mentions: 30,450 Trending themes: Ireland, life, abortion, human life, people, vote, amendment, pray, young Irish women, child Geographical spread: US, Ireland, UK, Canada, Australia #HometoVote – total number of mentions: 192,142 Trending themes: Ireland, today, women, abortion, Savita Halappanvar, pregnancy, doctors, sepsis, Dublin airport The international organisation that sponsored two Irish women who sued the government at the UN over being forced to have abortions abroad said the projected yes victory would give hope to women across the world today. The New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights, which backed – among others – Amanda Mellet’s complaint to the UN, said the expected yes vote “would reverberate globally for years to come”. Leah Hoctor, the regional director for Europe at the CRR, said: If the referendum passes it will mark a historic moment for the women of Ireland. Irish laws on abortion have long been among the most restrictive in the world and wholly out of step with legislation in almost every other European country … Women living in counties with highly restrictive abortion laws would have cause for hope that significant change can be achieved. Save the 8th, which led the no campaign, has effectively conceded defeat, saying in a statement on its website that Irish voters have perpetrated “a tragedy of historic proportions”. The 8th amendment did not create a right to life for the unborn child – it merely acknowledged that such a right exists, has always existed, and will always exist. What Irish voters did yesterday is a tragedy of historic proportions. However, a wrong does not become right simply because a majority support it. We are so proud of all of those who stood with us in this campaign: our supporters, our donors, our families and our loved ones. This campaign took a huge personal toll on all of us who were involved, and we have been so grateful for their support. The unborn child no longer has a right to life recognised by the Irish state. Shortly, legislation will be introduced that will allow babies to be killed in our country. We will oppose that legislation. If and when abortion clinics are opened in Ireland, because of the inability of the government to keep their promise about a GP-led service, we will oppose that as well. Every time an unborn child has his or her life ended in Ireland, we will oppose that, and make our voices known. Abortion was wrong yesterday. It remains wrong today. The constitution has changed, but the facts have not. More pressure is being placed on Northern Ireland over its restrictive abortion law from Clare Murphy, the external affairs director at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service. Ireland’s voters have shown that denying women the right to abortion services in their own country in 2018 is not acceptable, she said. This is a momentous step forward that is long overdue. For decades, Irish women have been forced to travel hundreds of miles to our clinics in England, often alone, at a huge personal and emotional cost. The result, once confirmed, means that the Irish government can bring an end to this suffering, and legislate to provide the care women need at home. Now more than ever it is time for the UK government to show the same respect for the women of Northern Ireland. The Guardian’s Lisa O’Carroll is watching the count in Roscommon, traditionally one of Ireland’s most conservative counties, and reports that even there, the yes campaign looks to be doing well. The Irish capital is expected to return one of the highest proportions of yes votes in the country. The Irish Times reports that with 23% of ballot boxes open in Dublin Bay South, 79% are for yes and 21% for no. Dublin Central has 46% of boxes open, with 76% in favour of repealing the eighth and 24% against. The detail of the RTÉ exit poll shows Ireland has profoundly changed its attitudes towards women, with most voters saying they had made up their minds to repeal abortion laws years ago, reports Lisa O’Carroll. It showed little gender difference in voting, with only one in 10 saying they were influenced by posters or religion, and more than 75% saying they had not changed their mind on abortion in the past five years – suggesting support for reform far predated the announcement of a referendum two months ago. Colm O’Gorman, the head of Amnesty International in Ireland, which campaigned for a yes vote, said expectations had been that the count would be close, but attitude surveys it conducted in 2015 had shown deep changes in thinking on abortion. More than 80% said they had not changed their minds on how they were going to vote during the campaign, and more than three-quarters said they were influenced by personal stories they had heard in the media, or from people they knew. Eight percent said they were influenced by the death of Savita Halappanavar during complications in her pregnancy in Galway in 2015. You can read Lisa’s full report here. Last night’s Irish Times exit poll showed a whopping 87% of 18 to 24-year-olds supported a yes vote, reports Sinéad Baker. The president of the Union of Students in Ireland, Michael Kerrigan, who represents more than 374,000 students, said: We are delighted, but not at all surprised by the reported turnout of young people. We had predicted earlier in the week that this would be the largest youth vote in the history of the state, with a large majority voting yes. This is an issue that has been debated on campuses since the mid-1970s and has really intensified in the last couple of years. The exit poll suggests this issue was not as divisive as reported and that repeal was supported across generations. The union has been pushing for repeal of the eighth amendment for years, and has been a constant presence at marches and demonstrations. It directly registered more than 25,000 students to vote in the run-up to the referendum. The idea that Ireland is a conservative country seems to be melting away. When it comes to referendums on social issues, Ireland has not voted for the conservative option since 1983. Over that time, both the rural/urban divide and the generation gap have slowly closed. When the country voted in favour of permitting divorce in 1995, it did so by 9,000 votes and only five constituencies outside Dublin voted in favour. In the 2015 plebiscite on same-sex marriage, the rural/urban divide vanished, and cross-generational support was clear – and it looks like this is the case again in 2018. The expected result in the Irish referendum is likely to put significant pressure on politicians in Northern Ireland to review its highly restrictive regime, reports Harriet Sherwood. If the repeal of the eighth amendment is confirmed and followed by legislation to permit abortion on request up to the 12th week of pregnancy, Northern Ireland will be the only place in the UK and Ireland – and most of Europe – where terminations are outlawed except for the most exceptional circumstances. UK politicians acknowledged that Northern Ireland would come under the spotlight as the exit polls landed. Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, who also holds the equalities brief, tweeted: And Owen Smith, the former shadow Northern Ireland secretary, had this to say: You can read Harriet’s full story here. One of the key cases influencing the debate on abortion in Ireland was that of the Indian dentist Savita Halappanavar, who died of sepsis at a hospital in Galway after being denied an abortion during a protracted miscarriage. Her husband, Praveen Halappanavar, claimed she requested a termination but was refused because the baby’s heart was still beating. A midwife manager at Galway university hospital confirmed she told Halappanavar a termination could not be carried out because Ireland was a “Catholic country”. Anti-abortion “Save the Eighth” campaigners had warned “extreme” legislation would soon follow if the amendment were repealed, but the Irish government’s proposed new regime is comparable to that in most European countries and stricter than several. Leah Hoctor, the regional director for Europe at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told Euronews this year that that 25 of the EU’s 28 member states permit abortion “either on a woman’s request, without restriction as to reason or for reasons of distress, or on broad socioeconomic or psychological grounds, at least in early pregnancy”. Abortion in most European countries is more or less freely available during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The Irish Times has the full list towards the bottom of its excellent “Abortion: the Facts” page. Here’s what the count looks like up close, from Sunday Business’ Hugh O’Connell. And the Guardian’s Lisa O’Carroll is at the count in Roscommon. So why did the yes campaign win so convincingly? The Guardian’s Ireland correspondent, Henry McDonald, offers his first take, identifying four key reasons: The first is the loss of political power in the pulpit since the early 1990s, when a series of scandals started to beset the Irish Catholic hierarchy. From Archbishop Eamonn Casey raiding the funds of his diocese to look after his lover and his son, to the Irish state trying to prevent the extradition of a serial paedophile priest for his crimes in Northern Ireland, the last decade of the 20th century charted a catastrophic loss of trust and authority on the part of bishops and cardinals. Worse was to come as a raft of public inquiries revealed the industrial scale of sexual and physical abuse, as well as the economic exploitation of young children in the Catholic church’s care. It was telling that by the time of the referendum, the majority of no campaigners on public platforms and media outlets were lay people rather than priests, bishops or cardinals. Secondly, there were the hard cases where the grim realities of abortion choices came up against theological and moral objections – from the 1992 X scandal, where some in the anti-abortion movement wanted to prevent a 14-year-old girl from travelling out of the state to have an abortion after being raped, to the plight of Savita Halappanavar, who died from sepsis in the womb in an Irish hospital six years ago after medics refused to grant her demand for a termination, prompting the UN to denounce the practice of forcing women to leave their country to obtain terminations as “cruel and inhumane”. Thirdly, there appears to have been an underlying message coming from the doorsteps from most voters. The Irish electorate recognised finally that this referendum was not really about if women were having abortions, but where they were taking place. Yes campaigners reported that the view was commonplace that if women were already having terminations, they might as well have them at home rather than abroad. Irish people had become more pragmatic and less theocratic in the way they viewed the question. Finally, there was the strategic ineptitude of the no camp. Aside from accusations that anti-abortion campaigners were being financed by the American Christian right, there was undoubtedly evidence that they had tried to adopt the electoral tactics of US conservatism, appearing to believe that if the Irish Catholic conservative heartlands could be equally fired up to vote in large numbers, the anti-abortion coalition would have enough to just marginally win. What they appear to have overlooked is that this base is much thinner and less ideologically inclined than the bible-belt millions of the American south and mid-west. The Irish version is an ageing, declining population. Seismic, stunning, emphatic and overwhelming are some of the words being used to describe the projected result in Ireland’s abortion referendum on removing a 35-year-old ban from the constitution. With two exit polls from the Irish Times and RTÉ showing about 70% of the country voted yes, the anticipated referendum outcome seems indicative of profound underlying change in Irish society that was taking root long before campaigning started eight weeks ago. Fresh details on the RTE exit poll showed the only group voting to save the eighth amendment were the over-65s. Farmers and rural voters, traditionally considered more conservative, all voted yes. The leaders of the main political parties supported a yes vote – but not all of them have their party members behind them, writes Sinéad Baker. As taoiseach and the leader of Fine Gael, Leo Varadkar campaigned vocally for repeal, describing abortion in Ireland as “unsafe, unregulated and unlawful”. He has the support of most of his party’s TDs. All Labour’s TDs supported yes, as did Sinn Féin’s, in line with the parties’ official lines. The repeal campaign was bolstered when the leader of Fianna Fáil, Micheál Martin, came out in favour of yes. The surprise announcement was seen as evidence that a fundamental shift had taken place in Ireland, with Martin saying the eighth amendment “has been shown to cause real damage to Irish women”. But the majority of his party’s elected representatives advocated for a no vote. Such a high level of political support for a change to the constitution would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. But it did allow the no campaign to present itself as having something of an anti-establishment position – despite strong support from many politicians and the Catholic church. Reaction, too, from Amanda Mellet, one of three Irish women who successfully persuaded the UN to denounce Ireland’s abortion ban as “cruel and inhumane”, who says the expected yes vote will represent “real closure”. Mellet and her husband, James, took a case in 2013 against the Irish government to the UN’s human rights committee after the couple were forced to obtain a termination for her pregnancy in England. Had she remained in the Irish Republic, she would have been forced to give birth to a baby who would be born dead, as she was suffering from a fatal foetal abnormality in pregnancy. She also became the first woman in Ireland to receive financial compensation from the Irish state. Speaking from Kilkenny, Mellet said: Even when we won our case at the UN in June 2016, it never felt like any proper closure for myself or James. We were not even sure back then that the government would even hold a referendum. When James and I voted on Friday morning, it did finally feel like real closure for the both of us. We had campaigned along with so many in the Terminations For Medical Reasons group for change, and now we are, hopefully, going to get it. Whilst I am superstitious normally, I think that it will be a yes vote and for the first time in a very long time, I feel comfortable here in Ireland. We all put so much energy and emotion into the campaign over the years, but now we can say a chapter in our lives is finally closing … if as it looks it’s going to be yes.” What does the eighth amendment actually say – and what would it be replaced by? The eighth amendment was inserted into the Irish constitution after a referendum in 1983. Abortion had been illegal in Ireland since the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861, but with many European countries opting to permit terminations on request until 12 weeks or more, campaigners sought the security of a constitutional amendment. The amendment states: The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right. If the eighth is repealed, the relevant clause of the constitution – 40.3.3 – will be replaced by the phrase: Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy. Reactions to the exit polls – which forecast a far wider margin of victory for the yes vote that was widely expected – have been coming in thick and fast, starting late last night. Here’s the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar: And the health minister, Simon Harris: And the leader of the no campaign, John McGuirk: And the actor and comedian Aisling Bea, a leading light in the yes campaign: Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage on what looks set to be a historic day for Ireland as votes are counted in its abortion referendum. Last night’s shock exit polls suggested a landslide vote for change, with an overwhelming majority of voters backing the repeal of a 1983 constitutional amendment that has led to one of the strictest abortion regimes in the world. An Irish Times/Ipsos poll forecast a margin of 68% to 32% in favour of repealing the eighth amendment, while a poll for the national broadcaster RTÉ predicted an even bigger margin of 69.4% to 30.6%. Turnout was on course to be one of the highest for a referendum in Ireland, possibly topping the 61% who voted in the plebiscite that backed same-sex marriage in 2015. Acknowledging an equal right to life for both the unborn child and the mother, the eighth amendment effectively prohibited termination in almost all cases, including rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality. Abortion when a mother’s life is at risk has been permitted since 2013, but in all other circumstances, doctors performing unlawful abortions face up to 14 years in prison. As a result, about 3,500 Irish women have travelled abroad, mostly to the UK, each year to terminate their pregnancies, and an estimated 2,000 more buy abortion pills online, administering them at home without medical supervision. If the exit polls prove accurate and the eighth amendment is repealed, the government plans to table a new law allowing abortion on request during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Terminations will be permitted up to 24 weeks if the woman’s health is threatened. We will be bringing you live reports, analysis and reaction through the day until the result is confirmed (it’s expected some time this afternoon), including from our reporters @lisaocarroll ‏ @_EmmaGH @sineadbaker1 and @henrymcdonald."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/25/kanye-west-paid-85000-to-use-whitney-houston-bathroom-photo-on-pusha-t-album","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T11:16:53Z","webTitle":"Kanye West paid $85,000 to use Whitney Houston bathroom photo on Pusha T album","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/25/kanye-west-paid-85000-to-use-whitney-houston-bathroom-photo-on-pusha-t-album","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/25/kanye-west-paid-85000-to-use-whitney-houston-bathroom-photo-on-pusha-t-album","fields":{"headline":"Kanye West paid $85,000 to use Whitney Houston bathroom photo on Pusha T album","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Kanye West paid $85,000 (£63,640) to license an image of Whitney Houston’s drug-strewn bathroom for the cover of Pusha T’s new album, Daytona. Pusha T told radio host Angie Martinez that West, who produced Daytona, changed the artwork at the last minute, calling him at 1am to declare: “This is what people need to see to go along with this music.” The photograph was taken in Houston’s Atlanta home in 2006 after an alleged drug binge and depicts paraphernalia apparently related to the consumption of crack cocaine. The image was released to the public after Houston’s death at the Beverly Hilton hotel in February 2012, which was caused by drowning and the effects of coronary heart disease and cocaine consumption. Daytona, originally titled King Push, was expected to follow King Push – Darkest Before Dawn: The Prelude, released in December 2015, but was delayed. In April this year West announced in the midst of a Twitter spree that the album would be released on 25 May via Def Jam and his own label Good Music. Daytona is the first album to be released from sessions at West’s retreat in Wyoming. “We’ve spent a year and a half digging for samples and writing,” he tweeted of the record. Pusha T told Martinez that West was still making changes to the album a day prior to its release, as West did with his own album The Life of Pablo, which he continued to edit following its release in February 2016. Pusha T also discussed their relationship, clarifying that the pair don’t discuss politics because he disagrees with West’s endorsement of Donald Trump: “The prison reform thing is so near and dear to me, and it’s something that I know we can’t even tackle with Trump. So, there’s nothing that I even want to hear in regards to him, a point of view, anything.” Pusha T also discussed West’s upcoming album, slated for a 1 June release under the name Love Everyone, suggesting that it somewhat clarifies West’s controversial recent proclamations on Trump and comments describing slavery in America as “a choice”. “He’s speaking on a lot on this album,” he said. “And I feel like he even speaks it clearer and messages it clearer and better through the music. That’s where you can see a bit of like, OK, you’re asking these questions. You’re saying these things to get this type of emotion or just get an answer for something else. I feel like it’s better there.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/may/25/chelsea-sound-out-maurizio-sarri-over-replacing-antonio-conte","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T10:07:43Z","webTitle":"Chelsea hold Maurizio Sarri talks as they consider Antonio Conte replacements","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/25/chelsea-sound-out-maurizio-sarri-over-replacing-antonio-conte","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/25/chelsea-sound-out-maurizio-sarri-over-replacing-antonio-conte","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea hold Maurizio Sarri talks as they consider Antonio Conte replacements","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Chelsea will meet Maurizio Sarri’s representatives on Friday as they consider potential successors to Antonio Conte, who is widely expected to exit the club this summer. The Stamford Bridge side continue to weigh up the future of Conte, who warned Chelsea they would be losing a “serial winner” if they decided to replace him after winning the FA Cup at Wembley last weekend. “After two years, the club knows me very well,” Conte said. “If they want to continue to work with me, they know me. I can’t change. I am this and my past speaks very clearly, as a player and as a manager.” Napoli appointed Carlo Ancelotti as Sarri’s successor on Wednesday after the latter guided the team to a second-place Serie A finish in his third and final season at the club. The 59-year-old Sarri – who has never managed outside of his homeland – has received an offer from Zenit St Petersburg, understood to be worth around £5.2m a year. It is believed that Sarri’s preference would be to join Chelsea but it is not clear whether he is the club’s primary target. He has an England-based representative charged with finding him a job. Following Napoli’s 2-1 win over Crotone, which saw Napoli end the season with 91 points before his exit was confirmed, Sarri told La Gazzetta dello Sport: “What I do think is that I could not go directly to another Italian team, and that if I had to make a change I would prefer to go abroad. Everything in life ends and it is better to finish things after writing a beautiful story.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/25/iran-lists-demands-nuclear-deal-eu-us-sanctions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T10:39:11Z","webTitle":"Iran lists demands for staying in nuclear deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/25/iran-lists-demands-nuclear-deal-eu-us-sanctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/25/iran-lists-demands-nuclear-deal-eu-us-sanctions","fields":{"headline":"Iran lists demands for staying in nuclear deal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Iran has said it will decide in the next few weeks whether to pull out of the nuclear deal signed in 2015 and start enriching uranium capable of making a nuclear bomb. The announcement was made by Tehran as its officials met counterparts from France, Britain, Germany Russian and China in Vienna on Friday to assess how the deal can be kept alive in the face of the reimposition by the US of secondary sanctions designed to cripple any European firm continuing to do business with Iran. President Trump withdrew from the deal despite strenuous European objections on 8 May, adding that old sanctions against contact with the Tehran regime would be reimposed. In the run-up to the Vienna meeting, Tehran officials said the EU would need to present a credible compensation package by the end of the month to make up for the loss of income to Iran caused by the US sanctions. Afterwards, Iran’s deputy foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said he was more confident than before that the deal could survive. “For the time being we are negotiating... to see if they can provide us with a package which can actually give Iran the benefits of sanctions-lifting and then the next step is to find guarantees for that package and we need both legal and political commitments by the remaining participants in the JCPOA [deal],” he said. Iran is increasingly sceptical that Europe has the means or will to set up an economic firewall that can assure European firms that they will be protected from US Treasury fines if they do business in Iran. Many of the firms trading with Iran, such as the French oil company Total, have substantial US interests and do not want to put those assets at risk to continue trading with Iran. The Vienna meeting being held in the joint commission format was the first such conference without the US, and was in some ways a test of Europe’s commercial and diplomatic ability to follow a foreign policy independent of Washington. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei this week said his country would stay in the deal on three strict conditions. He said the EU had to protect Iranian oil sales from US sanctions and continued to buy Iranian oil. He also demanded European banks safeguard trade with Iran, including by keeping the country inside the Swift international payments system. Finally, he also urged France, Germany and the UK not to seek a new agreement on Iran’s ballistic missile programme, or its regional activities, including its presence in Yemen, Iraq and Syria. Broadly, Russia and China agree with these terms. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on Monday outlined a counter set of demands before the country would rejoin the deal that the EU rejected as unrealistic and amounting to regime change in Tehran. The EU fears ever heavier economic sanctions will strengthen hardliners in Tehran, while the US believes a country-wide rebellion can be stoked among a population angry at the regime’s costly overseas military adventures. Speaking in St Petersburg, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the US approach to the deal was “not serious”, adding he was comforted by a report from the International Atomic Energy Agency confirming Iran was still abiding by the deal’s key restrictions on its nuclear facilities. He also said companies from France and other European countries should be given an opportunity to “keep their economic profit, despite the US sanctions, and maintain their economic presence in Iran”. Macron added: “Europe should have a stronger economic sovereignty. France envisages a compensation for French companies acting within the framework of treaties signed by France.” The EU is studying three plans to protect trade with Iran – a legally untested blocking statute that renders any US sanctions on EU companies null and void, euro-denominated finance for companies from the European Investment Bank, and an EU equivalent to the US Treasury’s secondary sanctions regime. Macron also said he wanted Iran to complete the nuclear deal by signing a new framework agreement to cover ballistic missiles and its regional activities. He revealed he had spoken to Tehran on the need to agree on what follows the end of the agreement in 2025. It is not clear what the EU will do if Iran pushes back on this plan. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, counselled against anything that resembled reopening the deal, and warned of the lamentable consequences if the deal collapsed. There is intense anger in some European capitals, notably Paris, at the unilateral tone of the US approach, especially the reimposition of sanctions. The premise of the nuclear deal – officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was to let Iran rejoin the global economy in exchange for denuclearisation. The only EU country so far to support the US withdrawal from the deal is Poland. The most effective weapon in the US economic armoury is to slash Iranian oil exports by isolating Iran’s central bank from the global banking system. About 37% of Iran’s oil exports go to European destinations, and overall the EU is Iran’s number one trading partner. The value of trade between the EU and Iran soared from $9.2bn (£6.9bn) in 2015 to $25bn in 2017."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/25/constable-jmw-turner-paintings-reunited-tate-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T11:51:25Z","webTitle":"Constable and Turner landscapes reunited for first time since 1831","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/25/constable-jmw-turner-paintings-reunited-tate-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/25/constable-jmw-turner-paintings-reunited-tate-britain","fields":{"headline":"Constable and Turner landscapes reunited for first time since 1831","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tate Britain has hung two paintings by John Constable and JMW Turner together for the first time since 1831, when their display provoked a row between the artists that rumbled on for years. Constable’s Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows, a lyrical rain-sodden landscape with a rainbow as a symbol of hope for the artist heartbroken at the recent death of his wife, has returned to the Tate after a five-year tour of UK galleries where it was seen by at least a million people. The artist regarded the painting as his greatest work, and in 1831 it hung briefly beside Turner’s Caligula’s Palace and Bridge, a view of monuments of antiquity fallen into ruin, which a contemporary critic called “one of the most beautiful and magnificent landscapes that ever mind conceived or pencil drew”. At the Royal Academy in 1831, Constable was the “hangman”, responsible for the placing of the paintings. He initially gave the Turner one of the best positions, in the centre of the end wall of the Great Room at Somerset House, central London, then the home of the academy. Just before the opening he switched the Turner for his own picture – an outrage the peppery Turner was never going to forgive. The artists met at a dinner party and a row erupted in which Turner “slew Constable without remorse”, according to one account. The following year the pair again ended up on the same wall at the academy. Constable’s Opening of Waterloo Bridge was a complex painting he had worked on for a decade. Turner’s Helvoetsluys was a simpler seascape. Just before the opening Turner came in, looked at his painting and added one detail – a small crimson buoy bobbing in the waves that instantly drew the eye of viewers. Constable remarked: “He has been in here and he has fired a gun.” The 1831 paintings have been reframed and reunited at the Tate for the Fire and Water display, which will include the reviews that remarked on Turner’s poetic imagination and Constable’s naturalism. The Salisbury Cathedral painting had been on long loan to the National Gallery. It was put up for sale in 2013 but saved from export after a national appeal, major grants from the Art Fund and the Heritage Lottery Fund, and an unprecedented partnership between the Tate, the national museums and galleries of Wales and Scotland, and the local museums in Colchester, Ipswich and Salisbury. The painting then went on a long tour, called Aspire, with exhibitions created around it. Alex Farquharson, the director of Tate Britain, said the tour showed creative partnerships could expand the interest in, and understanding of, such masterpieces. “Constable wanted the work to be seen by as many people across the country as possible. This has encapsulated his wish making this monumental piece of art history available to an every broader audience.” Fire and Water will be at Tate Britain from 26 May until July 2019."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/may/25/giro-ditalia-2018-stage-19-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T16:02:06Z","webTitle":"Giro d'Italia: Froome wins stunning stage 19 to take pink jersey – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/may/25/giro-ditalia-2018-stage-19-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/may/25/giro-ditalia-2018-stage-19-live","fields":{"headline":"Giro d'Italia: Froome wins stunning stage 19 to take pink jersey – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“I don’t think I’ve ever attacked with 80km to go like that before on my own, and got all the way to the finish,” he said. “But the team did such a fantastic job to set that up for me. It was going to take something really special to try and first of all get rid of Simon, to get away from Dumoulin and Pozzovivo and to go from fourth to first. “I wasn’t going to do that on the last climb alone so I had to try it from a long way back and Colle delle Finestre was the perfect place to do it - a gravel road which reminds me of the roads back in Africa. “I tried to stay within my limits and stay within myself there, so hopefully we can finish this off tomorrow.” Overall standings: Chris Froome leads Tom Dumoulin in the General Classificaion by 40 seconds. Thibaut Pinot is in third place, 4min 17sec off the pace set by Froome. Sean Ingle has filed this end-of-stage report on Chris Froome’s epic stage win. Sean Ingle is in Italy for the Guardian ... The Sky rider is in the race leader’s pink jersey and has a 40-second lead over Tom Dumoulin. Froome speaks: “If felt like it,” he says, upon asked if this was the greatest ride of his career. “I don’t think I’ve ever attacked with 80km to go but the team did so well to set that up for me. To go from fourth to first is ... I wasn’t going to do that on the last climb so I had to do it from much further out. Let’s hope we can finish this off tomorrow.” Stay tuned: As we wait for the official times, it’s worth noting that for all Chris Froome’s wonderful climbing today, it was his descent of the Finestre that was his most astonishing feat today. The man has his detractors but it took serious guts to do what he did on that downhill - at times it was bordering on the reckless and if he’d come off his bike he could have done himself a serious mischief. He went all-in on that descent and his dangerous gamble paid off. Today’s stage: Dumoulin finishes 3min 22sec behind Froome. There are some sums to be done before we know how much Froome’s lead will be tomorrow. He won bonus seconds for finishing today’s stage in first place. Challenging Miguel Ángel López for the white jersey, Richard Carapaz nicks the six bonus seconds by coming second and is followed over the line by Pinot and then Lopez. Having done all the work on the chase, Tom Dumoulin gets no bonus seconds whatsoever. Chris Froome will begin tomorrow’s penultimate stage in the pink after one of the great cycling performances. That was an epic stage. Having been on his own for 80 kilometres, Chris Froome wins the stage and puts himself in pole position to win the Giro d’Italia. He started this morning in fourth place, 3min 22sec off the lead. He finishes with the race lead. We’ll let you know how much he leads by just as soon as it’s confirmed. That was an astonishing ride - arguably the finest of his career. He wraps up the stage win in a time of 5hr 12min 26sec and punches the air in triumph as he crosses the line. 1km to go: As is customary on such occasions, there are a number of drunken gobshites lining the road, but Froome has passed under the one-kilometre to go kite and is now on a section of road protected by race barriers. 1km to go: Stage 19 enters its knockings and Froome is out of the saddle on the fairly narrow, spectator-lined road leading to the finish. The gap is 3min 18sec. 2km to go: Froome maintains the 3min 14sec to Dumoulin that will put the Sky rider in the maglia rosa on the penultimate day of this year’s Giro. Tomorrow’s stage is tough and it will be interesting to see how much, if anything, today’s 80-kilometre solo effort has taken out of him. 3.2km to go: In the white jersey, Lopez attacks off the front of the three-man Dumoulin group and Carapaz takes off in hot pursuit, leaving Tom Dumoulin isolated. Froome leads Dumoulin by 3min 08sec. 4km to go: Froome pedals onwards and upwards to the stage finish at Bardonecchia. Behind him, Thibaut Pinot has opened a gap of four or five seconds on the three-man group led by Tom Dumoulin. Dumoulin is with Miguel Ángel López and Richard Carapaz, who are fighting it out for the best young rider’s white jersey. 5km to go: Thibaut Pinot leaves Tom Dumoulin behind, but the man in second place on GC is able to regroup and rejoin the two riders duking it out for the white jersey. Froome leads the stage by 3min 11sec from Thibaut Pinot, who has opened a small seven or eight-second gap to Dumoulin. 6km to go: Froome’s relentless solo effort continues and tom Dumoulin cracks. He’s now paddling at the back of his own small group and in obvious distress. 8km to go: Chris Froome is about the hit the steep section of the stiff final climb. Behind him, Tom Dumoulin is doing all the hard work at the front of the four-man posse, but isn’t closing the gap. Remember that Froome has been on his own for 80 kilometres - that’s some effort. 9km to go: The race leaders have taken pity on Simon Yates and stopped giving updates on his time a fair while ago. He was nearly 20 minutes off the pace and struggling very badly the last time we got an update. 10km to go: Froome continues to increase his lead with a fine solo effort. He passes under the 10km-to-go kite with a lead of 3min 34sec over the four-man group led by Tom Dumoulin and Thibaut Pinot. As things stand: Chris Froome is the virtual leader of this year’s Giro d’Italia and has a 33-second lead over Tom Dumoulin. Thibaut Pinot, who has been working hard in Pinot’s small group of riders has moved onto the podium and is 4min 30sec behind Froome. 14km to go: Dimension Data’s Ben O’Connor has abandoned after crashing into some barriers on the most recent descent. It looked a sore one, but he got back on his bike only for his injuries to get the better of him a short time later. It’s a shame for him as he’d been riding an excellent Giro. 16km to go: The gap between Froome and the Dumoulin group is 3min 08sec and there’s one big climb left today - to the finish line at the Cat 1 Bardonecchia. 20km to go: Froome increases the gap to 3min 08sec after a splendid ride, while the volume of chippy correspondence from Sky fanboys and girls increases in my inbox. It’s like a cult. A big cult of Blinkered Whataboutery. Personally, I have no particularly strong opinions one way or the other on whether or not Froome should be in this year’s Giro or not, but the evasiveness of his team, a team founded on transparency, certainly does him no favours when it comes to ladling out sympathy or giving riders the benefit of the doubt. Whatever your thoughts on his unresolved Salbutamol case, it’s been an epic stage in a fascinating Giro and both Chris Froome and Tom Dumoulin deserve immense credit for two brilliant rides that have set us up for an epic denouement. An email from Jorrit Kors in the Netherlands: “Regarding the email from Christopher Lawton - there are no questions,” writes Jorrit. “Froome should never have been allowed to compete. It is a joke. Go Tom!” Before the opening stage of this year’s race in Jerusalem, Dumoulin had plenty to say about Froome’s unresolved salbutamol case dating back to last year’s Vuelta. Froome is still fighting to clear his name after an adverse analytical finding for the asthma drug last September. “It’s not good for cycling in general that it’s not solved,” Dumoulin told Sky News. “Everybody is a bit uncertain. If he wins now what will happen if he gets a positive [test result] afterwards?Does he lose his Vuelta title from last year and does he also lose his Giro title? There’s so much uncertainty, nobody benefits, also not Chris Froome. He has the right to race here, it’s his choice to make. It’s not up to me.” 32km to go: Froome extends the gap to 2min 58sec and becomes the virtual race leader. He can’t win this year’s Giro today, but he’s put himself in the box-seat with just one day of serious racing to go. An email from R Williams: “What does the Froome-hating Guardian have to say now?” he asks. “He’s a class act and his performance today is breathtaking.” Breath-taking enough to require a toot on an inhaler? Froome forced to take evasive action: Anyone who has ever attended one of Sir David Brailsford’s press conferences or seen him appear in front of a government select committee will know that Team Sky are masters of evasion and for once it proves very beneficial, as Chris Froome is forced to swerve around a crashed race motorcycle while cycling through a dark tunnel. Luckily, the driver of the motorbike appears to be OK. That’s the second close, motorcycle-related shave Froome has had today - on the descent of the Finestre, a motorcycle bearing a cameraman had to brake suddenly to avoid knocking him off his bike. An email from Christopher Lawton: “Exciting as this is surely there are going to be a lot of questions now around whether Froome should be competing,” he says. “While we are not yet in Armstrong territory the image of cycling does not necessarily benefit from Froome’s ride.” 45km to go: Froome crests the Sestriere, taking the King of the Mountains maglia azzurra jersey from Simon Yates in the process. Simon Yates has lost over 20 minutes and his hopes of winning this year’s Giro today. With Yates no longer in the picture, Dumoulin is the virtual race leader but Froome only needs to put another nine seconds to him and he’ll take that honour as well. 46km to go: This is a remarkable effort by Chris Froome, who is approaching the summit of the Sestriere and continues to put time into Tom Dumoulin, extending the gap to 2min 38sec. Those in the Dumoulin group appear to be suffering and are summoning their cars to furnish them with food and drink. 50km to go: Chris Froome continues his ascent of the Sestriere with a lead of 2min 08sec over the chasing group being led by Tom Dumoulin. Froome is on his own, Dumoulin has the support of Thibaut Pinot, Miguel Ángel López, Sebastien Reichenback and Richard Carapaz. Carapaz and Lopez are duking it out for the white jersey of best young rider and have not been contributing to the chase. In virtual terms, Dumoulin is the leader of this year’s Giro with a 44-second lead over Chris Froome. 55km to go: Chris Froome takes some food and drink on board as he prepares to hit the slopes again, en route to the third big climb of the day, the Cat 3 Sestriere. Froome leads the Dumoulin group by 1min 53sec. The Dumoulin group leads the Pozzovivo by 1min 10sec. Froome, Dumoulin or Pozzovivo will win this year’s Giro d’Italia. 57km to go: After a descent that often bordered on the downright reckless, Chris Froome has a stage lead of 1min 50sec over Tom Dumoulin - he put a minute into his nearest pursuers on the downhill of the Finestre. Simon Yates, bless him on a horrible day, has just gone over the summit of the Finestre and is more than 17 minutes off the pace being set by Froome. An email from Marco Grandi: “I am sorry to see Yates suffer, but its a great payback towards the arrogant crew in the comment sections who so many times forget that this is a three-week race,” he writes. Arrogance? In the Guardian comments section? Surely not. 69km to go: For the first time in three climbs up the Finestre in the Giro, the race leader has failed to hang on to the maglia rosa. And how - Simon Yates is now 13min 16sec behind today’s stage leader Chris Froome, who is currently negotiating the descent. Yates could conceivably lose half an hour or more today. Behind Froome, virtual race leader Tom Dumoulin is in hot pursuit, in the company of Thibaut Pinot, Miguel Ángel López, Sebastien Reichenback and Richard Carapaz. Froome’s lead on the stage is 1min 18sec. 71 km to go: Tom Dumoulin is organising the downhill chase behind Froome and it’s interesting that he’s in the company of Thibaut Pinot, who is a notoriously poor descender. As they crested the summit of the Finestre, Dumoulin gestured to Pinot as if to say: “Follow me and I’ll guide you down”. 73km to go: Tom Dumoulin is being forced to do all the hard graft at the front of the five-man group that is 38 seconds behind Froome. Chris Froome crests the summit, the highest point of this year’s race and begis a very technical descent. The road is narrow, it’s wet in places and there’s quite a scary drop to the right. 74km to go: While there seems little point in continuing to monitor Simon Yates’s grisly demise, there is something grimly fascinating about watching a Grand Tour leader’s challenge disintegrate in such spectacular fashion. He’s now 10min 30sec off the pace being set by stage leader Chris Froome. Froome leads Tom Dumoulin towards the summit of the Finestre - the gap between the pair is 37 seconds and there are 73 kilometres to go. 76km to go: Chris Froome leads the stage by 40-seconds from Tom Dumoulin, his main rival for this year’s Giro. Dumoulin is in a four-man group with Thibaut Pinot, Miguel Ángel López and Richard Carapaz. In the big news of the day, Simon Yates is nine minutes behind Chris Froome on the road today and the gulf is getting just bigger and bigger. It’s been a nightmare day for the man in the pink jersey. don’t forget, there’s a long, long way to go in today’s stage. 77km to go: Simon Yates seems to riding through treacle and the gap between him and stage leader Chris Froome is heading towards the eight-minute mark. On a remarkable day’s racing, Chris Froome has a 34-second lead over the chasing group of four riders including Tom Dumoulin. Froome needs to gain 2min 54sec on Dumoulin if he’s to be in pink tomorrow. They continue the ascent to the summit of the finestre and they’re high above the snow line. 79km to go: How things stand: still on the monster climb of the day, Chris Froome is alone in front. Behind him, Tom Dumoulin, Thibaut Pinot, Sebastien Reichenback and Richard Carapaz can still Froome in the distance - his lead is 17 seconds. Domenico Pozzovivo, third on the GC at the start of racing today, has also been dropped. In the pink jersey, Simon Yates is now five minutes down. 80 min: They’re on the gravel section of the Finestre and Chris Froome attacks! Tom Dumoulin isn’t able to follow and Froome is alone in front with 80 kilometres to go. Can he hold on? 81km to go: On Eurosport, people who know more about this kind of thing than I do, are saying that Simon Yates’s Mitchelton-Scott team need to limit the damage that’s being done to the race leader as much as they can until they get over the top of the Finestre and see what happens after that. My guess, looking at the pictures as the riders negotiate hairpin bend after hairpin bend, is that Yates’s goose is well and truly cooked as far as this year’s Giro is concerned. While Tom Dumoulin is currently the virtual race leader, Chris Froome is looking very strong and could well attack at some stage today. He was 2min 54sec behind Dumoulin at the start of racing today. 83km to go: Astana’s Luis Leon Sanchez, who had been leading the stage only to be told to sit up by his team overlords, is now riding along with the Sky riders at the front of the field and has just taken an energy gel offered to him by Chris Froome. The gap back to Simon Yates, who continues the struggle to keep up with his own team-mates, is almost two minutes. 83km to go: SImon Yates is having a terrible time here and looks a certainty to lose the pink jersey. His team-mates are doing all they can to help him, hanging back to try and help him up the hill, offering him food and drink, but he’s struggling to even to stay on their wheels. They’re still not even halfway up the Colle delle Finestre - this afternoon could get a hell of a lot worse for Yates before they get better. 84km to go: Stage leader Luis Leon Sanchez has been instructed to sit up by his Astana’s directeur sportif, as his young team-mate Miguel Ángel López, currently in the young rider’s jersey, is struggling. 85km to go: Simon Yates looks to be in all sorts of bother as Team Sky ratchet up the pressure. Sergio Henao, Chris Froome, David De La Cruz and Wout Poels, among other Sky riders, are all to the fore as Yates falls further and further behind. Tom Dumoulin is upsides the Sky riders as the gap to Yates stretches to 22 seconds and counting. 88km to go: We’re less than halfway up the Colle delle Finestre and race leader Simon Yates looks to be in big trouble! Sky have assembled the troops at the front of the pink jersey group, put the hammer down and have left him behind. 87km to go: Astan rider Luis Leon Sanchez is out on his own in front with a 41-second lead over the pink jersey group, which is being led up the narrow, twisting tree-lined corridor by Sky. At the moment he is being chased by a man waving a magic wand, wearing a pink tutu and orange t-shirt combo, set off nicely by the rubber-duck buoyancy ring around his waist. 89.4km to go: What’s left of the nine-man breakaway group has a 43-second lead in the early stages of the climb to the summit of the Colle delle Finestre, but it’s unlikely to be enough to see them over the top without being caught. Behind them, Sky’s Salvatore Puccio is leading the chase, in the absence of his team-mate Vasil Kiryienka, who has abandoned. 91km to go: Sky are leading the maglia rosa group at a quite high tempo, hoping to take control of the stage. Simon Yates’s Mitchelton Scott and assorted Astana riders are tucked in behind them. Your nine-man breakaway: Nathan Brown (EF Education First-Drapac), Matteo Montaguti (Ag2R-La Mondiale), Luis Leon Sanchez (Astana), Krists Neilands (Israel Cycling Academy), Darwin Atapuma and Valerio Conti (UAE Team Emirates), Koen Bouwman and Danny van Poppel (LottoNL-Jumbo), Rodolfo Torres (Androni Giocattoli). They have a lead of 1min 11sec as the field begin the big climb of the day. 95km to go: We’re approximately three kilometres from the foot of the brutal climb to the Colle Delle Finestre. The five-man breakaway has almost doubled in size to nine. 100km to go: A new five-man breakaway has put a few seconds between themselves and the pink jersey bunch. Conti, Brown, Atapuma, Nielands and Montaguti are the men in question. 106km to go: We’re on the 30km stretch of false flat before the big climb of the day and the gap between the breakaway and the pink jersey group has all but closed. There was a feed zone at the bottom of the descent and while those in the breakaway took their musettes and slowed down to transfer their bidons, gels and other goodies to their pockets, the pink jersey group just raced straight through the feed zone. They’ve caught the escape party, but will need to get grub on board at some point before they hit the Colle Delle Finestre. Mitchelton-Scott had the pink jersey group strung out like the washing as they forced to pace to close down that breakaway. 109km to go: The race has split into three distinct groups: the breakaway group in which three of the main GC contenders (but not race leader Simon Yates) have trusted lieutenants to help them in the knockings of today’s stage, the pink jersey group of about 70 riders who are 40 seconds behind and the grupetto. 118km to go: We have TV pictures, so fasten your seat belts for what promises to be an exciting afternoon watchjing other people suffer. Some big news - a 15-man breakaway has opened a gap of about one minute on the pink jersey group at the bottom of the first descent. Sky have two riders - Henao and Cruz - in it, Bahrain have one, Tom Dumoulin’s Sunweb team has Laurens Ten Dam in it. Domenico Pozzovivo (Bahrain-Merida) has Giovanni Visconti in it. Race leader Simon Yates’s Mitchelton–Scott team have not - repeat not - managed to get anyone into the breakaway. That’s an early blow in today’s stage for Yates - when the going gets tough later on, he’ll have nobody positioned up the road to help him. Still waiting for a live TV feed: On Eurosport, Sean Kelly is very down on Simon Yates’ chances of holding on to the pink jersey. He quite clearly thinks the Englishman is going to lose it over the next two days, but wonders if he is genuinely exhausted or just didn’t eat and drink properly yesterday and merely suffered from what is known in cycling parlance as hunger knock. 138km to go: Sky’s Sergio Henao and Astana’s Luis León Sánchez have got themselves in a breakaway as the bunch tackle the summit of the Colle del Lys. They’re just two of several riders who’ll be attempting to put some distance between the pink jersey group so they’ll be in a good position to help their men among the main GC contenders when they attack later today. The descent is 22 kilometres, then there’s 30 kilometres of false flat (patronising explanation: a low-gradient climb, usually occurring partway up a steeper climb) before the riders take on the Colle delle Finestre. Fancied as a potential winner before the race, the Italian national champion Fabio Aru has had a disastrous Giro riding for UAE Team Emirates. He has abandoned this morning. Sky’s Belarusian rider Vasil Kiryienka has also quit the race. 145km to go: The riders are tackling the Col San Giovanni, a comparatively stiff climb that leads into the beginning of the Colle del Lys, the first categorised climb of the day. A group of 10 riders - Betancur, Pedrero, Montaguti, Cherel, Sanchez, Formolo, Goncalves, Henao, Atapuma, Conti - have opened a gap on the rest of the bunch. From the Global Cycling Network: Emma Pooley asks some of the riders in this year’s Giro d’Italia what music they like to listen to as they warm up. They’re racing in Stage 19: The 158-strong peloton rolled out of Veneria Reale, went through the neutral zone and were given the all-clear to start racing and are now 36 kilometres into the stage as they negotiate the first of the day’s categorised climbs - the Cat 2 Colle Del Lys. Androni Giocattoli’s Marco Frapporti has tried and failed to launch an early attack and the group is still together. From the Giro d’Italia 2018 website: The last summit finish awaits the peloton after a full mountain stage. Shortly after the start, the route climbs to the top of Colle del Lys (from Viù). After dropping into the Dora Riparia valley and reaching Susa, the route climbs once more to the top of Colle delle Finestre. The Colle delle Finestre (Cima Coppi) has a steady 9.2% gradient throughout (with just a short punchy bit in Meana di Susa topping out at 14%). The first 9 km are on tarmac, while the last 9 km is a gravel road, all the way to the summit. Twenty-nine hairpins are tucked in less than 4 km over the first part of the climb (45 hairpins overall until the summit). The descent is very technical as the roadway is narrow and initially unprotected, up to Pian dell’Alpe. As the route goes back onto the ss. 23, the climb is resumed with do-able gradients all the way to the finish. A long uncomplicated climb follows, leading to the Sestriere categorised summit. Following a fast drop into Oulx and a false flat section leading to Bardonecchia (intermediate sprint), the route takes in the closing climb to the top of Jafferau. The final 7 km run entirely uphill, with sharp 9-10% gradients, topping out at 14% in the first part. The road narrows in Maillaures, approximately 6 km before the finish, in the steepest section. The finish line lies on a 50m long, 6m wide home stretch. Simon Yates leads the Giro d’Italia by 28 seconds from Tom Dumoulin. Italy’s Domenico Pozzovivo is in third place, while Chris Froome is 3min 22sec off the pace in fourth. Sean Ingle was in Prato Nevosa for the Guardian yesterday and here’s his dispatch from the front line. Twenty-eight seconds. That’s the slender lead Simon Yates has in this year’s Giro by after seeing his lead over Tom Dumoulin halved in yesterday’s Stage 18 from Abbiategrasso to Prata Nevoso. Upon being asked if this might signal the beginning of the end of his attempt to win the race, the Michelton-Scott rider from Bury was less than bullish with his response. “It’s a good question,” he said. “I don’t know. I hope not. We’ll see.” We certainly will and after nearly 2,000 miles of racing across 20 days, the outcome of this year’s Giro remains very much up in the air with just three stages remaining. Taking in the Colle Delle Finestre today’s 184km slog from Venaria Reale to Bardonecchia is the most difficult and attritional of the race and could not come at more perfect time – the day after the maglia rosa has shown his first signs of weakness.

Many words have tried to capitalise on the success of the Danish art of enjoying life’s pleasures and feeling content. Lagom, a Swedish word that effectively means everything in moderation, got close but has since petered out. The rest are long forgotten. Now, there’s a new contender. It’s been a good few months since we found a word from another language that doesn’t translate exactly, describes a lifestyle which, though desirable, is impossible to assimilate, and which we have co-opted and mispronounced until it entered the everyday vernacular – but not before selling a few million cosy rugs in the process. If you haven’t heard of meraki yet, you may have seen it without realising. It’s a Greek adjective that loosely means doing something with love, brio and care – but it’s also a festival in St Albans, a few beauty salons in the UK, half a dozen Greek restaurants, a Danish lifestyle and skincare brand, and now a clothing line of elevated basics from Amazon. The idea, says Harri Crosby, a senior menswear designer at Amazon Fashion Private Brands, is for a 90-piece collection that is “thoughtfully designed”, in a “core colour palette” and which is so simple that, when you get dressed in Meraki clothing, you will save some of the 16 minutes the average woman supposedly spends getting dressed each morning. Time which, if correctly harnessed, could be used to do something more fruitful, such as make a meraki breakfast, take a more leisurely meraki commute, or finish last night’s row with a dash of meraki. Dr Myrto Hatzimichali, a lecturer in classics at the University of Cambridge, isn’t convinced: “I was wondering if they had picked a Turkish word, because it has a slightly different meaning,” she says of the word, which entered the Greek language from Turkish but whose meaning has evolved. In Turkish, she says, “it means care, worry, or even hobby”. The Greek is harder to translate. “It loosely means taking pleasure at your work. Doing something with joy, attention to detail, putting in the extra mile. With craftsmanship, it means made with love and care and taking pride.” To Hatzimichali, it feels arbitrary unless, that is, “they are trying to emphasise the care taken with craftsmanship”. Hatzimichali’s issue lies less with the translation – “although a lot of Greek words are untranslateable” – and more with using the word in this context altogether. “It’s not a concept. It’s not hygge,” she says. Still, “it’s nice to boost interest in Greek culture, so I’m not against it”. Amazon came up with the word using a concept as old as meraki itself – collaborative branding – but while it’s easy to be cynical about its use, at least we can pronounce this one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/25/new-uk-nuclear-power-plants-hinge-on-deal-between-hitachi-and-government","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T14:49:03Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear plans 'risk collapse if Hitachi talks fail'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/25/new-uk-nuclear-power-plants-hinge-on-deal-between-hitachi-and-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/25/new-uk-nuclear-power-plants-hinge-on-deal-between-hitachi-and-government","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear plans 'risk collapse if Hitachi talks fail'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Britain’s hopes for a number of new nuclear power stations could collapse if the government and the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi fail to make a breakthrough on talks for a plant in Wales, a top nuclear lobbyist has warned. Hiroaki Nakanishi, the firm’s chairman, met Theresa May earlier this month, to press the prime minister for financial support for two reactors at Wylfa on the island of Anglesey. The company’s board is understood be meeting on Monday to decide whether it can proceed with the UK’s subsequent offer, believed to include a multibillion-pound loan. Tim Yeo, chairman of the industry-backed group New Nuclear Watch Europe, said the outcome of the negotiations had huge consequences for other international firms hoping to build reactors in Britain. “If Hitachi walk away from Wylfa that probably spells the end of new nuclear in the UK,” he said. The 3GW plant at Wylfa by the Hitachi subsidiary Horizon Nuclear Power would be the UK’s second new nuclear power station after EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C, under construction in Somerset. More are planned: EDF wants to build at Sizewell on the Suffolk coast, South Korea’s Kepco at Moorside in Cumbria and China’s CGN at Bradwell in Essex, with EDF’s help. Hitachi wants to build abroad because of a moribund home market, while the UK government sees nuclear as an important source of low-carbon power. Despite the protracted discussions between the two parties, London appears to still be committed to making the economics of nuclear work. “I sense there’s still a lot of political will to make new nuclear happen from government, and backbenchers seem to want it in their areas,” a Whitehall source said. An industry source said the deal would work if the government offered some form of financial support directly, while energy bill payers footed the rest through a subsidy known as a contract for difference. That would mean Hitachi receiving a guaranteed price of power, likely to be around £80 a megawatt hour, lower than Hinkley’s £92.50 but still nearly twice the wholesale cost of electricity. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) is understood to be enthusiastically backing the project, while the Treasury, which would have to see an equity contribution or loan for the construction period on government books, is more sceptical. Paul Dorfman at the Energy Institute at University College London said: “This would mean the hardworking UK taxpayer and energy consumer, who are labouring under ramping austerity, are being asked to stump up for an extraordinarily expensive nuclear plant just at the time that renewable costs are plummeting.” Japanese media have reported the UK government’s loan for the project could be as much as £13bn, and put the total cost of the plant at more than £20bn, even more than Hinkley Point C. The details are understood to have been leaked by the Japanese government, not Hitachi, and the UK government has said it “does not recognise” the reports. Greenpeace said the UK was wrongly pursuing a “dinosaur” technology and should focus on renewables, batteries and interconnectors to other countries. Kate Blagojevic, the group’s head of energy, said: “It’s unacceptable the Japanese public are hearing about this before the British public, if what we’re hearing is true that over £13bn of British taxpayer money is going to a Japanese company to build a plant in Wales. “It’s pretty outrageous the government hasn’t been upfront about what they’re proposing and why.” A spokesperson for BEIS said: “These discussions are commercially sensitive and we have no further details at this time.” A Horizon spokesperson said: “It’s no secret we’re in discussions with the UK and Japanese governments, and have been for some time, over support for our project. With these discussions still ongoing it is too early to comment on the specifics of what a future deal may look like. “We’re confident, given the strategic importance of our project to both nations, we’ll reach a successful conclusion to these discussions in the near future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/26/a-new-improved-more-inclusive-less-reverse-racist-sorry-day","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T21:00:37Z","webTitle":"A new improved, more inclusive, less reverse racist Sorry Day! | First Dog on the Moon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/26/a-new-improved-more-inclusive-less-reverse-racist-sorry-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/26/a-new-improved-more-inclusive-less-reverse-racist-sorry-day","fields":{"headline":"A new improved, more inclusive, less reverse racist Sorry Day!","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/25/galileo-uk-will-build-own-satellite-system-if-frozen-out-of-eu-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T08:06:46Z","webTitle":"UK will build own satellite system if frozen out of EU's Galileo – chancellor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/25/galileo-uk-will-build-own-satellite-system-if-frozen-out-of-eu-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/25/galileo-uk-will-build-own-satellite-system-if-frozen-out-of-eu-brexit","fields":{"headline":"UK will build own satellite system if frozen out of EU's Galileo – chancellor","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has warned that the UK will build its own satellite navigation system to rival the European Union’s €10bn (£9bn) Galileo project if Brussels carries out its threat to block access. The European commission has cited legal issues about sharing sensitive information with a non-member state to justify its decision to shut British firms out of the project. The EU has also said it will restrict access to encrypted signals from Galileo. Speaking as he arrived in Brussels for a meeting of finance ministers on Friday, Hammond said the UK could not accept the EU’s decision to block British companies from the satellite’s manufacture and the government from secure aspects of the project. He told reporters: “We need access to a satellite system of this kind. A plan has always been to work as a core member of the Galileo project, contributing financially and technically to the project. “If that proves impossible then Britain will have to go it alone, possibly with other partners outside Europe and the US, to build a third competing system. But for national security strategic reasons we need access to a system and will ensure that we get it.” The UK is said to be hopeful that Australia could be a partner for such a rival project, should the impasse with the EU continue. The EU is insistent that the UK had agreed in 2011 as an EU member state on the rules on blocking non-EU countries from access to secure elements of the project. A senior EU official said, after some fraught negotiations this week, that it had become clear the UK “would like to transform Galileo from a union programme to a joint EU-UK programme, and that is quite a big ask for the EU”. “They want to have privileged access to the security elements of PRS (the encrypted navigation system for government-authorised users) and to be able to continue manufacturing the security modules which would mean that after Brexit the UK, as a third country, would have the possibility to turn off the signal for the EU,” the official said. “It also means they are asking for information and the possibility to produce the security modules that would give them information that currently not all member states have.” The European commission will to report back to member states to gauge their views, but the UK’s approach has been described as a “big ask”. On Thursday, the EU accused British negotiators of “chasing a fantasy” and failing to get to grips with the consequences of Brexit. A senior EU official also claimed progress on the problem of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland was proving elusive, something the UK government sources suggest is mere posturing by Brussels. In a sign that the criticism has been felt, the prime minister’s chief Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, who has been leading the talks this week, wrote a rare tweet on Friday morning. He said: “Very proud of the x-Government team that worked so hard to support technical talks in Brussels this week. UK proposals for a deep relationship, calmly and professionally presented.” The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: “On the same day the Office for National Statistics has confirmed that UK economic growth is the weakest it’s been in six years, it’s not surprising the chancellor is looking to focus on matters in outer space. “Working people will be rightly angry that Philip Hammond can find billions of pounds at the drop of a hat for a space programme, yet is not prepared to find the money our vital public services like the NHS desperately need. “It’s time the chancellor came down to Earth, to prove he is on the same planet as the rest of us by recognising what he is putting people in our country through with his austerity cuts.” The EU wants the UK to agree by a European council summit in June to present a workable backstop position for Northern Ireland that would come into force should a future trade deal or bespoke technological solutions fail to arise that could avoid the need for a hard border. In recent days, the prime minister has suggested a solution could be found in the UK staying in the customs union for a time-limited period. But the EU is insistent that the backstop must be “Northern Ireland-specific”. The official said: “We have to do away with the fantasy that there is an all-UK solution to that.” Responding to the EU’s withering assessment of the UK’s approach, Hammond told reporters: “We’re having very constructive discussions. I don’t think that’s a particularly helpful comment; there are obviously a wide range of views on both sides.“Everybody I’ve engaged with has been very constructive, very keen to find a way to move forward. We’re very conscious of the ticking clock and the need to make significant progress for the June European council and that’s what we’re here to do.” Hammond said the government was looking at “all sorts of options to deliver the reassurances that are being sought around maintaining the Irish border in an open condition”. He said: “That’s a priority for us. We’re very keen to find a way to move forward and we’re looking at all the options.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/may/26/sportwatch-afl-nrl-netball-super-rugby-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T12:20:08Z","webTitle":"Sportwatch: AFL, NRL, netball, and Super Rugby - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/may/26/sportwatch-afl-nrl-netball-super-rugby-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/may/26/sportwatch-afl-nrl-netball-super-rugby-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"Sportwatch: AFL, NRL, netball, and Super Rugby - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"And that’s a wrap! All four games in the AFL ending up quite clear cut in the end, but all four of them at one stage or another very much in the balance. Essendon with perhaps the upset of the evening, as Richmond, Sydney and Geelong recorded wins that were perhaps expected. And in the ‘battle of the top four’ in the NRL it was the lower placed teams producing the performances - South Sydney far too strong for a disappointing Warriors side, with Penrith putting on a near-perfect eighty minutes to down the top-placed St George Illawarra. The Roosters with another steady win as they came from behind to down the Titans. In the Super Netball a massive result for the Firebirds who downed the previously unbeaten and top-placed West Coast Fever to keep their title push alive. And in the Super Rugby, it was another double-helping of sad-times sundae as both the Waratahs and the Reds went agonisingly close to important wins over NZ sides, only to ultimately fall short. Lashing of George Orwell for the players at training next week no doubt. Yes Boxer, just work harder and it will all be fine. Thanks for your company tonight - see you again next Saturday on the Sportwatch that never sleeps! They kicked just one major in the third quarter but how’s this last quarter from the Bombers! Leading by just four after Himmelberg’s miss, Essendon just flew home; Jake Stringer showning himself to be a flat-track bully with the two final goals to rub the Giants’ noses right in it. 35 points the final margin - and Essendon make it back-to-back wins! Gola gola! What an effort from Sam Menegola to crown this one, after Gary Ablett (jnr) misses a chance to add some nostalgia to his return to Kardinia Park tonight. They’ve turned it on when it’s really mattered here, the Cats. A bit like Richmond in the earlier clash with the Saints. They got within 8, did the Blues but they got steamrolled in those closing minutes. So they bounce back from that shock loss to the Bombers last week, and it’s 6-4 for the Cats to sneak back into the top eight. Big moment here - Tom Hawkins claims the mark, and with just ten to play he kicks just Geelong’s 9th of the night, and Hawkins’ second! They go out to 16 points clear - surely the Blues can’t reel this in. And nope - that has to be it; Hawkins with a second in as many minutes. 3.0 and what a time to fire them. Great experience from the Geelong full-forward. Meanwhile at Kardinia Park we’ve got a grandstand finish on our hands as well! Geelong came out and kicked the first of the final quarter, and who else but Dangerfield to put his side 18 points ahead. But the Blues have fired back with five consecutive scoring chances - and in fitting with their evening, four of them are behinds! They’re doing this the hard way the Blues (just for a change) - fifteen to play and they trail by 8! Harry Himmelberg with the first chance of the final quarter - and the Giants player hits the post! They could have taken the lead for the first time all game! The gap is reduced to just four. Deary me. A push in the back and they’ve conceded a 50m penalty the Giants. That’s a coach-killer that is. It’s easy for James Stewart who fires home, and it’s the Bombers now by ten! Orazia Fantasia picks up a loose ball - he looks to fire a quick-fire second.. but it veers to the side. Adds just the one and they’re back to 11. And big moment here - Fantasia picks out Shaun McKernan, and he puts it on his chest! He turns around, fires that one home and it’s the Bombers rolling home here! Not pretty for the home fans - they’re staring at just one win from their last six matches. Forget slump, they’re in freefall, the Giants. Okay, let’s pick up the two AFL games, where we’ve got a banger of a final quarter in store both in Western Sydney, and possibly in Geelong as well! With a goal after the buzzer to Jeremy Cameron to close that third quarter, the Giants - who remember have never led in this game - find themselves just five points in arrears: 7.9 (51) trails 8.8 (56). Meanwhile, there’s just 12 points in it at Kardinia Park where but for some wayward kicking the Blues could be sniffing another big scalp against the Cats. Having leapt to that 24-0 early lead, Geelong did stretch it back out to 20 points the margin - but two behinds and a goal to David Cunningham has the Blues lurking with intent. 4.11 being their downfall so far - won’t some of those feature in some middle of the night dreams tonight. And confirmation of that top-of-the-table NRL result; and it’s a near flawless performance from the home side in front of a sold-out Panthers Stadium, with both Origin coaches in the house, and haven’t players like James Maloney and Nathan Cleary done themselves ever favour with this performance. Too good from the Panthers, as the Dragons lose just their third game of the season; and if my maths is right, they go exactly level on points difference, but will remain second because St George have scored more? Something like that. Aaron Smith directing traffic for the Highlanders; they’re just playing low-risk one-off forward hit ups here. The Reds getting increasingly frustrated; they haven’t seen the ball for minutes. They concede the penalty, and surely that’s the match. Too much experience from the Kiwi side who bounce back from their disappointing showing last week against the Waratahs. A big chance missed for the Reds tonight. Five minutes to play, and both sides trading kicks. The Reds failing to make the most of a key turnover with a box kick that’s straight down the throat of the Highlander’s backline. Sopoaga kicks for touch in turn, and the Reds make a key error from the line out. Big chance for the visitors here - they’re about 25m out and building momentum. Deary me. One of the Queensland tall timbers tries to bring down a smaller opponent, but it’s a high tackle - and Sopoaga slots the penalty. 15-18 Highlanders with three minutes to play! Well they’ve not been poor, the Dragons, but we have the remarkable situation where the league’s top side could be about to be held try-less. Big statement here by the Panthers; it might be a question then of making sure they get through the representative season without losing this momentum. Viliame Kikau with the final nail in the coffin. Let’s move our attention now to the Super Rugby where we’ve 8 minutes to play and it’s still locked 15-15 between the Reds and the Highlanders! We’re still stuck around a 10-point margin halfway through the third in GWS v Essendon, where the home side have still never been in the lead, but nor have they ever been far away from it. It’s one-goal a piece in the third stanza - 6.7 (43) trailing 8.5 (53). The Bombers with 60 tackles so far, they’re really scrambling and harrying well - but will it prove enough? It’s still right in the balance this one! We’ve twenty to play in the Super Rugby and a converted try to the Highlanders has seen the South Island side square it all up at 15-15 after Hamish Stewart had scored for the Reds just after half-time. Big final quarter of that match to come! A reminder for cycling fans we’re underway with live Giro D’Italia action as well - here’s Nick Ames with all the action from Stage 20: Can Chris Froome back up yesterday’s remarkable exploits? James Maloney with a clever step to send Yeo through a gap. From the next player the Panthers play it wide and fast, and terrific strength shown by Christian Crichton out wide to stretch out the arm for the line. That could be the game - and Maloney’s slotted the conversion from the sideline. It’s outside two converted tries, big ask for the Dragons, this. A sickening injury from the Cats-Blues clash, here’s Australian Associated Press with the update: Geelong’s AFL clash with Carlton has been marred by an ugly leg injury to exciting youngster Esava Ratugolea. The 19-year-old’s right leg was trapped beneath him in a marking contest in the second quarter of the round 10 encounter at Kardinia Park on Saturday night. Play was stopped for several minutes as medical staff tended to him before he was taken from the field on a stretcher and taken to hospital. Some talk flying around it could be a broken leg or ankle. Awful news for a talented young player, if that’s the case. We’re back in the second half at Panthers Stadium, where Penrith have gone just metres short of the St George Illawarra line once again; only to be denied by some excellent tryline defence from the visitors. Isaah Yeo, denied for the second time tonight less than a metre out, with Cleary almost darting over for a second try. Meanwhile an injury concern for State of Origin, with Ben Hunt leaving the field with a suspected leg injury. Queensland fans won’t like the look of this. Fingers crossed it could just be a corked thigh. Meanwhile, the Dragons finally get on the board courtesy a penalty. 8-2 the score with 30 minutes to play. A fine finish to the first half up in Brisbane, where the Reds have their noses just in front in the Super Rugby against the Highlanders. It was just a penalty goal each until Tevita Li crossed for the visitors with 27 minutes gone, but in the shadow of half-time a big push saw Brandon Paenga-Amosa crash over. The Reds leading 10-8. Can they make it back-to-back wins over the Highlanders for Australian sides?! Both AFL fixtures proving very engrossing as we near half-time. Having raced to a 22-point second quarter lead the Bombers have been grounded here as the Giants have kicked 3.2 to trail by just two with ten to play before the siren. They’ve kicked just 1.0 this second quarter, where despite some wayward stuff from Jeremy Cameron the Giants have really showed some intent. And at Kardinia, a remarkable turn of affairs where we’ve gone almost 40 minutes without a goal! Having raced to that 4.0 lead the Cats then gave up the next seven consecutive scoring shots - but Carlton could only manage 2.5 to crawl back with seven points. Sam Menegola with a steadier for the Cats, they lead by 15 with about four minutes to play in the first half. Well, it wasn’t high-scoring, but an incredibly engrossing first half for the top-of-the-table clash. One of those war of attrition type of encounters, but some fine moments of individual skill. The home side shading it, as reflected on the scoreboard. Both defences completing their tackles at over 90% so a tough and relatively low-error encounter so far. He’s only just back from a serious leg injury but a brilliant individual effort from Nathan Cleary to finally breach the St George defensive line. Tyrone Peachey with great metres to set it up, but it’s the double dummy and angled run that fools the Dragons defenders. James Maloney adds the extras, making it 2/2 after an early converted penalty. We’ve got both State of Origin coaches inside a packed Panthers Stadium, so plenty of subplots for this one. No points also 20 minutes in to the Super Rugby showdown in Brisbane where both the Reds and the Highlanders have traded penalties to gain field position, but neither side have made it count on the scoreboard. Okay, quarter time wraps from the two AFL fixtures. At Kardinia Park it’s the Cats by 11. They raced to 4.0 in an opening 10 minutes that was all Geelong; but it was Carlton who then responded with 2.1 over the next six minutes. Remarkably, from then on there was not a single point registered for the final 14 minutes! And a bright start for the Bombers in Western Sydney, where they’ve picked up where they left off last weekend with a five-goal opening quarter. The Giants trailing 2.3 (15) to 5.2 (32). Let’s see how they respond before half-time! Very close! Gareth Widdop with a crucial intervention as Maloney grubbers and looks to regain his own kick, but the former Storm man swoops to ‘soccer’ behind. All this after Isaah Yeo is pulled down literally inches short of the line! Great tense drama this; St George defending manfully. And after twenty minutes played, we’re still without a score! So, no score during the first ten minutes of this top-of-the-table NRL clash, with both sides keen to soften each other up. A few tough tackles but no clear points-scoring openings as yet. Ben Hunt earning a few restarts for the Dragons with some clever in-goal kicks; they’ve marginally shaded the opening exchanges have the Dragons. Now we’ve got two fixtures in the AFL to keep an eye across - we’ve just kicked off in Geelong where the Cats have already scampered to a three goal lead over the Blues. And in Sydney its GWS playing host to a resurgent Bombers outfit, who have also already helped themselves to early goals. We’ll keep you abreast of both these clashes. Finally, in the Super Rugby it’s Reds v Highlanders, which to be fair I’ve got down as a bye for the Landers, given how keen they’ll be to make amends for last weeks’ loss to the Tahs. Right! Now to the big one. It’s 1st v 2nd in the NRL where we’re off to Penrith where the Panthers are playing host to the Dragons. The players running out in beanies tonight - which I thought was due to the temperature but I’ve been informed it’s beanies for brain cancer week. A nice touch. A sell out here in Western Sydney - let’s hope we get a game to match. Alle les footy! And final confirmation from the AFL clash at the Gabba as well. Another brave showing from the Lions who threatened to inch their way back into this one. But the Swans showing some game management skills to remain relatively comfortably ahead here. Heeney, Hayward and Ronke with doubles for the Swans, with no Lions players kicking more than one goal. Josh Kennedy again huge in midfield with 34 disposals and seven tackles, but in fairness they were never more than 1pt behind from the opening whistle the Swans. They go 7-3 and jump to third on the ladder with the Crows and the Demons still yet to play. And a confirmation of the game up the road in Auckland where the Bunnies have blown away their competition rivals the Warriors tonight. They scored two tries whilst down a man, and some poor tryline defence set the tone for the home side. They’ve threatened to mix it this season, but their Achilles heel of inconsistency has flared once again. 4th place leapfrogs third, and that’s a big body blow for the Kiwi outfit. Some cheeky stuff from the Chiefs who cross after the buzzer for a bonus-point earning try from McKenzie which he then duly converts. It’s a final score that’s not reflective of what was until the 80th minute a very close-fought affair. They continue to push the top NZ sides, do the Waratahs, but for the second time in three weeks they’re undone by the finest of margins. Not to be, but another fighting effort. Brillance from Folau, he regathers from the restart - and the Waratahs with a huge chance here! They probe the line, they’re about 20m out; they wheel left, they wheel right. It spreads through the hands, and with the men in light blue about 10m from the line - it’s a penalty: Brodie Retallick has got his lumbering frame over the ball, and that could prove a game-saver! Terrific work from the back rower; and that MIGHT just be the game. Some desperate tryline defence from the Waratahs here with McKenzie looking to spark something to give his side some breathing room. The Chiefs were just 5m out but have been penalised for a player diving over the top. We roll on, and with seven to play it’s the skipper Hooper who’s been penalised in turn. McKenzie lines one up from dead in front and about 30m out. He hits it - it drifts right.. but just inside the upright! It’s 32-27, five points the margin with six minutes to play! No further points up in Auckland in Warriors v Rabbitohs since Sutton’s 43rd minute try - it’s still 6-28 there with about fifteen to play. And we’ve got another successful penalty to the Waratahs here from right in front, and it’s 29-27 in Hamilton with also around fifteen to play. Dare to dream, kids. Dare to dream. Meanwhile, we’re back to three majors the difference at the Gabba, despite their mismatch on the ladder, the Lions are just threatening to hang within striking range still, as we reach the halfway mark of the final quarter. 6.9 (45) plays 9.6 (60) - we’ll let you know if that spices up over the final fifteen minutes. But surely the Lions can’t sneak this, can they? And I regret to inform you, the report of the revival of Australian Rugby has been premature. RIP. Smart work from the Chiefs with the halves (Brad Weber, I think?) identifying a pace mismatch out wide and box-kicking a terrific ball to the wing. Pulu steaming past one of the lumbering Waratahs forwards to score in the corner. But once again, McKenzie strikes the post with the conversion. Ooh, hello hello! Folau combining brilliantly with Beale, who pins the head back, commits the covering defence with the dummy and slides through on the angle to score in the corner! Foley with a perfect effort from the sideline to add the extras. Can anybody else smell this? It’s Tahs-mentum! Australian Super Rugby’s back, baby. Hmmm. That well. A bit of a scrappy breakdown in attack there but terrific skill from Pulu to recover a loose ball, jink inside his opposite number and charge at the line. A Foley penalty had cut the half-time lead to just two points, but we’re back out to a converted try here. McKenzie striking the post with the conversion attempt. Nope, sorry whanau. I’m hopping of the Warriors train. We’re four minutes into the second half and the Bunnies have just strolled over for another one, John Sutton the scorer. We’re 6-28 here and unfortunately without Johnson we’re not seeing too much razzle-dazzle from the home side. Let’s see how the Tahs are holding up. And the Swans are out to a 23pt lead up in Brisbane, where the wet conditions have definitely kept the scoring low here. Sydney playing perhaps the smarter footy though; not overcommitting to the loose ball. Every time the Lions look to get back into this one the Swans find an answer. We’re just in the shadow of three-quarter time where it’s 4.6 (30) plays 8.5 (53). And it’s a closer affair just down the road in Hamilton where the Chiefs have turned around an early bright start from the high-flyers of the Australian conference (which in fairness is akin to me being a rapid schoolboy winger for the E’s). Two very good backline set pieces for the Tahs led to tries, before McKenzie put Retallick into a hole from close range. But a terrible turnover about 20m from their own line gifted the Chiefs their second, and the momentum heading into the sheds. Still, despite conceding the last 19 points, they’re not out of this, the Tahs. If the Warriors keep capitulating over in the NRL, we might even shift our attention to this one for the second half. We’ll keep you posted. Well, we thought it would be a tight affair as third hosted fourth in the NRL; but it’s been anything but so far with the Warriors very much second best, despite playing with a man advantage for ten minutes! They did go very close just in the shadow of half-time but the Auckland-based outfit couldn’t muster the morale-boosting try, with the ball spilling loose over the line. And a bit of stink from that early Saints-Richmond game, here’s the latest from Australian Associated Press: Richmond coach Damien Hardwick has labelled the AFL’s score review system an “embarrassment” after Jack Higgins had a goal overturned during the Tigers’ victory over St Kilda. The Tigers led by 13 points early in Saturday’s third quarter at the MCG when Higgins kicked truly from the forward pocket, only for the field umpire to call for a score review. Replays showed the ball had clearly crossed the line before being touched by St Kilda ruckman Tom Hickey. But the goal umpire’s decision was overturned and the Saints went on to kick four goals straight and snatch back the lead. Richmond ultimately prevailed, surging home in the fourth quarter to secure a 15.15 (105) to 12.5 (77) victory. But Hardwick, who has been a strident critic of the score review system, was still fuming about the decision after the game. There you go! And I was thinking the Dustin Martin goal was the contentious one; you win some, you lose some, Monsieur Hardwick? Deary me. They’re identical twins, and now they’ve scored identical tries! We know they’re big lumps of men, these Burgess lads, but surely the Warriors defence has to do better from that distance? Back on the field after his early sin-binning and Burgess, T has made amends. Mannering the guilty party there, for a straightforward bash and carry try. We’re 32 minutes gone and Warriors are in all sorts here. The Bunker takes a good look at this for a possible obstruction; definitely a decent shout for it as Burgess, T runs into Mannering in defence. But it’s Big G.I. who barrels over, and they won’t take it off him. Reynolds with one of the least convincing conversion attempts you’ve ever seen - how’d he miss that?! Could be one of those nights for the Bunnies goalkicker - in his defence he did successfully slot a penalty a few minutes earlier. And we’re about 20 minutes played in the Super Rugby clash between the Chiefs and the Waratahs, and it’s the Australian team making the brighter start once again! Two converted tries to one the score (7-14) with the Tahs backs Cameron Clark and Curtis Rona the scorers. Big Brodie Retallick pulling one back for the Chiefs. That one’s nicely poised, but don’t get too excited yet.. #RememberCrusaders An update from half-time at the Gabba, where it remains a low-scoring affair between the Lions and the Swans in the AFL. Not pretty watching for home fans who add just one behind to their score for the quarter, but the Swans only mustering 2.3 themselves. 2.3 (15) trailing 5.3 (33) as the visitors lead by three goals. Remarkable! They’re the team with twelve players out there, but they’ve put on two tries in Tom Burgess’s absence. Some terrific slick hands with G.I. joining the line and posing his usual nuisance. Reynolds shanks the conversion attempt, but it’s the Bunnies hopping to the lead; around 20 minutes played! And if brothers Burgess were aggrieved seeing Tom sent to the bin, they’ve struck back in the best possible fashion. Big George, he of the flowing locks, has powered over despite the attention from as many as five Warriors defenders. Brute force that. But could the defensive line have done better? Reynolds adds the extras, and we’re game on. We’ll stay with the NRL for a bit, given the top-of-the-table nature of this one, and some huge talking points! Souths with a concerted effort to bounce straight back here, but RTS with a terrific one-on-one tackle to save a certain try as the Bunnies ran on the last! And less than a minute later, its Tom Burgess who’s been sent to the bin, with Souths pinged for consistently being inside the ten! Oh dear, how much might this mad minute come to haunt them? And it’s first blood to the hosts - Agnatius Paasi burrowing over from close ranger after the Bunnies concede three penalties in the first six minutes. They’ve started a little lacklustre have South Sydney - they can’t afford to let the Warriors get on a roll here. We’ll also have Super Rugby action for you shortly, as the Waratahs take on the Chiefs in Hamilton, not a million miles away from Auckland where the NRL is happening tonight. A big test of whether Australian Rugby is back, that one. Can the Tahs go back-to-back against NZ opposition? (Hint: probably not, no). And that’s kick off in the Warriors v Rabbitohs clash! Nice looking conditions in Auckland (which hasn’t been too regular of late). Rabbitohs get through their first set of six comfortably, and similarly Roger Tuivasa Sheck receives well under his first test. Some interesting subplots to this one - former Rabbitoh Isaac Luke v Damien Cook with NSW State of Origin jerseys on the line, and of course no Shaun Johnson for the Warriors who’s out with an ankle injury. Warriors with an early penalty and in trademark fashion don’t opt to take the two, but instead push for the six. In the interim a recap of some big news from some other sports. A huge statement in the Giro D’Italia where Chris Froome has defied his critics once again to launch himself back into the pink jersey. Sean Ingle has more: And in the NBA, who else but LeBron James has played an emphatic hand to force it to Game 7 between the Cavaliers and the Celtics. Is there anything this guy can’t do? A well contested start to our second AFL game of the night, where at quarter time the Lions are just trailing the Swans 2.2 (14) trails 3.0 (18). Few clear-cut shooting chances in a tightly-contested opening salvo. Expect this one to open up as tired legs come into play. And we’re about 20 minutes away from the first of our two huge ‘top-four only’ NRL clashes, where Mt Smart in Auckland is the venue for Warriors v Rabbitohs. And a huge statement in the Super Netball - the undefeated league-leaders have crumbled! Tippett offering sublime support to Aiken in the end as the two Firebirds goalscorers launched six-unanswered goals to wrest this one away early in the final quarter. 26/28 goals and 27 goal assists for Tippett with Mahalia Cassidy shading the battle of the centres as well. Big result, and a big shakeup in the netball. If footy games lasted 34 minutes you’d say a terrific win for the Titans.. but alas it wasn’t to be today. Twenty-eight points unanswered, including a cherry on top try from veteran Rooster Mitch Aubusson after some excellent work from Tedesco once more. Back to the drawing board for coach Garth Brennan, whose side are already looking off the pace in the race for the finals. And we’re underway in our second AFL clash of the day, where the Lions host the Swans at the Gabba. Seven minutes in and no score for either side. An interesting third quarter in the Super Netball - where the Fever have finally won a term (securing a bonus point under the new scoring system) - I mentioned the two Jamaican sharp-shooters, Aiken and Fowler; well they’re both shooting at a remarkable 97%! Do you reckon it’s personal out there? Fowler 37/38 and Aiken 35/36 leading the charge, but key contributions from GA from Tippett (16/17) for the Firebirds and the veteran Medhurst (10/13). The latter however missing three in the third quarter alone; will that come to haunt the Fever at full-time? It’s still a five-point game though thanks to that strong second quarter from the Queenslanders. We’re a few minutes into the final stanza where it’s Firebirds 55-50. Back to the NRL, and have we seen a turnaround! Trailing 6-14 at half-time the Roosters have put on 22 unanswered points in as many minutes to steamroll the Titans! Isaac Liu, Latrell Mitchell and Cooper Cronk the try scorers, with Mitchell adding three conversions and two penalties from the boot. Isn’t he enhancing his growing reputation, the young 20-year-old from Taree. Well that gave that a real good rattle, did the Saints, and they gave the Tigers a decent third-quarter scare when they ran out to a 12pt lead. But it was Richmond who purred to the finish line like a fine racing motor, despite the loss of Jack Riewoldt to an early concussion. Jade Gresham leading the line for St Kilda to make it a contest; but it’s an eighth win of the season for the Tigers who keep the pressure on West Coast at the top of the ladder. It’s turning into the Caddy v Gresham show with both forwards firing season or career best efforts here for their respective sides. Josh Caddy fires his fifth (5.1) to effectively close the door for the Tigers, but inside a minute it’s Jade Gresham with his sixth (6.0) for the Saints! We’re two minutes to play, and Caddy’s just marked about 48m out - can the 25-year-old bang a sixth of his own; it flies far, it flies clean - yes he can! And there’s Richmond bringing up the triple figures. They lead disposals, contested possessions, tackles and hit outs, but they just can’t quite match the top-end finishing of the Tigers here, can the Saints. Tim Membrey with a solid effort to bring it back to a 15pt clash; before Vlastuin fires his third to ease the nerves for the home fans. They’ll need to kick four to win this, so surely that’s goodnight to this plucky St Kilda challenge. Close but no cigar? And the pressure is building here in the AFL, but the Saints are just hanging in there. FOUR consecutive behinds as the Tigers besiege their goalsquare, but they can’t quite find the knockout punch. Two of these were rushed behind, so the Saints backline working overtime. 14 points the difference, with about fifteen to play. And there it is - finally they land the six-pointer, and its Dan Butler to put Richmond 20 ahead. That’s the largest margin of the game - surely the Tigers to close this out? Wowee. A quick update from the clash-of-the-titans encounter over in the Super Netball; where Queensland Firebirds are putting on a clinic in the second quarter! They’re running 17-9, to pull out to a nine-goal lead - and this against the only undefeated team in the league! Aiken and Gretel Tippett running the boards with 8 of the last 9 goals! And we’re underway in the final quarter in the Richmond-Saints clash. A contentious moment this - Dustin Martin with some more superb athleticism to fire one goalwards; but has it been touched on the line? The video suggests perhaps a wafer-thing touch, but its inconclusive. We go back to umpire’s call, and it’s adjudged a six-pointer! Will that come to haunt the Saints? Jade Gresham with his fifth goal - just his second 5-goal haul of his career, and we’re back at an 11pt lead for the Tigers. 20-odd minutes to play here. And we’ve just hit half-time in the NRL - where it’s the visitors the Titans who finish the opening stanza the stronger: Is Don, is good - Anthony Don, that is - in the corner with a fine pirouette and placement to take the Titans out to a 14-6 lead. Yikes, and what a Jekyll and Hyde quarter that was over in the AFL! Having left it with the Saints on a hot streak, the Tigers have roared back to life with 4.3 of their own unanswered to go into the final quarter with their noses back in front! Two goals in as many minutes to Nick Vlastunin started the rout, before Josh Caddy fired a fourth major of the day, and then Dustin Martin rattled off a trademark effort to stretch it to a 15pt for the Tigers. Jade Gresham with his fourth as well to arrest the slide, but it’s still a 10pt lead for Richmond. Not insurmountable; we’ll watch this final quarter keenly for you! In the NRL early fixture we’re about 30 minutes played and it’s Roosters and Titans locked up at 6-6 up in the Central Coast. Michael Gordon with an early penalty and then try for the Gold Coast after some sketchy work in the in-goal by the Roosters defence. But a classy one-handed effort from James Tedesco has leveled the ledger. Plenty to come in this one. And we’re underway in the Super Netball, where Queensland Firebirds are playing host to the undefeated West Coast Fever. They went down in a tight one last week to Giants Netball did the Firebirds - in fact both their losses this season have been by two or less goals - so they’ll be keen not to lose too much distance on the league leaders. It’s been a fine start for the home side - they raced out to a 7-3 lead with just five minutes played with Jamaican sharp-shooter Romelda Aiken firing 5/5. But the Fever have recovered with their own Jamaican tall (to borrow an AFL term) Jhaniele Fowler shooting a rapid 6/6 of her own to tighten things up. We’re just about to finish the first quarter and it’s Firebirds just edging it 16-15. This one should be a cracker. Let’s start with a quick whip round the boards, and already there’s an interesting one on the boil in the AFL - where it’s St Kilda leading Richmond after a sharp third quarter turnaround. Trailing by 13 at half-time, the casual observer might have presumed the Tigers were on their way to their 8th win in 10 - but it’s been 4.2 unanswered since the break with the Saints really with the bit between the teeth! Some interesting half-time observations from the commentary team suggesting this was on the cards, based on the Saints’ around-ground pressure and high tackle rate.. we’ll keep an eye on this one! G’day all - wherever you’re following this coverage from. As usual we’ve a full dance card worth of sports action in store for you tonight. Can Essendon pull off another stunning upset in the AFL? Will Richmond keep their strong early season form going against the Saints? Can the West Coast Fever remain undefeated in the Super Netball? We’ve got the top four all in action against top four opponents in the NRL - which of the Warriors, Rabbitohs, Panthers or Dragons will post an early blow to a title contender? And can the Waratahs go back to back against NZ opposition in the Super Rugby? We’ll have all the answers to these questions and more, here, on the one-and-only Guardian rolling Sportswatch, where too much sport is never enough."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2018/may/26/artist-mike-parr-to-be-buried-under-a-road-for-three-days-at-dark-mofo","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T22:26:52Z","webTitle":"Artist Mike Parr to be buried under a road for three days at Dark Mofo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/26/artist-mike-parr-to-be-buried-under-a-road-for-three-days-at-dark-mofo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/may/26/artist-mike-parr-to-be-buried-under-a-road-for-three-days-at-dark-mofo","fields":{"headline":"Artist Mike Parr to be buried under a road for three days at Dark Mofo","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The artist Mike Parr will be buried underneath a road for three days as part of a new performance work at this year’s Dark Mofo festival in Hobart. Parr will be buried below the bitumen in the central lane of Macquarie Street, which passes through the Hobart city centre, in a container measuring 4.5 metres by 1.7 metres by 2.2 metres, and the road will be resealed once the container is in place for traffic to continue as normal over the site. The work, entitled Underneath the Bitumen the Artist, is intended to be a comment on the violence of Australia’s colonial history. It will begin at 9pm on Thursday 14 June when the container is buried, and close at 9pm on Sunday 17 June, when Parr will make his exit. “When Mike Parr asks to be buried under the streets of Hobart, it’s hard to say no,” the Dark Mofo creative director, Leigh Carmichael, said in a statement. “Underneath the Bitumen the Artist acknowledges two deeply linked events in Tasmania’s history. The eventual transportation of 75,000 British and Irish convicts in the first half of the 19th century, and the subsequent, nearly total destruction of Tasmania’s Aboriginal population.” Dark Mofo said Parr would be provided with sketchbooks, pencils, a stool, bedding, water, “and other items necessary for survival”. He will continue to create artworks while underground and out of sight. The container will remain in the road after the performance has concluded and will be sealed with concrete. Parr’s artworks are known for being challenging and often disturbing, and regularly contain an endurance element – from the audience as well as the artist. This is the third time he has created an artwork for the Tasmanian arts festival. Asylum [Entry by Mirror Only] – a 72-hour endurance piece in Willow Court Asylum – took place in 2016, and last year had Empty Ocean. Dark Mofo will run in Hobart from 13 to 24 June, with a prelude weekend of programming beginning on 7 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/27/australias-doctors-elect-gp-president-to-send-a-message-to-greg-hunt","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T04:55:20Z","webTitle":"Australia's doctors elect GP president to 'send a message' to Greg Hunt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/27/australias-doctors-elect-gp-president-to-send-a-message-to-greg-hunt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/27/australias-doctors-elect-gp-president-to-send-a-message-to-greg-hunt","fields":{"headline":"Australia's doctors elect GP president to 'send a message' to Greg Hunt","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Melbourne GP, Dr Tony Bartone, has been elected president of Australia’s peak medical body and said improving access to the public health system would be a priority during his two-year term. Bartone on Sunday replaced Western Australian obstetrician Dr Michael Gannon in the role as head of the Australian Medical Association (AMA), telling delegates at the national conference in Canberra that “a GP president will send a message” to the health minister. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “Being a GP means I am plugged in to a variety of issues such as access to care, the time patients wait to get into public hospitals, and the chronic and complex health issues patients are facing, particularly with an ageing population,” Bartone told Guardian Australia. “I’m aware of the variability in health services in rural and regional Australia and the access issues confronting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and the need to ensure there are more quality aged care packages to help elderly people to remain home longer. We need to see real action now.” His predecessor, Gannon, used his term to take on the private health insurance industry, calling for reforms to make insurers more transparent and affordable, and pressuring the government to take action to force insurers to stamp out “junk” health insurance policies that provided little cover and to rein in premiums rises. Bartone said he would continue this insurance reform work, but that he believed that maintaining the private health industry was essential. “Fifty-three per cent of elective surgery occurs in the private health system and if that was to collapse then that access to care would be denied, placing a burden on public hospitals,” he said. The health minister, Greg Hunt, congratulated Bartone on his new role on social media, saying in a tweet; “I look forward to working with you to achieve better health outcomes for patients and doctors.” While Bartone did not go as far as Gannon when it came to Victoria’s voluntary assisted dying laws – Gannon said he was “disappointed” in parliament’s decision last year – Bartone did say he believed the issue of palliative care “took a backseat” during the assisted dying debate. With other states now considering similar legislation Bartone said he agreed with the AMA’s updated position statement, which acknowledges the diversity of opinion among doctors towards euthanasia and says there is a need to consider the possible negative impact of such legislation on the rest of the health system.

England have been smashed by nine wickets by Pakistan inside 90 minutes on day four, a truly dreadful way to begin their international summer. Vic Marks has popped out a quick match report on how it fell apart as soon as it began on Sunday morning, their final four wickets falling for seven runs. Pakistan - who were magnificent throughout - did the rest, collecting the 64 runs they needed in 12.4 overs. Thanks for your company across the four days. We’ll be at Headingley on Friday to do it all again. Keep an eye out for pieces from Vic, Ali Martin and Andy Bull across the afternoon. Bye for now from Lord’s. Mohammad Abbas is the man of the match for his eight wickets. Wasim Akram is interpreting for him in response to Mike Atherton’s questions on Sky. Abbas said he was happy with the lengthy preparation and it helped him agree on the length he was going to bowl in the First Test at Lord’s. He adds that Glenn McGrath and Mohammad Asif are two his heroes and the bowlers he tries to emulate. Joe Root, England captain, at the presentation. “We played some poor shots and gave some wickets away and you can’t afford to do that in Test cricket.” He has no regrets on the toss, though: “If we bat well and get 250 or 300 it is very different on that surface. As a batting group we need to find a way.” More from him shortly at the media conference. Ali Martin will have a story on that soon. Trevor Bayliss, England coach, speaks on BBC. Believes the decision to bat at the toss was a 50/50 call. “The problem is that we didn’t bat very well at all. Yes, it was going to be difficult in the first couple of hours but but we just didn’t bat well enough. We simply keep making the same mistakes. We have seen these guys score runs in difficult conditions but we have to do it more often.” On the slip cordon chopping and changing, Bayliss acknowledged the issue. “We haven’t fielded well in the slips,” he said. “It is a bit like the rest of our play, we have a good game then a bad one. We need someone to field at short leg. Cookie is probably our best short leg to the quicks. Rooty has had a go in there this week.” Scrappy. Still waiting to see the captains. The response online is absolutely brutal. I shared the view of Vish Ehantharajah earlier that yesterday at times felt a bit like Hobart when Australia were smashed there by South Africa in November 2016. Having covered both of those annihilations, I certainly share that view 24 hours on. The same despair. A couple of stats from CricViz that stand out. Since Mohammad Abbas made his debut against the West Indies in 2017, nobody has taken more Test wickets at a lower average. Since the start of the Ashes Tour, England have made a total of 600 runs or more in the entire Test match on only one occasion. Presentations coming up shortly where we’ll hear from the captains and the man of the match, Abbas certain to take home that gong. What a performance from him. All over inside 90 minutes on day four. To think England came here with actual hope this morning. Instead, they lost four wickets in seven balls to leave just Pakistan 64 to win, which they knocked off in 76 deliveries. “Absolutely walloped,” says Phil Tufnell on TMS. “I can’t remember them playing so badly.” Haris Sohail finishes it in style, popping a full toss from Bess into the grandstand then two balls later clipping him through midwicket for four to win the game! Pakistan 66-1 (Imam 18, Haris 39) 12th over: Pakistan 56-1 (Imam 18, Haris 29) Joe Root at silly point on his hands and knees as though he’s striving for the final wicket late on day five. A short leg also there, a leg gully too. No surprises where Wood is directing his attack at Imam, then. In saying that, Wood is fuller this over than the two that came before it. Runs from three of the six deliveries around the field. Both teams happy for this to finish asap. Eight to win. 11th over: Pakistan 50-1 (Imam 13, Haris 28) Haris Sohail looking fantastic here. It is a shame that his day is nearly done. Admittedly, the first of his two boundaries this over was a case of putting away a Bess full toss. No issues with that. The second required real skill, bisecting the two men in the covers after getting to the pitch. Spot on. 14 to win. 10th over: Pakistan 42-1 (Imam 13, Haris 20) Wood sends down a maiden to Imam to slow the Pakistan chase, if briefly. He is really banging it in short of a length as his stock delivery, changing it up with a couple of bouncers. No issues for the opener. 9th over: Pakistan 42-1 (Imam 13, Haris 20) Haris into the 20s with another lovely drive through cover, off Bess this time. He looked fantastic in the first innings, before getting out. A nice red inker here will give him plenty of confidence going into Headingley. Not far away now, 22 more required for a famous Pakistani victory. A little factoid here from the BBC: “The last time England lost the first Test of a summer, regardless of what month it began, was in 1995 against West Indies.” 8th over: Pakistan 36-1 (Imam 13, Haris 14) Mark Wood getting a chance now in place of Broad. Bowled with excellent pace first time around and immediately into his work here, short to Haris who ducks. When Imam gets down there, he gives him a bumper to begin as well. Fair enough. And then again to finish, trying to leave a bruise by aiming at his body. 7th over: Pakistan 35-1 (Imam 13, Haris 13) Dom Bess on for a twist and I think that’s a good shout from Root. If the debutant can get his first wicket in Test cricket before this is finished, that won’t be for nothing ahead of next week. He is very close with his third ball of doing just that, Imam throwing his hands and missing everything. Loose shot from a ball that had plenty of air. I’ve liked that from Bess, giving the ball a chance to turn from the outset. Frustratingly, his misses his line next up and Imam tickles a four fine. Gosh, then some big spin out of the footmarks that beats Imam and Bairstow (and Stokes), adding three more runs to the sundries column. Bowled. 6th over: Pakistan 27-1 (Imam 12, Haris 9) Forget about that extra half an hour, they’re ticking over nicely here with a couple of boundaries for Haris in this Broad set. The first is in error off the edge, but not to hand. The second is much better, leaning into a lavish cover drive that skips away to the rope in front of the grandstand. 5th over: Pakistan 19-1 (Imam 9, Haris 4) Anderson in from the Pavilion End once more. I don’t expect that he will bowl many overs here with back to back Tests. Runs coming from three deliveries in this over, Haris clipping one, Imam driving three then Haris pushing another. He keeps the strike. But really, nothing to see here. Lunch is an hour away and the umpires have the power to extend the session by half an hour if they believe a result is imminent. In other words, one way or another, this ends before lunch. 4th over: Pakistan 14-1 (Imam 6, Haris 2) Broad charging in from the Nursery End and keeping Imam honest throughout, beating him with a good’un to finish. He receives generous applause from the modest crowd in today. Modest by Sunday at Lord’s standards that is, and for good reason. “‘Obsequies’ is a lovely word, isn’t it?” observes John Starbuck. Funeral rites, the definition (full disclosure: I googled). But yes, that’s what this is. 3rd over: Pakistan 14-1 (Imam 6, Haris 2) Haris has three balls to look at, tucking neatly around the corner towards the rope beneath my spot in the press box. A couple for him. Something there for Jimmy, picking up Azhar for the second time in the Test. That’s a beauty too, angling in before nipping past the outside edge, smashing into the off-stump. Can’t ask much more of him this week. 2nd over: Pakistan 11-0 (Azhar 4, Imam 5) “Does this not remind you of Adelaide?” asks Dan Norcross on TMS. Not wrong. A wicket second ball then all over in about an hour. Anyway, Imam’s turn and he’s going to make it count based on the early evidence, playing a glittering off-drive to get off the mark. That’s delightful. A single gets Azhar on strike and Broad beats him immediately. A couple of emails asking about the spot fixing documentary that has just gone live on Al Jazeera. With an abundance of caution, I’m leaving that alone for now, but Ali Martin is writing up a yarn. I’ll post here soon as it is live. 1st over: Pakistan 6-0 (Azhar 4, Imam 0) So, Imam is out there batting despite having copped a bad whack to the groin in the field just before Pakistan’s quicks finished it off. His senior partner Azhar Ali is taking the first ball from Anderson, though. He’s defending to begin before a couple of leg byes get the chase underway to fine leg. Then some runs off the bat to finish off the over, four of them, to third man. Not far from the catcher at third slip, but not to be. They are back on. Jimmy with the ball in his hand with 63 to defend. Yep. Unsurprisingly, the England twitter account have not been posting videos of those wickets. But the clips, if you feel the need to watch them, are alongside the scorecard here (for those reading in the UK). “Do you think England after 141 years of test cricket are in with any chance of improving on Ireland’s five wicket loss to Pakistan in their first ever test?” asks Peter Salmon on the email. “Something to aim for.” In short: no. Aside from the final session yesterday, this has been horrid. As Vish Ehantharajah observed on yesteday, this may well be England’s ‘Hobart Moment’. When Australia were flogged by South Africa there a couple of years ago, five changes followed. Now, that won’t happen. But this side are in real strife at the start of a long summer. By contrast for Pakistan, Abbas finishes with match figures of 8-for-64. Just brilliant. There it is! For all the talk of tricky fourth innings chases, England lost four for seven this morning in 25 balls. It’s emphatic from Amir, uprooting Bess’ off stump. Pakistan need 64 to go one-nil up. Early bath then, lads. 82nd over: England 242-9 (Bess 57, Anderson 0) Jimmy nearly goes first ball! Big inside edge, very lucky it didn’t bend back his leg stump. Oh, I better hit send on this because... (you can probably tell what has happened first delivery of the next over). A second ball blob for Broad, who bags himself a pair. Just a soft prod and Abbas finds the edge on the way through. Test wickets don’t come much easier than that. It came the ball after a lengthy delay when Imam was hit in the groin by a Broad drive that went to point, requiring the young man to leave the field in some distress. But given how small the fourth innings target is going to be, he can put his feet up. England lead by 63, adding only seven to their overnight score, losing three wickets along the way. Oh dear. It takes four deliveries with the second new ball for Amir to find Wood’s outside edge with a ball that nipped away beautifully. No footwork to speak of, but that’s excellent bowling to the tail. The left-armer warmed up rolling a couple down with the old ball, which enabled Bess to get off strike, but Wood didn’t have much of an idea there. Broad walks out on a pair. I did say this could happen quick. 81st over: England 241-8 (Bess 56) 80th over: England 240-7 (Bess 55, Wood 4) Shot. Wood off the mark with a lovely square drive to the rope. He’s happy to leave the rest alone. That’s the final over with the old ball and it is a successful one. It looks like they will take it straight away with Amir immediately on to replace Hasan. We’ll see. Here is the DRS map on the Buttler dismissal. Abbas has taken five LBWs in the match, Andrew Samson tells us on TMS. Nobody has taken six in a Test at Lord’s. He has a big chance to do so here with three England wickets on the shelf with the new nut. No issue with that decision from Paul Reiffel, technology confirming that the ball is hitting middle and leg. Buttler was beaten on the inside edge from a delivery that just hinted back at the right-hander off the seam. More superb bowling from Abbas who is having a mighty Test Match. He’s in the book for a third time with his second ball of the morning. The 126-run stand is broken with England’s lead 57. BUTTLER GIVEN LBW! He’s reviewed. He has to. But it looks pretty good on the first look. Stand by. 79th over: England 236-6 (Buttler 67, Bess 55) Cripes, the third ball of the day has just about run along the ground. Can England hang around long enough for it to matter? Buttler digs out a yorker to cover but can’t beat the man there, but does keep the strike with a single squeezed to third man. Azhar Mahmood ringing the bell. He scored a ton on debut at number eight in 1997, Dan Norcross advises on the wireless. That’s what Dom Bess is trying to do here. If you were wondering, the highest score for an England number eight on debut is Liam Dawson who made 66. He was the last man to debut in that position, as it happens. Bess resumes on 55. I made a mistake in the preamble earlier, by the way (which I’ll be editing in a tic). Keaton Jennings was, of course, the most recent hundred first up for England - not Trotty. Righto. Hasan Ali has the ball in his hand, Joss Buttler is on strike. PLAY! Jos Buttler having a chat on radio. “He (Dom Bess) is a confident boy and he knows his game really well. He’s got a lot of talent with the bat. I’m not sure how many people knew it before this Test, but they do now.” Said from a tricky situation, they showed some “skill and character” to dig in during the final session. “I had the same mentality really, I played the situaiton. I said before the game whether the ball is red, white or pink, I play with the same (approach).” The players are due out in about five minutes and the sun is still poking through the clouds. But the updated forecast isn’t great, heavy rain expected around lunchtime. Speaking of TMS. Getting in before I’m asked, this is the link to listen to their radio coverage via youtube if you are following from outside of the UK. A look at the track. Doesn’t seem the type to misbehave. “I think it has been a tremendous Test Match wicket,” says Michael Vaughan on TMS. Some more on The Hundred from Ali Martin the paper today. Looks like they are going to take it on the road (well, the UAE) to give it a spin later this year. Ultimately the plan is to have the scorecard showing the number of balls going down in each 100-ball innings – regardless of how that number is reached – as the score goes up. One senior ECB official told the Observer this is intended “to help answer the age-old question of ‘who is winning?’” and thus simplify cricket for the uninitiated. Groan. Andy Bull on Dom Bess. This line isn’t about the man on debut, but I’ll pull it out as it made me laugh: A lot of dubious thinking goes on at Lord’s on the Saturday of a Test match. Something about it seems to lead people to make the most bizarre decisions. How else does one explain all the preposterous clobber people wear? The blazers with candy-cane stripes, the schoolboy caps, the scarlet slacks, all those men ferreting around in their wardrobes asking: “Darling, have you seen my red trousers? I reckon it’s just the day for them.” Good start. I most certainly tagged my first post as “welcome to day three” rather than day four. You can get stuck into me about that on email the usual way (note the new address, my old account is no longer), or via twitter if you’d prefer. When turning in last night, I thought this was going to be an OBO of the wet weather. How about that storm? Lightning strikes every few seconds for what felt like hours. 50,000 of them, I’m told. Followed by chunks of hail that were more tropical Queensland than London. But fast forward to the morning, and it’s all good at Lord’s. That might not be what England fans necessarily want to hear with the home side still so far behind in this Test, but the forecast says the rain will come again later today. So that gives us is a chance to revel in the work of a couple of lads from the west country who batted beautifully on Saturday afternoon to keep the contest vaguely alive. Without getting too far ahead of myself, Dom Bess has the chance to double his half-century and become the first Englishman since Keaton Jennings to record a hundred on Test debut (and the first ever from number eight). You get chapters in books written about you for that kind of thing. Go on, you good thing. As for the more senior man, Jos Buttler, he said his recall to the XI was like being on debut again, and resuming on 66, can salute for three figures for the first time in the creams for England as well. So, despite how it looks when these two joined 125 runs ago and hopes of a fourth day were fading, there remains more than a bit of interest here. Pakistan have been joyous in their celebrations across three days of this match so far but will be mindful their job is not done. If this incumbent pair can stick around for the bulk of this session, the fourth innings chase will enter nasty territory, much as it was when they batted last in Ireland a couple of weeks ago. No major concerns, but work to do. On the other hand, if they can keep the old ball reversing (or get the second new one going in two overs time) this could be over in a hurry and the visitors will triumph in London again, as they did both 2016 Tests here and the 2017 Champions Trophy Final. They like the capital as much as the city enjoys being in the European Union. Yes, I’ve been working on that gag all week and it still doesn’t work. Adam will be here shortly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/26/gareth-bale-cristiano-ronaldo-doubts-real-madrid-futures","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T22:41:21Z","webTitle":"Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo cast doubt over their Real Madrid futures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/26/gareth-bale-cristiano-ronaldo-doubts-real-madrid-futures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/26/gareth-bale-cristiano-ronaldo-doubts-real-madrid-futures","fields":{"headline":"Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo cast doubt over their Real Madrid futures","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale cast significant doubt in their futures at Real Madrid in the midst of celebrations at the end of the Champions League final. Bale said he needed to be a regular starter and would talk to his agent about his options and Ronaldo referred to his time at the club in the past tense and said that he would make a statement in the coming days. The future of each may depend in part upon the other. Bale, who came on and scored twice to win the European Cup, said: “I need to be playing week in week out, and that’s not happened this season for one reason or another. I had a five- or six-week injury at the start of the season and I’ve been fit ever since so now I have to sit down in the summer and discuss it with my agent and take it from there.” Ronaldo too appeared to say that his future lies elsewhere. “It’s been very nice to be at Madrid,” he said. “In the coming days I will give a response to the fans because they actually have always been at my side.” Ronaldo’s mention of the fans was probably designed to highlight the difference between their support and what he perceives as a lack of support from the president, Florentino Pérez. This is not the first time he has expressed unhappiness and suggested that he wants to leave, only to stay rather than following through on his threats. Rarely though has he spoken as openly. Pérez responded by saying: “Now is not the time for individual issues. There’s always lots of noise and then nothing happens.” Ronaldo was outspoken too on the future of the European Cup: “The Champions League should change and be called the CR7 Champions League. I have won five and I am the [top] goalscorer again.” He later expressed regret at the timing of his comments regarding his future but said he had talked from the heart and that he would make the statement he promised. “I’ll speak,” he added. “I can’t hide that [I have something to say]. It wasn’t the right moment because of the history of the club.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/26/gareth-bale-real-madrid-could-be-glorious-farewell","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T21:59:11Z","webTitle":"Gareth Bale soars but hints he may be on his way out of Real Madrid | Sid Lowe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/26/gareth-bale-real-madrid-could-be-glorious-farewell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/26/gareth-bale-real-madrid-could-be-glorious-farewell","fields":{"headline":"Gareth Bale soars but hints he may be on his way out of Real Madrid","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"For a moment there was silence and then there was a small smattering of applause. At the Liverpool end, they were stunned, and they were not alone. The goal that won the European Cup had to be watched twice and they still couldn’t believe it; even the replay on the giant screen didn’t entirely shake them out of it. For the second time, the second Real Madrid goal, they were left wondering whether that had really happened. The first goal was surreal, perhaps the stupidest the European Cup final has seen; the second was sublime, perhaps even the most brilliant. Gareth Bale had been on the pitch for only two minutes when he took flight. High in the Kiev sky, he connected with a wonderful overhead kick. Bale ran to the corner and threw himself to the turf, sliding face down. Cristiano Ronaldo followed his team-mates over to the Welshman. On the far touchline Zinedine Zidane could barely believe it. He scored the winning goal in the European Cup final at Hampden Park 16 years ago, a volley that became emblematic. When Ronaldo scored an overhead kick in Turin in the quarter-final this year, Juventus’s fans had stood to applaud. Afterwards, Zidane had been asked about it. “Mine was nicer,” he smiled, a twinkle in his eye. Even he may admit that Bale’s was better, just as even Karim Benzema may admit that his goal was the worst he has scored in his career. Between them, Bale and Benzema, assisted by Sergio Ramos and Loris Karius, had taken Madrid to a third title in a row, history made. For Bale, it is his fourth title since moving to Spain. It may yet be his last. Asked afterwards about a move to the Premier League he said: “I need to be playing week-in, week-out and that hasn’t happened this season for one reason or another ... I have to sit down in the summer and discuss my future with my agent and take it from there.” If this was his final game for Madrid, it was some way to bid farewell. Or perhaps it can be a new beginning, a revival. It was, after all, a moment beyond the reach of the plausible, like something out of a comic. An astonishing goal to which he later added with a long shot that slipped through the hands of the Liverpool goalkeeper, who was inconsolable at the end. Karius curled himself into a ball, face hidden in his shirt; Bale stood, arms aloft. The European Cup final was won and by a moment worthy of any final. Madrid had not always impressed, but the goal certainly did. Until then, and speaking of comic, the final had been marked by two moments. Karius throwing the ball against Benzema’s boot and into the net and before that, Ramos dragging Mohamed Salah to the ground, forcing him out of this final, and seeming to change the game entirely – even if Liverpool did find an equaliser, thus requiring Zidane to call on Bale. So, on he came, to score the decisive second and a third that made it safe. Left out to start with, he was named man of the match. Scorer in Lisbon, successful in the shootout in Milan, he had done it again in the Ukraine. Twice. Bale’s absence from the starting XI was not out of keeping with his season: it had started on Valentine’s Day, when he was left out against Paris Saint-Germain, an unexpected decision which was soon revealed as no one-off, not least because of the sense that he did too little to rebel when he came on, accused of disengaging. In the second leg he was again left on the bench. In Turin it was the same and, although he started the second leg, he was withdrawn at half-time, with the team 2-0 down. He withdrew at full-time too, while his team-mates celebrated. “I had to do something,” Zidane said afterwards. But, Bale wondered, did it have to be that? There had been no explanation, no conversation; he and Zidane did not talk. Against Bayern Munich there was more of the same. Madrid had made it to the final but he had played only 99 of 540 minutes in the knockout phases. And yet, his performance in Villarreal last week, widely assumed to be a dress rehearsal, the gathering speed and the specifics of Liverpool, had brought him back into a focus, a candidate to be included from the start for the final. Instead, it was the same XI than began in Cardiff in last year’s final, Benzema beginning ahead of him; then, Bale was injured, here there was no excuse. No consolation, either – that would come later, and how. When Madrid’s subs came out to warm up, the Welshman did not join them. That is not so abnormal, but as a staging of his separateness it is still striking. He too had become resigned to the probability of a departure. Bale, though, knew that there might always be a chance, that at least he could go the right way. Liverpool knew that Madrid could change the game from the bench in a way that they could not. A couple of months ago it had been suggested to him that for all that he had not been playing, for all that he had thought his time at Madrid was ending, and that much as he probably would not start in Kiev, he would come on and win the final. And so it proved. Even if he had believed it, he would not have imagined it like this. An overhead kick, a long shot that Karius dropped into the net, and a fourth European Cup. No Briton has ever won more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/26/real-madrid-liverpool-champions-league-final-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T20:38:52Z","webTitle":"Real Madrid win Champions League as brilliant Bale sinks Liverpool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/26/real-madrid-liverpool-champions-league-final-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/26/real-madrid-liverpool-champions-league-final-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Real Madrid win Champions League as brilliant Bale sinks Liverpool","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It was an epic night, filled with so many different storylines, and unfortunately for Liverpool’s accident-prone goalkeeper, Loris Karius, he will have to live with the fact that his part will be remembered for just as long as, or possibly longer than, Gareth Bale’s spectacular bicycle kick or the tears from Mohamed Salah. For Bale it was a personal triumph with two of Real Madrid’s goals and a man-of-the-match award from a final he did not enter until the 61st minute. His flying, acrobatic volley, only two minutes after coming on, will go straight into the list of the greatest all-time goals in a Champions League final and put Madrid, with their 13th triumph, on their way to emulating the great Ajax and Bayern Munich teams of the 1970s with a third successive win. That, however, tells only part of the story from a night when Karius was a danger to his own team, responsible for Madrid’s two other goals and last seen wandering aimlessly around the pitch – alone, distraught and clearly traumatised – to ask forgiveness, hands clasped, from the thousands of Liverpool supporters. Karius looked broken. He chose a bad night to be so vulnerable and Liverpool will always wonder what might have happened if the German had not turned the night into his own personal ordeal. Or, indeed, if they had not lost Salah, half an hour in, with the shoulder injury that turned the match in Madrid’s favour. Salah looked inconsolable as he was led from the pitch and Sergio Ramos had some nerve offering a sympathetic hug on the way off. Ramos had locked Salah’s right arm and turned him, judo-style, as they lost balance going for the same ball. Television replays hardened the suspicion it was a calculated move on Ramos’s part and, when Salah landed with a hell of a thud, the damage was considerable. That blow could conceivably put the Egyptian out of the World Cup, too. His absence was a grievous setback for Liverpool, who had looked the more dangerous team until that point, and it would not be sour grapes for the losers to think that was the moment the game started to swing away from them. They had started so thrillingly but all their early momentum was lost once Salah went off. It never properly came back and the players in red took a long time – too long, probably – to adjust to being without the man who had scored 44 times over a record-breaking season. Without Salah, they never looked so threatening again. Ultimately, though, the difficult truth for Liverpool, and the tragic Karius, is that two of the goals they conceded were almost beyond comprehension, and how many times has Jürgen Klopp been warned this team risks being undermined by the lack of an elite goalkeeper? Karius has too much previous for this to be considered a one-off and, as goalkeeping mistakes go, his errors in the 51st and 83rd minutes were as bad as one another. In fact, they were not just bad. They were appalling, so wretched it was difficult to recall a worse goalkeeping performance in any major final through the years. His meltdown – for that is exactly what it was – started with the opening goal when he came to the edge of his penalty area to collect a ball that Toni Kroos, trying to set Karim Benzema free, had overhit. All Karius had to do was pick up the ball and roll it to Trent Alexander-Arnold on the right of defence. He got the second part horribly wrong, as if unaware that Benzema was still lurking, and the striker was able to flick out a boot to intercept the underarm throw. That was all it needed and, almost in slow motion, the ball trickled into an exposed goal. Liverpool’s equaliser came within four minutes. James Milner swung the ball over from a corner on the right and Sadio Mané, Liverpool’s most dangerous player, was alive in the six-yard area. Dejan Lovren won the header and, when Mané flashed his shot past Keylor Navas, it seemed as though Klopp’s team might have the momentum again. Instead Zinedine Zidane turned to Bale, playing possibly his final game for Madrid, and it was an incredible way in which the Welshman announced his presence – a twisting, mid-air bicycle kick to redirect Marcelo’s left-wing cross and flash the ball into Liverpool’s net. Zidane against Bayer Leverkusen in 2002? Mario Mandzukic for Juventus in 2017? Bale’s effort belongs in the same category. There was even applause from Liverpool’s fans when it was replayed on the giant screens. At 2-1 Liverpool came back again and Mané, in particular, kept threatening, fizzing a low shot against the post. Yet Bale was clearly emboldened by his first goal and, when he let fly again from 40 yards, the ball swerved in front of Karius and went through the goalkeeper’s hands. Perhaps Karius’s confidence had been damaged by the earlier mistake. Maybe the swerve was deceptive. At this level, however, there can be no excuses for such a mistake and, in that exact moment, everyone inside the Olimpiyskiy Stadium must have known there was no way back for Liverpool. If anything, they were fortunate not to suffer more damage in the second half. Madrid could also look back on Isco hitting the crossbar and there was an extraordinary moment when Cristiano Ronaldo was shaping to shoot only to be interrupted by a pitch invader from the end where the Madridistas were going through their victory songs. For the most part Liverpool had contained Ronaldo and Klopp’s team had often played well, particularly before Salah’s injury. The problem was that their goalkeeper had the worst night of his professional life. It was a sixth successive defeat for Klopp in a major final and at the final whistle, with Karius burying his face into the turf, there was not exactly a stampede of team-mates wanting to console him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/2018/may/26/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-to-face-new-trial-iran","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T17:33:52Z","webTitle":"Jailed Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe ‘to face new trial’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/26/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-to-face-new-trial-iran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/may/26/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-to-face-new-trial-iran","fields":{"headline":"Jailed Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe ‘to face new trial’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the detained British-Iranian aid worker sentenced to five years in jail in Iran, is reportedly to face a second trial on new security charges.

Ghazanfarabadi said the new charge against Zaghari-Ratcliffe was security related, but did not specify what it was, Tasnim reported. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested in 2016 as she was heading back to Britain with her daughter after a family visit. She was convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran’s clerical establishment, a charge denied by her family and the foundation. In a statement last week, the foundation said it totally rejected “the renewed accusations that Nazanin is guilty of spreading propaganda”. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, told the BBC that she had met a judge “who said there would be a charge of spreading propaganda against the regime.

Among the American’s many admirers and rivals in the game Johanna Konta is in awe of her, for returning to the court after being away for most of the past 18 months, and her decision to defy convention. She knows, too, how dangerous Williams can be when cornered: as when Heather Watson had her on the ropes at Wimbledon in 2015 but could not land the knockout blow; or at Roland Garros a month earlier when, so sick she could barely walk to the service line, she won the deciding set to love against Timea Bacsinszky to reach the final. Williams, Konta understands, is a born fighter. Konta, whose campaign begins on Sunday against the world No 93, Yulia Putintseva, is eloquent in her praise and analysis. “I don’t know [what it must feel like for Williams] because I haven’t given birth,” she says. “I’m not a mother and I haven’t been off Tour for that length of time. I wouldn’t want to have a child and come back. I’d like to have my tennis career and then have a family. That’s just a personal preference. That’s a choice every woman has the choice to make. “It’s a tough call. There’s a lot of women on Tour who are at the age where society thinks they should be thinking of motherhood or wanting to have children. There’s a lot of expectation on women in their 30s of: ‘Why haven’t you had a child yet? Can you have children?’ “It’s a woman’s prerogative of when and if they want to have children, and what profession they choose and how long they choose to do it. In sport it’s a little bit different because of the physical side. “But it’s a tremendous achievement to be able to bring your body back to being fighting fit in that way. Seeing women like Jessica Ennis-Hill and Paula Radcliffe and what they have achieved and the way they have been able to work their way back to the elite level of their sport after having children – I think it’s incredible. I want to see a man do it!” Konta does not think she will be playing tennis at Serena’s age, adding, “But again, who knows?” Williams, who celebrated the birth of her first child by lending her name to a series of insightful TV documentaries on her new life as a mid-30s mother and athlete, has accidentally inspired a debate that rumbled into Paris on the eve of her return to the big time: should her reputation entitle her to a seeding after she has been away from the game for so long (apart from four matches this year)? The tournament officials looked to their rules and history, said “No” and the furore intensified. Konta revealed the WTA players’ council, on which she sits, has discussed the issue. Unlike Maria Sharapova, no great friend of the American but who supports her on this one, Konta is undecided. She sees merit in respecting Williams’s stature and achievements, as well as the rights of others who have worked hard to be seeded. Yet, stripped back, the argument has flaws. If seedings are meant to reflect the likelihood of a player winning the tournament, only a fool would say Williams is not worth a place in the top 10, at least – despite her lack of activity. A more reliable guide follows the money – and the American betting expert, Sean Calvert, who correctly picked a 100-1 shot, John Isner, to win the Miami Open this year (where Williams lost in the first round to Naomi Osaka), has Williams at 10-1, which seems about right. In front of her, in his estimation, are the world No 1, Simona Halep, an 11-2 favourite, Elina Svitolina (8-1) and Garbiñe Muguruza (9-1). Yet, because of their adherence to custom, the official seedings do not rate Williams, arguably the greatest player of all time, among the best 32 players in the draw. First up she plays Kristyna Pliskova, the world No 70. Greater danger lurks in the second round, where the 17th seed, Ashleigh Barty, is a likely opponent. Beyond that lie either Sharapova or Pliskova’s sixth-seeded sister, Karolina. And that could be where the discussion is put to bed. For Konta there are a lot more positives than negatives in Williams returning. “It’s exciting. It shows incredible strength as a woman,” she says. “Also, breaking down boundaries, in a way it’s showing the world that there aren’t those self-imposed limitations that a lot of people see. And it’s important to give her the respect of finding the level that she wants to play at – however long and however many matches that takes. “I know that she feels she’s back, because she can perform at the level that she wants to play at and she’s prepared to be in those positions and playing the big matches. That’s the confidence that every player has on court, that everyone who plays on the Tour has. “Otherwise we wouldn’t be playing. I personally don’t expect anything of her. I expect her to enjoy what she is doing.” That alone would be a victory."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/27/shipping-routes-move-save-whales-greek-seas-dying-agony","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T06:05:17Z","webTitle":"How ships bring agonising death to last Greek whales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/27/shipping-routes-move-save-whales-greek-seas-dying-agony","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/27/shipping-routes-move-save-whales-greek-seas-dying-agony","fields":{"headline":"How ships bring agonising death to last Greek whales","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In an office up a steep hill in a seaside suburb of Athens, a tiny blue light flickers from a computer terminal. Dr Alexandros Frantzis, Greece’s foremost oceanographer, points it out. The light, he says, tracks marine traffic “in real time”. It is key to saving one of the world’s most endangered whale populations. “Every few seconds it logs the position, course and speed of a vessel entering Greek waters,” he says. “And that is vital to mapping shipping densities in areas populated by sperm whales.” Frantzis has spent nearly a quarter of a century studying marine mammals. His desk, like his small Pelagos Cetacean Research Institute, is testimony to a passion that has helped transform understanding of dolphins, porpoises and whales in a country where little was known about marine life barely two decades ago. Shelves are stacked high with the bones of sea mammals big and small. The remains of a sperm whale’s lower jaw are propped against a wall in his back office. And in a room beyond, the skeletons of two whales – gargantuan, crusty and yellow – lie neatly assembled across the floor. “Greece’s marine environment is very rich in species,” says Frantzis. “In antiquity cetaceans were taken very seriously. Aristotle wrote the first scientific study, his Historia Animalium, about them. You could say Greeks are the first and the last to come to the field, which is why urgent measures are being taken.” Sperm whales are the focus of Frantzis’s latest campaign. Although prevalent in other seas there are fewer than 300 in Greek waters, their largest habitat in the eastern Mediterranean. Like marine mammals in most places, the whales face a multitude of threats, from entanglement in fishing nets to ingestion of plastic waste. In Greece there is the added risk of noise pollution from Nato warships conducting underwater sonar drills – exercises blamed for disorienting whales reliant on their own form of sonar to navigate and hunt. Seismic surveys, following the discovery of underwater hydrocarbons, also pose a threat. But Frantzis says the biggest danger to local cetaceans is the chance of colliding with a ship. He singles out the waters off the western Peloponnese, an area where whales swarm but one of the busiest routes for tankers, cargo vessels and cruise liners. Last month a nine-metre whale washed up on a beach in Santorini, the latest in a series of strandings. Frantzis now has a large white bone – one of its teeth – on his desk. For sperm whales, death by collision is by far the most painful, he claims, with propellers often leaving the animals torn and gashed. “We don’t know how this latest incident occurred,” he sighs, dispelling reports that huge amounts of plastic had been found in the mammal’s digestive tract. “But what we do know is that at least one whale every year is killed as a result of a ship strike. It’s a death rate the species in these parts cannot survive.” Conservationists contend that if shipping lanes were routed farther offshore, the risk of ship strikes would drop dramatically. “Sperm whales like waters off steep underwater gradients but unfortunately the Hellenic trench off the Peloponnese is also the direct route for ships moving parallel to the coast,” the British marine mammal scientist Russell Leaper told the Observer. “The solution would be to move ships a little bit offshore into deeper waters less favoured by whales,” he said from the Scottish island of Coll, where he was observing minke whales and dolphins last week. A marine mammal expert with the International Fund for Animal Welfare, Leaper has spent more than 20 years studying ship strikes and says that in Greek seas they account for more than 60% of whale deaths although most, he adds, go unreported and unrecorded. Greece is not alone. The southern tip of Sri Lanka – one of the world’s busiest shipping routes – poses a similar danger for the blue whale population. Environmentalists have won unexpected support from the shipping industry. The International Maritime Organization, acknowledging the problem, has drawn up guidelines. Earlier this month, the International Whaling Commission urged the Greek government to take action, saying scientific evidence showed that ship strikes needed to be tackled. “There are times when whales have been caught in the bow of a ship with half a tail ripped off,” Leaper says. “Sometimes you get a body that shows no external wounds but the bones have been crushed. In all cases it is a very horrible way to die.” Prime minister Alexis Tsipras’s leftist-led coalition is expected to submit proposals to the IMO to reroute shipping lanes this summer. Frantzis and his team have helped identify waters that are prone to ship strikes because of the overlap of high densities of whales. Much of the research has been based on mathematical analysis conducted by Leaper, who believes shifting traffic five miles farther offshore would suffice. He also cites the example of approaches being altered to the Panama canal and off the coast of California. “For a cruise liner going at 20 knots, that [five miles] would add 15 minutes to the entire journey,” he says. “It’s a pressing conservation and welfare problem and very easy to solve. Greece has the opportunity to come forward with proposals that will help resolve this, and might also help other countries come forward as well.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/27/electronic-dance-music-edm-has-it-all-gone-pete-tong-sales-plateau","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T05:00:18Z","webTitle":"Has it all gone Pete Tong for electronic dance music?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/27/electronic-dance-music-edm-has-it-all-gone-pete-tong-sales-plateau","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/27/electronic-dance-music-edm-has-it-all-gone-pete-tong-sales-plateau","fields":{"headline":"Has it all gone Pete Tong for electronic dance music?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Well, the party had to end sometime. The phenomenal rise of electronic dance music (EDM) may have entered a new, more mature phase, according to DJs and industry experts. After almost a decade of growth, in which the subculture has entered the mainstream, the size of the global EDM market dropped 2% to £5.5bn last year – its first ever fall. An annual state-of-the industry report presented at the International Music Summit (IMS) in Ibiza last week, which examined everything from recorded music sales to DJ earnings, club and festival revenues and merchandising, suggests the industry is in rude health in Asia but is losing market share in the US and Europe. Kevin Watson, founder of Danceonomics, a knowledge hub for the electronic music industry, and the author of the report, said that, given such success, it was not surprising that appetite for the genre would eventually stall. “I think there’s still plenty of room for growth going forward. There’s been a slight dip but that’s to be expected, and the numbers still remain very positive on what the future looks like.” The rise of EDM has been powered by technology, with social media helping build the profiles of emerging artists such as the Belgian techno DJ Amelie Lens. It has also transformed the music distribution model. “Kids in their bedrooms can – pretty much for free – produce their own electronic music track and distribute it instantly,” Watson said. “And there’s lots of people out there that are now doing this and becoming very successful, because there are now almost zero investment costs.” Watson’s report will be seen in some quarters as confirmation that the long-predicted bursting of the EDM bubble has finally happened. But those within the industry suggest the picture is more nuanced. Pete Tong, the DJ and co-founder of the International Music Summit, told Music Week that the bubble had “punctured” rather than burst. “I guess another analogy would be: ‘The party’s over, it’s now time to really get your hands dirty, get back to work and look after this business you’ve built for this level and get it to the next phase’,” Tong said. Watson agreed, noting that as electronic music (he eschews the EDM label, arguing it has become synonymous with the commercial side of the genre) has teamed up with mainstream artists and festivals, its impact has become disguised. “You see a lot of tracks that are produced with DJs collaborating with other artists and a lot of those are being classified as pop or R&amp;B,” he said. “They’re not getting registered in electronic music’s share of sales. Another thing we’re seeing is a lot of mainstream festivals like Coachella, which we wouldn’t normally term electronic music festivals, are booking a lot of electronic music DJs and artists.” Recent examples of mainstream acts teaming up with EDM artists include Coldplay and the Chainsmokers, Justin Bieber’s work with Skrillex and Diplo and Ariana Grande’s collaboration with the DJ and producer Zedd. Conversely, as other music genres assimilate it, parts of the electronic music movement have gone more underground. “Quite often when things become much more populist and commercial, a lot of people become more focused on the underground, and that experiences a renaissance as well,” Watson said. “People might read about Coldplay and the Chainsmokers and the latest smash hit, but actually there’s a lot of stuff going on across the industry and there’s plenty of room for everyone to champion their particular sound.” Tom Faber, a DJ and music critic, predicts that the genre, whose roots lie in 1970s artists such as Kraftwerk and King Tubby, will continue to mutate. “Electronic music has been a thing over the last 40 years: it’s always going in and out of the mainstream. It’s one of the genres that’s always coming back. For me, electronic music is always looking forward, always doing something new.” For EDM’s superstar DJs, the industry continues to be a cash cow.

Yes. Yes. Women, lovely women, the women of Ireland, have defeated those who hate us, fear us and wanted to keep us down. Overwhelmingly defeated them. The nightmare is over. This campaign hasn’t been for three months. It has been for 35 years. The relief, the joy, is almost indescribable. So this is what liberation feels like. I am crying, I am laughing. I am so, so proud. I was 26 in 1983 when feminists tried to stop the government from outrageously diminishing the humanity of women with the so-called anti-abortion amendment. My granny paid for more than one trip to England in our family. On Friday night, as the magnificent news of the exit polls came through, my 24-year-old daughter, home to vote, hugged me. Nine out of ten of her generation voted Yes. One of them tweeted that millennials in Ireland might never own property “but we’re sure as hell going to own our own bodies”. We tweeted a photo of us going in to vote, and Grannies 4 Equality liked it. The Father Ted jokes are great. The sun is shining. Based on the exit polls, it looks like 72% of women and 66% of men voted Yes. People across all age groups, all classes. It has been a huge victory for humanity, for compassion, for empathy. We did not want any more children forced to bear children. Any more grieving couples having to smuggle the remains of their cremated baby back to Ireland. Any more women allowed to die because they were pregnant and doctors were too afraid to treat them. On a south Dublin wall, a mural of Savita Halappanavar’s beautiful lost face has candles around it now. The anti-repeal side made out that women were marauding murderers. They tried to appropriate Irishness – they had a poster with our 1916 proclamation of independence on it, claiming that its signatories would want us to vote No. It was incredibly moving to see all the people surging through Dublin airport, some of them having made huge, expensive journeys back from every part of the world because they knew how momentous it was to be Irish at this moment, and with the chance to shake off all that old nonsense. The suffering caused by this amendment cannot be undone. Nor can the cruel history that led to it, the Magdalene Laundries, the mother and baby homes which tortured women and sold their babies. But this is the Yes that will enable Irish women to say No. No to all the other indignities and inequalities we still have to endure – the patriarchy has no idea what lies ahead now that we are actually going to own our own bodies. The North still has to be liberated – it has neither same-sex marriage nor abortion yet. But for now we are reeling. Ireland has said Yes. Passionately, lovingly, Yes. ps.

Nearly two in three Irish voters opted to repeal the eighth amendment to the constitution, defying opinion polls that suggested the election could come down to the wire. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who had campaigned for a repeal, welcomed the result. “What we have seen today is the culmination of a quiet revolution [that has been taking place] for the past 10 or 20 years.” The referendum – in which 66.4% voted Yes, a majority of 706,349 – drew the highest turnout for a ballot on social issues, and the result shows a deep commitment to reform despite an often acrimonious campaign. “We are actually a nation that is united, and we want to make this change,” said Varadkar, who was mobbed by ecstatic Yes voters when he appeared at Dublin Castle to announce the final result. All but one of Ireland’s 40 constituencies voted Yes with Donegal voting 51.9% in favour of No. Support appeared to cross almost every divide – old and young, urban and rural, rich and poor – defying some predictions that the liberal capital might force change on conservative countryside areas. The turnout was 64.1%, the third highest for a referendum in Ireland since the adoption of the constitution in 1937. The highest was the 1972 question on joining the European Economic Community, at 70.88%. The scale of the victory makes it almost impossible for opponents to challenge the laws that the government must now pass, which are expected to allow abortion on request up to 12 weeks and under stricter conditions beyond that. Varadkar said he hoped legislation would be enacted by the end of the year. The groundswell of support for change also puts renewed pressure on Northern Ireland, now the only place in Britain and Ireland where women cannot access legal abortion on request. Sarah Wollaston, the Tory chair of the health select committee at Westminster, said: “This is a great result for women in the Republic of Ireland, and now it’s time for people in Northern Ireland to have their say in their own referendum.” The Labour MP Stella Creasy said she would be asking the Commons “to back legislation to bring the UK’s abortion laws into the 21st century”. Tears, joy and disbelief greeted the first exit polls late on Friday evening, and even when official counting began on Saturday morning, many supporters were still dazed by emotion. “I’m really overwhelmed and proud,” said Dominique McMullan, 31, wiping away tears. “With the marriage equality referendum and this, we are leading the way – we are a new country. The old Ireland is gone.” Forty years ago Irish women could not even buy a condom legally, divorce was banned and abortion almost unmentionable in public. So for many supporters, the wave of public support for repeal sealed a remarkable national transformation. Still it was a bittersweet victory. McMullan, like many other women and men, chose to start the day at a mural of Savita Halappanavar, a 31- year-old dentist who died after she was refused an abortion in 2012. Her death spurred the campaign for change. “I came down especially to pay tribute,” McMullan said. “It’s brilliant that this has happened, but we can’t forget the people who died because of our laws.” Halappanavar’s father told the Observer by phone from India that justice had been done for his daughter: “I have no words to express my gratitude to the people of Ireland.” There had been fears that, as with Brexit and Donald Trump’s election, the No campaign would muster a last-minute surge. In the end, though, the silent majority won through. The provision, enshrined in the constitution since 1983, gave “the unborn” equal rights to pregnant women, making abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest and severe danger to the mother. Irish law also bans ordering or taking abortion pills, under threat of up to 14 years in jail. “It’s a new dawn,” said Danielle Graham, “We didn’t expect it to be this big. We just wanted not to feel like criminals in our own country.” Many in the Yes camp attributed the victory to the many women who defied social taboos to speak out about their own abortions. “The spell of shame has been broken,” said Quentin Nea, a 61-year-old teacher from Dublin, old enough to have campaigned against the eighth amendment when it was introduced. Much of the repeal campaign focused on the high numbers of women ordering abortion pills online or forced to travel to Britain for a termination. “They showed that abortion was already here, we are just trying to make it safe and regulated,” said Denise Charlton, from the Together for Yes campaign. The result is also an overwhelming defeat for the Catholic church, three months before Pope Francis makes his first trip to Ireland. There was no comment from the Vatican or the Irish bishops. “It’s nice to see that we are finally throwing off the shackles of the Catholic church,” said Sarah McCormack, 25, as she left flowers at the Halappanavar mural. Anti-abortion campaigners have described the decision as a “tragedy of historic proportions”. The Save the 8th campaign communications director, John McGuirk, said the unborn child no longer had a right to life recognised by the Irish state. “Shortly, legislation will be introduced that will allow babies to be killed in our country, We will oppose that legislation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/27/british-arms-exports-israel-new-record","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T06:00:19Z","webTitle":"British arms exports to Israel reach record level","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/27/british-arms-exports-israel-new-record","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/27/british-arms-exports-israel-new-record","fields":{"headline":"British arms exports to Israel reach record level","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"British defence contractors are selling record amounts of arms to Israel, new figures reveal, just days after it was confirmed that Prince William will represent the UK government on a visit to the country next month. Figures from the Campaign Against Arms Trade reveal that last year the UK issued £221m worth of arms licences to defence companies exporting to Israel. This made Israel the UK’s eighth largest market for UK arms companies, a huge increase on the previous year’s figure of £86m, itself a substantial rise on the £20m worth of arms licensed in 2015. In total, over the past five years, Israel has bought more than £350m worth of UK military hardware. Licences issued to UK defence contractors exporting to Israel last year include those for targeting equipment, small arms ammunition, missiles, weapon sights and sniper rifles. In 2016 the UK issued licences for anti-armour ammunition, gun mountings, components for air-to-air missiles, targeting equipment, components for assault rifles, components for grenade-launchers and anti-riot shields. Human rights groups have questioned the wisdom of sending a senior royal to a country whose use of lethal force last month has been the subject of concern from the UK government. “After the appallingly excessive response of the Israeli security forces at the Gaza border, tensions in the occupied Palestinian territories are likely to be close to boiling point when Prince William makes this historic visit,” said Kerry Moscogiuri, Amnesty International UK’s campaigns director. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, defended Israel’s response, saying “every country has an obligation to defend its borders”. But Theresa May backed calls for an independent inquiry into the violence, which reportedly left 58 Palestinians dead. The British prime minister said the use of live rounds by Israeli forces was “deeply troubling” and called for greater restraint. Now the UK government faces questions as to whether UK-made weapons were used by the Israelis last month. A review by government found the UK had issued 12 licences for arms it believed were likely to have been used in the 2014 war. In 2010 the then foreign secretary, David Miliband, said Israeli equipment used in an attack on Gaza “almost certainly” contained British-supplied components. Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade said: “The shootings we have seen over recent weeks have been an awful reminder of the appalling collective punishment and oppression that has been inflicted on the people of Gaza. By the government’s own admission, UK arms have been used time and again against Palestinians. Yet the arms sales have continued unabated. There must be a full investigation into if any UK arms have been used in the atrocities we have seen over recent months.” The Duke of Cambridge’s five-day trip will begin in Amman, Jordan, on Sunday 24 June, take in Ramallah, the Palestinian Authority’s capital city, and end in Jerusalem. Netanyahu has said it will be “a historic visit, the first of its kind”. But Smith said it was taking place against the “backdrop of a massacre”. He added: “If the prince does not speak out against the violence that has been inflicted, then it will be regarded as a major political endorsement. He must not use his visit to whitewash or legitimise these terrible abuses.” Moscogiuri said: “When he’s in Ramallah, we’d like to see Prince William going beyond the usual royal meet-and-greet by spending time talking with some of the Palestinian communities who’ve been affected by Israel’s 51-year occupation. Like everyone in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, people in Ramallah have endured years of discriminatory restrictions on their movement, with roadblocks, militarised checkpoints and off-limits roads which are for the exclusive use of those in the illegal Israeli settlements.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/may/27/need-reform-nhs-avoid-decade-misery-sarah-wollaston-liz-kendall-norman-lamb","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T07:00:22Z","webTitle":"We need reform of the NHS to avoid a decade of misery |  Sarah Wollaston, Liz Kendall and Norman Lamb","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/27/need-reform-nhs-avoid-decade-misery-sarah-wollaston-liz-kendall-norman-lamb","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/27/need-reform-nhs-avoid-decade-misery-sarah-wollaston-liz-kendall-norman-lamb","fields":{"headline":"We need reform of the NHS to avoid a decade of misery","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"As a cross-party group of MPs who have come together to campaign for a new settlement for the NHS and social care, we welcomed last week’s report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) and the Health Foundation. The next 15 years will see an extra four million people over the age of 65 in the UK. We believe that the task of meeting the health and care needs of our growing and ageing population is the greatest domestic challenge facing policymakers over the coming decades. There has been a failure to grasp the true scale of this responsibility or to plan for the number of people living with multiple long-term conditions and the escalating costs of treatment. The IFS report, commissioned by the NHS Confederation, offers a robust and credible analysis of the pressure this will place on the NHS and care system, which is already stretched to the limit, and of the implications for public spending on these services. Its message is simple: if we want effective and safe services, we will have to find the resources to pay for them. The report found that “a modernised NHS could require funding increases of 4% a year over the next 15 years”. That would mean health spending rising from 7.3% of national income today to 9.9% in 2033-34. For adult social care, spending is likely to have to rise by 3.9% annually over the same period. It also offers another scenario, with modest increases in real-terms spending that will do little more than keep the show on the road – never mind deliver the higher standards of care we should expect from an institution that has long been the envy of the world. The report presents us with a stark choice as a nation. If we want to have the benefits of a modern, efficient and effective healthcare system, which treats mental and physical health equally, tackles health inequalities and prioritises prevention, we will have to spend significantly more. We are clear that the government should accept the case for meeting the ambitious scenario that would deliver a modernised NHS. The funding projections in the report set a benchmark against which we should judge any announcements from the government about extra funding for the NHS and social care, as we approach the 70th anniversary of the NHS. Across the political divide, there is almost universal agreement that current funding levels are not sustainable. Few people now deny the blunt reality that, without a fresh settlement, we will face a decade of misery in which the sick, elderly and vulnerable will be repeatedly let down. Whatever your politics, that is a shameful prospect for a country with one of the world’s largest economies. We can’t accept a second-rate healthcare service in which people with mental health problems continue to face delays and inequality, there is a postcode lottery for access to new treatments, and staff are pushed to the brink. We need honesty and a wider public debate about what sort of services we want, how much they will cost, and how we should pay for them. For the last two years, we have been arguing for political parties to put aside their differences and work together to answer these questions, and put our treasured NHS and social care services on a sustainable long-term footing. This may seem like blue-sky thinking given the NHS’s status as the nation’s favourite political football. But politicians, health professionals and the public are waking up to the fact that a cross-party approach is the only way we can have the mature, rational debate needed to come up with a lasting solution to this crisis. The tide is turning. In March, more than 100 MPs from Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats urged the prime minister to establish a cross-party commission to confront these challenges in a spirit of collaboration. If we reject a cross-party approach and carry on as normal, political parties will continue to duck the challenges, shying away from bold solutions in favour of short-term political advantage. Abuse will continue to echo around the House of Commons. Meanwhile, adults and children across the country will continue to suffer from ever-longer waiting times, the rationing of treatment, and a growing catalogue of failures of care. We believe in the founding principles of the NHS: a universal tax-funded service, free at the point of need, based on need, not ability to pay. We believe additional funding must be progressive and fair across the generations. People are likely to be willing to pay more if they know that these resources will be dedicated to the NHS and social care. Last week’s report must act as a wake-up call to the Treasury and No 10. We urge the government to act now in the interests of the country – to grasp this unique opportunity to work with others and set the NHS and care system on a new trajectory for the next 70 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/26/mika-hakkinen-monaco-demanding-formula-one","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T13:47:20Z","webTitle":"Mika Häkkinen: ‘Monaco is very demanding.

If you panic, you are in the wall’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"“I have never forgotten what James Hunt said to me: ‘Remember, Mika, remember to have fun,’” recalls the double world champion Mika Häkkinen, relaxing on a yacht in Monaco beside the very car that enabled him to fulfil Hunt’s bidding. Häkkinen believes his win here 20 years ago, on the way to his first Formula One title, was the stand‑out performance of his career and that the drivers who take to the streets on Sunday still face the ultimate test in Monte Carlo. Hunt’s words had been delivered to an intense young Finn in 1991. By 1998, after a life-changing accident and some tough years in F1, he was finally able to do as the British champion advised and revel in his endeavour. “When I did the first test in ’98 I felt the car was fast whatever I did, turn or break, it did exactly what I wanted,” he says. “I told myself: ‘Now is the time. You can win the world championship’.” The car was the McLaren MP4/13, the first Adrian Newey had wholly designed for the team and it was a remarkable piece of machinery. At the first round in Australia Häkkinen and his team-mate, David Coulthard, completed their one-two finish by lapping every other competitor. By the time they arrived in Monaco, Häkkinen had won three of the opening five races. Now 49 years old, having retired from F1 in 2002, he has lived in the principality for 25 years but back then he feared he was jinxed never to win the grand prix here, having suffered a series of retirements and accidents at previous races. However, with Newey’s world beater beneath him, he believed his time had come. Häkkinen began the serious business of the weekend with an exceptional qualifying lap to take pole. He always disliked understeer, preferring the car to have front-end bite he could throw at an apex, while catching and recatching the rear. On his final run in Monaco he deliberately braked early on a short, downhill section of track into the first corner, Sainte Dévote. This pitched the car’s weight forward and brought his tyres to their operational temperature immediately. It worked brilliantly, he had the front-end grip he wanted and he exploited it with “maximum attack”. In the race that followed Häkkinen was hounded by Coulthard until the Scottish driver’s engine gave out and, after putting in a series of perfectly executed laps, he left the Benetton of Giancarlo Fisichella and Michael Schumacher’s Ferrari squabbling for second in his wake. It had not been easy. “The track is very demanding physically and psychologically,” he says. “It takes a lot of energy to stay calm, if you are panicking, you are in the wall. That’s why preparation is harder than anywhere else.” Nor can it be taken for granted, even for a moment. Easing up with five laps to go he lost temperature in the tyres and brakes and a rear tyre clipped the barrier at Rascasse. He feared the jinx had struck again. “I will never forget it,” he says. “I was 100% sure that was it, the race was over, but it didn’t break.” Now a brand ambassador for McLaren, he cites the team’s diligence and forward thinking as having saved the day. They had brought in new, stronger wishbones after qualifying – enough to withstand the blow. Four victories followed, the last in the season finale, at Suzuka, where he sealed the title. His second followed the next year yet, now at the top, he viewed his future with the perspective of a man who had already almost lost his life. In 1995, during first qualifying for the Australian Grand Prix, Häkkinen suffered a tyre failure that caused him to crash violently. He was severely injured and saved by an emergency tracheotomy at the side of the track. He remained in critical condition and was in hospital for two months. That he recovered to drive again the following year was remarkable but the incident had left its mark. “When I won the world championship I thought: ‘Don’t push your luck any further, this is good, now do something else,’” he says. He has since pursued a variety of business interests including a newly launched social media app. In Monaco this weekend, standing beside the car that was instrumental to his first title, Häkkinen describes Newey as a genius and believes his car – the Red Bull – will be the class of the field again. “He has always been a great designer of downforce cars and Red Bull have a good chance to get the victory here,” he says. But he knows how hard that will be in a race that requires an “incredible level of concentration”. A tough task then but one the flying Finn has only reason to remember affectionately. “Monaco is the best grand prix on the calendar,” he says, smiling. “When I take my children to school and we are exiting the tunnel I say: ‘Ah, sometimes I used to be coming out of here at 300kmh ...’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/31/juan-mata-is-a-manc-nigerian-greats-and-wales-versus-the-springboks","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T09:30:51Z","webTitle":"Juan Mata is a Manc, Nigerian greats and Wales v the Springboks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/31/juan-mata-is-a-manc-nigerian-greats-and-wales-versus-the-springboks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/31/juan-mata-is-a-manc-nigerian-greats-and-wales-versus-the-springboks","fields":{"headline":"Juan Mata is a Manc, Nigerian greats and Wales v the Springboks","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1) Juan Mata, The Nicest Man In Football™, loves a corporate video.

Speaking to the Guardian by phone from his home in Karnataka, south-west India, Andanappa Yalagi said: “We’ve got justice for Savita, and what happened to her will not happen to any other family now. “I have no words to express my gratitude to the people of Ireland at this historic moment.” Last week he told the Guardian that his daughter’s death had devastated the family. “It’s still very emotional after five years. I think about her every day,” he said. As it became clear on Saturday that Ireland had voted overwhelmingly to reform its restrictive abortion regime, flowers and messages were left at a mural created by street artist Aches in Dublin last week to commemorate Halappanavar. Ian Jennings, 24, said: “I’ve come down here specifically to say sorry to the women of Ireland and women like Savita that we let down. “For decades in this country we turned women away, hid them and we shamed them and our generation has decided that we are never going to do that again.” One message taped to the wall read: “I’m sorry. I hope this absolves our country’s guilt.” Another note said: “Your death started me on this journey to repeal the eighth. Today I stand proud of our country as we managed to do that. You will never be forgotten and I’m so sorry we couldn’t help you. My yes was for you.” Rosita Sweetman, 70, a founder member of the women’s movement in Ireland, said: “It feels like the end of hundreds of years of repression by the Catholic church. It’s such a huge change.” Linda Cummins, 60, said: “I’m feeling a bit emotional and happy and relieved that this has been taken out of the constitution. “I think Savita was kind of iconic, she focused us on what this actually meant for women and what was really happening and it was just such a terrible, avoidable tragedy.” Halappanavar’s death was a catalyst for the movement to repeal the eighth amendment. An independent inquiry into her treatment found there had been an “over-emphasis on the need not to intervene until the foetal heart had stopped”, as well as poor patient monitoring and risk assessment. It strongly recommended that the Irish parliament consider changing the law, and “any necessary constitutional change”. Prof Sir Sabaratnam Arulkumaran, who chaired the investigation, last week called on voters to back the repeal of the clause, saying it tied doctors’ hands. Halappanavar was admitted to University hospital in Galway on 21 October 2012, when she was 17 weeks pregnant with her first child. Medical staff concluded that a miscarriage was inevitable but did not intervene – despite requests from Halappanavar and her husband for an abortion – as a foetal heartbeat could be detected. A few days later, medics diagnosed infection as a result of ruptured membranes and, later septic shock. Halappanavar died on 28 October. In media interviews in the following weeks, Praveen Halappanavar said he and his wife had repeatedly asked for the pregnancy to be terminated after her admission to hospital, but they had been told: “This is a Catholic country”. Thousands of people took part in candlelit vigils and protests across Ireland, calling for changes to allow women to have access to legal abortions. An inquest jury returned a unanimous verdict of medical misadventure. Praveen Halappanavar, who has left Ireland, has not spoken publicly about his wife’s death since an out-of-court settlement was agreed shortly before a medical negligence case was due to open at Ireland’s high court in 2016."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/27/north-korea-us-summit-on-track-says-moon-candid-talks-friend-kim-jong-un","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T21:41:30Z","webTitle":"Trump confirms US negotiators in North Korea for summit talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/27/north-korea-us-summit-on-track-says-moon-candid-talks-friend-kim-jong-un","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/27/north-korea-us-summit-on-track-says-moon-candid-talks-friend-kim-jong-un","fields":{"headline":"Trump confirms US negotiators in North Korea for summit talks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Donald Trump confirmed on Sunday that US negotiators were in North Korea for talks ahead of his planned summit with Kim Jong-un – a meeting the US president said was cancelled only three days before. “Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself,” the US president tweeted. “I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day. Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this. It will happen!” The Washington Post first reported that the US officials had crossed into North Korea. The Post said Sung Kim, US ambassador to the Philippines, was with Allison Hooker, Korea expert on the White House National Security Council, and a Pentagon official and had met Choe Son Hui, the North Korean vice-foreign minister. Later, a state department spokeswoman said the US delegation was in “ongoing talks with North Korean officials at Panmunjom”, a village on the border between North and South Korea. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said a “pre-advance team” had left for Singapore to work on logistics. Before Trump’s supposed cancellation of the meeting on Thursday, the summit had been set for 12 June. On Saturday, South Korean president Moon Jae-in met Kim Jong-un in a surprise move. On Sunday Moon said Kim was committed to meeting Trump and achieving complete denuclearisation. Amid hugs and smiles, Moon met Kim on the North Korean side of Panmunjom, the site of their first meeting a month earlier. The atmosphere was “just like an ordinary meeting between friends” and the two held “candid talks”, Moon said. A video released by the South Korean presidential office had the audio replaced with dramatic music, showing the two men embracing, both with wide smiles. The spontaneous offer by Kim to meet, and Moon’s quick acceptance, showed how close the two leaders have become. It capped a whirlwind 24 hours of diplomacy as Moon scrambled to salvage the summit between Trump and Kim. On Saturday evening at the White House, as Moon was briefing reporters on his meeting with Kim, Trump suggested a climbdown was possible. “We’re doing very well in terms of the summit with North Korea,” Trump said. “It’s moving along very nicely. So we’re looking at 12 June in Singapore. That hasn’t changed. So, we’ll see what happens.” In the US on Sunday, James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, told CNN’s State of the Union he wanted the summit to go ahead, saying: “There’s value [in] having gone this far, there’s value in meeting and greeting, gripping and grinning, and having the summit.” Clapper also said he thought “Kim Jong-un may have met his match here with a very hard, very unconventional president”. Michael Hayden, a former director of the CIA, was less sure Trump would have an advantage. He told ABC’s This Week: “Kim Jong-un knows his programme inside and out. I think he knows what he can concede. I don’t know that the president has done the kind of homework that would allow him to do this.” Discussing the Saturday talks, Moon said Kim “once again committed to complete denuclearisation”. But he repeatedly refused to answer questions on how North Korea would relinquish its nuclear weapons or if it would allow international experts to inspect nuclear facilities, issues which have hung over discussions between Washington and Pyongyang. US officials have demanded North Korea unilaterally disarm before earning concessions on sanctions or a pledge of non-aggression. Pyongyang prefers phased negotiations and concessions. Kim expressed “his fixed will on the historic” meeting with Trump, according to the North’s state-run Korean Central News Agency. Photos of the Moon-Kim meeting were printed on the front of the Rodong Sinmun, the Workers’ party newspaper. “It’s strategically smart for Kim to invite Moon for a face to face meeting, it helps portray him in the public eye as a very friendly, diplomacy-oriented statesman,” said Jenny Town, managing editor of monitoring group 38 North. “It really offsets the tone Kim’s regime has put forward with statements threatening nuclear war.” But Town warned there was still a chasm between Washington and Pyongyang on core issues, saying there was little point in holding a summit that lacked substance. “This is not diplomacy, it’s political theatre,” she said. “There is no trust between the two right now, so why would Kim trust any US security guarantee on paper? Trust on both sides need to be built over time and no one should expect Trump to fly to Singapore and leave with all of North Korea’s nukes.” Moon said: “The path to complete denuclearisation and full peace was never going to be an easy one.” He added: “I’m sure we will succeed.” Moon also said he hoped there could be a meeting between North Korea, South Korea and the US to formally end the Korean war, which ceased with an armistice in 1953. He praised Kim for announcing a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests, as well as the closing of a nuclear test site this week. The two sides are set to hold “high-level talks” on 1 June as well as military discussions and efforts to set up reunions between divided families."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/26/liverpool-mohamed-salah-cruel-end-real-madrid-sergio-ramos-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T22:50:36Z","webTitle":"Mo Salah’s tears and agony a cruel end to his season of joy with Liverpool | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/26/liverpool-mohamed-salah-cruel-end-real-madrid-sergio-ramos-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/26/liverpool-mohamed-salah-cruel-end-real-madrid-sergio-ramos-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Mo Salah’s tears and agony a cruel end to his season of joy with Liverpool","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"And fade to white. By the end of a messy, thrilling, occasionally grisly Champions League final in Kiev the most unexpected note was that Liverpool’s fearless run to this stage should end with regrets and a quiver of what might have been. It seemed even crueller still that the final image of Mo Salah’s joyful season should be the sight of the Premier League player of the year leaving the pitch in tears with half an hour gone. But then there are reasons why Real Madrid win these games, why the same faces keep on being framed by the cameras year after year lifting that intoxicatingly shiny trophy. Or in other words: Mo, meet Sergio. Madrid were the story here: three-times champions, with victory capped by an overhead kick from Gareth Bale of such devastating grace that even the Liverpool end offered him a ripple of bruised applause as Madrid lined up for the restart. Yet there will be a sense through red-tinted spectacles of having been cheated by fate, by misfortune and by Sergio Ramos. Make no mistake Liverpool had their moments to take this game by the scruff, most obviously in the opening quarter when they went for the full, blitz attack, drawing stumbles and stutters and hoofed clearances as those princely white shirts looked a little giddy. Liverpool can do this to you, swarming in with the body shots, taking your breath, making the pitch spin. Something had to give. It did. The wrong thing. Nobody will ever really know what Ramos intended as he grabbed Mo Salah’s arm and tumbled to the ground. No foul was awarded, even with Salah lying in agony holding his shoulder. Probably this was simply an innocent coming-together. In slow motion it looked like an expert secret service judo move, the kind of thing you spend three years learning to pull off in a camp in the Swiss Alps, along with the blow dart to the neck and the sword-stick umbrella jab. Ramos might say he was giving some back in kind, reacting to Liverpool’s own concussive style. Either way Salah was done, soldiering on for a few moments before going down in distress clutching a dislocated shoulder. Ramos, svengali of white-shirted bastardism, loves these games. Here he seized another by the throat and squeezed at the vital moment. Instantly the weather inside the stadium changed. The excellent Sadio Mané was switched from the left where he had been traumatising Dani Carvajal. The red shirts seemed winded – and within six minutes of half-time Madrid were in front, Loris Karius producing a gut-wrenching error, placing the ball on the end of Karim Benzema’s foot in front of an open goal from a simple throw-out. Liverpool did not let it drop. Four minutes later they were level, Mané nipping in at a corner to poke the ball past Keylor Navas, drawing a vast cheer at that end and another note in the pure pleasure that has soundtracked this run to Kiev and which will remain even now the dominant note of a lost May weekend in Ukraine. What is black and white and red all over? Kiev of course. Or at least it was for one sun-drenched afternoon as Liverpool’s travelling support added a great sweaty replica-shirted smear of red to the washed out greens and blues and greys. They came in vans and coaches and cars. They came via Frankfurt and Amsterdam. Throughout the day they packed Shevchenko park with a bobbing, burping, chanting mass of sun-flushed flesh and filled the side-street bars with a travel-frazzled sense of Soviet-tinged dolce vita. As the minutes ticked down to kick-off there was a familiar feeling of ravenousness and an impatience around the pre-match hoopla, capped by the massed kitchen foil-clad dancers of the great Dua Lipa, who eventually appeared bouncing gamely on top of a blue and yellow birthday cake stage. Even with Salah off, this game was still there. Mané hit the post. Trent Alexander-Arnold struggled manfully with Marcelo, sniping inside like a horribly malevolent giant tarantula. But without that glaze of genius, the switch of gear that Salah brings, Madrid were able to purr forward. Still it took another painful howler from Karius to kill the game as he let a Bale shot spill through the most brittle of pasta-wristed punches. This was a professional tragedy for a footballer in the biggest match of his life, on a stage to which he will surely never return. But it was also not entirely surprising. Jürgen Klopp persuaded Karius to sign for Liverpool in the first place, then made him his number one. At the end of which, and when it really matters, Karius has made a pair of match-killing howlers. Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Kiev and beyond, the sun continues to rise, dogs still bite postmen, brown bears still seek out the treeline when nature calls. A new goalkeeper looked like an essential summer signing even before tonight. The intersection of luck and design is always a difficult area in sport. Here Liverpool could only bring on a half-fit Adam Lallana for Salah. Madrid could call on Bale, Salah’s equivalent as a player but able to lurk potently on the bench. Liverpool will leave Kiev a little bruised but also with a sense that their one real shot at this game, that full-throttle Plan A, was derailed in the coldest fashion by a more seasoned, powerfully stocked team of champions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/26/real-madrid-liverpool-champions-league-final-player-ratings","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T21:44:08Z","webTitle":"Real Madrid 3-1 Liverpool: Champions League final player ratings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/26/real-madrid-liverpool-champions-league-final-player-ratings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/26/real-madrid-liverpool-champions-league-final-player-ratings","fields":{"headline":"Real Madrid 3-1 Liverpool: Champions League final player ratings","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Real Madrid Keylor Navas 7/10 Lucky not to be punished by Van Dijk when he missed a corner but one his safer goalkeeping displays.

Had only just returned from a hamstring problem and made a careless start. Raphaël Varane 7/10 Vulnerable to Liverpool’s press when in possession, and not the most physical, although made several well-timed interventions inside his penalty area to thwart Klopp’s side’s attacks. Sergio Ramos 8/10 The villain as far as Liverpool are concerned. Knew what he was doing when he dragged down Mohamed Salah but, as a defender, the captain was completely dominant. Marcelo 8/10 Made a convincing start to his duel with Salah before that headache departed. Was given more licence to attack and prospered but slow to react for Mané’s equaliser. Luka Modric 7/10 Given little time and space to dictate play due to the industry of Milner and Henderson. Tidy as always but only got into harmful areas when the game opened up. Casemiro 7/10 The unheralded but key part of this Real Madrid team performed effectively and diligently as usual, helping to curb Firmino’s influence on the Liverpool display. Toni Kroos 6/10 Operated too deep throughout the final and that left Ronaldo and Benzema isolated too often as a consequence. His passing was below its usual standard, too. Isco 6/10 Always searched for openings but could not get involved enough. Wasted a great chance to put that right when he hit the bar with only Karius to beat. Karim Benzema 8/10 May have been fortunate for the opener but, like any good striker, was alert to the possibility when Karius erred. Fared well in his physical battle with Van Dijk. Cristiano Ronaldo 7/10 A rarity in that this was a major final that the world player of the year did not bend to his will. May have done better with one header that Karius saved well. Substitutes: Nacho 7/10 (for Carvajal 37): A strong and positive replacement for the injured Carvajal Gareth Bale 9/10 (for Isco 61): What an impact. Off the bench to win the final with a world-class goal Marco Asensio 5/10 (for Benzema 89): Brought on in the dying seconds as Zidane sought fresh legs Liverpool Loris Karius 3/10 Two absolute howlers on the biggest stage of all. An appalling performance from which it will be difficult to resurrect a Liverpool career. Trent Alexander-Arnold 7/10 Again seen as a potential weak link and again responded manfully to keep Ronaldo relatively quiet. More of a problem when Marcelo advanced, though. Dejan Lovren 7/10 Set the tone for another impressive European display when he snapped into Ronaldo at the first opportunity. Won the header for Mané’s goal. Virgil van Dijk 7/10 May feel he should have done better with the header from Milner’s corner that Navas missed but fought well against Benzema and made timely interceptions. Andy Robertson 8/10 Good in the air and, as usual, his positive runs down the left posed a frequent problem to the Real defence. Superb tackle on Ronaldo stopped a certain goal. Georginio Wijnaldum 6/10 The most inventive of Liverpool’s midfield trio but could not get on the ball often enough truly to hurt his opponents. Drove the team forward to the end. Jordan Henderson 6/10 Neat and careful on the ball and worked hard defensively to prevent Isco having an influence on the final but unable to stamp his authority on the game. James Milner 7/10 His set-piece deliveries were Liverpool’s most potent weapon once Salah had gone. Also pressed ferociously from the start to help swarm the Real midfield. Mohamed Salah 5/10 Not how his phenomenal season was supposed to end. Left the pitch in tears and in agony after Sergio Ramos caused a shoulder injury that damaged Liverpool. Cruel. Roberto Firmino 6/10 So close to connecting with one header, threaded a brilliant ball into Mané and worked tirelessly but could not influence this European game as he has so many others. Sadio Mané 8/10 Stepped up after Salah’s injury and was Liverpool’s liveliest forward. Showed quick reactions to draw Klopp’s team level and unlucky to strike a post, too. Substitutes: Adam Lallana 5/10 (for Salah 30): Plunged into the game early due to Salah’s injury and not at his sharpest after injury Emre Can 6/10 (for Milner 83): Brought on for a late rescue mission but to no avail in the end"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/26/fulhams-scintillating-football-set-to-invigorate-tired-premier-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T21:39:34Z","webTitle":"Fulham’s scintillating football set to invigorate tired Premier League | Ben Fisher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/26/fulhams-scintillating-football-set-to-invigorate-tired-premier-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/26/fulhams-scintillating-football-set-to-invigorate-tired-premier-league","fields":{"headline":"Fulham’s scintillating football set to invigorate tired Premier League","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The deafening sound as Fulham celebrated promotion under the Wembley arch gave a whole new meaning to white noise, for Slavisa Jokanovic’s slow-burning, swaggering side had finally got over the line. A couple of months ago, Jokanovic had insisted that dreams were to be had in the bedroom but he woke with his team triumphant and many topless at the end of Fulham’s first game at the national stadium since 1975. His players, showered in gold confetti, guzzled champagne as they bounced on a hastily erected stage still feeling the effects of the mass pile-on at full-time. The often ice-cool Jokanovic erupted with joy, thumped the air with both fists, later hoisting the trophy airborne while Shahid Khan, the Fulham owner intent on buying Wembley for £900m, puffed his cheeks. Victory was theirs, Wembley possibly his. Khan, who is worth around £7bn, moved from Pakistan to the United States with $500 in his pocket and here Fulham exited with a jackpot that could be worth £280m if they stay up next season. For now, as Jokanovic said when asked about the future of Ryan Sessegnon and retaining on-loan striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, it is all about enjoying what his attacking team have achieved. This fearless, rip-roaring Fulham team, along with the champions Wolverhampton Wanderers, will reinvigorate a Premier League that has grown a little tired and musty. Promotion is vindication for the glorious front-foot manner in which Fulham have flummoxed countless teams this season. They will do the same next season but they are not naive. “We must try to dominate against teams we think we can but we must be realistic in the future,” Jokanovic said. The risk, as typified by Denis Odoi’s wild kick on Jack Grealish to pick up his second yellow card, is that they can sometimes overindulge but they are mightily good fun. Tom Cairney, the twinkling Fulham captain, just about held back the tears in interviews pitch-side. “After we missed out on promotion last season, a lot of people wrote us off,” he said. “We got a lot of stick. But football won today. Football won.” Cairney harnessed his role not only as the team’s protagonist but its artist too – probing, prowling, twirling away from challenges, stroking passes across the canvas and, ultimately, adding that all-important finishing touch. Before Cairney slotted home, time appeared to stand still as he readied himself to meet Sessegnon’s cute, weighted ball. For a team that froze on the final day of the regular Championship season, in turn forcing them into the play-offs, they displayed enormous steel, fight, and plenty of personality here. Much of the talk in the buildup to this match had revolved around Villa’s big-game experience yet Fulham showed they have anything but a soft underbelly. They were perfectly capable of time-wasting and utilising other dark arts, just like the rest of them. Mitrovic, one of three key January signings, put in another classy performance too, summed up by a sublime touch to control Tim Ream’s pass. How other clubs must wish they had pushed the boat out as Fulham, then languishing in mid-table, did to land Mitrovic from Newcastle United, as well as Matt Targett from Southampton. Any worry that Fulham would buckle at the thought of the occasion or wilt under pressure evaporated. “We must adapt ourselves and know what is ahead; we must know it is the Premier League, the best and most competitive league,” Jokanovic said. “We must adapt and be clever, we must not make one step back. To show ambition we are going to need to show the money too.” Sessegnon, who turned 18 this month, has been rightly lavished with praise all season. Yet on the opposite flank, Ryan Fredericks was again mightily impressive, with both occasionally helping out the other to double up on Albert Adomah and Robert Snodgrass. Between them, they gladly hoovered up danger and it was only Grealish, the dancing Villa playmaker who Fulham failed to mute. His bewitching second-half surge upfield did deserve to finish with the ball rippling the net. Other than that, Villa asked few questions, by which point Fulham had answered all those thrown at them. The exciting thing is the project Jokanovic referenced in his post-match comments is just beginning for this Fulham side."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/26/labour-live-festival-corbyn-unite","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T23:04:08Z","webTitle":"Unite steps in to save Labour’s struggling ‘Glastonbury’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/26/labour-live-festival-corbyn-unite","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/26/labour-live-festival-corbyn-unite","fields":{"headline":"Unite steps in to save Labour’s struggling ‘Glastonbury’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Labour’s biggest union backer is giving away a thousand tickets to an event billed as Jeremy Corbyn’s very own Glastonbury, amid serious fears that it will lead to major losses for the party. Unite announced to members that it was giving away the tickets and even offered free travel to the event in London for those who need it. It follows recent reports that ticket sales for the Labour Live Festival have been sluggish, with only 2,500 of the 15,000 seats sold for the event at White Hart Lane in north London on Saturday 16 June. Full-priced tickets cost £35. Some insiders are worried that the party could be in for a seven-figure loss unless action is taken, though Labour officially denies such a loss is on the cards. Unite, whose general secretary Len McCluskey has been one of Corbyn’s most powerful allies, has now stepped in to help boost the numbers. “If you are quick you have the chance to book a free ticket for the event,” the union said in a message to members. “Unite have 1,000 tickets to give away on a first-come first-served basis … Contact your local Labour party regional office to find out about the free travel services we’re providing.” The Labour Live event has struggled to attract big-name acts, but it will feature Hookworms, the Magic Numbers, Rae Morris and Jermain Jackman. The event was designed to benefit from the adulation Corbyn received when he appeared at other live events, including Glastonbury last year. A Labour spokeswoman said: “Labour Live is one of the ways we’re continuing to open up politics to a wider audience and spread Labour’s message about how we can build a society that works for the many, not the few. We welcome the support of the wider labour movement.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/27/novichok-salisbury-shopping-centre-back-to-normal-after-skripal-poisoning","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T06:00:18Z","webTitle":"Skripal case: Salisbury tries to return to business as usual","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/27/novichok-salisbury-shopping-centre-back-to-normal-after-skripal-poisoning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/27/novichok-salisbury-shopping-centre-back-to-normal-after-skripal-poisoning","fields":{"headline":"Skripal case: Salisbury tries to return to business as usual","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Without much fuss or fanfare, but, happily, with plenty of shoppers, Salisbury quietly reopened its central shopping centre on Saturday, almost three months after it became the site of an international incident. The Maltings, which connects the coach park to the city centre, has been off-limits to the public and shielded by safety cordons and tents since the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped on one of its park benches after being poisoned. Market traders were moved behind the shopping precinct by Wiltshire county council while the decontamination operation was under way. High street staples including Superdrug, Greggs and Robert Dyas were simply forced to close until further notice. “Another week and I don’t know what we would have done,” said Henry, – “Call me the Cockle Man” – who runs a seafood stall from the Maltings three days a week. “It was so quiet where we were moved to, there was no footfall – we had to cut down to just doing Saturdays.” Relief for businesses in the area, which have suffered an estimated 80% drop in takings, has come from the council’s recovery programme and Salisbury’s Business Improvement District association. “It’s good to be back,” said Henry. “We weren’t sure what today would be like – whether it would be a mad day like it is, or absolutely dead because people were still wary of coming through.” For Sandra, a childcare worker who has lived and worked in Salisbury for five years, “it has been very difficult”. She motioned towards the Zizzi restaurant where it is thought the Skripals were poisoned, and which remains closed, behind optimistic hoardings encouraging tourists to “Be inspired … shop, explore, discover: it’s all here in Salisbury!” “They blocked this way and routes were diverted and you had to go the far way round, you couldn’t cut through..” She was relieved things were getting back to normal. “At the beginning I was scared, they were asking people to take their clothes and throw them away or wash them and I was frightened. But the council has been very good.” The cathedral city of Salisbury, which has a population of 46,000, has a mix of tea shops and pubs among the familiar names of Tiger, Costa Coffee and a Shoe Zone. But tourism accounts for a major part of the local economy and, according to VisitWiltshire, provides jobs for up to 10% of the city’s workforce; three years ago, Lonely Planet named Salisbury as one of its top 10 must-see cities in the world. “It’s been odd to watch [the city] in the news,” said Dave Howell, a local geophysicist who had stopped with his daughter by the park in the Maltings. “I go to a lot of conferences for work and usually you have to describe where Salisbury is because no one has any idea and now it’s ‘Ooh, novichok!’ “I had one person physically step back from me and say: ‘Oh … Are you all right?’ and I said ‘Of course, I’m fine thanks!” Howell laughed. The patch of grass next to him had been resurfaced in the spot where the noxious bench was removed, with a small sign asking visitors to stay off the grass “to allow the turf to establish”. “For locals there was a lot of confusion,” he said. “Why here? It’s a not a place where anything generally tends to happen. And then there was fear about the impact on the town – because people did stay away.” The city suffered a significant drop in visitors following the poisoning in March, which led to the prime minister pledging a £2.5m recovery package for the city. “But the council offering free parking and the weather has helped,” said Howell, confident that Salisbury was getting back into its swing. Salisbury residents Katy and Alex were enjoying their first picnic in the park together for months. “We made a point of coming here today,” said Katy, a programmer. “We’ve just got married and were on honeymoon for three and a half weeks in Japan, so we just hoping it would be back to normal when we got back.” The couple’s April wedding was moved from the register office, where the council took up residence after its offices were being cleaned, to “an upgraded room which had two windows looking on to a lovely lawn”. But just before the big day, a huge tent to house cleaning equipment was erected on the lawn. “We had to move everything round, not have pictures taken where we wanted,” said Alex, “but obviously we’re very aware businesses suffered here and it was the never really knowing how long it was going to take – weeks or months.” They agreed a sense of normality, was being restored. “The initial excitement has worn off,” said Katy, “we were bored it of it. We just want things to move on.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/26/corbyn-under-pressure-momentum-give-members-vote-labour-brexit-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T14:19:45Z","webTitle":"Corbyn under pressure to give members vote on Labour Brexit policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/26/corbyn-under-pressure-momentum-give-members-vote-labour-brexit-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/26/corbyn-under-pressure-momentum-give-members-vote-labour-brexit-policy","fields":{"headline":"Corbyn under pressure to give members vote on Labour Brexit policy","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Supporters of Jeremy Corbyn from the leftwing campaign group Momentum are piling pressure on the leadership this weekend to give members a debate and vote on Labour’s Brexit policy in a move that will further expose the party’s deep divisions over Europe. Several prominent figures on the left have told the Observer that it will be unacceptable – and reminiscent of the worst elements of Tony Blair’s leadership – if policy is decided behind closed doors. They are demanding that Brexit is fully discussed and voted on by delegates at the Labour party conference in Liverpool in September. The gathering will take place before any vote by MPs in parliament on the outcome of negotiations between Theresa May and Brussels. The calls for involvement of the mass membership come as the leadership faces growing pressure from Labour MPs, peers and members to take a more pro-EU, pro-single-market approach as the main political parties prepare for a series of crucial Commons votes on the EU withdrawal bill in less than three weeks. A spokesman for Momentum said the organisation remained supportive of the leadership on Brexit. But, increasingly, elements within Momentum and the trade union movement are demanding the right to be heard on the most important policy issue of the day, in line with Corbyn’s repeated pledges to involve members at every turn. The Trades Union Congress is expected to intensify its demands for the party to back staying in the single market in the coming months. Rida Vaquas, a former member of Momentum’s national coordinating group, said: “The left has always stood against stage-managed conferences from the days of Blair, where decisions of substance are made behind closed doors whilst party members are given no chances to have robust debates on the direction of our party. “A Corbyn-led Labour party can only be strengthened by vigorous discussion among our own ranks, on our political differences as well as what unites us. How we approach Brexit is an issue of decisive importance and it is therefore only right it is debated at conference. Socialists can never succeed by dodging political questions, only by facing them head on.” Michael Chessum, who was on Momentum’s first steering committee in 2016/17 and is now national organiser of the leftwing anti-Brexit group Another Europe is Possible, said: “Jeremy Corbyn and the rest of the Labour leadership are principled people. “They have spent decades fighting for democracy in the party and against the idea that important decisions can be made in smoky backrooms by officials. So I’m confident that they will support the right of members to democratically debate issues as pivotal as Brexit and free movement. There should be a consensus around that. “Labour isn’t negotiating this deal, and the closer we get to exit day, the clearer it gets that the Tories’ Brexit agenda is going to be a disaster for the rights, freedoms and prosperity of working-class people and the communities that Labour and the left are supposed to represent. It is urgent that we clearly place an alternative to Brexit on the table – one linked to a radical vision for society under a Corbyn-led Labour government.” At last year’s Labour conference in Brighton, Momentum and some of the unions joined forces to prevent the Brexit issue being debated in order to avoid exposing the party split and embarrassing the relatively Eurosceptic Corbyn. At the time, many of his MPs and peers were pushing for him to back permanent membership of the single market. This year the arguments over Brexit look likely to be even more heated and calls for a debate will be far more difficult to resist in September, when the date of the UK’s departure will be less than six months away. Another Momentum member, Omar Raii, who sits on the London Young Labour committee and is a former NUS national executive committee member, said: “On an issue as big as this it would be unacceptable if we decided to determine our policy behind closed doors. It would be the worst kind of Blairite approach. “It’s hugely important that Labour members democratically thrash out policy at conference on all issues, especially one as huge as Brexit. I hope to see Labour articulate a genuinely internationalist policy that opposes the reactionary, anti-migrant plans the Tories have for us.” At a recent conference of the centre-left grouping Progess, nine candidates for Labour’s national executive committee launched the campaign LabourSay.EU to push for a meaningful vote on Brexit at the Labour conference. Earlier this month, student unions representing almost 1 million young people studying at UK colleges and universities signed a statement calling for a “people’s vote” or second referendum on the final deal negotiated by May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/26/can-more-proactive-policing-prevent-yet-another-public-shooting","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T18:08:32Z","webTitle":"Man killed after Oklahoma restaurant shooting known to police, LGBT groups say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/26/can-more-proactive-policing-prevent-yet-another-public-shooting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/26/can-more-proactive-policing-prevent-yet-another-public-shooting","fields":{"headline":"Man killed after Oklahoma restaurant shooting known to police, LGBT groups say","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A man suspected of shooting three people in an Oklahoma City restaurant on Thursday night came to the attention of local police in January, after he posted hundreds of fliers across the city in which he warned of “demons in cloned transexual (sic) bodies” and asked people to visit his YouTube channel. Such behavior by the suspected shooter, reported in January by local LGBT advocates, raises questions about whether a more proactive law enforcement reaction might have prevented yet another public shooting. On Friday, a police spokesman said then the man’s only interaction with the police was over a domestic incident 15 years before. The incident also renewed debate over whether states should make it easier for civilians to carry guns without a permit, a measure gun rights organizations say would make it easier for civilians to respond to random attacks. Earlier this month, Oklahoma’s Republican governor vetoed a bill that would have allowed adults to carry handguns without a permit, angering gun rights advocates. Authorities said Alexander Tilghman, 28, and a legal gun owner, opened fire at Louie’s On The Lake during dinner service. Three people were wounded and one man was injured trying to escape. The gunman was shot dead by two bystanders. Troy Stevenson, director of the LGBT rights group Freedom Oklahoma, said Tilghman was the same man who distributed flyers across Oklahoma City earlier this year, warning of demons taking over people’s bodies. The LGBT publication The Gayly interviewed Tilghman, who said he was “trying to find real people out there. Everywhere I go, there is nothing but fake people”. The Gayly said it discussed Tilghman twice with the local police department, which sent an officer to its office to request an interview transcript and a statement. The Gayly reported that a public information officer said: “This guy needs to be on our radar.” Speaking after the shooting, Oklahoma City police captain Bo Mathews said the only interaction police had with Tilghman was during a domestic assault and battery call when Tilghman was 13. A police report from that incident, in 2003, indicated Tilghman was arrested after his mother told police he punched her several times in a dispute over a vacuum cleaner. Investigators were trying to determine a motive behind the restaurant attack, Mathews said. A Facebook page police said belonged to Tilghman contained a video in which he claimed his television was possessed by the devil. The page used the same profile photo as a YouTube channel on which a man who appeared to be Tilghman described demons possessing his TV and being surrounded by computers. The man begged for help from “a real human”, saying he was suicidal, lonely and “really losing it”. A man who identified himself as Tilghman’s brother told television station KOCO Tilghman needed treatment, saying: “Nobody reached out to him, you know. He was crying for help.” Flyers with similar messages to those posted in January were plastered all over a vehicle that Tilghman drove, said Ryan Beaulac, who said he frequently saw Tilghman at his apartment complex in north-west Oklahoma City. Beaulac said he saw Tilghman acting strangely on Wednesday night. “He was twitchy, grabbing his hair and acting weird,” the 35-year-old said. “I was uncomfortable and definitely wanted to get away from him.” Tilghman was licensed as an armed security guard and was legally authorized to carry a firearm, said Gerald Konkler, general counsel for the Oklahoma Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training, which certifies law enforcement officers and other armed personnel across the state. Obtaining such a license requires a background check and at least 72 hours of training. Mathews said the shooting appeared to be random but noted that Tilghman drove to the restaurant and wore protective gear for his ears and eyes. “It looked like his mind was made up that he was going to discharge his firearm once he got there,” Mathews said. The investigation was ongoing he said, confirming that Tilghman’s mental health was being looked into. Police said Tilghman was armed with a pistol. A 39-year-old woman and two girls were shot and wounded and a man broke his arm while trying to escape. All four victims were in good condition, police said on Friday. Mathews, the police spokesman, praised the two people who retrieved firearms from their vehicles and “were able to shoot the suspect and put an end to a very dangerous situation”. A woman who answered the phone at the home believed to belong to Tilghman’s mother declined to comment when contacted by the Associated Press. The National Rifle Association said in a tweet on Friday that the shooting was an example of “how the best way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun”. In Indianapolis on Friday, a witness said an unarmed science teacher disarmed a student who shot and wounded the teacher and another student. The witness told ABC News the teacher, Jason Seaman, threw a basketball at the gunman before swatting the gun away. In April in Nashville, Tennessee, unarmed restaurant patron James Shaw Jr wrestled an assault-style rifle away from a gunman at a Waffle House restaurant. Four people were killed in that shooting. In its Friday tweet, the NRA also criticised Governor Mary Fallin, for blocking the “constitutional carry” bill."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/27/how-does-world-deal-with-donald-trump-erratic-and-capricious-ways","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T05:00:18Z","webTitle":"How does the world deal with Trump’s erratic and capricious ways? | Will Hutton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/27/how-does-world-deal-with-donald-trump-erratic-and-capricious-ways","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/27/how-does-world-deal-with-donald-trump-erratic-and-capricious-ways","fields":{"headline":"How does the world deal with Trump’s erratic and capricious ways?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"What does the world do about Donald Trump, the most erratic, egocentric and compromised US president ever to hold office? Trade war or no trade war? Summit or no summit with North Korea? Is Nato obsolete or relevant? Military or no military involvement in the Middle East? The US remains the overwhelmingly predominant economic, military and financial force on the planet. For 70 years, it has sustained a world order that, whatever its downsides, was at least an order with predictable patterns of international behaviour, along with a bias to openness, trade and peace. Suddenly it is all up in the air. For the west’s enemies and critics, the new chaos is welcome. Russia’s Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping are united in their view that the postwar order was a victor’s order, organised to suit US interests and from which it has benefited hugely. China chafes under the supremacy of the dollar, the US’s network of military bases, its dominance of the great international institutions and the way global trade and financial flows centre on the US. Russia still smarts from how the ring of satellite countries that constituted the Soviet Union have since detached themselves from Russian influence. Putin wants to level the score – witness his invasion of Crimea, his siege of Ukraine (involving, we now learn, the Russian shooting down of flight MH17, killing all 298 passengers) and his armies massing on the frontiers of the Baltic republics. Both see yet more opportunities spinning out of Trump’s incredible stupidity in deliberately destabilising the very system from which the US benefits so much. His waywardness is offering the chance to create new Russian and Chinese spheres of influence. China is being given the chance to dominate Asia, Russia the chance to recreate the Soviet Union’s influence in its old borderlands. And both can do it while talking the language of peace and respect for obvious global menaces such as climate change. Has a bigger fool ever occupied the White House? In Trumpland, however, both he and his “ base” see themselves as advancing America first. It is a universe that has created its own hermetically sealed reality. Trump’s long, rambling folksy speeches at his rallies – he uses “folks” a lot, diving into eccentric diversions at enormous length – are bound together by a combination of paranoia, vanity, prejudice and jokiness that is as curiously compelling as it is bonkers. But the unifying theme is that life is a zero-sum game: there are never gains from collaboration, no virtue in sharing and no value in anything but asserting your own will – with a gun, with a cheque book or with a missile. Give no quarter, look for the other side’s weakness and brutally cut the deal to walk away taller and prouder yourself. Trump’s fights and deals may reward the rich, but many of the disenfranchised rally to the philosophy of uncompromising self-assertion. It’s potent and it’s dangerous. Thus the twists and turns in American foreign policy. Iran has to be seen to kowtow to US will. Palestinians must accept the new Middle Eastern reality: there will be a US embassy in Jerusalem. Thus China is threatened with swingeing tariffs to be suspended only after it blinks first. Nato is tolerated because members are increasing defence spending as demanded. The US will only re-enter the Paris climate change accords if the world reshapes it wholly to accommodate US interests. North Korea must overtly bend to US will if there is to be a summit. Foreign policy has become a series of zero-sum games: the US has to win each one. This may work with Trump’s base – but it is a ludicrous way for the superpower to behave. For a start, it abandons any attempt to sustain world affairs systemically around a coherent set of shared principles or maintain the US’s leading role in its varying alliances. The world system, based on the dollar, Pax Americana and economic openness, is the foundation not only of global trade growth and prosperity since the Second World War but also of the US’s own economic model; it is why its hi-tech multinationals, rather than China’s, are world actors. By undermining the system, Trump will lose the benefits of systemic gain for tiny wins – and often not even for those. Furthermore, it fragments the entire alliance network– and legitimises Russia and China. Thus Russia and the Europeans are acting in concert to sustain the Iranian denuclearisation deal. The EU is refusing a transatlantic trade deal until the US recommits to the Paris climate change agreement, with China and Russia positioning themselves as on the side of the angels. China may increase its purchases of US soya bean and oil – the reason why the trade war was suspended – but it’s hardly worth endangering the world trade system. Meanwhile, it encourages Asian countries to sign up for China’s belt and road initiative, trade sphere and Asian bank. Worse, it makes everyone else adopt the same dog-eat-dog value system. The lesson of history is unambiguous. When the international system becomes a cockpit for economic, trade and national rivalry, armed conflict becomes more likely. Trump and the incompetent ideologues around him may welcome that: nobody else does. The best response is to show no weakness and stand up to him, as France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Angela Merkel do. And try to keep what is left of the international system together until eventually Trump is either impeached or voted out of office. But Macron and Merkel have the power of the EU behind them, itself now the world’s best and most powerful custodian of a rules-based international system. Britain is a weakened onlooker – a flyblown lion unable to muster more than a whimper. Our capacity is reduced by Brexit, just as we – and the world – need so much more. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/27/chris-froome-flash-of-magic-giro-italia","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T05:00:18Z","webTitle":"A moment of pure sporting magic from Chris Froome | Kenan Malik","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/27/chris-froome-flash-of-magic-giro-italia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/27/chris-froome-flash-of-magic-giro-italia","fields":{"headline":"A moment of pure sporting magic from Chris Froome","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"This was sport at its rawest, most thrilling, visceral best. For months, British cyclist Chris Froome has been battling for his reputation. His team, Sky, faces opprobrium for sharp practices and the alleged use of drugs. A shadow was cast across Froome’s remarkable four victories in the Tour de France. “Perhaps it’s not surprising,” critics muttered darkly. Then, last September, Froome failed a drugs test. He denies any wrong-doing and is fighting the case. But the muttering became a roar. All year, he has been building up to the Giro d’Italia, the third of Europe’s grand races. If he won, he’d be only the third cyclist in history to hold the Tour de France, the Vuelta a España and the Giro at the same time. Many insisted that he should be banned from even taking part. Reconnoitring the course the day before the start, Froome had a nasty fall. He began the Giro shakily, well down the field. It was another Brit, Simon Yates, who exhilaratingly led the race. Some advised Froome to retire from a futile quest. Then came Friday, the 19th and most brutal stage, with vertiginous climbs and daredevil hairpins. Froome attacked on the Colle delle Finestre, a mountain that makes my legs shake even at the thought of walking up, with 80km to go. Such was the ferocity of his break that Froome claimed the outright lead. It was a moment as electrifying as Bob Beamon’s long jump in Mexico ’68 or Liverpool’s comeback in the 2005 Champions League final. I understand the arguments about drug taking. But what constitutes an “unfair” advantage, or what it is to be “clean”, is not as black and white as the drugs warriors seem to believe. And on whatever side of the debate one falls, it’s hard to deny that what Froome did up there on the Colle delle Finestre was something special, the kind of moment for which sport was invented. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/may/26/traditionally-conservative-roscommon-votes-for-irish-abortion-reform","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T16:03:45Z","webTitle":"Traditionally conservative Roscommon votes for Irish abortion reform","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/26/traditionally-conservative-roscommon-votes-for-irish-abortion-reform","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/26/traditionally-conservative-roscommon-votes-for-irish-abortion-reform","fields":{"headline":"Traditionally conservative Roscommon votes for Irish abortion reform","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nearly everyone expected Roscommon to vote no. Instead, the traditionally conservative county, the only constituency in Ireland that voted against same-sex marriage in 2015, confounded predictions with a resounding yes to abortion reform. Roscommon – blighted by generations of emigration and written off, by some, as a rural backwater – proved on Saturday it was in step with the rest of the country, voting to overturn a 35-year-old constitutional ban on abortion. “Without doubt it’s probably one of the most difficult areas to get the yes vote out, but we’ve done it and we’ve shown that Roscommon is living in the modern world, and we’re delighted about that,” said MEP Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan, from Castelrea in north Roscommon, at the Hyde Park count centre. Roscommon’s 57% verdict in favour of reform was one of a wave of surprises in the midlands that proved the much anticipated urban-rural divide had failed to materialise. Even the tiny rural village of Dysart, a place of dry stone walls and even stonier fields, voted yes. “My own [ballot] box, a very rural older population – wow,” said Tom Nolan as he tallied up 203 to the yes side and 123 to no. A breakdown of the exit poll carried out by broadcaster RTÉ suggested that 63% of voters in rural areas voted to repeal the eighth amendment, compared with the confirmed result of 76.5% in Dublin Central. RTÉ also projected that 52.5% of farmers had backed abortion reform. According to the forecast, all age groups except the over-65s backed repeal, and there was a majority among both men and women. Roscommon county, with a voter register of just 63,000, was considered the bellwether for the no campaign as the only constituency in Ireland that voted against legalising same-sex marriage in the referendum of 2015. The brief notoriety offended those who had voted in favour of marriage equality. But they had to wait three years to shake off the unwelcome sobriquet as the most conservative country in Ireland. It meant tears of joy when the results started to flood in. Mother and daughter Georgina and Natalie Barrow, who had canvassed door to door for repeal, hugged and sobbed as a ballot box in their polling station, Strokestown, produced a 90-66 yes vote. “I am actually shaking,” said Georgina. “I can’t believe it: we hoped for this and we got really good feedback on the doors but you just never know when people go into the booth just what they will do.” She put the result down to the “shy voter” who did not want to share their opinion in public in a small country town for fear of recrimination, but voted with their conscience in the privacy of the polling booth. Campaigning for yes in Roscommon county had not been easy, said artist Jacinta Lynch. “The investment of the no campaign was really overwhelming, and it felt there was a really dark situation here. But a landslide? We couldn’t ask for anything more.” Some yes campaigners had been subjected to abuse, she said. Posters for the yes side had also “literally disappeared overnight” while the no posters remained. In the village of Knockcroghery, yes posters were turned to face the wall. As well as tears, Nollaig Molloy was on the verge of exhaustion after months of campaigning. “I just feel like going away to sit somewhere by myself; it’s been intense,” she said. While taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the result was the “culmination of a quiet revolution”, not everyone agreed. Research by RTÉ showed most people had formed a view on abortion five years ago and were unswayed by any campaigning. Some said it showed politicians were long out of step with the public. But there was also anger in some quarters that the referendum was bound up with specific proposals for legislation to introduce unrestricted abortion up to 12 weeks. “I’m extremely disappointed. We still don’t realise the onslaught and death toll that is going to come from this. We’ve literally handed away the rights of the unborn to our government,” said no campaigner Darragh Bailey, 22. In Roscommon town, no voter Claire Feeley, 38, said she was “very disappointed and quite shocked” with the result. “I had difficulties with this pregnancy,” she said pointing to her baby; now, other children like hers may not be protected, she said. Across the road, Caitlin McConn, who runs Harlows pub, disagreed: “It’s a great result. My mum, dad, sister, brother-in-law, all voted yes. I was blown away by my parents. They felt it wasn’t their choice to make choices for others who might find themselves in difficulty,” she said. Local TD Eugene Murphy, who voted no, said the result was “the will of the people” but that he hoped respect would be shown to his side of the divide. “It is very important that people who voted no are not isolated or feel isolated, and the legislation reflects their genuine concerns,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/26/serena-alexander-benson-missing-schoolgirl-believed-to-have-left-uk-in-company-of-adult","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T13:58:32Z","webTitle":"Missing London schoolgirl believed to have left UK in 'company of adult'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/26/serena-alexander-benson-missing-schoolgirl-believed-to-have-left-uk-in-company-of-adult","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/26/serena-alexander-benson-missing-schoolgirl-believed-to-have-left-uk-in-company-of-adult","fields":{"headline":"Missing London schoolgirl believed to have left UK in 'company of adult'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A search has been launched for a 13-year-old schoolgirl who left the UK on a Eurotunnel train.

Departure time was “8pm sharp”: we finally got under way at 8.30pm, but a two-and-a-half hour trip meant we would still see the bulk of the acts. After a couple of stops we were near Strabane, on the border, at 10.30 when we hit out first checkpoint. A bomb scare meant a detour down a back road – this was the start of a not-so-magical mystery tour. After getting lost we hit another checkpoint but finally made it to the border just after 11pm. “Look at those four cops,” someone said behind me, “I reckon they’re gonna get on and search us.” He was right. A plain clothes officer boarded the bus and informed us we would be being searched under Section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. We were shepherded into a large, cold, concrete shelter where up to a dozen RUC officers proceeded to conduct a thorough search.

He was attacked at the Kerryman pub in Digbeth, near the city centre, at about 1.30am on Saturday, West Midlands police said. Officers were viewing CCTV footage and investigating in the local area, but no arrests have been made and no weapon has been recovered. Supt Sally Holmes said the incident was not connected to the Pride celebrations taking place in Birmingham this weekend. “We’re working hard to establish the circumstances around the stabbing and the scene is currently closed while forensic examination is carried out,” she said. “With this being a busy area, we believe there will be a number of people who may have vital information to assist our inquiries. I would urge anyone who hasn’t spoken to officers to contact us.” The attack came as local media reported that Birmingham was “in the grip of a terrifying crimewave”, which included three murders in a single week as well as several shootings and stabbings. On Tuesday, Taimoor Zaheer, 22, was shot dead as he sat in a car Handsworth, north-west Birmingham. Anib Khan, 23, was arrested by Kent police as he tried to board a ferry in Dover later that night. Zaheer’s killing came five days after Ozell Pemberton, 16, was killed by a stab wound to the chest outside a McDonald’s in Lower Parade, Sutton Coldfield. Four teenagers have been arrested in connection with his murder. Two days earlier, Abdul Rahman, 24, was shot dead at a street barbecue on Stratford Place in Highgate, close to Birmingham city centre. Thousands turned up for Rahman’s funeral on Thursday, but no arrests have been made. Birmingham’s surge in violent crime – which has been replicated in cities around the UK, particularly London – has spurred the West Midlands police and crime commissioner, David Jamieson, to invest an extra £2m in preventative measures, including mentoring schemes for young people and mediators to defuse violence. Alex Murray, assistant chief constable, said: “There is no place in society for such despicable acts and we are committed to doing all we can to take knives and guns off the streets to keep our communities safe. “We are involved in a number of initiatives involving local authorities and support groups to steer young people away from crime and gang affiliation by getting them into education, training or work. “But we also need the help of our communities in tackling these issues and need them to tell us any information they have. It could be the difference between a life being lost or someone being charged.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/29/stone-circle-haroon-mirza-texas-stonehenge","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T15:00:52Z","webTitle":"Stone Circle: the story behind Haroon Mirza's Texas Stonehenge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/29/stone-circle-haroon-mirza-texas-stonehenge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/29/stone-circle-haroon-mirza-texas-stonehenge","fields":{"headline":"Stone Circle: the story behind Haroon Mirza's Texas Stonehenge","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ever since New York artist Donald Judd relocated to Marfa in 1979, this small Texas town has become an art destination. It isn’t exactly a place you’d expect to find a booming creative scene, but artists and galleries moved here in the 1980s to take advantage of empty spaces and cheap rents, while also paying tribute to Judd’s legacy. The Ayn Foundation – which currently boasts Andy Warhol’s The Last Supper – opened in Marfa in 1993, and art galleries like Inde/Jacobs and Rule Gallery, as well as design boutique Wrong Marfa, are all set up in Marfa. So is a landmark fake Prada boutique on the roadside, which is an artwork by Elmgreen &amp; Dragset from 2005. Just last year saw the small town of 2,000 people host Solange Knowles at a concert for Judd’s Chianti Foundation. Next up, Marfa will see a new solar powered Stonehenge project by British artist Haroon Mirza. The piece, entitled Stone Circle, is a set of black marble-like rocks in the Texas desert until 2023 (but potentially indefinitely). Every full moon, there will be a musical concert and light show in what Mirza calls “solar symphonies”, with the first one held on 28 June. “On full moons, the stones will start to play composed electrical signals, which will be quite musical,” said Mirza over the phone from his London studio. “You will hear the electricity as sound.” The stone pieces stand in a circle, like the ancient Stonehenge or the famed Nine Ladies site in Derbyshire. Set in the high desert, eight chunks of marble will sit in a circle with the ninth as the “mother stone”, charging the circle through a bank of batteries underground. “You see the electrical current as light and you hear it as sound,” said Mirza. The stones are made of marble shipped from Mexico, which light up at night. “During the day, they look like quartz crystals, but at night they glow with electricity,” he said. Mirza, who is the winner of the Silver Lion for Most Promising artist at the 54th Venice Biennale in 2011, has made solar-powered artworks in the past, like wall-works which generate sound from electricity, including Duet for a Duo (Solar Symphony 7) from 2015. He recalls his first mystified experience with the Stonehenge as he drove past it decades ago. “I remember thinking it was an alien thing, like a UFO landing,” he said. “It has an incredible aura to it, from a distance and up close.” It wasn’t about replicating the Stonehenge, but presenting a new experience. “The feeling of being at the Stone Circle is a sense of commune with nature,” said Mirza. This artwork is more than just a journey out into the desert, as it also promotes solar power in the south. Freedom Solar, the Austin-based solar panel company, donated half of the solar panels for the project. They’re also offering a rebate for new solar customers referred through the gallery which is presenting this project, Ballroom Marfa. (Freedom Solar also offers local workshops for west Texans wanting to switch to solar power at home and at work.) Surprisingly, it’s working. “When I first visited Marfa, I didn’t see one solar panel anywhere, which I thought was surprising because there is a lot of sun,” said Mirza. “There is controversy around it, but there is potential for solar energy in that part of Texas and people have started installing solar panels, which is a positive move.” “It’s a no brainer, actually,” he adds. “If you live in a climate like that, it makes a massive difference.” The project was no easy feat, as Stone Circle took five years to materialize, and it didn’t help that the marble was stuck at the Mexican border for nine months. “I thought it was going to be easy, but it was complicated and expensive,” said Mirza. “Sometimes it’s better to be naive and have ambition and think big.” For the first full moon gathering, the marble ‘stones’ will light up and play sounds that call to mind electronic music. “I’ve composed the electrical signals,” said Mirza. “It depends what you regard as music.” Even though the Stonehenge was used as a site for worship, there will be no sacrificial lambs. “People are perceiving and preaching it as a spiritual gathering, but I don’t have an intention of it being a spiritual thing,” said Mirza."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/may/25/brazil-protests-latest-temer-clears-trucks-highways-army","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T20:17:30Z","webTitle":"Brazilian president sends in army as truck protest paralyzes country","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/25/brazil-protests-latest-temer-clears-trucks-highways-army","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/25/brazil-protests-latest-temer-clears-trucks-highways-army","fields":{"headline":"Brazilian president sends in army as truck protest paralyzes country","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Brazil’s conservative president Michel Temer has ordered the army and federal police to clear highways blockaded by striking truck drivers after a protest over soaring fuel prices entered its fifth day. The blockades have paralysed much of the country’s economy and prompted São Paulo, the biggest city in South America, to declare a state of emergency over fuel shortages. “I have actioned the federal security forces to unblock highways and I am asking governors to do the same,” Temer said in a televised address on Friday. “We will not let the population do without its primary needs.” The protests began over fuel prices but have been further stoked by widespread anger over repeated graft scandals involving prominent politicians – including Temer himself. In São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, supermarkets and restaurants are running low on supplies. Some factories have shut down, bus services been reduced and even the Refugees World Cup, scheduled to take place in São Paulo on Saturday, has been cancelled. The Folha de S Paulo newspaper site reported that 11 airports including one in the capital city Brasília have run out of fuel, and long queues have built up at gas stations around the country. Behind the scenes, the army – already embroiled in a controversial operation against gang violence in Rio de Janeiro state – is concerned it might not have enough fuel to break the strike, the G1 news site reported. “It is a difficult, delicate mission,” said reserve Gen Augusto Heleno Pereira, who commanded Brazil’s UN military force in Haiti. “The truck driver is a sympathetic figure … we hope there will be negotiation and there will be a deal and that they won’t offer resistance.” The government appeared to believe it had resolved the crisis, but many drivers were unsatisfied with the deal. One of the main unions, known in Portuguese as Abcam and representing 600,000 truck drivers, walked out of the negotiations. “We will not go back to work until our demands are met,” said truck driver José Cicero Rodrigues, speaking by telephone from a protest at Santos, Brazil’s biggest port near São Paulo. Brazil’s federal highway police said that highways continued to be blocked on Friday but would not confirm how many. Local media reported that security forces will be able to enter trucks and remove them from the highways, and the decree is due to come into effect on Friday. Following Temer’s decree the Abcam union said it was telling its members to stop blocking highways, but continue demonstrating peacefully. “We have already shown our strength to the government,” the union said in a statement on its website. Ahead of yesterday’s agreement, Brazilian media reported that some congressmen were fleeing Brasilia to return to their home states before the fuel ran out. Eunício Oliveira, the Senate president who flew back to his home state of Ceará in the North East, was forced to fly straight back to Brasília after a wave of criticism. Videos circulating on WhatsApp showed truck drivers enjoying barbecues on blocked highways and pictures of trucks covered in Brazil flags and banners reading “stop with the thieving or we’ll stop the country”. On Friday striking school bus drivers paraded down São Paulo’s landmark Paulista Avenue in a cacophony of blaring horns. Drivers drew a direct link between their own increased fuel costs and the vast sums of money that politicians of all parties have been accused of stealing. “Nobody can stand any more. This is absurd, so much stealing, so much thieving and we have to pay the bill,” said Anderson Barbosa, 41. “Brazil is indignant.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/25/johanna-konta-game-prosper-clay-paris","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T21:30:38Z","webTitle":"Johanna Konta believes she has the game to prosper on the clay of Paris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/25/johanna-konta-game-prosper-clay-paris","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/25/johanna-konta-game-prosper-clay-paris","fields":{"headline":"Johanna Konta believes she has the game to prosper on the clay of Paris","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Johanna Konta insists she is comfortable playing on clay – despite a thin résumé in five visits to Roland Garros. It says much for her self-belief. “This is only my third French Open main draw by ranking,” she said, “so I think it would be a little bit unfair to say completely that my record is terrible. I would like to give it a few more years.” She has a chance to prove doubters wrong against the demonstrative Kazak battler Yulia Putintseva with whom she wiped the clay of Rome the last time they met, a year ago. However, losing to the delightfully artistic doubles specialist Hsieh Su-wei here last year after winning the first set 6-1, was the upset of the opening round. And the year before, she went out at the first time of asking against Julia Goerges, who was ranked 57 in the world but had struck form. “I’ve only qualified for two slams and one of them was here, so I have experienced success in Paris. The one last year was an incredibly tough one against Su-wei – and we’ve all seen since then how well she can play. “Before that was against Julia Goerges, who plays incredibly well on this surface and made the final in Nuremburg the week before. So there needs to be respect given to the players that I played and the level that they produced. “But, as for how I feel on the surface, every year that I come here I look forward to it because I know I can play well on the clay. Before I started playing more on the WTA tour I actually won most of my Challengers on the clay, especially at the very beginning. I’d like to give myself a little more time.” That confidence might come under pressure in her first match. “You’ll need to ask her why she does it,” Konta said of Putintseva’s ability to light up a court with her language as well as her racket. “In my experience, most players act the way they do in their own self-interest, in getting their emotions out and basically working with their own demons on court. She will deal with the match the way she feels she needs to deal with it to win, and I will deal with the match the way that I feel I need to deal with it to win.” Konta’s penchant to see all sides of a debate should qualify her to negotiate a way out of Brexit, and she was similarly diplomatic when asked what she thought about the tournament not seeding Serena Williams on her return to slams after winning the 2017 Australian Open, and now the proud mother of Alexis Olympia. Although not a great one for analysing the draw (she didn’t even know it had been made on Thursday evening), Konta appeared pleased when told she was not in the American’s section – and that Williams was vying in the first week with Garbiñe Muguruza, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Maria Sharapova in a quality charge at the semis. Williams starts against Krystina Pliskova and looks on course for a fourth-round meeting with Sharapova – who surprised a few people in Rome last week when she supported a review of the WTA rules to seedings and long absences. “Wow, it’s a very strong quarter,” Konta said. “There are no easy matches any more, regardless of who you play. We’ve had plenty of proof through the last number of years that there are going to be upsets, there are going to be new breakthroughs, there are going to be oohs and aahs and all that. Whatever match you play, whatever quarter you’re in, you’ve got your work cut out for you.” Konta, still with her diplomat’s hat on, refused to be drawn on the topic of the week: whether or not Williams should be seeded here, after a long absence from the Tour. “It’s important to remember that there were mothers previously, such as Kim Clijsters, who came back and who weren’t seeded. It’s an ongoing conversation. I think it’s important to find a good balance of rewarding the current players who have earned their right to be a seed and also supporting returning mothers.” And what would that good balance be? Smiling, she replied, “It’s a good question. Honestly, I don’t quite know. I think seeding is on a player’s current form. “It would also be unfair of a player who is coming back being put into that position as well, as well as the players who are currently playing but you are taking that away if they’ve earned it.” Konta, ranked 22 in the world after a long spell in the top 10, needs a good run in this tournament and is confident she can finally do it. “This year, preparation-wise, I’ve had some really great matches on the clay. I feel like I’m playing to my level in general, regardless of surface. I’m playing better and better. So I’m hoping to continue that here. “I back myself in every way to be able to go deep into the tournament, go on to the end – but it starts with the first round.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/25/memorial-weekend-what-you-will-do-inevitably-drinking-beaches-rain-disappointment","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T20:02:44Z","webTitle":"Sun, flee or disappointment: how will your memorial day weekend pan out?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/25/memorial-weekend-what-you-will-do-inevitably-drinking-beaches-rain-disappointment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/25/memorial-weekend-what-you-will-do-inevitably-drinking-beaches-rain-disappointment","fields":{"headline":"Sun, flee or disappointment: how will your memorial day weekend pan out?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The pressure is on, it’s the first long weekend of the summer, and here you are, flailing, desperately trying to work out the best way to make the most of it. Months from now you’ll be a cold, sad, winter-enduring person, and after that, sweet, sweet death. This is your one chance to make the most of the free time. So how will you take ownership of that extra day off? Probably in one of these ways. The ‘it’s our chance to get out the city’ approach In an impromptu attempt to prove that you are fun and/or “up for whatever!” you recruit any and all available friends to meet you at the beach, where you are determined to tan just enough for your enemies to be jealous. After sleeping through your alarm, you leave for the beach shortly after noon, convincing yourself amidst several hours of traffic that there will be plenty of sun left by the time you arrive. You repeat this to yourself as you begin sifting through millions of boardshort-wearing patriots, feeling no less desperate than Cal Hockley in Titanic when yelling “I have a child!” Finally, after 45 minutes shuffling through sand and trying to find enough space to place your towels, coolers and remnants of dignity, you lay down, close your eyes, and realize how cold you are. The sun has just set, and you are hungry. You and your friends collect your belongings and resign yourselves to the fact that dinner will be a bag of chips in the car on the way home. Somehow, you still have a heat rash. The ‘big Friday’ approach Barreling out of the office on Friday afternoon, you mentally re-enact the School’s Out scene from Dazed and Confused as you vow to live each moment like it’s your last. High on possibility and the ability to wear shorts without feeling too chilly or foolish, you text everyone you’ve ever met and manage to recruit all available parties for A Big Night Out™. You skip supper, telling yourself chips and guacamole are more than enough, then proceed to consume the weight of yourself and your friends in alcohol, shunning water or any non-alcoholic beverage with the wave of your hand and the cries of, “Boooooo!” You depart your fifth bar at 3am, promising to be at karaoke the next night because you’re “not a buzzkill, Cheryl”. Subsequently, you spend the entirety of Saturday sleeping between sips of ginger ale on your bathroom floor, before declaring Sunday an international day of rest. You look at the work shorts you wore on Friday and question whether you’re over summer entirely. The ‘I’m going finish all my work’ approach As your coworkers ask what your weekend plans are, you smugly mention having a lot of work to catch up on while you study their faces for jealousy. You decline their invitations to barbecues, cookouts and gatherings and stifle the urge to throw in how important you are and how, unlike them, you are dead serious about your career. You go to bed early on Friday, confident that you will begin your Saturday with a jog before dawn, a breakfast of the healthiest sort and several hours of solid laptop time, promising that if you wrap up early, you’ll treat yourself to one (1) episode of whatever Netflix show you won’t binge because you’re responsible. You are better than everybody (you tell yourself). Fomo is for losers. By Monday night, you’ve typed three words despite uploading 14 Instagram stories alluding to your Howard Hughes-like productivity. You’ve watched your coworkers, friends, lovers and people you accidentally creeped through that weird Discover page celebrate a weekend whose sentiment you don’t actually understand, but are now jealous about. The ‘I’m actually going to do some memorialising’ approach Promising to begin taking national holidays more seriously, you attend a parade with a friend you bribed to accompany you. Adamant that if you arrive early will “get some good seats”, the two of you end up standing behind the tallest people who ever have lived, which prompts you to ask your friend if they’ll heist you up on their shoulders. After your friend leaves, you spend the duration of the parade walking alongside the procession, trying to see something, anything, for the love of all that is good, just one band would be fine. You look down at the tiny flag you are holding and wonder if these six hours were worth it. You consider jumping in like Dr Richard Kimble in The Fugitive to see if it’s really that easy. The ‘going back home to see old buddies’ approach Determined to relive the madness and mayhem of youth, you descend on your hometown to party like it’s the late 90s/noughts/whatever decade it is you thrived in. Welcomed by your parents who have turned your bedroom into the place where the treadmill is, you text the friends you grew up alongside only to realise most of them don’t live there anymore and you are terrible at keeping in touch. You spend the next two and a half days next to the treadmill, dodging questions from your family about what your job is, who you’re dating now and why you won’t just sleep in the guest room (see: the room where the treadmill used to be). After fixing your parents’ 2002-era desktop and convincing them to stop using Hotmail, you leave with six pounds of barbecued hamburgers your mom encourages you to eat on the train. You oblige."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/27/liberal-democracy-history-us-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T14:53:04Z","webTitle":"Liberal democracy is in crisis.

But ... do we know what it is?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It was 25 years ago that Fareed Zakaria warned against a new and growing threat: the rise of “illiberal democracy” around the world. Democratically elected governments were routinely flouting liberal principles, openly violating the rule of law, and depriving their citizens of basic rights and liberties. Today, many believe that we stand on the precipice of an existential crisis. Liberal democracy is “closer to collapse than we may wish to believe”, writes Ed Luce of the Financial Times. In a bracing new book, the former secretary of state Madeleine Albright even warns of a revival of fascism. There is a growing consensus that American democracy itself is at risk. The Economist’s index categorizes the United States as a “flawed democracy”. There is a danger within: Americans are becoming complacent about democracy, losing interest in their traditional ideals. Liberalism has failed, writes Patrick Deneen. The problem, says David Brooks of the New York Times, is that liberals have forgotten how to defend their “liberal democratic values”. They must go back to first principles; they must remember “the canon of liberal democracy”. The trouble is that we don’t really know what liberal democracy is. A spate of books, articles and opinion pieces talk about its demise, but their authors speak past each other or around in circles, because they are using different definitions of the term. Ed Luce defines liberalism one way, David Brooks another and Patrick Deneen yet another. How can we have a proper discussion about liberal democracy when we are not speaking about the same thing? The problem concerns more than semantics. The confusion of terms leads to confused thinking. It impairs liberals’ understanding of their own principles and weakens their politics. Their opponents easily exploit the verbal ambiguities. It is high time, therefore, that we clarify what the term “liberal democracy” means and what it stands for. For this we need to understand its history. One common mistake is to conflate liberalism with democracy. The two concepts are not synonyms. For most of their history, they have not even been compatible. From the time of the ancient Greeks, “democracy” has meant “rule by the people”. Some have interpreted this to mean direct political participation by all male citizens. Others have taken it to mean a representative system based on the suffrage of all male citizens. Either way, however, well into the 19th century, the majority of liberals were hostile to the very idea of democracy, which they associated with chaos and mob rule. It is hard to find a liberal who was enthusiastic about democracy during the heyday of what is often called “classical liberalism”. Indeed, it would not be wrong to say that liberalism was originally invented to contain democracy. Certainly, the founders of liberalism were no democrats. Benjamin Constant stood for strict property qualifications for both voting and officeholding. The French revolution proved to liberals like him that the public was utterly unprepared for political rights. People were ignorant, irrational and prone to violence. Under their pressure, the rule of law had been suspended, “enemies of the people” guillotined, rights trampled upon. The most democratic phase of the revolution had also been the most bloody. Napoleon’s despotism, which was legitimized repeatedly by plebiscites based on universal male suffrage, only confirmed the liberals’ apprehensions about democracy. The emperor’s popularity demonstrated in no uncertain terms that French citizens had an unhealthy predilection for authoritarian rulers and were fatally susceptible to propaganda. New words were invented to name his pseudo-democratic regime. Some called it “democratic despotism”. Others used the terms “Bonapartism” or “Caesarism”. Constant called it “usurpation”. “Usurpers” are constantly compelled to justify their positions, so they use lies and propaganda to manufacture support. They form alliances with religious authorities to prop up their regimes. They take their countries into useless wars to distract people from their treachery, while they enhance their own power, line their own pockets and enrich their friends. Worst of all, they corrupt their people by tricking them into participating in their lies. Alexis de Tocqueville also had deep misgivings about democracy. Two additional French revolutions, one in 1830 and the other in 1848, followed by another Napoleon, depressed him greatly. It proved once again that the masses were easy prey for demagogues and would-be dictators catering to their lowest instincts. Democracy fostered a pernicious form individualism, another word for selfishness in Tocqueville’s lexicon. Early liberals like Constant and Tocqueville spent much time thinking about how to counter the perils of democracy. Limits had to be placed on the sovereignty of the people, the rule of law and individual rights guaranteed. But good laws would never be enough, since a popular strongman could easily pervert or simply ignore them. The survival of liberal democracies required a politically educated citizenry. Constant travelled around France instructing French citizens about the principles of their constitution, their rights and their duties. He published articles and delivered speeches for the same purpose. He fought valiantly for the freedom of the press. Both men also believed that the survival of a liberal democracy depended on certain moral values. It required public spiritedness and a sense of community. Tocqueville thought deeply about fostering “public morality” and “public virtue”. Constant agonized over the political complacency, moral apathy, and selfishness that he saw all around him. Only dictators profited from such vices. How to counter the moral degradation? They thought about this as well. The commitment of public-spirited elites was essential. “The enlightened classes” and “well-meaning men” must be the “missionaries of truth”, wrote Constant. They must redouble their efforts to counter the cynicism that was turning people away from the public good. As Tocqueville said, it was essential to “educate democracy.” And this, he said, was “the primary duty imposed on the leaders of society today”. It is a sad sign of the times that such statements sound so naive or ring hollow today. The truth is that we still have much to learn from the founding fathers of liberalism, who lived through an existential crisis of their own. They knew about the tendency that democracies have to become illiberal. Let us heed their lessons. Helena Rosenblatt is professor of history at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

It lies in the Inner Hebrides, just off the east coast of Skye, six miles or so from the mainland across the Applecross sound. I had woken up in Finsbury Park, north London. After a taxi, a flight, a beguiling train ride from Inverness to Kyle of Lochalsh and another taxi to Sconser, on Skye, I finally met the ferry to Raasay, 11 or so hours after my alarm went off. Any reservations slunk off once I was sat in the Isle of Raasay Distillery’s bar, clutching a glass of whisky and looking back to Skye across the sound. The hotel, which opened earlier this year, is designed to provide this view as often as possible, with good reason. It’s unassailable, and unavailable anywhere else. On the near side of the water, lawn and small pastures give way to pebble beaches and the sea, a spread of grey and green beneath the looming Cuillin mountains on the other side of the channel. The lower reaches are swathed in conifers and heather, which give up the fight as the slopes gets steeper, exposing raggedy volcanic peaks. Some of these rocks are among the oldest on earth. This view is slowly becoming better known, although it was never exactly a secret. The most famous account of Raasay was written by Samuel Johnson, who stopped by on his tour of the Western Isles of Scotland with Boswell in 1773. Comfortingly, the journey was even worse for them, across a landscape unmarked by roads or signs, but once they arrived they settled in as guests at Raasay House, the seat of the ruling MacLeod clan, where Johnson was surprised by the local breakfasting habits. “A man of the Hebrides… as soon as he appears in the morning, swallows a glass of whisky,” he wrote, “yet they are not a drunken race, at least I never was present at much intemperance; but no man is so abstemious as to refuse the morning dram, which they call a shalk.” Despite this long history of drinking whisky, however, to say nothing of a proud tradition of moonshiners, until recently Raasay never had a proper distillery of its own. Then in 2013, entrepreneur Bill Dobbie and his old schoolfriend Iain Hector Ross, a writer and publicist, were having a few drams at the end of a day’s skiing. Dobbie was looking for a new project, “something physical and in Scotland, a product that would have a legacy”, Ross explained to me on a Land Rover tour of the island the next morning. The two men first discussed tweed before turning to the stuff in their hands. “Whisky had been around forever,” Ross said, “and we were mildly aware that people were paying decent sums for it. But we also realised we didn’t know anything about it.” Nevertheless, the seed of an idea was sown. Ross went off to learn about the history of whisky and ended up writing an entertaining book, The Whisky Dictionary. Dobbie looked for someone who might actually be able to make it. He came across Alasdair Day, a food industry veteran who had already been looking to start a whisky operation. Their initial plan was to base it in the Borders, but Ross, whose wife’s family are from Raasay, heard about an old hotel for sale. Raasay had plenty going for it. There were no other distilleries, and there was a source of fresh water – a well that had been in use since Celtic times. Also, like many of the Hebrides, Raasay crams into a few square miles a lot of bloody history, of clearances and raiders and a general abundance of brave Scots and dastardly Englishmen. (More recently, it was off Raasay that the nuclear submarine HMS Astute ran aground while the captain was having a shower.) Recruiting local architect Olli Blair, Dobbie and Day set about overhauling the old buildings and installing a state-of-the-art distillery. They could hardly have timed it better. Boosted by a combination of the weak pound, Instagram posts, a Harry Styles video shot last year and minibus tours from Edinburgh and Glasgow, Skye is rapidly gaining in popularity, with visitor numbers said to be up 15% this year alone. While the Raasay ferry now runs hourly in the daytime during the week, the island is unlikely to turn into Venice any time soon. There is one town, Inverarish, with a single shop, and no pub. All the action revolves around Raasay house and, now, the new distillery. The hotel and distillery are part of the same building; the hotel is simple but surpassingly comfortable, with a dining room dominated by a spectacular feature wall, designed to mimic the geology of the island. Our fellow guests included a couple from Atlanta, Georgia, and a pair of German Outward Bound instructors. We also passed a group of men who called themselves the Dram Busters, old friends from England who meet several times a year to climb a hill and drink a decent Scotch. While the hotel is up and running, the Raasay employees are in the traditional limbo of new distillers, as they will not have anything to drink until 2020. Until then they have a holding whisky, While We Wait, designed to give a sense of how the finished product might taste: less peaty than some of the heavier Islay-style whiskies, with a fruitiness that comes from a longer-than-average fermentation period. The last census, in 2011, found that Raasay had a population of 192, which means the new distillery employs a significant percentage of the island’s working population. “If you’re from Raasay, the chances are your family is either involved in crofting or on the sea,” explained Callum, who was working on local ferries before starting his new job giving excellent distillery tours. If in doubt, everyone on Raasay is called Callum. The perennial problem for young people, he said, is housing, which is tightly controlled by the council. On the last morning I meant to go for a walk, but I was distracted again by the view. Clouds rumbled into sight from the south, bullying their way into the sound. Under a heavy sky, the slopes on Skye deepened to plum and chestnut. The only bright point was the ferry that shone like an old crooner under a crack in the clouds. Even with such an appealing new destination, a visit to Raasay is only tangentially about whisky, just as whisky is only tangentially about whisky.

Emerging apparently from nowhere, he quickly became “the coolest man you’ve ever seen”, designing flamboyant clothes for stars such as Elton John and the Beatles, who, apart from George, wore his suits on the cover of Abbey Road . Lance Richardson’s splendidly readable and gossipy account of his life has a trump card to play – namely the relationship between Tommy and his photographer brother, David, who acted as a kind of artistic Boswell to his brother’s sartorial Johnson. Tommy died in 1992 of an Aids-related illness, but David is still alive, and his cooperation enhances a gripping read that is as much social history as it is biography. To be gay, as both Tommy and David were, growing up in postwar Britain was a mixed blessing. On the one hand, it was a time of chemical castration for “queers” and imprisonment; on the other, it was a world of secret languages and discreet clubs (with less than discreet patrons). Richardson, himself gay, writes about the persecution of homosexuals at the time with bracing anger; readers who expect a series of camp anecdotes may be surprised as he describes how the outing and punishment of gay men was “like a public hanging transposed from the middle ages: prurient [and] ethically indefensible”. It was in this milieu that Tommy, a talented young “cutter” who learned his trade on Savile Row, opened his first boutique at No 35a with the brilliant Edward Sexton. With the financial and publicity assistance of, among others, Cilla Black and Peter Brown (one of the Beatles’ management team), Nutter was the right man in the right place, strutting about in a gorgeous, ridiculous era peopled by characters such as Michael Fish, who sold silk kipper ties from his eponymous Clifford Street boutique in the shape of actual kippers. Nutter, a “comely youth from Edgware”, north London, soon rose to the challenge, producing outfits that were “an eccentric mix of Lord Emsworth, the Great Gatsby and Bozo the Clown”. It is no surprise that the likes of Lennon and Jagger were aficionados; nor that, after quickly scaling the heights, Nutter went into decline, irrelevance giving way to ill health. A lesser writer might have made the story of his downfall depressing, but Richardson has an eye for telling and hilarious details. We learn, for instance, that for Elton John’s (first) wedding in 1984, Nutter created 20 wildly exuberant outfits, “two of each, in case of any mishap, in a wide range of primary colours”. It is David who gives the story a wider dimension. He was nicknamed “Dawn Black” for his habit of partying throughout the night in New York, though he was a more introverted and less reckless character than his brother, photographing the stars of the day, but remaining an observer rather than a participant in bacchanalian pursuits. But then he could hardly help seeming less colourful than Tommy – a man whose idea of making a splash was to throw himself into the Thames after being ejected from a party at the Tate. House of Nutter, Richardson’s first book, is a fine match of author and subject. He writes with flair and erudition, making extensive use of interviews with David, and bringing something new to the evocation of an era that might seem overfamiliar and cliched to many. In fact, barring the absence of an index, it’s hard to find fault with this thoroughly enjoyable glimpse into high fashion and low life. • House of Nutter: The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row by Lance Richardson is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (£25).

Numbers of common pochard, a duck species at risk of global extinction, have fallen substantially over the past 30 years, a decline partly attributed to the fact that they eat some of the 5,000 tonnes of lead pellets discarded in the countryside by people shooting game, according to the Lead Ammunition Group (LAG). Other species affected by lead poisoning include the grey partridge, which is also on the RSPB’s “red list” of threatened species, as well as the golden eagle, common buzzard and red kite, the LAG says. The warning comes in a major new report by the LAG, an expert panel set up by the government in 2010, which says up to 400,000 wildfowl a year may suffer from lead poisoning, causing up to 100,000 deaths. Recent research cited in the report shows that lead can be toxic at lower levels than previously thought. More than 600,000 people go shooting in the UK each year, part of an industry worth about £2bn. They typically use lead shot to hunt birds, a practice known as wildfowling. The shot scatters when it leaves the gun barrel, and a large proportion falls to the ground. Birds eat the lead shot, mistaking it for the gravel their gizzards need to digest food. The report says new research shows that birds wounded by lead shot also suffer lead poisoning. By using steel shot instead, shooting-related industries could save up to £16m a year, research indicates. “Replacing all leaded ammunition, certainly for live quarry shooting, would be more effective, cheaper and more straightforward,” said John Swift, the LAG chairman, who added that Forest Enterprise Scotland had already started to use lead-free ammunition for culling the rapidly growing population of red deer. “This ensures that a very considerable amount of venison is going on to the market lead-free,” Swift said. “Forest Enterprise Scotland have been using this and found it entirely satisfactory. There are those who say it’s better than lead ammunition.” Some shooters dislike steel shot as it has a shorter range and can’t be used in antique shotguns, but Swift, a former chief executive of the British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC), said that most serious shooters had more than one gun. “There are significant gains to be had from engaging constructively,” he said. “I cannot see why the shooting world is so resistant to change. A lot of people now realise that this is an issue which the shooting world has got out of step on.” The LAG was set up by Defra and the Food Standards Agency to advise the government on the effects of lead on wildlife. It reported in 2015 that about 10,000 children grew up in households eating game killed with lead ammunition, putting them at risk of brain damage. But LAG members from organisations that support shooting resigned before the report was released, saying it was not based on sound scientific evidence. The government responded to the report by slipping out an announcement by the then environment secretary, Liz Truss, on the day that Theresa May entered Downing Street, saying that the report “did not show that the impacts of lead ammunition were significant enough to justify changing current policy”. Since then there have been significant moves outside the UK to ban lead ammunition. The European Chemicals Agency is consulting on plans to phase out lead ammunition across all wetland habitats in the EU, with a decision by the European commision due next year. The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust’s head of communications, Peter Morris, welcomed the report, saying it showed there was “great global consensus and political momentum to stop poisoning wildlife. He added: “We’d love the UK to catch up with that international enthusiasm to clean up the countryside and parts of the shooting industry are already embracing that ambition. Lead ammunition was somehow dragged into pro- and anti-shooting debates, with some on both sides mistaking its phasing-out as a potential thin end of a wedge for the sport. But ironically, going lead-free would be a win-win. It would lead to healthier live wild birds and healthier game meat too.” BASC spokesman Garry Doolan disputed the new LAG report, saying that it was acting “in an entirely lobbying capacity”. “The UK has acted to protect vulnerable species by legislating on the use of lead shot for wildfowl and over wetlands,” he said. “There are existing lead shot regulations in the UK, specifically designed to protect the species mentioned.” He added that recent estimates showed that the common pochard population in the UK had more than doubled in 2017, although over the last 25 years numbers have falled by 67%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/27/britain-follow-european-ban-single-use-plastic","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T04:59:16Z","webTitle":"Gove urged to follow Europe with ban on single-use plastic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/27/britain-follow-european-ban-single-use-plastic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/27/britain-follow-european-ban-single-use-plastic","fields":{"headline":"Gove urged to follow Europe with ban on single-use plastic","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The EU is to ban plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery, cotton buds and balloon sticks in a bid to tackle the rising tide of plastic waste, a move that has prompted urgent calls for the environment secretary, Michael Gove, to guarantee that the UK will follow Brussels’ lead after Brexit. The restrictions on “single-use” plastic will be launched on Monday by the European commission as part of its plan to ensure that 55% of all plastic is recycled by 2030. About 80-85% of all litter in the oceans is plastic, and half of that is made up of throw-away items such as plastic straws. A leaked draft of the commission’s proposals spells out a step-change in the bloc’s attitude to plastic waste. But it is likely to come too late to be part of the bulk of EU legislation due to be transposed into UK law. The draft document, to be unveiled by commission vice-president Frans Timmermans, states: “Single-use plastic products for which suitable and more sustainable alternatives are readily available should no longer be placed on the union market to limit their impact on the environment.” The plastic items targeted by the ban are cotton buds (except for swabs for medical purposes), forks, knives, spoons, chopsticks, plates, straws, beverage stirrers and sticks for balloons. Where there are no readily available alternatives, such as plastic fast-food containers, the EU says member states must respect a “polluter pays” principle. Companies making such items will have to cover the costs of waste management and the clean-up of marine waste, along with measures to raise awareness to prevent and reduce such litter. EU countries will also have to achieve a significant reduction in the use of such containers and throw-away cups within six years of the proposal being written into national law. The EU would like member states to use deposit schemes to ensure that 90% of plastic bottles are collected separately by 2025. Caroline Lucas MP, co-leader of the Green party, has called on Gove to meet the EU’s standards on plastic waste after Brexit. Gove had a public Twitter spat with Timmermans earlier this year after claiming that EU legislation might get in the way of a UK ban on plastic straws. Lucas told the Observer: “Once again the EU is way ahead of the UK when it comes to the pace and direction of protecting our environment. We all know that single-use plastic needs to be eradicated but all we’ve got from this government is a vague promise of action on ‘unavoidable’ waste by the end of 2042. “If Brexit goes ahead, we need clarity and certainty that our environment will not be sold down the river and that means a watchdog with real teeth. That’s how to help ensure Britain outside of the EU doesn’t slide back into its old reputation as the dirty man of Europe.” ClientEarth chemicals lawyer Alice Bernard said: “These measures are essential to stop our wasteful use of plastics and an important first step to tackle plastic pollution. We hope the next steps will be addressing the issue of dangerous chemicals in plastics – such as bisphenols.” Last week the United Nations warned that Britain’s reputation was at risk over plans for a new post-Brexit environmental watchdog which would not have the power to take the government to court. Despite Gove’s promise of a “green Brexit”, the Treasury is said to have resisted giving the new watchdog the same powers as the European commission because of the potential impact on post-Brexit growth. Earlier this month the UK and five other nations were referred to the European court of justice for failing to tackle illegal levels of air pollution. The ECJ has the power to impose large fines. Bas Eickhout, the Dutch Green MEP, said: “Whether the deal will be concluded before or after Brexit remains to be seen. But given the urgency of tackling our plastic waste problem, I expect the UK to implement this policy anyway. Theresa May already showed she is happy to implement EU plastic policies when she proudly presented her policies against single-use plastic bags, so I expect she won’t do any less on all single-use plastic policies.” The EU first outlined its intention to ban straws as part of a wider strategy in January ahead of the publication of draft legislation expected on Monday. In April, Gove announced a consultation, rather than draft legislation, adding that he was unsure of the legal basis of such a ban. A government spokesman said, however, that they believed the UK was leading the way. He said: “The UK set an example with our proposals earlier this year to ban plastic straws, cotton buds and stirrers and it’s good to see the EU following our lead.“While we want to see a reduction much more quickly than the 6 years proposed for some products and want to see other European nations follow our ban on plastic micro-beads, any action to reduce plastic waste is of course welcome.“As we deliver a Green Brexit, the UK will continue to show global leadership in setting even higher environmental standards.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/25/absence-of-swing-baffles-anderson-broad-england-pakistan","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T18:20:14Z","webTitle":"Absence of swing leaves Anderson and Broad as baffled as the scientists | Andy Bull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/25/absence-of-swing-baffles-anderson-broad-england-pakistan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/25/absence-of-swing-baffles-anderson-broad-england-pakistan","fields":{"headline":"Absence of swing leaves Anderson and Broad as baffled as the scientists","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"No one really knows why a cricket ball swings. It is a problem that foxes the finest scientific minds, as much of a conundrum as the true size of the universe, the life-span of a proton and quite why James Hildreth has never been picked for England. Oh, the mechanics of the movement are clear enough. That is all to do with what they call laminar flow, the way the air passes over the two sides of the ball. But the when and the where of it, why one ball should swing and another not, why certain grounds should be especially conducive to it, whether the weather has any effect or what that effect might be – all that is a mystery. Cricketers say it is to do with how hot and humid the day is. But a lot of scientific studies have been done to determine just how much difference those two things make to the trajectory of a ball and the answer is none at all. The most recent one, at Sheffield Hallam in 2012, concluded that, if the atmospheric conditions do have anything to do with when and whether the ball swings, it is not because of the humidity but something else altogether. “It is proposed that new avenues for investigation should focus on how differing levels of cloud cover may affect localised air turbulence.” Which sounds like academic for “we don’t know”. England did not come any closer to an answer on Friday morning. They spent a lot of the day wrestling with the swing problem and did not come any closer to solving it than the engineers and scientists at Sheffield Hallam. Pakistan’s novice attack made the ball hoop around on Thursday. They have 40 caps between them. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad have played more Test matches here than that, never mind in the rest of the world. The conditions were similar, thick, sticky and still, but they could not get the ball to move nearly so much as Pakistan had. England expected it to swing. Broad and Anderson tried to do it. Anderson was hit for a couple of fine drives by Haris Sohail as he floated the ball up full to give it every chance to do its thing. He got so fed up with it all that he banged the next ball in short and hit Sohail in the ribs. England did a lot of that as the morning wore on. Once they realised the ball was not swinging they quickly decided to switch to plan B, which meant peppering the batsmen with bouncers and pestering the umpires to switch this ball for another, one that might move in the air. The plan worked on the batsmen better than it did on the umpires. Mark Wood softened Sohail up with a couple of bouncers from around the wicket before he had him caught at slip off a ball that moved away down the slope. Ben Stokes bounced out Asad Shafiq, caught at slip, Sarfraz Ahmed, caught at fine leg, Shadab Khan, caught behind, and also forced Babar Azam to retire hurt by hitting him on the forearm. This is not exactly how play on a cloudy May day at Lord’s is meant to go. It all meant that England’s new young spinner Dom Bess had a lot more to do in his first Test bowling spell than one might have guessed at the start of play. Anderson and Broad are a couple of old Eeyores but Bess, 20, is supposed to be full of Tiggerish enthusiasm for the game, which is good because he will have needed every last little bit as he wheeled through plenty of thankless overs on Fridayafternoon, without so much as a sniff of spin to work with. Bess has played 16 first-class games and none of them was at Lord’s. He has not done much bowling outside Taunton, where the wickets tend to turn. So it felt as if England were asking an awful lot of him here. Bess went about it all enthusiastically enough. He has a busy run-up. He makes a brisk, determined march to the crease, cocked forward at the waist, like a geography teacher cutting through the playground to break up a fight on the far side of the yard. He works his wrist as he goes, as if readying it to grab one of the boys by the shoulders. There is a lot going on before his delivery, then, but less after it. Anderson and Stokes at least found a hint of swing from the Nursery End as the day wore on but Bess did not get a single ball to turn off the straight. It did not fizz so much as float. Bess stuck at it, though, from over and around the wicket. The Pakistani batsmen worked him this way and that and looked troubled by him only when they tried something too ambitious. Bess will hope he has more to work with in the fourth innings. The way the match has shaped so far, England will have to bat a lot better if he is going to get his wish."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/may/26/england-v-pakistan-first-test-day-three-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T18:05:06Z","webTitle":"England v Pakistan: first Test, day three – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/may/26/england-v-pakistan-first-test-day-three-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/may/26/england-v-pakistan-first-test-day-three-live","fields":{"headline":"England v Pakistan: first Test, day three – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here you go. So, at last, England win a session, and all because Ed Smith opted to go west in search of a young man to bowl some spin. Dom Bess hasn’t taken a Test wicket yet, but he has made a fifty – and proved that he can stand the heat in a kitchen which, when he walked in, had all the smoke alarms going off at once. He has been expertly shepherded by a more senior son of Somerset, Jos Buttler. Their partnership for the seventh wicket is an unbeaten 125, which is more than double the next best England stand in this match (57). Pakistan were on fire in mid-afternoon, but the evening belongs to England, who lead by 56 and live to fight another session, at least. Thanks for your company: the emails have been as entertaining as the ebb-and-flow. 78th over: England 235-6 (Buttler 66, Bess 55) The final over of the day: Bess facing Amir, keeping him out, keeping him out – and then creaming a four through the covers off the very last ball. Ah, the audacity of youth. “Tim.” Yes, John Starbuck. “I don’t use any of those terms myself [75th over], so have no preference. There really ought to be a website for arcane cricket-related insults. Perhaps there is? My main gripe though is people thinking my surname ends in a S as well as starting with one.” Ouch – I plead guilty, but have done some hasty corrections now. “I’m not a coffee company (even though I’ve had a discount there now and again on the strength of it). I believe they picked the name because they’d read Moby-Dick, in which Mr Starbuck is the First Mate, whose gloomy predictions are never believed but all come true.” Classy. 77th over: England 231-6 (Buttler 66, Bess 51) Faheem produces a beauty out of nowhere, jagging away from Buttler’s bat, but it’s too good to find the edge. Robert Wilson, seeing Simon Horbury in full flow, is back for another bite of the cherry. “Yup, that is a top effort from Bess. Tyro blitheness and self-assurance are a nice little booster package but I’m guessing a debut fifty from a near school-age spinner in a sticky enough situation has to be founded on a base of strongmindedness. That’s Aussie level dogged. Respect.” 76th over: England 230-6 (Buttler 66, Bess 50) Mo Amir returns, which sounds like an attacking move – but Sarfraz gives him just the one slip, as if fretting about the deficit already (it’s 51). Buttler clips Amir for two. Bess may well steal the headlines, but Buttler has been terrific, calm and sober, adjusting to the red ball, while also grabbing every run on offer. “What do you think England need?” says Nasser, and the person he’s asking is Ian Botham, who knows a bit about improbable reversals. “200,” he says, firmly, as if he’s forgotten the time when 130 was enough. 75th over: England 228-6 (Buttler 64, Bess 50) So Bess passes the little test set by Mr Hussain, the deputy head, and then Buttler pulls Faheem for four. Nasser turns his beady eye on the fielders: “Pakistan starting to look a bit ragged, for the first time.” Simon Horbury is back, picking up on John Starbuck’s point from the 73rd over. “The Chinese Cut was our name for the Harrow Drive when I were a young ’un. Now which of those would Mr Starbucks prefer?” That is superb. A gift on leg stump, a confident tuck – but Bess has earned the freebie by playing with great aplomb after coming out into a crisis at 110-6. This is a 20-year-old we’re talking about, on his Lord’s debut, never mind his Test debut. What a moment. 74th over: England 220-6 (Buttler 57, Bess 49) Bess pulls for a single, Buttler-style, and Nasser Hussain says, “This is the only time I get twitchy, when a young player approaches a milestone.” Come off it Nass, you get twitchy all the time. But point taken: Bess, who has sailed through a proper test of his temperament, now faces another, smaller one – can he play normally for the next few minutes? 73rd over: England 219-6 (Buttler 57, Bess 48) A few more singles off Shadab, including one taken off the last ball by Bess, who is no longer being shielded at all by his senior partner. “A Harrow drive?” says John Starbuck. “That sounds like a public-school educated denigration, just like the Chinaman used to be, along with the Staffordshire Cut and the ball going Irish.” It may well be – but let’s be fair to the public schools, they’ve produced many fine cricketers, including Buttler and Bess. 72nd over: England 216-6 (Buttler 56, Bess 46) Abbas continues, and Bess picks up another single with a fluent flick to fine leg. He looks as if he could end up in the top six, just as long as he remembers to take some wickets. An email arrives from Adam Roberts. “These were Ed’s two out-of-left-field selections, so maybe .... Of course, with his one 1st-class wicket this season, we should have known Dom was being picked for his batting. “Am I alone,” he wonders, “in my super-immaturity, in saying ‘Yer face’ every time someone says ‘Shadab’?” 71st over: England 213-6 (Buttler 55, Bess 44) Shadab goes round the wicket and Buttler kicks him away. The partnership is 103, the lead 34. Simon Horbury. meanwhile, is on a roll. “Is it possible that England have adopted the idea that my, now very old, cricket masters occasionally had and have decided to reverse the batting order of the ‘best batsmen’? Might I suggest next time we do it genuinely and open with No 11?” Just don’t expect Jimmy Anderson to thank you. 70th over: England 212-6 (Buttler 55, Bess 43) Abbas returns, and Bess greets him with an imperious square drive, off the back foot. That could have been another off spinner: Carl Hooper. Buttler then plays a rare false shot – looks like a Harrow drive, turns out to be four leg byes – and that’s the hundred partnership. WinViz reckons England now have a chance of victory – a 2 per cent chance, that is. Mike Atherton and Wasim Akram both feel it’s a bit more than that. 69th over: England 201-6 (Buttler 53, Bess 38) Bess takes another of those tight singles. He needs to be getting through to the close, not committing hara kiri. There are about 40 minutes to go. Richard Morris is back. “I knew it would all be fine!” Meanwhile, in other news … Buttler eases Shadab into the off side for a single, and England are 200-6, which is a whole lot better than 110-6. Anyone daring to dream, apart from Tom van der Gucht? 68th over: England 199-6 (Buttler 52, Bess 37) Hasan bounces Bess and concedes a wide, which may have been a bit harsh. Pakistan, whose Plan A worked so well, seem unsure about Plan B. A few overs ago, Sarfraz raced up to the bowler’s end to remonstrate with Hasan, though, to his (Sarfraz’s) credit, he didn’t send him into the wilderness. 67th over: England 197-6 (Buttler 51, Bess 37) Sky show highlights of Butter’s fifty, and there have been plenty – elegant strokes, evenly divided between extra cover and midwicket. “He’s a game-changer,” says Wasim Akram. Takes one to know one. Well, this is a rare sight: an Englishman waving his bat in the air. Buttler clips Shadab to midwicket, where a dive doesn’t quite prevent the four. A lovely shot and a fine innings. 66th over: England 192-6 (Buttler 46, Bess 37) A few more singles off Hasan, and these two have put on 81, easily England’s best stand of the match. After an understandably stodgy start, they’ve been rolling along at four an over. Someone had to say it, and Simon Horbury has. “Make Bess captain... It would be no more ludicrous than having a match of 100 balls per innings, with the last over consisting of ten balls.” 65th over: England 189-6 (Buttler 44, Bess 36) Bess lives dangerously against Shadab, surviving an LBW shout as he misses the googly, and then prodding at thin air when the leg-break arrives. But he survives. Confident, plucky, resourceful, a fizzing fielder: there have been worse picks, and that’s just among the fringe spinners. Hugh Odling-Smee has a retort for Gary Naylor (64th over). “Well Michael was a better batsman than captain, so he would know.” 64th over: England 189-6 (Buttler 44, Bess 36) England startle the crowd by going into the lead, thanks to another punchy cover drive from Bess, who adds a cut for four and a swat for three as Hasan offers too much width. These two have sailed past the rocks of total ignominy, but real hope is still some way off. And here’s Gary Naylor. “Dom Bess is reminding me of Michael Atherton’s rather terse description of Chris Schofield – ‘He’s a better batsman than bowler’.” 63rd over: England 177-6 (Buttler 43, Bess 25) Shadab goes for a few comfy singles. The OBO’s loyal readers, like a few people in the crowd, may have nodded off. 62nd over: England 174-6 (Buttler 41, Bess 24) Buttler plays another of his measured pulls for a single. Don’t the umpires realise that having drinks in mid-over messes with our system? 62nd over: England 173-6 (Buttler 40, Bess 24) Buttler picks up two thanks to another misfield, in the covers, and the deficit is down to six. It’s not the end of the over, but there’s a suspicion that the ball is being changed for going out of shape, and that’s drinks. England are now flirting with respectability, but it’s surely too little, too late. 61st over: England 171-6 (Buttler 38, Bess 24) Shadab returns with his leg spin, and when he tries a rare googly, Bess eases it for four to third man. He is beginning to look like A Find. Here’s David Acaster, joining the captaincy debate. “I would make the left bail captain,” he says, “if I thought it would restore Root’s batting.” Well, I know what you mean, but he’s making just as many runs as he was in the ranks – just getting to 50 all the time and 100 less often. 60th over: England 166-6 (Buttler 37, Bess 20) Bess keeps out Mo Amir, in a way that his elders and betters could not, and then he plays the shot of his day, a delicious off drive, on the up, that brings a ripple of Lordly appreciation. 59th over: England 162-6 (Buttler 37, Bess 16) A single to each batsman off Faheem, and a lovely flick-hook from Buttler, which goes for four on the strength of a misfield from Abbas. That was old-school Pakistan. And so the 50 partnership comes up, a credit to both batsmen, and to Ed Smith – the first time his bolder picks have come good. “Buttler captain?” splutters Simon Horbury, a propos the 56th over. “1. You’re having a laugh. 2. Might happen sooner than later.” 58th over: England 156-6 (Buttler 32, Bess 15) Buttler clips Amir for a single, fearlessly handing him four balls to have a go at Bess, who has his sensible head on and survives. Tom van der Gucht is back for more. “Drastic times like this call for drastic measures,” he declares, “and I’d like to think I’m from the Ed Smith school of decisive action. Having given it some consideration, after this test has been completed I’d drop Malan, select Morgan and give him the captaincy, swap Stoneman for Roy and tell Bayliss to focus on the white-ball cricket and ask Farbrace to step up and coach the test team for the foreseeable future.” At the risk of sticking my neck out, I can’t see all of that happening. But Tom is right that something needs to be done about Stoneman, who looked lost today, and has already been sacked as the short-leg fielder. 57th over: England 155-6 (Buttler 31, Bess 15) Bess wafts, for once, at Faheem, and gets a jammy four that might have been a catch to third slip. Sarfraz’s fault for going on the defensive when he’s right on top. That brings up the 150, and Bess’s first foray into double figures. He cashes in with a much better shot, a cover drive for four. The deficit is down to 24 now. 56th over: England 147-6 (Buttler 31, Bess 7) Amir comes round the wicket, looking for the killer reverse swing that Wasim Akram, who is commentating, brought to the 1992 World Cup final. And Buttler sees him off, happy to play out a maiden. Buttler has quietly manipulated the strike, facing 54 balls to Bess’s 33, without appearing to distrust him. Practice for the day when Buttler finds himself captaining England. 55th over: England 147-6 (Buttler 31, Bess 7) Buttler takes a rather tight single into the covers, but gets himself out of a hole with a sprint. He and Bess have done what ministers can only dream of, and halved the deficit. Aha, here comes Amir. 54th over: England 146-6 (Buttler 30, Bess 7) Buttler picks up another two and a one off Abbas, and in between he may be dropped behind by Sarfraz, who is standing up – a very tough chance as Buttler nicked an inswinger. Buttler has earned that with his positivity, and his unflustered fluency. I was just wondering where John Starbuck was, when this turned up. “Those of us who have followed England cricket for a while are not masochists, simply resigned. We know things have to get really bad before they can get better, so it’s just part of a very long cycle. I well recall my emotional state at Headingley 1981, so I know that Hope springs eternal. She’s a deity to whom our emotions are sacrificed.” Nicely put. 53rd over: England 143-6 (Buttler 27, Bess 7) Sarfraz makes a change, but it’s Faheem, not Amir, who returns. Buttler picks up a couple with a leg glance off Faheem, and a single with a glide to third man. The game is suddenly feeling sleepy, although if any team can wake themselves up with a start, it’s Pakistan. “Afternoon Tim.” Afternoon Simon McMahon. “If Buttler can cut loose here and make, say, 149, giving the England bowlers, say, 130 to bowl at, then you never know I suppose. Though you do, really.” Ha. “Speaking of Cambridge,” says Ben Reilly, “as somebody who has a ticket for tomorrow and is currently at the Cambridge beer festival, I really hope for it to be over soon so I can get properly drunk without worrying about the morning.” Priorities. 52nd over: England 140-6 (Buttler 24, Bess 7) Bess, getting a bit carried away, goes for a big cut off Abbas and misses, but recovers with a sensible push for a single. Buttler then gets a leading edge which pops up into empty space in the covers and brings him a streaky three. Here’s Tom van der Gucht. “I’ve been out for a pub lunch and spent some time sat in the sun, but I don’t think this game is over yet... If Buttler can tap into his IPL form and cream out a quickfire 150 backed up by Bess, Broad and Wood all cashing in with 30s against a tiring attack, we’d still be in with a sniff of a chance. Especially if Anderson could hang around for an obstinate 2-hour-long 12...” Well, that answers the question from the 44th over about dreamers or masochists. 51st over: England 135-6 (Buttler 20, Bess 6) Dom Bess guides a two to backward point and moves to his highest Test score. Hasan responds with a feisty bouncer, which Bess does well to jag out of the way of, and a yorker, which he digs out. Well played the kid, as Jose Mourinho would say. Robert Wilson is back, answering my question from the 46th over. “Which university, you say? Put it like this; if you plough through the archives of Cambridge University’s august sporting records, you will find my name twice. Being the first soccer player to be sent off in their entire history is all very well but I think that getting sacked from the St Catharine’s Novices Rowing Eight for cheating on the dawn run to the river by taking a taxi was my finest moment.” 50th over: England 133-6 (Buttler 20, Bess 4) A single to each batsman, off Abbas, and a clip for two from Buttler. There hasn’t been a wicket for a full eight overs. Sarfraz must be tempted to summon the extra snap of Amir. 49th over: England 129-6 (Buttler 17, Bess 3) Buttler is seeing the ball well and getting a big stride in to stymie the swing. “Certainly England are not awful,” says Ram Prasad, “but young guns from Pakistan have come good in this match and 4 half centuries have hurt England a lot. Just that the impetus to propel the score when the chips are down, is lacking from Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes. Particularly Jos as he is red hot from a terrific IPL stint. Could he prove me wrong today?” I’m not sure impetus is what’s lacking, especially from those two – they both have tremendous energy. What’s been missing is nous, from the moment Joe Root declined to bowl first on Thursday morning. 48th over: England 128-6 (Buttler 16, Bess 3) Bess finally comes to the party, albeit unintentionally, as, facing Abbas, he tries to withdraw the bat and gets a bottom edge to third man for three. They all count. “Desperate times, desperate measures,” says Jon Millard. “Can we still call up Chris Cowdrey?” 47th over: England 124-6 (Buttler 15, Bess 0) After a wary start, Buttler finds his groove with a front-foot pull off Hasan, and celebrates with two fours through the off side – a glide and a cover drive. Given something to cheer at last, the crowd go wild, or as wild as they go at Lord’s. Here’s Dave Seare, with an email that’s more of a one-act play. “The phone rings at Lord’s. ‘Er, hello.’ ‘Good morning, I’d like to speak to [insert England player name] please.’ ‘I’m sorry Sir, he’s just gone out to bat.’ ‘That’s ok, I’ll wait...’ Tip your waiter, we’re here all week.” 46th over: England 112-6 (Buttler 3, Bess 0) We have a run! Buttler hooks, or swats, Abbas for a controlled single to fine leg. Bess, again, keeps the straight ones out. He looks like finishing his first Test without any wickets, but he has shown a good temperament. “Dear Tim,” says Robert Wilson. “I’d hate to be guilty of reflexive Celtic Fringe anti-Englishness. I love you guys. You fed, clothed, housed and educated this particular Irish urchin. Then you sent me to your best university. Thanks a bunch. That was incredibly nice of you. And has confirmed my decided Anglophilia. So it is with great pain and deep sympathy that I point out that we are quite clearly MUCH better than you at Test cricket.” Nice one. So which university? However grim things get, we can always rely on Gary Naylor. “Writing a quiz recently,” he begins, classically, “I recalled that Zaheer Abbas made 240 at The Oval in 1974 (I was allocated locker 240 when I went to the big school soon after). In 44 years watching cricket, this feels as low an ebb as at any time since. 4-0, 58 all out, The 100 and now this.” It seems we’ve reached peak Naylor. So what do you reckon – have England been awful, or just not as good as Pakistan? Sarfraz and his young team have given the sort of performance that Jurgen Klopp is planning for this evening: an underdog masterclass. OK, they’re not up against Real Madrid. But England are strong at home, and normally formidable in May – they’ve never lost a Test that has started this early in the summer. Send us an email (and if you sent one a bit earlier, please send again to tim.delisle at gmail, as my Guardian email is down) or a tweet. 45th over: England 111-6 (Buttler 2, Bess 0) Another maiden, from Hasan Ali to Dom Bess, who manages to play a solid straight bat to some naggingly accurate deliveries. And that’s tea. A moment that usually brings balm to an English brow, but here it’s more a case of rampant embarrassment. After England had finally had a good hour, Pakistan bounced back with a sensational one, taking four wickets for 19 in no time. England are minus 68 for 6, and the only doubt is whether Jos Buttler can bash a few defiant fours and make Pakistan bat again. 44th over: England 111-6 (Buttler 2, Bess 0) A maiden from Mohammed Abbas to Jos Buttler, who was standing outside his crease to reduce the risk of LBW – so Sarfraz Ahmed came up to the stumps, adding sheer courage to his collection of strengths as a keeper-captain. “Why the doom &amp; gloom?” said Richard Morris, a few minutes ago. “Root will bat safely for hours, Buttler will survive comedy moment after comedy moment, we’ll have a lead of 150, 8 for from Sir James, Ed Smith will look like a genius, all is right in the world.” Are cricket fans dreamers, masochists, or both? 43rd over: England 111-6 (Buttler 2, Bess 0) Well, this is a rout. And if it weren’t for Simon Burnton, you wouldn’t have heard about it because I’ve been having almost as many technical problems as England’s batsmen. Big thanks to Simon, and many commiserations to Ed Smith on finding, like a few others before him, that he has taken over a shaky ship. 42nd over: England 110-6 (Buttler 1, Bess 0) Root has now got 10 half-centuries since his last ton. That was a fine delivery from Abbas, and given that he is the only Englishman to even offer some token resistance here it seems unfair to be overly critical, but that’s not so good. Anyway, here, finally, is Tim. Bye again! Curtains. Pakistan think so, the umpire thinks so, and Root has to review it in the circumstances. 41st over: England 110-5 (Root 68, Buttler 1) Hasan Ali is back. Root, whose innings has so far been exemplary, drives through the covers for four. A single gives Buttler half the over to deal with, and he is so committed to being unButtlerish that he leaves the ball whenever he can, even when he very nearly can’t - the last goes two inches wide of off stump, too close for comfort. 40th over: England 105-5 (Root 63, Buttler 1) Pakistan know that Buttler will do as Buttler does, so move three slips into position as Mohammad Amir takes aim. A maiden is the almost inevitable result. But the slips very nearly got some action, Amir’s final delivery a peach that tempts Buttler into a drive and zips just past the edge. 39th over: England 105-5 (Root 63, Buttler 1) That is a ludicrous way to get out in this situation. That dismissal was so soft it was practically liquid. It was a gaseous dismissal. A damp fart of a dismissal. The question now is whether England can make Pakistan bat again. Stokes mishits, sends the ball looping apologetically into the hands of the man at midwicket. He hangs his head. He shakes his head. He takes his head back to the dressing room. 38th over: England 103-4 (Root 62, Stokes 9) By the way, it’s still Simon here, banging on while Tim sorts out a few technical issues. And Mohammad Amir is also still going, now seven overs into his second spell. 37th over: England 100-4 (Root 61, Stokes 8) England reach triple figures with a splendid shot from Stokes, spanking the ball through midwicket. He had at that stage his two of the three deliveries he’d faced for four. But then he’s very nearly out next ball, which sends him back into his shell. Actually the way the ball flew off the fielder’s foot could only really have happened if it was already heading upwards, rather than down, but it was very hard to tell in real time. The ball bounced a foot before the fielder at short leg, and the TV directors had the perfect angle to show it. That would have been a fluke of the cruellest kind for a team already struggling. The ball flew off the bat, into a fielder, into the air and was caught. But did it, perchance, at some stage hit the ground? We’re going to find out! 36th over: England 95-4 (Root 60, Stokes 4) England had half a good session. At drinks, they had a semblance of stability, a foothold in the game at last. Moments later, it’s gone. The delivery that did for Bairstow was a cracker, and an absolute nightmare for a new batsman, moving quite late, and quite a lot. Stokes then comes in and cracks his first ball past square leg for four, but the hole England are hiding in just got a whole lot deeper. And another one! A bit of inswing there, and it flies inside the bat to clip middle and off! That’s edged, and two balls after drinks Malan has gone! 35th over: England 91-2 (Root 60, Malan 12) Malan sweeps the ball but not off the middle or particularly near it; the ball goes in the air but over the fielder and away for four, his first boundary of the day and finally taking him, after 46 deliveries, out of single figures. And that’s drinks, at which point I’m going to hand over to Tim de Lisle. You can drop him an email here. Bye! 34th over: England 85-2 (Root 59, Malan 7) It’s a good day for the Roots. 33rd over: England 82-2 (Root 56, Malan 7) Shadab bowls a full toss, by a margin his worst delivery of the innings, and Root hammers it through midwicket for four. After 62 balls he had scored 22; 31 deliveries later he had his half-century. 32nd over: England 77-2 (Root 51, Malan 7) Fifty up for Root! Again third man is his aim, and this time the ball goes between the slips and gully and reaches the rope! That’s Root’s sixth half-century in his last nine Test innings; on only one of those occasions has he scored more than 61. “Can’t disagree with the positive assessments of the demeanour and general niceness of the Pakistan team,” writes Brian Withington, “but do they really have to be quite so unnecessarily competent at playing the game too?” 31st over: England 72-2 (Root 46, Malan 7) Root tries another nurdle to third man but fluffs his lines, and comes pretty close to chopping into his stumps. Instead the ball runs through Sarfraz’s legs and he gets four. 30th over: England 66-2 (Root 43, Malan 6) Root takes a couple from the last delivery. There hasn’t been a maiden since lunch, with England very slightly picking up the pace, scoring a positively freewheeling 29 runs off 10 overs. 29th over: England 64-2 (Root 39, Malan 6) Shadab bowls, Malan leaves and Asad Shafiq at short leg diverts the ball very gently back onto the stumps. Pakistan celebrate, and the bails came off so slowly and unobtrusively for a while it’s not clear why, but replays eventually show that Malan’s toe was just about grounded. “Completely agree with Jon Salisbury,” writes Jimbob on Twitter. “This Pakistan team are ever so lovely, have been ever since the hero that is Misbah took over.” 28th over: England 63-2 (Root 38, Malan 6) After a five-over spell at the start of the innings, Mohammad Amir is back for more, and England take some more sharp runs. This time Malan runs two but the second was a little optimistic - he grounds his bat not a moment too soon, and a direct hit (and it didn’t miss by much) would have done for him. 27th over: England 61-2 (Root 38, Malan 4) Shadab gets a lot of turn, and it goes past Malan’s bat, past his pads, past the stumps, clips Sarfraz’s gloves and the batsmen run three byes. “I know they’re winning but is this the nicest Pakistan team to tour here?” wonders Jon Salisbury. They certainly seem a delightful bunch, but perhaps a two-Test series isn’t long enough to build up proper enmity. 26th over: England 58-2 (Root 38, Malan 4) Hasan bowls, Root tries to drive through the covers but the ball clips the bottom of his bat and goes wide of third slip for four instead. 25th over: England 54-2 (Root 34, Malan 4) Shadab bowls, and Root cuts late for four. Fifteen of his 34 runs, including all his boundaries, have come with variations of that shot. 24th over: England 46-2 (Root 28, Malan 3) Malan pulls Hasan; it’s a handsome shot, but there’s a fielder in place to deal with it and he only gets a single. And then Root takes a silly single! He works the ball to cover and sets off, and Imam collects smartly and throws back to the striker’s end, where Malan had given up - it was either missing, or he was going to be out by a good six yards. It missed. 23rd over: England 44-2 (Root 26, Malan 2) Root cuts Shadab to third man for three. The first session was largely pretty slow, but they appear to have been thoroughly energised by their lunch. 22nd over: England 39-2 (Root 22, Malan 1) Crack! Hasan bowls short to Malan, who reacts late and can’t get his head out of the way. It smacks him on the side of the helmet, towards the front - so not on the side of the head - pretty effectively dismantling it. That is vicious. A physio comes on to assess the batsman’s health, but after an extended pause he dons a reassembled helmet and plays on. 21st over: England 38-2 (Root 22, Malan 1) Shadab gets the session started, and after five dot balls Malan tickles one to deep midwicket and takes a single. Four of his last six innings have brought six runs or fewer. The players are on their way back out. If Pakistan have the better of this session as well, the game is surely up. Another good session for Pakistan. Root has certainly taken his time, but is looking fairly assured. So, that’s something. 20th over: England 37-2 (Root 22, Malan 0) Hasan bowls, and at no point in the over does bat meet ball. 19th over: England 37-2 (Root 22, Malan 0) Root takes a single off the fourth ball, giving Shadab a couple of deliveries at the left-handed Malan, which he’s very excited about. A crowd of close fielders is brought in, but Malan comfortably survives. One more over before lunch. 18th over: England 36-2 (Root 21, Malan 0) Hasan bowls a bit wide, and Root drive it for an imperious four. “If Stoneman plays fully forward to that ball, he hits it with his bat, or it hits his pad outside the line of the stumps,” notes Gary Naylor. “It looked unplayable, turning and keeping low, but it wasn’t.” This is absolutely the case. Shadab has got the ball spinning pretty hard, but the batsman need not to make his life easy. 17th over: England 31-2 (Root 16, Malan 0) Some spin, then, from Shadab, and he almost immediately gets one to turn viciously of the rough and jag into Stoneman’s pad. The batsman pushes at the next one, nicks it, and it goes between the keeper and first slip and away for four. So he retreats cautiously, and instead of pushing forward to deal with the ball he lingers on the back foot and is then helpless when it turns and heads for the stumps. That’s well bowled, but technically poor from Stoneman. Shadab gives Stoneman a bit of a work-out, which ends with the batsman entirely unsure what to do with himself. So he does nothing very much, and the ball spins between bat and pad before clipping off stump! 16th over: England 26-1 (Stoneman 5, Root 15) Stoneman could be under just too much pressure to perform. With an average of 29, five 50s, no score above 60 and all sorts of question marks dangling over his head like angels’ halos, he desperately needs a decent knock. This may become that, but so far it has been very slow going. It’s another maiden, and Stoneman has taken 41 deliveries over his five runs. 15th over: England 26-1 (Stoneman 5, Root 15) Another maiden, from Faheem to Root. Abbas is currently the most expensive of the bowlers in this innings, with his five overs going for 1.6 runs each. 14th over: England 26-1 (Stoneman 5, Root 15) Hasan Ali, whose four wickets in the first innings included that of Root, is denied a first of this innings, though it did always look like it had pitched too wide. Then Stoneman pushes through the covers, and it takes a fine bit of fielding to limit the damage to two runs. It pitched outside leg. Quite a long way outside leg. The umpire says no. Pakistan say, why on earth not? 13th over: England 24-1 (Stoneman 3, Root 15) And Root sends his very next delivery to the rope! It’s a bit wide, and cut very nicely indeed. Indeed, it’s such a fine shot Root takes the remainder of the over off. 12th over: England 20-1 (Stoneman 3, Root 11) Hasan Ali comes on. Root has faced 33 balls in this innings, and 24 in the first, and has yet to score a boundary. The last time he batted twice in a Test and failed to score a boundary was in Sharjah in 2015, and before that it had only happened against New Zealand at Headingley the same year. He has already scored as many runs in this innings as in those four combined. 11th over: England 19-1 (Stoneman 3, Root 10) A change of bowling, and Faheem Ashraf comes on. His first over is a maiden, to Stoneman. 10th over: England 19-1 (Stoneman 3, Root 10) A strangled appeal from the bowler as the ball thunders into Root’s pad, but it was moving - quite a lot - across the batsman and heading wide of leg stump. Meanwhile, what is going on with the photo of Mohammad Abbas on his Cricinfo profile page? All his team-mates have delightful studio portraits, but his appears to have been stolen from 1976. 9th over: England 17-1 (Stoneman 2, Root 9) The pressure remains on. England are in survival mode, playing within themselves, reining in the aggression and the ambition. One run off the over. 8th over: England 16-1 (Stoneman 2, Root 8) Abbas bowls across the left-handed Stoneman, the ball moving a little off the slope, forcing a shot and a miss. 7th over: England 13-1 (Stoneman 2, Root 5) Amir and Abbas are both producing some excellent, disciplined, hostile bowling, with very little loose stuff for the batsmen to tuck into, and some good fielding in the deep when the batsmen threaten the boundary. It is all, in short, good stuff. The batsmen are therefore reliant on sharp running to keep the scoreboard ticking over, and they have already offered a couple of vague sniffs of a potential run-out. Then with his fifth delivery Amir finds the edge, but it lands short of second slip! 6th over: England 10-1 (Stoneman 0, Root 5) Root is hogging the strike here: for the second successive over he faces all six deliveries and gets a single off the last. 5th over: England 7-1 (Stoneman 0, Root 2) Amir spends most of the over bowling nicely across Root from round the wicket, but he gets his line wrong a couple of times: one is straight and wide of leg stump, and it flicks Root’s pad and goes down the ground for four leg byes, and the last is into the body and worked away for a single. 4th over: England 2-1 (Stoneman 0, Root 1) Both of these batsmen were out for four in the first innings. If there’s a silver lining to the cloud that is Cook’s premature departure, it’s that after scoring an attention-hogging 70 with his first knock he has at least shared round the ignominy (though his catching had already gone quite a long way towards doing that). 3rd over: England 1-1 (Stoneman 0, Root 0) A maiden from Amir. “Geoffrey Boycott has just said: ‘If I was in the dressing room mine would be a very short, sharp, speech, because I think people remember them better than talking forever for a long time,’” writes Ben Attenborough. “Inevitably Geoffrey then went on to talk for a very, very, long time about what he would say to the players.” 2nd over: England 1-1 (Stoneman 0, Root 0) Mohammad Abbas takes the ball at the other end. Might the manner of his dismissal add a little motivation for him? “Remind me - when did it become acceptable to bounce out a number 11?” wonders Ranil Dissanayake. “Didn’t England go all up in arms about this when they were getting it from Mitchell Johnson?” It was perhaps a little legtheorish. Anyway, he aims at the stumps, and is rapidly rewarded. Cook is trapped absolutely plumb in the second over of the day, and barely even considers a review before heading back to the pavilion! 1st over: England 1-0 (Cook 1, Stoneman 0) Mohammad Amir opens the bowling. With the sun shining and the pitch drier than it was in the first couple of days, these appear close to ideal batting conditions. But can England ignore the scoreboard and make hay? So, it begins. This is a big session for England: they have not been the better team for any of the match’s first six, a trend they need to reverse sharpish. So with Babar Azam unable to return to the crease, Pakistan’s first innings ends with their score very nearly double England’s. England need 350 runs at the very least from their second knock. Let’s see how that goes... Wood decides to aim for Abbas’s chin, rather than the stumps. The No11 does well to get out of the way of the first couple of bouncers, but the third is too low to be duckable and he instead fends it away with his glove, and Bairstow dives to his right to take the catch. 114th over: Pakistan 363-8 (Amir 24, Abbas 5) Abbas again uses gets off strike with a leg bye, and then blammo! Amir thumps the ball back down the ground for four! I’ve had several emails asking for the link to the BBC’s audio (only available to those outside the UK). Here it is: 113th over: Pakistan 356-8 (Amir 19, Abbas 4) At the other end, Amir seems keen most of all on sticking around. As a result, Wood bowls a maiden. 112th over: Pakistan 356-8 (Amir 19, Abbas 4) Broad bowls one short, and Abbas clubs it away to the long-on boundary to equal his all-time top score in quite literally a stroke. It was also a no-ball. A couple of deliveries later he has a totally wild swing and gets only a little bat on the ball, enough to keep it away from both stumps and defenders. Still, Abbas’s batting philosophy is clear: go big or go home. 111th over: Pakistan 351-8 (Amir 19, Abbas 0) Mohammed Abbas (top score in nine Test innings: 4*), is on strike, and he survives five deliveries before one flicks off a pad and they run a leg bye. St John’s Wood is bathed in sunshine, with flags flapping in a pretty strong wind. Out come the batsmen! Now, how much trouble can this final pair cause this morning? It looks like Mark Wood will be the first to test them. It’s worth pointing out, though I don’t doubt that the England squad have worked extremely hard since they got together on Monday, and a pre-game kickabout has become a traditional part of their preparations. Still, this close to the action it could be a distraction. Jimmy Anderson has a pre-cricket chat: We’re obvously behind in the game. It’s down to us to get this last wicket and then put on a good show with the bat. If we can match what Pakistan get in this innings, it gives us something to bowl at. Potentially in hindsight yes but I also think we didn’t do ourselves justice with the bat. Again with the ball, I think we bowled pretty well yesterday and on another day I think we could have bowled them out much cheaper. He’s then asked about England bowling the wrong length, and his statistically better performance from the Nursery End: Yesterday I didn’t think the ball did as much as the first day. We want to bowl that fuller length and find that edge, it depends on the batsman you bowl at. We talk a lot about length, but if you’re not making the batsman play it doesn’t matter what length you bowl. I like bowling this end when the ball’s swinging. My grouping is a lot better from this end in terms of line. And then about Stokes taking the second new ball yesterday, and all those dropped catches: I didn’t feel in particularly great rhythm from this end. It’s just the way it goes. As a captain, you want your in-form bowlers to take the new ball and I was probably down the pecking order a bit yesterday. We met up on Monday, and we put so much work in on the catching, in the slips in particular. It’s frustrating, but they’re not doing it on purpose. We’ve got areas to improve and the catching is one of them. We’ve put in a lot of work trying to get that better. Weather watch: it has rained overnight in north London but currently it’s brighter than it was at any stage yesterday, and no further rain is forecast until this evening. So, we’re all set. So, day three. Pakistan lead by 166, with one first-innings wickets remaining, Babar Azam having been ruled out for the remainder of the series with a fractured forearm. England’s position in the match is bad, and the tourists have a chance to turn that to downright terrible in the first hour of the day. And then England have to bat, and they have to do it better than they did on day one. Here’s some day-two reporting and reaction to while away the dark, dreary pre-cricket hours:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/27/peggy-attlee-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T10:37:40Z","webTitle":"Peggy Attlee obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/27/peggy-attlee-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/27/peggy-attlee-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Peggy Attlee obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My mother, Peggy Attlee, who has died aged 99, began a career as a peace activist when other people would have been retiring in the 1970s and 80s. She campaigned for east-west understanding during the later stages of the cold war, protested against nuclear weapons and helped to establish an annual ceremony to honour conscientious objectors. On Ash Wednesday 1988, Peggy took part in a protest against nuclear weapons at the Ministry of Defence, and was arrested and fined. She later wrote With a Quiet Conscience (1995), a biography of her father-in-law, Tom Attlee (brother of Clement Attlee, the Labour prime minister), who was imprisoned as a conscientious objector in the first world war. In 1994 she helped to establish an annual ceremony in Tavistock Square to honour conscientious objectors. Peggy was born in Dublin. Her father, Jerry Brennan, had died in France four months earlier, during the first world war. Until the age of seven, Peggy and her mother, Florrie (nee O’Neill) lived with her grandmother. Florrie then married Tommy Kilner, an Englishman, and moved to London, where Peggy gained a stepbrother and two half-brothers. After boarding school at Mayfield, Sussex, she read philosophy, politics and economics at St Anne’s College, Oxford. Through rowing – Peggy won a blue coxing the women’s team – she met Patrick Attlee. They were married in 1941 while Patrick was on leave from army service, having been wounded and evacuated at Dunkirk. Three children arrived but Peggy managed to complete her degree, train as a social worker and become a Labour councillor for Oxfordshire. Patrick joined the Foreign Office and for 20 years Peggy was a diplomat’s wife. Two more children arrived. After postings in Greece, Turkey, Uruguay, Venezuela and the US, Patrick retired and they moved to Cornwall. Peggy busied herself with the affairs of St Piran parish, the Women’s Institute and Oxfam. When Patrick died, in 1975, Peggy moved back to London, becoming involved in various social justice groups. She joined Pax Christi, a Catholic peace movement whose blend of faith and politics matched her beliefs. During the 1980s, Peggy’s efforts went into furthering understanding between east and west, through the informal dialogue conducted between Pax Christi International and the Russian Orthodox Church. She started a group in which academics, journalists and others discussed the tensions confronting the world, wrote a pamphlet looking at the history and outlook of Russia from a Christian perspective, and organised visits to peace-minded contacts in Russia. Peggy’s daughter Helen died in 2015. She is survived by four children, Jeremy, Margaret, Thomas and me, 12 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/25/man-95-arrested-death-of-carer-islington-london","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T20:07:59Z","webTitle":"Man, 95, arrested on suspicion of murdering care worker in London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/25/man-95-arrested-death-of-carer-islington-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/25/man-95-arrested-death-of-carer-islington-london","fields":{"headline":"Man, 95, arrested on suspicion of murdering care worker in London","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A 95-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering his care worker after a woman died in hospital, police have said. The Metropolitan police said they believed the 61-year-old woman’s injuries were sustained at a residential address in Islington, north London, where she was doing care work. The London ambulance service was called to the property at 4.15am on Thursday and sent two crews, a spokesman said, adding: “We treated one person at the scene and took them to hospital as a priority.” Police officers were called to a hospital in north London shortly after 7am on Thursday, after the woman was admitted with head injuries. She died shortly before 11am. A neighbour who has been living in the block of flats in Holloway for 10 years said the 95-year-old man was rarely seen outside his home since he and his wife fell ill. The woman, who did not want to be named, said another neighbour told her of hearing a scream in the early hours of Thursday morning. She said the elderly man would normally have a care worker looking after him and he was occasionally visited by family members. “It’s a surprise,” she said. “They are a very good family. I don’t know what’s happened. I was coming home from work and saw police upstairs. Another neighbour heard a scream at about 4am, but I didn’t.” The woman who died was an employee of a care agency commissioned by Islington council. The council’s leader, Richard Watts, said: “We are devastated to hear of the death of a carer in Islington. Our thoughts are with her family and friends at this desperately sad time.” The elderly man was bailed and police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. Neighbours said the man was frail and used a walking stick. He was taken to hospital as a precaution owing to a pre-existing condition. Police said he would stay there until a place was found where “his complex health and care needs” could be managed. Neither the man nor the victim have been named by Scotland Yard. The woman’s next of kin have been informed and police said a postmortem examination would be carried out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2018/jun/06/smoked-on-the-water-the-eel-trader-reviving-an-old-amsterdam-tradition","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T10:00:10Z","webTitle":"Smoked on the water: the eel trader reviving an old Amsterdam tradition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jun/06/smoked-on-the-water-the-eel-trader-reviving-an-old-amsterdam-tradition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/jun/06/smoked-on-the-water-the-eel-trader-reviving-an-old-amsterdam-tradition","fields":{"headline":"Smoked on the water: the eel trader reviving an old Amsterdam tradition","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“Eeeeelll, freshly smoked eeeeelll!” These words are once again echoing along the canals of Amsterdam. Half a century after the city’s last parlevinker – or boat-based travelling salesman – dropped anchor, Bas Oosterbaan is reviving the practice. Early every morning, the 57-year-old skewers a dozen slippery specimens and raises them above the fire to let the smoke do its work. Later he casts off and sets course along central Amsterdam’s canals in search of customers. Oosterbaan’s eels being prepared, smoked and served The trick, he says, is to get their attention: a bell, his voice and loud music – classical or old-Amsterdam singalongs, depending on the neighbourhood. Almost everyone on the street looks up when Oosterbaan sails past, hollering and ringing his bell – but only real Amsterdammers buy his eels. “Tourists don’t understand what I’m doing, let alone what I’m selling,” he explains. “Smoked eel is a typical Dutch delicacy – one of the few.” Oosterbaan and his eels are a novelty – but selling from a boat on the city’s canals is not a new idea. Parlevinkers – combining two Dutch specialties: the trading spirit and water – used to be common here. But somehow these salesmen on small boats disappeared; not just in Amsterdam, but throughout the Netherlands. The last Dutch parlevinker is thought to have sailed away in 2008 – long after the last one left Amsterdam, sometime around 1965. Parlevinkers sell groceries and petrol in Rotterdam Oosterbaan didn’t set out to revive this historic trade. Six months ago, he had accepted a job as head of the food department at a university in Amsterdam. But he had never worked anywhere for long: he’d always get bored after a while, or get into trouble. So after a few weeks, when he was fired again, he started to question himself. In search of answers, he started to sail the lakes of Friesland, a province in the north of the Netherlands. It was here that he first got a taste for smoked eel, and began to sell a few. Another happy customer … When someone suggested moving his business to the canals of Amsterdam, Oosterbaan, with nothing to lose, set sail. Arriving in midwinter to a city dusted with snow and ice, he found that curious Amsterdammers would flock to his boat – attracted by his singing and the smoking barrel on the stern. Soon the snow melted and it was spring. The days became longer; the business better. Recently he was featured in the Amsterdam newspaper Het Parool, and even Oosterbaan can’t deny his status as some kind of local hero. Oosterbaan in his boat … Away from Amsterdam’s crowded streets and streams of tourists, there is space on the water – and Oosterbaan and his eels may yet kickstart the rebirth of the parlevinker. There are rumours that a baker has started to sell fresh bread from a boat (though he remains under the radar because he lacks the vendor’s permits). As for Oosterbaan himself? He can’t stop singing. “Eeeeelll!

So comes the provocation from Ed Husain, self-proclaimed former Islamist radical, who puts much of the blame for Isis, Syria, Hamas and beyond on Saudi-sponsored Salafism and the export of Wahhabism across the world. “We can’t blame the rest of the global neighbourhood for the fire we’ve lit in our own home,” he says, in an empty Brick Lane cafe on the first morning of Ramadan. Through writing his new book, an attempt at condensing a global history of Islam, Husain arrives at the logical, albeit frequently observed, conclusion that the spread of this rigid, literalist interpretation of Islam “rejected by the vast majority of Muslims and imposed on them” is the biggest threat to the religion. The solution? To defeat the ideology. Exactly how the battle of ideas can be won is not so clear, but one proposal from Husain is takfir: to publicly expel terrorists and jihadists from the faith rather than to allow any suggestion that they are martyred. The trouble is that Islam comes in diverse forms and sects, without a central institution to thrash out theology or articulate universal doctrine. Husain optimistically judges that this could be done via a “Middle Eastern Muslim Union”, a Marshall-plan-type programme funded by “the economic capital that God has blessed the Gulf with”, to be “deployed through investment and redistribution to address the difficulties across the region”. The point is to engage with extremist ideas. “We make the mistake of seeing the world in physical entities,” he says. “With Isis it has always been about ideas. It’s not so much a caliphate, it’s an expansionist fascist mindset.” This much most of us agree on, but surely Isis losing so much territory is a significant moment? “If that was the case, then we should have seen the decline of the Taliban in Afghanistan. What we saw with Isis was a desire for recreating a caliphate that was ever stronger, but there is no military victory here. It is a mindset that has to be criticised, undermined and thrown out.” As he puts it, “throughout Muslim history there have been periods where problematic, subversive ideas have been expressed” but the ability to challenge them “is missing in civil society currently”. A considerable weight of responsibility, in Husain’s view, rests on the shoulders of so-called moderate or liberal Muslims to “defeat [ideas] on campuses, bookshops, mosques, publication houses, the internet”. Husain says that during the course of writing his book he has had the ear of “several Muslim prime ministers, three presidents, several princes – people in charge of tens of thousands of clerics – and millions of people following very prominent Muslim scholars”. His background is in thinktanks; his speciality is in “the thought space”, which saw him founding the counter-extremist organisation Quilliam in 2007 with Maajid Nawaz, and going on to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York before a stint at the Tony Blair Faith Foundation. He is both “unashamedly Burkean and conservative with a small c” and a practising “Muslim believer, proud of my heritage and proud of my faith”. He is at pains to emphasise Islam’s history of rich and liberal diversity, its sensuality and flexibility being at odds with the rigid puritanical form that currently dominates. “Here in the UK, we have 20,000 Muslims being monitored. Twenty, ten, five years ago that wasn’t the case.” Several years ago, Husain advocated on behalf of the government’s Prevent programme, and declared that spying on British Muslims, whether they were suspected of committing crimes or not, was morally right as “the alternative [would be] to let the buggers do what they wish, until they appear on the violence radar, which is too late”. He makes no apology for his work with Quilliam, “taking money from British taxpayers to help support British security”. To him, it’s clear “Islam doesn’t have a problem; Muslims have a problem. The body of ideas that want to control the state and take halal and haram to a legislative level and impose it, that remains a problem”. For a century and a half, says Husain, Muslims have struggled politically with defining their place in the modern world. “Where we have done that is in our place in the west, where 20 to 30 million of us have come to terms with our minority status, with democracy, pluralism, the rule of law – we don’t have to be the powering elite,” he says. “Our Muslim cousins have yet to come to terms with how as believers they can reconcile with a secular nation state. Many of our extremist Islamist types haven’t, and that’s why they demand control, whether it’s Iran or the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.” He is cautious about the impact of the leadership of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. “He’s on the reform path – when I see it, I’ll believe it. Headlines and PR in the west are all well and good but real change should be in the heartland of Islam.” But in line with Husain’s thinking, on the face of it Saudi Arabia has taken a public stance against suicide bombers and set up a terrorism and ideology monitoring centre. Clerics in Mecca’s Grand Mosque have also been open about the need to retrain Salafi clerics. “It’s welcome news and there is a shift,” he concedes. “But Mohammed bin Salman being in touch with his own people while bringing about these reforms is vital.” For Husain, Turkey – “which isn’t Erdoğan, it’s bigger than Erdoğan” – may provide a model. “Turkey has a form of Islam we can work with in the west. On a political level it’s chaos, but Turkey is the only country I can take my two daughters and wife to, and no one bats an eyelid if we walk into a mosque together. I’ve had the good fortune of travelling across the Muslim world and I’ve never come across a country that is more free for Muslims and people of faith in general.” To those who argue that Islam needs a kind of Reformation, he offers a corrective: “Wahhabism is the reformation – Islam is in need of a renaissance and a reminder of its own values of what it means to live and coexist in a free world.” The House of Islam by Ed Husain is published by Bloomsbury"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/23/rufus-wainwright-interview-swig-maple-syrup","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"Rufus Wainwright: ‘I like sugar a lot; I can swig maple syrup from the bottle’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/23/rufus-wainwright-interview-swig-maple-syrup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/23/rufus-wainwright-interview-swig-maple-syrup","fields":{"headline":"Rufus Wainwright: ‘I like sugar a lot; I can swig maple syrup from the bottle’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sleep Sleeping well is why I’m able to tour as much as I do. Occasionally I get up in the night to jot down a lyric, or hum a melody into the phone to remember it. Every morning, I wake up, get my coffee and play the piano for an hour. I have a seven-year-old daughter, Viva, who spends a third of her time with me and my husband, Jörn Weisbrodt, and the rest with her mother, Lorca Cohen. My set getting-up time is 9.30am, but when I’m with Viva I get up at 7am. I’m rarely in bed before midnight. Eat I like sugar a lot; I can swig maple syrup from the bottle. I did manage a few months ago to cut sugar out of my diet. I have an Irish palate: fatty food, cabbage and brussels sprouts. I can’t stand anything typically good for you. Breakfast can be just coffee. When I’m touring, lamb or chicken for lunch needs to fit around departing at 3pm to reach the venue. I stick to total sobriety, but one day at a time. Work People think the moment you walk in my door I’m madly playing piano and pulling my hair out, but in most cases I’ll just be on the couch watching the news. I work a lot – I write operas and I do songs and shows – but talk to my husband or my sisters and they’ll say: “He works incredibly hard, but his general vibe is laziness.” Family Jörn works in LA at the Music Centre. He puts together concerts, and sometimes I’m in them. We met when he was well known in the opera world in Germany, so those connections are useful. It’s important for us to have separate hemispheres in our own professional lives. I don’t think any of my family [father Loudon Wainwright III, sister Martha Wainwright, half-sister Lucy Wainwright Roche] will be joining me on stage on my UK tour, but I would not be surprised to find one of them trailing in a neighbouring country.

At its heart is the dialogue between the EU and Theresa May’s government, but that process has become increasingly detached from the negotiation that Mrs May conducts with her cabinet, her party, and parliament. The concept of Brexit being presented to British audiences now bears hardly any relation at all to the concept as it is grasped in Brussels. This disparity is extremely dangerous. For weeks, Mrs May has been bogged down in debate about alternatives to a customs union, as if that is the thing on which a good deal depends. Viewed from Brussels, this looks like refusal to engage with underlying issues, and dereliction of duty to explain to voters what the true choices entail. The customs union row is a proxy for the question of how far the UK intends to diverge from EU standards and regulations. That issue isn’t addressed directly for two reasons. First, it exposes an ideological schism in the Conservative party. Second, the “joint report” ending the first phase of negotiations in December includes provisions for an invisible Irish border that settle the matter in favour of zero divergence. But Mrs May doesn’t dare say so. The UK government has already signed something in Brussels that requires a soft Brexit and the Tories are performing a pantomime debate behind red lines that require a much harder Brexit. It is an act of monstrous collective irresponsibility. So what is the real negotiation? In essence, it is about the extent to which the UK can replicate the existing regulatory regime while allowing the prime minister to assert that some “control” has been recovered. In terms of what is most urgent to leave voters, that means immigration control. So the least ruinous deal that might win public consent is an association agreement with the EU. Its potential outline was described this week by Ivan Rogers, the UK’s former ambassador to Brussels: “Quasi single market membership, paying something for it, living under ECJ jurisprudence and jurisdiction in goods, but dis-applying … free movement of people.” That would be painful for hard Brexiters but also for the EU, since the four freedoms have been said countless times to be indivisible. The prohibition on “cherry-picking” could not have been made clearer. On this point, it is in Brussels that uncomfortable truths must be aired. The European project is imperilled by domestic turmoil in many member states. The formation of a populist-nationalist government in Italy is the latest manifestation of these trends. The Brexit vote expressed peculiarities of British Euroscepticism, but its political and cultural causes were not unique. After the referendum, Brussels was shaken by fear of contagion. The need for Brexit to fail and be seen to fail seemed imperative. That is no longer the issue. The impossibility of leaving the EU on terms superior to membership has been demonstrated. The new imperative is to show generosity and flexibility to a valued and valuable “third country”. The EU’s big power brokers – France, Germany and the commission – should be imagining alternative models to full membership that might incentivise closer association for non-members, in the western Balkans, for example. Brussels will never be grateful to Britain for creating the Brexit mess, but that doesn’t mean opportunities can’t be salvaged. The UK government has failed in its duty to level with the public about the scale of compromise and costs involved in Brexit, as indeed has the Labour party. The prime minister is running out of time to realign a delusional domestic debate with international reality. But she has allowed the two spheres to drift so far apart, it is hard to reunite them without triggering a hugely destructive political crisis. Such a combustion would be bad for the rest of Europe, too. Mrs May needs help from Brussels. She cannot unilaterally devise a new, highly integrated model of close partnership. Far from fearing such a partnership as a dangerous precedent, the rest of the EU should welcome it as a sign that their alliance is both more resilient and more flexible than it has so far looked to many ordinary European citizens."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"education/2018/may/29/oxford-and-cambridge-university-colleges-own-property-worth-35bn","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T09:10:20Z","webTitle":"Oxford and Cambridge university colleges own property worth £3.5bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/29/oxford-and-cambridge-university-colleges-own-property-worth-35bn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/may/29/oxford-and-cambridge-university-colleges-own-property-worth-35bn","fields":{"headline":"Oxford and Cambridge university colleges own property worth £3.5bn","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Oxford and Cambridge colleges collectively own more land than the Church of England and have a portfolio of properties across the UK worth £3.5bn, a Guardian investigation has found. From a Scottish castle conquered by Robert the Bruce and the O2 arena in Greenwich to a betting shop in Brent, north-west London, the land and buildings owned by the universities’ colleges encompass ancient and modern possessions amounting to 51,000 hectares (126,000 acres) – an area more than four times the size of Manchester. The Oxbridge holdings dwarf the 42,000 hectares owned across 41 dioceses by the Church of England, which is often said to be the UK’s largest private landowner. The figures follow the revelation on Monday that estates, endowments, investments and other assets held by Oxford and Cambridge are collectively worth almost £21bn. The property details come from the most extensive survey of Oxbridge landholdings since 1873, through a combination of freedom of information requests, archival research and Land Registry records. The property holdings of Oxbridge colleges are worth a combined £3.5bn, while the universities collectively hold property investments worth £863m. These figures do not take into account the value of many historic college sites, which are held at depreciated cost. The total size does not include unmeasured land held by several colleges “under ancient possession”, or the holdings of the universities, which could not give a full account of their land ownership but own at least 1,800 hectares, according to information available online. The two major Cambridge landowners are St John’s and Trinity, which have 10,500 hectares worth £1.1bn and make up more than half of the 17,000 hectares owned by Cambridge colleges. Trinity values its property investments at £850m, and in early January, the college sold a block of retail and residential space in Kensington High Street, central London, to Unitum Ltd, a Malta-based holding company, for £28m. All Souls, Christ Church and Merton are Oxbridge’s biggest UK landowners, owning 14,000 of the 34,000 hectares held by Oxford colleges at a value of about £460m. The oldest property owned by any college is Buittle Castle in Dumfries and Galloway, built in the 12th century and given to the Scottish nobleman John de Balliol, who, with his wife, Lady Dervorguilla, founded Balliol College, Oxford, in 1263. Though the castle was captured by Robert the Bruce in the 14th century, it later reverted to the crown and is now back in the hands of Balliol College. One of the most lucrative holdings is the O2 arena, originally known as the Millennium Dome, which Trinity College owns on a 999-year lease after buying it for £24m in 2009. Trinity collects rent from Anschutz Entertainment Group, which operates the concert arena, and over the past two years, the college has registered a profit of nearly £22m from the site. Other well-known holdings include the site of the Top Gear test track, also owned by Trinity, and the Rose Bowl, the home of Hampshire cricket club, owned by Queen’s College, Oxford. One of the most unlikely holdings belongs to St John’s College, the alma mater of the former prime minister Tony Blair, and Oxford’s wealthiest college. It is the landlord of Millwall’s training ground. Less glamorous are swaths of rural farmland and woodland, which include an Isle of Wight farm bought by Queen’s College from Henry VIII, multiple Leeds industrial estates, several gastropubs across England, and the freeholds to more than 100 retail outlets and shops, including branches of Caffè Nero and HSBC. The most concentrated commercial land ownership is in Brent, where All Souls College, one of Oxford’s wealthiest, owns more than 300 properties. The vast majority are residential houses, but they also include the freehold of a Ladbrokes betting shop. The London borough had the highest proportion of housing benefit claims by private tenants in the country, according to research by the Financial Times in 2015. Several colleges have received agricultural subsidies amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds, according to data from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). These include £117,000 in common agricultural policy subsidies paid in 2016 to Waterside farm in Berkshire, owned by St John’s College, Oxford, which sits on wealth of £582m. The farm has received the taxpayer-funded grants, intended to conserve the environment by protecting wildlife and maintaining rural landscapes, despite West Berkshire council putting forward plans in 2016 to extract 200,000 tons of gravel over an 11-year period from the farm, located in the North Wessex Downs – an area of outstanding natural beauty. The plans were met with widespread anger at the time from locals, including one who wrote a letter to the college vowing to “highlight the damage that St John’s College is intent on inflicting on the environment, the ecosystem, the neighbourhood, the town, and not least, the residents”. Meanwhile, Cambridge, which holds net assets of £4.8bn, also received £180,000 in CAP subsidies in 2016 for its university farm. That is despite research from the university in 2015 describing such funding as “perverse” subsidies “promoting negative actions in both the long and short term by being bad for the environment and costly to the economy”. An Oxford spokesperson said: “The central university’s strong balance sheet allows us to fund new initiatives for our students, staff and outstanding teaching and research.” Oxford’s endowment includes 600 trusts with funds earmarked for specific purposes such as teaching posts, buildings and research. About £270m of the endowment supports student scholarships. Cambridge declined to reply to requests for a response."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/27/rbs-profits-offer-some-shelter-from-shareholders-agm-ross-mcewan","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T06:00:17Z","webTitle":"RBS’s profits offer the boss some shelter from shareholders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/27/rbs-profits-offer-some-shelter-from-shareholders-agm-ross-mcewan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/27/rbs-profits-offer-some-shelter-from-shareholders-agm-ross-mcewan","fields":{"headline":"RBS’s profits offer the boss some shelter from shareholders","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It is unlikely Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Ross McEwan expected the positive results announced in April to quell anger among a significant body of his shareholders. That anger is anticipated to become clear on Wednesday at the company’s annual meeting in Edinburgh, when a vote is expected on setting up a new shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. More than 140 investors backed the push for a special resolution that calls for the creation of the committee, and it could be down to the government on whether it is carried or not. The resolution will need 75% backing to pass and the government, through UK Financial Investments, holds 71% of the shares. The vote will be the culmination of a 20-year campaign for better shareholder engagement by ShareSoc and the UK Shareholders’ Association (UKSA), which have argued that the creation of a committee would help avoid the mistakes which led to the £45.5bn state bailout 10 years ago. This is not of course the only contentious issue that is expected to be raised at Wednesday’s meeting – the other main one is whether the government will be selling its stake in the bank, and when. RBS has agreed a £3.6bn penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis. This clears the way for the government to sell its shares. Its plans are to sell £15bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in £3bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about £26bn after the bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. Also likely to come up is the report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) detailing the “disgraceful” treatment of struggling small businesses that came to RBS for financial assistance in the wake of the banking crisis. The full report was released by the Treasury committee in February after a standoff with the FCA, which had only published an edited version. The document detailed “widespread inappropriate treatment” of small businesses by the bank’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG). The report’s authors found that 16% of businesses they analysed that were still viable when they entered GRG were likely to have suffered “material financial distress” due to its treatment of them. While RBS “did not set out to engineer” financial difficulty, it said, the bank had a “conflict of interest”, with staff encouraged to prioritise the extraction of fees and so-called “upside instruments” to boost revenue, rather than looking after the needs of the small firms. And then there is the issue of branch closures and whether some of the shareholders at Wednesday’s meeting will even have access to their local bank. Earlier this month, RBS said it would close 162 branches in England and Wales in the summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, the result of a deal with the EU last year which meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout. So McEwan will be facing a series of probing questions in Edinburgh on Wednesday but will presumably be pointing to the bank’s positive results. Profits more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. How much those results placate shareholders remains to be seen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jul/11/somalia-the-rise-of-mogadishu-artists-music-activists","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-11T04:30:02Z","webTitle":"'We laugh, sing and play music': the rise of Mogadishu","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/11/somalia-the-rise-of-mogadishu-artists-music-activists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/11/somalia-the-rise-of-mogadishu-artists-music-activists","fields":{"headline":"'We laugh, sing and play music': the rise of Mogadishu","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The surprising sounds of a late evening in Mogadishu: surf on the beach, laughs of revellers, clinking of cups and glasses, oaths of harassed waiters and the soft melodies of the oud of Aweys Kabanle. Kabanle, a 45-year-old former dressmaker turned musician, is playing traditional Somali music at the luxury Mogadishu Beach View hotel at the city’s Lido to a smartly dressed audience in one of the world’s most dangerous cities. “This is Mogadishu. We laugh and sing. We play music. Music is for peace so we no longer live in fear,” Kabanle says, sipping a cappuccino. There are few cities with contrasts as stark as those of Mogadishu. Swollen by hundreds of thousands of people displaced by famine, drought and conflict in rural areas, its outlying districts resemble a vast refugee camp. Authorities are incompetent, corrupt or simply absent. It is seven years since the Islamic militants of al-Shabaab withdrew but many streets bear the scars of more than two decades of incessant warfare. Mogadishu’s inhabitants have long been known for their resilience, but a new wave of activists, entrepreneurs and artists are now trying to improve their city. Two years ago, Kabanle survived an al-Shabaab gun attack and suicide car bombing close to where he now performs every evening. The attack left at least 10 dead, including three of Aweys’s friends. The oud player was forced to jump over the wall of the hotel where he was playing to escape. “For several months following, there was no show,” he says. “People were unwilling to come back but I was committed to come here again. I started the first night by myself alone playing music and resumed hosting the show. Thanks be to God, people got confidence and now they are coming back for my show.” Despite the ongoing violence in the Somali capital, the economy is growing, hundreds of expatriates are returning from the west or African nations, scores of colleges are opening to cater for the young population and there is growing investment from the diaspora. Estate agents thrive: a two-storey house can cost nearly £100,000. Mogadishu has hosted a TEDx conference. Ahmed Hassan Sheikh decided to return to Mogadishu from Kenya a year and a half ago. He started his own arts company inside the fortified Mogadishu airport complex, where thousands of diplomats, United Nations staff and regional troops from the African Union stabilisation force are based. There is no shortage of demand for Sheikh’s paintings. “I do not need to fight with a gun. I have a powerful pen with which I draw my feelings. I believe through it I can bring change. I can make Mogadishu peaceful,” the 48-year-old artist says. His paintings call for young people to take up pens and books instead of arms, to warn against illegal migration and its devastating effects on Somali families. Other drawings recall life in old Mogadishu before the civil war, a time when the city was known as the most beautiful city in Africa. “When people see my artworks of former Mogadishu and how it used to be like, they appreciate how peaceful and prosperous Mogadishu was,” Ahmed says. Then there is Ubaxa Caasimadda (Flowers of the City), a group of students who, 18 months ago, set out to smarten scruffy city streets and mark roads to increase public safety. They started with the safest roads such as those near the presidential palace, because some had already received death threats from al-Shabaab. “When we started, we did not even know what will come out. It was just, go and do and then see. We knew the dangers we were facing but we took that risk,” says Amira Mahad Abdulle, a 24-year-old university student. Abdulle wears a burqa to conceal her identity and does not respond to phone calls from unknown people for her safety. “There are a lot of threats coming in but I try to stay safe. I do not fear. I want to serve Mogadishu,” she says. The group decided to act “because nobody else was willing to do it” and the government in Mogadishu is focused on fighting al-Shabaab. “We could not sit behind and wait for someone else to do this for the people of Mogadishu. We are the youth of this country and we decided to stand up for it,” Abdulle says. So far the group has painted dozens of zebra crossings and have planted flowers on pavements. “We are committed. We were born in Mogadishu and we want to help our city become developed, beautiful and safe like other cities in the world,” Isse Hassan Ibrahim, a 23-year-old typographic graduate, says. Though his best friend, a government employee, was assassinated by al-Shabaab last year, Ibrahim never stopped working as a volunteer in Mogadishu. “When my friend was killed, I got scared but I decided not to quit. I want to help my people and my capital city,” Ibrahim says. “We now have new youth groups joining us from other cities.” In the last 18 months, US and Somali forces have intensified the battle against al-Shabab, though without achieving decisive success. Last week US officials said a new airstrike killed 14 militants. Though the increased military activity has weakened the extremists, it also led to more civilian casualties. Kabanle believes his country will soon be at peace. “Somalia is no longer a war zone. It is a love zone,” he says, pointing to a group of young men and women sitting on the warm white sand of Mogadishu’s beach.

Tousle-haired busts gaze at gilded frames and silvery mirrors keep company with Susi’s own designs: velvet cushions, tables or lampshades in deep oranges, Borgia reds and Medici greens. Even the architecture of this five-bedroom apartment carved from a vertical slice of an Edwardian country mansion is classical: the colonnaded portico and pilasters grounded in Renaissance proportions. It reminds Bellamy of Florence, where she lived with her family for six years when her husband, an energy consultant, was posted to Italy. “I’d taken a career break to bring up our children so I had time to absorb the city… It’s that mix of old and new which I loved: the contrast of a Pucci pattern against a crumbling palazzo wall; the coffee bars and the traditional shops selling gilded frames and marbled papers. It really did feel as if I’d died and gone to heaven,” she laughs. Returning to the UK in 2010, Bellamy was keen to bring some of that “ancient meets modern” combination to her home, near Newcastle. Set in a former shipping magnate’s rural pile, the apartment sits in the central section of the building. From the double-height entrance, a staircase swirls up to the first-floor sitting room, main bedroom and guest bedroom. There are three more bedrooms tucked under the eaves, a layout that suited a family with three grown-up children. But there was work to do. “I’d looked at lots of architecture in Italy and realised that some elements of the apartment didn’t work. With historic buildings you sometimes have to move on – sympathetically.” So Bellamy called the architect Ike Isenhour, who she had met in Florence. “He came to stay and we bashed out ideas in the pub.” Isenhour’s “simple” changes brought symmetry and light. The old utility room is now a corridor drawing your eye towards the new door into the sitting room. Underfoot, the original floors were oiled to a dove-grey and the oak “gentleman’s club” panelling painted taupe as a foil for evolving wall schemes: oranges, yellows, or the deep-plum of the sitting room. Bellamy had planned to use the entrance hall as a dining room – “But Ike took one look and said, ‘You’ll never use it: it’s too cold.’” Now it functions as a light-filled second sitting room where a sofa from Bellamy’s past offers a comfortable spot for the Sunday papers. Next door, the kitchen was redesigned to echo the proportions of the Edwardian architecture. The round table, a Tuscan souvenir, sits by the bay window with views across landscaped lawns to the Tyne Valley. This is where Bellamy, who launched her design business in 2016 (to the approval of buyers from Liberty and Heal’s), works using pens, paints and inks to create distinctive prints and patterns. The peaceful corner is a world away from her first job as fashion editor at Brides magazine, zipping Kate Moss into nuptial whites and chasing Jimmy Choo for heels (“He’d turn up with a pair he’d made that morning, smelling of glue.”) That team spirit of collaborating with designers is echoed in pieces Bellamy commissioned for the house. “I love ping-ponging ideas about to produce something different,” she says. She designed the abstract rug in the hallway with her friend, the interior designer Eve Waldron. Raskl, in Newcastle, made the leather-clad wardrobes in the bedroom and colourful mirrors which bounce light into the sitting room. On the top floor, where bedrooms are lined in Bellamy’s marbled wallpapers to evoke the feel of jewel boxes, the hallway glows with gold-stencilled motifs inspired by Lanvin’s 1920s bedroom in Paris. The art, too, “has a meaning; a personal connection”. There is a painting by Bellamy’s cousin, Vivien Geddes, which once hung at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, and drawings by her émigré aunt and uncle who taught Bellamy, “a nice Jewish girl from Cardiff”, how to paint. In 2015 she did an MA in fine art at Northumbria University: “I was the 49-year-old surrounded by 21-year-olds. It forced me to throw out preconceptions and experiment.” But it was in Florence that she “served her apprenticeship”, practising life drawing, copying Old Masters like the Van Dyck which hangs in the bedroom, or making her Madonna collages, “reappropriated versions” of Catholic street shrines. At 54, Bellamy is experiencing something of a midlife renaissance with orders from designers and stockists in Japan, Scandinavia and Russia. “Even now I am still very ambitious but I’m aware that I need to move forward before it’s too late,” she says. In September, she is back in Florence for a solo show at the Palazzo Tornabuoni. On days off she has earmarked her favourite coffee bars and paper shops; there will be trips to gaze at triptychs and educational window shopping on piazzi where, one day, she dreams of opening her own store. susi-bellamy.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/25/brexit-boris-johnson-dominic-cummings","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T15:43:00Z","webTitle":"There’s a rat in this Brexit heist movie.

Even so, the prime minister’s insistence on being ludicrously positive about literally any old doodah is surely nearing its endgame. Or is it? This week it was claimed that, in order to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland, May will ask the EU for a customs and regulatory alignment period (CRAP) lasting until the end of 2023. I will be asking them for country music stardom and England to win the World Cup, and I imagine we’ll both get similar results. Meanwhile, news that Britain may be frozen out of the EU’s £10bn Galileo satellite navigation system has opened a whole other vista of magical thinking, this time stretching all the way into orbit. Chancellor Philip Hammond – who has the sort of cabinet presence that might be expected of someone in one of the better witness protection programmes – has broken cover to retort that we will just build our own rival system if we’re to be shut out. Like me, you may well have had no idea we were so rich, particularly in the week the Institute for Fiscal Studies released a report stating that the NHS needed an additional £2,000 in tax from every UK household just to stay afloat. But we’re forgetting the legendary referendum slogan: “Let’s spend ten billion quid on a satnav for this bus instead.” Considering the bailiffs are almost at the ward door, then, we seem to be feeling oddly flush. This week found Boris Johnson in South America on some mission or other, doing ironicidal things like opening a new Bupa hospital in Santiago. Absolutely super news for the Chilean elite, and anyone whingeing about plans to close their own local hospital needs to stop talking down Global Britain. In the meantime, do think of Boris’s overseas tours as the equivalent of No 10 saying “I’ll time you” to the foreign secretary, as you might to a child you’d very much like to run along and get out of your hair. He doesn’t seem to have cottoned on to the ruse yet, but it’s possible the globetrotting is beginning to take its toll. He told journalists on Tuesday that he needed a private Foreign Office plane, as the prime minister’s one was “grey” and “seems to be very difficult to get hold of”. Also, a snazzy new jet could help strike trade deals. Wait, I thought Brexit needed a new boat? Specifically, a new royal yacht – although I get the feeling it could also be a Sunseeker. Or a kiteboard. Or a Ducati Panigale V4. You’ve heard of a soft Brexit and a hard Brexit and a clean Brexit and a jobs-first Brexit – and yet, at some base emotional level, I think we always knew we were going to get a Paul Hollywood Brexit. On the morning after the referendum vote, JK Rowling observed that Brexiteers are “like the cheating man shocked he can’t stay in the spare room for two years while he sorts himself out”. Nearly two years later and … well, here we are, not even at the midlife of the crisis. Still, the foreign secretary reckons a plane will do it – call it Air Foff One – and who are we to question his needs? Perhaps it was jetlag that kept Boris on the phone to Russian pranksters he thought were the Armenian PM for 18 minutes before ending the call. The foreign secretary discussed the Skripal poisonings and more with the pair – only for the foreign office minister Alan Duncan to conclude it was Vladimir Putin left with egg all over his face. “If this was an attempt to ridicule us,” judged Alan, “it has totally backfired. All it has done is make the Russians look even sillier than we knew they were.” You tell ’em, Alan. He’s far from the only one on the defensive, of course. And so to Vote Leave’s mastermind, Dominic Cummings, who has broken another silence to unleash a couple of furious drive-bys about how Brexit is being done wrong, and to refuse to appear before a select committee. Like many unintentionally comic movie masterminds, Dominic is the guy whose every point is essentially: “WHY AM I SURROUNDED BY IDIOTS?” I’ve lost count of how many of his 20,000-word facepalms I’ve read, but it’s fairly clear there has been some sort of acute henchmen crisis ever since the referendum vote. You really can’t get the staff these days, and as a result Cummings’ brilliant and beautiful secret plan has been ruined – ruined, I tell you! – by junior personnel such as the prime minister, the cabinet and the entire senior civil service. Or, if you prefer a different sort of movie analogy, we are now at the point in the heist-gone-wrong where the accusations are beginning to fly among the co-conspirators. Someone set them up. Someone’s a rat. Someone killed people when the express rule was no killing. Often in these movies, someone gets greedy, so they cock up the plan by staying too long in the vault. In this case, Theresa May didn’t stay long enough, triggering article 50 before she needed to. How will it end? When will it end? Not for years and years, is the conservative – though not the Conservative – answer. David Cameron promised the referendum would “settle the issue for a generation”; instead ministers will be able to handle little else but its fallout for a generation. Sunlit uplands? Even younger politicians are beginning to see that they could well be getting their second hip replacement at the Bupa hospital in Santiago before those heave thrillingly into view. • Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/03/michael-goves-hot-air-will-eventually-choke-us-all-air-pollution","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T09:00:43Z","webTitle":"Michael Gove’s hot air will eventually choke us all |  Stewart Lee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/03/michael-goves-hot-air-will-eventually-choke-us-all-air-pollution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/03/michael-goves-hot-air-will-eventually-choke-us-all-air-pollution","fields":{"headline":"Michael Gove’s hot air will eventually choke us all","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In January, a sulphurous cloud of French pollution drifted across from France to further stink out vast areas of Surrey, its stench so powerful that it overwhelmed the natural foul odours of Eric Clapton, who dwells silently in the hideous region, a subterranean blues truffle. It was as if the smelly Gallic gas glob did not respect international borders, and had imagined it could just blow around on the wind wherever it liked, a giant goose feather fashioned only from farts, irrespective of our exemption from the Schengen area agreement. Clearly, a continent-wide environmental strategy is required. In other apocalyptic news, last month all 10 million Swedes were sent leaflets warning them to prepare for Russian invasion by stockpiling their cellars with Swedish staples like meatballs, delicious cakes and pornography. Our own response to the perceived Russian threat has been to delay the visa of the Putin-backing billionaire Roman Abramovich, who I once stood next to while watching 80s Los Angeles band the Long Ryders in a venue he owned. This was perhaps the only point of overlap in the simplistic Venn diagram of Russian oligarchs and alternative country pioneers, apart from the brief period when Oleg Deripaska played pedal steel for Jason &amp; the Scorchers. But the threat of Russian invasion is especially problematic in the peacenik nude bathing utopia of Sweden which, in 1980, took official measures to discourage retailers from selling war toys to children. Not knowing one end of a gun from another, Swedes will be fighting the oncoming Russian hordes in the streets with Buckaroos ™, Fuzzy Felts ™ and Slimes ™. Ironically, street combat with apparently harmless toys is exactly the kind of unpredictable surrealist strategy favoured by Putin’s art-school propaganda adviser Vladislav Surkov, and will either result in an unexpected Swedish victory, or a Russian counter attack involving Stretch Armstrongs ™, Mutons ™, and Kerplunks ™. I envy the Swedes the simplistic certainty of the threat of Russian invasion. Here Brexit means that, like the ladies in the flashbacks in The Handmaid’s Tale, we are sleepwalking into a rightwing coup without noticing. What supplies should we stockpile in our British cellars to survive subjugation by the Brexiteers? French horns? Kraftwerk bootlegs? Experts? Those hated experts were in conspicuously short supply last week as the environment secretary M Gove responded to demands from the corrupt fat cats of the unelected EU that we take more serious steps to stop choking ourselves, our European neighbours, and our whole planet to death. Have they learned nothing in their Brussels ivory tower? This is exactly the kind of interfering attitude that brought about Brexit. If British people want to choke themselves and their children to death in a foul smog of car fumes that is up to us, and it’s not for beret-wearing traitors like Monsieur Jacques Delors, Madame Michèle Yvette Marie-Thérèse Jeanne Honorine Alliot-Marie and Monsieur Eddie Izzard to tell us we can’t. British air pollution levels are above those recommended by the World Health Organisation for 90% of our population, and fall far short of the meddling EU’s less stringent recommendations. But when we leave the deplorable EU the untrustworthy adopted nest-cuckoo M Gove has promised we will actually aim to better the shit EU’s environmental standards, even as he flounders towards deregulated food supply life rafts made of his friend Donald Trump’s maggoty meats. The literary stereotype of an orphan is of a meek and hopeful lamb child. But take it from me, all orphans lie, and M Gove is no exception. Last week, in the heat of the Windrush backdraft, the vengeful adoptee also claimed, counterintuitively, that Brexit “has made the UK more welcome to migration and more open to more people entering”. The shamans of the Lakota nation, searching for someone to fulfil the ritual role of the heyoka, the crazy backwards clown, for whom all truths are inverted, need look no further than M Gove for their future holy fool. You don’t have to be Doubting Thomas ®, from God®’s The Bible ™, to doubt the airy assurances M Gove bubbles through his lying goldfish lips. Pirate Liam Fox sees a buccaneering Britain, bustling with freebooting Tom of Finland businessmen in unbuttoned shirts, thigh length sea-chaps and skull medallions, and is unlikely to allow its forthcoming post-Brexit economic miracle to be hampered by costly self-imposed environmental legislation, me hearties. Clearly, the pollution crisis needs a top-to-bottom strategy, with the immediate elimination of the internal combustion engine as its ultimate goal. M Gove has promised to phase out diesel- and petrol-driven cars by 2040, a tiny flatus puff in a vast tornado, 22 years of slow death away. As usual M Gove and his west London friends, essentially the human equivalent of the all-controlling Orangutan priests in the dystopia of Planet of the Apes, will find a way of remaining untouched in their airtight Notting Hill survival biospheres, their constituents choking to death beneath the Westway outside. The £19,000-a-year Notting Hill Preparatory school has begun fitting £5,000 air filters to each of its classrooms, and who can blame it. But one looks forward to an M Gove government implementing the same safety measures in every state school across the country, perhaps employing cost-cutting subcontractors with the same bottom-line attention to detail as the Grenfell Tower cladders. Breathable air for school children, it appears, is to become an economic privilege, like private education, not a basic human right. When I blagged into a private school on an orphan’s charity bung in 1979, I was taken aback by the playing fields, the chapel, and the Welsh mountain geography-trip cottage. Back in those halcyon days, I took the idea that I’d be able to breathe the air as read.

The deal is expected to trigger fresh pain on a high street that is already shedding stores and jobs at a faster rate than during the recession in 2009. Major high-street names including Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams, Topshop and House of Fraser are also struggling. On Friday the homewares chain Dunelm issued a profit warning, blaming “challenging” conditions. So why is life so tough on the high street? Online rivals It is hardly a surprise that the high street is under pressure as the internet has hoovered up about a fifth of all retail spending, with non-food sales online rising by 7.5% in the past year. Now smartphones are ubiquitous, it is possible to buy a sofa on the bus, a designer handbag from the sofa or a new kitchen while in bed. The internet has made life challenging for retailers in a number of ways. Apart from directly diverting sales, it has given shoppers less reason to visit their high street, reducing small retailers’ chances of drawing in passing trade, while the cost and complexity of building the infrastructure to deliver goods to homes efficiently has hit profits. As traditional retailers struggle to adapt, they are being pressed by online specialists, such as Asos, Amazon and Boohoo.com, unhindered by a long tail of outdated stores. The ease of comparing prices and accessing goods from around the world has given more options to those based in small towns who are no longer restricted to shopping local, making competition tougher than ever. The internet is also enabling savvy shoppers to trade goods among themselves much more easily. Whether it is bundles of baby clothes selling on Facebook, fashion fans searching for vintage on eBay or Etsy, or teenagers flogging their unwanted impulse purchases on fast-growing mobile app Depop, this market is on the rise. In the US, the fashion resale market, both on and offline, is expected to rise 13% between 2016 and 2021 to $33bn, and new specialist sites such as Hewi (Hardly Ever Worn It) and Vinted as well as Depop are also expected to drive growth in the UK. Rising costs As traditional retailers battle to fund adapting their businesses to cope with the shift to online shopping, they are being hit with a perfect storm of other cost rises. The fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote has pushed up the cost of sourcing goods abroad. The impending exit from the EU and lower value of sterling have also acted to push up wages in some areas as it has been more difficult to find skilled workers who have traditionally come from mainland Europe, such as van drivers. The rise in the legal minimum wage and imposition of the apprenticeship levy have also pushed up costs, as has a rise in business rates this year. While some businesses have seen a cut, and many small stores were protected, those in the south, particularly in London, have seen major rate rises. About 1,400 shops, pubs, restaurants and hotels received an average rise of almost £50,000 according to property adviser Altus Group. Consumption fatigue After years of filling their wardrobes and homes with material possessions, Brits appear to have reached “peak stuff”. Young people are now more likely to be renters rather than buyers, meaning they’ve no yearning to fill a bottom drawer with household goods they may have to lug between short-term lets. Barclaycard data for last year reveals a 10% increase in spending on entertainment and an 11.4% rise in spending on telecoms, which of course doesn’t include all those direct debits paying for long-term phone contracts. Entertainment, pubs and restaurant spending was all up in double-digit percentages last year, according to Barclaycard, but women’s clothing spending was down. The latest data from Visa indicates that spending on household goods and clothing continues to fall, while restaurants, hotels, pubs and bars are still on the up. High-street decline Retailers are currently closing stores at a faster rate than during the recession, but despite the underlying issues being well rehearsed, no coherent plan has emerged to tackle high-street decline. Some 50,000 stores are deemed surplus to requirements and MPs have recently launched a fresh inquiry, with the goal of drawing up a vision of what high streets and town centres could look like by 2030. There is no shortage of brain power being devoted to this emotive subject; retail guru Bill Grimsey is currently leading a taskforce that is revisiting his influential 2013 review. But while MPs and retail experts bang their heads together, the pace of decline only accelerates. Last week Marks &amp; Spencer confirmed plans to close 100 of its traditional high-street stores by 2022 as sales move online. M&amp;S’s predicament typifies that of large chains with long histories: stores opened on once-thriving high streets are now surrounded by discount stores and fast-food outlets. If shoppers have abandoned a high street and shops are ever more expensive to run, how can retailers be expected to stay? Bad management Retail executives have plenty of excuses up their sleeves – ranging from the weather to declining footfall and the rise of the internet – for falling sales but no one admits to lacking skills and vision. The world wide web has been around for more than 25 years so retail bosses have had plenty of time to get used to the idea and adapt their businesses. Nearly 50% of Next’s £4bn sales are rung up online, whereas last week Marks &amp; Spencer admitted that despite spending the best part of £400m on its website operation, it is still too clunky and needs more money thrown at it. There are clear instances of bad management heightening the pressure created by the structural change bearing down on the high street: Homebase, which employs more than 11,000 people, was sold for just £1 after its new Australian owners, Wesfarmers, made terrible decisions that turned a profitable business into a massive loss-maker; the struggling Mothercare chain can no longer persuade new parents to shop there despite around 1,900 babies being born every day. Analysts level claims of inexperience at the bosses of retail chains such as House of Fraser, which has joined a long list of household names that includes Carpetright, New Look and Mothercare resorting to company voluntary arrangements (CVA), a form of insolvency, to jettison their weakest stores. Spending squeeze Consumers have just escaped a long period of falling real income and the scars are now becoming visible on the high street. Last year saw inflation rise to 3%, while wages remained stuck between 2% and 2.5%. According to pay experts, most wage bargaining deals signed last year were nearer 2%. That made for a significant fall in inflation-adjusted earnings and depressed the disposable incomes of most shoppers. It wasn’t supposed to be this way, with employment at record levels and unemployment so low that it has dropped to levels last seen in the 1970s. What many economists depict as full employment was meant to send wage rates soaring. However, Brexit uncertainty – and the transformation of working life following the rise of self-employment, part-time jobs and zero-hours contracts – more than offset the pressure from rising vacancy rates to send household incomes falling backwards. A lack of investment by British business has also played its part, keeping productivity and wage rises low. To maintain their standard of living, consumers have ramped up their borrowing, especially to buy cars and other big-ticket items. They have also run down their savings. The hope is that falling inflation this year will allow real incomes to rise again and a credit binge can be avoided. That’s what most forecasters expect, though the twists and turns of Brexit could wreck that prediction."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/28/brexit-indigestion-row-brewing-over-call-for-uk-laws-to-protect-likes-of-cognac-and-feta","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T14:36:17Z","webTitle":"Brexit indigestion: row brewing over call for UK laws to protect likes of cognac and feta","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/28/brexit-indigestion-row-brewing-over-call-for-uk-laws-to-protect-likes-of-cognac-and-feta","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/28/brexit-indigestion-row-brewing-over-call-for-uk-laws-to-protect-likes-of-cognac-and-feta","fields":{"headline":"Brexit indigestion: row brewing over call for UK laws to protect likes of cognac and feta","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Feta cheese, Parma ham, French cognac and Belgium’s sour lambic beers are the latest cause of indigestion in Brexit talks, after the EU stepped up demands on the UK to legislate to preserve the status of European speciality produce. EU special status for regional food and drink has emerged as a new sticking point in the negotiations, following a bad-tempered week of discussions in which the two sides clashed over the Galileo satellite system, and the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told the UK government to stop playing “hide and seek” over its goals. In a demand likely to infuriate Brexiter backbenchers, the European commission is calling on the British parliament to legislate to protect a few thousand protected food and drink products from copycats. The EU wants the UK to adopt a near equivalent to its system of “geographical indications” – labels that protect a product linked to a region. Barnier has said geographical indications are among the issues that must be settled before the UK can have an exit deal, including a 21-month transition period. But after fractious talks in Brussels last week, a senior EU official said they were proving to be another “difficult issue ... where the UK has no position”. “At the moment, we do not have any indication if they intend to protect geographical indications on their market beyond Brexit,” they said. An EU position paper published last September said “necessary [UK] domestic legislation” must be “comparable to that provided by union law”. A senior EU source told the Guardian this meant “indefinite” protection beyond the transition period to the end of 2020. “I assume that the UK, since they see that this is an economic bargaining chip, will probably try to hang on as long as possible, but they will probably have to give in as well, because this is about grandfathering rights,” the source predicted. Diplomats from France, Italy and Greece, countries with hundreds of protected products under the EU’s scheme, are pressing the commission’s negotiators for results. “Don’t underestimate the sensitivity of these issue,” said the senior official. Reserving the name champagne for sparkling wine from north-eastern France has been French government policy for at least 100 years. Protection of champagne and other French wine and spirits was even included in the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. Barnier, a former French agriculture minister, has referred increasingly to the issue since January, describing geographical indications as one of the “not negligible” topics that must be settled. The EU has more than 3,300 protected foods and drinks, including scores from the UK, listed under its register of geographical indications. The rules bar English growers from calling their sparking wine champagne, for example, or Danish farmers from selling their crumbly cheese as feta. As well as the big names, the list includes hundreds of lesser-known specialities, such as Lithuanian rye bread, Polish Grójec apples and Croatian smoked sausage. The UK, a latecomer to applying for GI labels, has 83 protected foods and drinks, including Scotch whisky, Cornish pasties and Arbroath smokies. The government has promised to protect these products on the UK market. Britain has said the protection of EU food and drink on the UK market is a matter for negotiations. Officials think the issue gives them some leverage and do not want to give away valuable intellectual property rights without getting something in return. Special status for food and drink is always one of the biggest sticking points in EU trade talks with other countries. Most recently, Brussels and Mexico clashed over cheese, when the EU insisted the name manchego should only apply to sheep’s cheese from central Spain, while Mexico asserted its right to sell “manchego” from cow’s milk. In a sign of the difficulties surrounding the issue, technical talks are continuing, despite agreement on an overall trade deal. Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, a former EU trade representative at the WTO, said the issue of protected food and drink was often overdramatised. “The likelihood that the UK would have any interest in making their own champagne or their own feta or their own prosciutto di Parma is simply nil,” he said. “This is a legal and technical issue that is not straightforward [but] I don’t agree with the perception that it is thorny or a deal-breaker. It is actually one of the issues where we have shown a great amount of flexibility, but we have always compromised in the final wrap-up.” A UK government spokesperson said: “Leaving the EU gives us a golden opportunity to secure ambitious free trade deals while supporting our farmers and producers to grow and sell more great British food. We will ensure that consumers continue to have a wide range of choice of high-quality food products at affordable prices.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/may/25/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T20:00:36Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/25/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/may/25/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• Mitsui, which owns a 40% stake in the Greater Anglia rail franchise operator Abellio, was misnamed as Matsui (There may be trouble ahead for franchises, 19 May, page 42). • Characters in the Deadpool films are based on comics that are part of the wider Marvel universe.

An initial meeting of officials and diplomats in Brussels on the treatment of UK nationals post-Brexit found a mood in favour of a “smooth and simple” approach. Governments across Europe have different approaches to dealing with foreign EU nationals who move to live in their country, with some encouraging or demanding registration. Many in the meeting on Friday expressed the view that imposing an additional mandatory system on British nationals in their country would prove an unnecessary complication and expense. Britons who move to EU countries before the post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December 2020 will be granted rights similar to those available today, although with some gaps, including the right to onward movement between member states. The UK has opted to set up a new system for resident EU nationals, under which applicants will be charged £72 each. The former home secretary Amber Rudd vowed it would be as simple as setting up a shopping account with the high-end retailer LK Bennett. It subsequently emerged that the app for the system would not work on iPhones, a brand used by more than half of the adult population in the UK. Ingrid Taylor, 61, a translator who has lived in Germany for 30 years and who is a member of the lobby group British in Europe, said her fellow Britons abroad were keen to avoid unnecessary paperwork. “We need some kind of document to show that we have rights but it should be a declaratory system, not a long application that people have to fill out,” she said. “That will bring all sorts of problems and pitfalls, as we have seen with the 85-page permanent residence application form in the UK.” Of the 27 member states represented in the meeting in Brussels on Friday, about 10 were minded to establish a system similar to the UK’s with 17 were opposed, according to EU sources. Of those with the most UK nationals, Spain said it was undecided and representatives for France did not share their thoughts. Germany said it was undecided but was leaning towards an obligatory system for Britons, in order for the government to be able to recognise people conferred with rights under the withdrawal agreement and those not. The European commission proposed a uniform set of identification documents to be made available for UK nationals who make their home in the EU before the end of the transition period. A follow-up meeting on the issue is expected in September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/25/brendan-ingle-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T14:27:25Z","webTitle":"Brendan Ingle obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/25/brendan-ingle-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/25/brendan-ingle-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Brendan Ingle obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The boxing trainer Brendan Ingle, who has died aged 77 after a brain haemorrhage, could rightly be viewed as one of the most important men in the history of the sport in Britain. Not only did he train world champions, most notably Naseem Hamed, but he also changed the style in which they fought, by emphasising the importance of speed, reflexes and movement rather than the more traditional virtues of power and durability. From his gym in an old church hall in Wincobank in the tough east end of Sheffield, he produced a succession of brilliant fighters and effectively founded a boxing dynasty. His sons, Dominic and John, continue to work with current fighters who have become world champions, including Billy Joe Saunders and Kell Brook. Born in Dublin, one of 15 children of Charles Ingle, a dockworker, and Sarah (nee Lawless), Brendan went to Haddington Road school and began boxing as a boy. He followed one of his brothers to live in Sheffield as a teenager, in 1958, working in the steel industry and augmenting his income by becoming a professional fighter. By his own admission, it was soon apparent he would never reach championship standard, and when he retired in 1973 he had won 19 of his 33 paid contests. As it turned out, his story had only just begun. His local vicar asked Ingle to help run a youth club, and his ability to communicate with troubled and often violent youngsters quickly established him as a hugely respected member of the Sheffield community, who changed the lives of hundreds of those who came to use the St Thomas’ Boys and Girls Club boxing gym. Like so many of his generation, Ingle had grown up hero-worshipping the world heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali, and he tried to teach his young proteges to fight in the same style as “the Greatest”, emphasising the virtues of balance and footwork as much as aggression. Ingle-trained fighters became known for their defensive skills as much as their big punches. His first great fighter was Herol “Bomber” Graham, who did not become world champion but was good enough to become a British and European title holder. Such was his defensive prowess, Graham was avoided by peers such as Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank. To illustrate his skills, Ingle would tour prisons with his star fighter and invite inmates to give him their best shot. Graham, with his hands behind his back, would make them miss embarrassingly. But Ingle’s greatest single achievement was in shaping the career of “Prince” Naseem Hamed, who was brought to his gym as an unruly seven-year-old by his father. Ingle, perhaps embellishing the truth, said he had spotted Naz from his seat on a bus while the little boy was being picked on by a group of lads in the school playground. “Nobody could touch him,” Ingle said. “That’s when I knew he was special.” Once, while working for BBC Radio, I ventured to Sheffield to interview Graham before one of his title fights. Ingle was as proud of Hamed as he was of his top boxer. “Here, look at this cocky little thing,” he would say while encouraging the 11-year-old to bounce off the ropes of the ring, perform acrobatic hand springs and shadow-box. “One day he will be champion of the world.” Hamed went on to fulfil the prophecy, winning the world featherweight title in 1995 and becoming, for several years, the biggest star in British boxing. But the relationship with Ingle began to sour. “He told me he would not be running any more. Things changed. Money had become the most important thing to him.” The split with Hamed finally came in 1998 around the time of the boxer’s world title defence against Wayne McCullough. It was a falling out never properly reconciled. “I’m disappointed because he could have been greater and certainly more popular if he’d only listened to those who knew what they were doing,” Ingle said later. “People never saw the best of him. I believe that he could have been a world champion at every weight from flyweight to middleweight. The way he treated people like Frank Warren, who promoted his world title fights, it was scandalous. He couldn’t handle the wealth that came to him.” Despte the success and money he earned from boxing, Ingle remained unchanged. Living in a modest house on the same road as his gym, he was never one for flashy clothes or cars. Instead he would love to share his success stories, such as the British middleweight champion Brian Anderson. “He was a right tearaway,” Ingle would say. “I would say if it wasn’t for boxing, he would have been in prison. Well, I was right. He became the governor of Doncaster prison.” Other world champions he trained included the world cruiserweight champion Johnny Nelson, who described him as “the best trainer in the world”. The former world light-welterweight champion Junior Witter and former world light-heavyweight champion Clinton Woods also recognised his influence, and Warren said: “I will look back fondly at the many great moments we shared together in the sport.” Ingle was appointed MBE in 1998 for his services to boxing and work with young people, and in 2002 was awarded an honorary doctorate by Sheffield Hallam University. In 2008 Sheffield city council honoured him as a “Sheffield legend”. Although his memory had begun to fail in recent years, Ingle remained a regular in his gym, where his son Dominic continues as head trainer. He is survived by his wife, Alma (nee Chaloner), whom he married in 1961, their five children, Brendan, Bridget, Dominic, John and Tara, and 14 grandchildren, and by four brothers and three sisters. • Brendan Ingle, boxing trainer, born 19 June 1940; died 25 May 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2018/may/25/kimmel-on-trumps-north-korea-letter-not-what-youd-call-lincoln-esque","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T15:27:15Z","webTitle":"Kimmel on Trump's North Korea letter: 'Not what you'd call Lincoln-esque'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/25/kimmel-on-trumps-north-korea-letter-not-what-youd-call-lincoln-esque","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/may/25/kimmel-on-trumps-north-korea-letter-not-what-youd-call-lincoln-esque","fields":{"headline":"Kimmel on Trump's North Korea letter: 'Not what you'd call Lincoln-esque'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Late-night hosts on Thursday discussed the cancellation of Donald Trump’s planned summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, which was scheduled to take place in Singapore on 12 June. Stephen Colbert “The world continues to wait with bated breath and fully stocked bomb shelters to see if Donald Trump will have that summit with North Korean dictator and bored mozzarella ball, Kim Jong-un,” Stephen Colbert began. “Trump is hoping he can convince Kim to end his country’s nuclear program. If Trump is successful, it’ll be a monumental achievement; just ask him.” The host then showed footage of a reporter asking Trump if he thinks he deserves the Nobel peace prize. The president responded: “Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it.” “Now, it looks like Un is unlikely to attend,” Colbert explained. “Last week, he abruptly canceled talks with the South because it was holding joint military exercises with the US, which North Korea called a ‘provocation’ and a rehearsal for an invasion.” The host then mentioned John Bolton, who he called a “muppet on trial at the Hague”, and how the national security adviser’s comments about North Korea having to agree to a disarmament deal similar to the one Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi agreed to in 2003 threw a wrench in talks with the US. Colbert added: “Well, that turned out OK for Gaddafi, right? Should we ask him?” On Wednesday, Colbert continued, “Trump reassured a troubled world that the summit will occur, maybe, who knows,” showing footage of Trump saying “someday a date will happen”. “They’ve got no choice now because they’ve already made the commemorative coin marking the occasion of the summit,” the host joked. “It’s got Trump and Un, and I have to commend the designers, they were truly committed to jowl accuracy.” Jimmy Kimmel ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel also discussed the summit and Trump’s diplomatic skills. “Only Donald Trump could cancel a summit with Kim Jong-un in the morning and then have a meeting with Sylvester Stallone later in the day,” Kimmel said. “Soak it up: we’ll probably never see anything like this again. “The president cancelled his June 12 meeting with Kim Jong-un today after North Korea’s vice-minister of foreign affairs called Mike Pence a dummy, which did not sit well with one Donald Janice Trump,” the host continued. “It was the nuclear non-proliferation equivalent of ‘you break up with me, I break up with you.’” Referring to the letter Trump sent Kim Jong-un on Thursday, which formally announced the cancellation of the summit, Kimmel said: “This is some letter, by the way. Not exactly what you would call Lincolnesque.” “This to me is the most interesting part of the letter,” the host said, before reading an excerpt: “You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used.” In another excerpt, Trump says, “I felt a wonderful dialogue was building up between you and me.” “South Korea, who really has the most to lose in all of this, was reportedly caught totally off-guard,” Kimmel noted, reading aloud a statement released by a South Korean spokesperson. “They wrote: We are trying to figure out what president Trump’s intention is and what its exact meaning is.” “Well, welcoming to the club,” Kimmel replied, “because we are, too, every day.” Seth Meyers Finally, NBC’s Seth Meyers also weighed in on the subject of US-North Korean relations. “President Trump has spent weeks hyping his upcoming summit with North Korea,” Meyers began. “He’s earned glowing praise from the media, chants of Nobel from his crowds, and his government even made a commemorative coin to mark the occasion.” Meyers, who bought a commemorative coin for himself, showed it to the audience before cutting to news coverage about how the talks have stalled. “It’s my fault,” he said. “I should’ve learned my lesson after I bought commemorative coins for the completed border wall, biggest inauguration ever, Anthony Scaramucci’s first 100 days on the job, ‘cleared of all charges’ and People’s Sexist Man Alive. “Trump canceled the summit, which shouldn’t surprise anyone,” Meyers said. “He repeatedly made clear he had no idea what he was doing.” As an example, Meyers said that Trump, who wrote in his letter that North Korea should follow the path of denuclearization, was vague when asked how such a process would work. Asked by a reporter how denuclearization would take place, the president said: “I have a strong idea how it takes place, it must take place. I have very strong opinions on the subject.” “Once again,” Meyers concluded, “Donald Trump is a teenager who didn’t prepare his oral report and is now stalling for the bell to ring.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/may/25/marks-and-spencer-everywoman-exposed-high-street-myth-clothing-sales-slump","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T14:35:48Z","webTitle":"Marks and Spencer's everywoman exposed as a high street myth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/25/marks-and-spencer-everywoman-exposed-high-street-myth-clothing-sales-slump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/may/25/marks-and-spencer-everywoman-exposed-high-street-myth-clothing-sales-slump","fields":{"headline":"Marks and Spencer's 'everywoman' exposed as a high street myth","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"News just in: the “everywoman” who has long patronised Marks &amp; Spencer’s fashion department does not exist. She never has, of course, even if, two decades ago, it was easy for the retailer to behave as though she did. Back then, high street offerings were so limited that big retailers could produce broad-brush designs conceived to appeal to the masses. The world has long since moved on. We live in an age of individuality. Women of all ages expect to express themselves through their clothes. The myth that a woman turns 40 and immediately reaches for a beige waterfall cardigan has been debunked. The high street is now full of brands that serve older women with a clear point of difference. Many of them offer sleek, Scandi-influenced minimalism, as at Cos, or Hush, and Kin at John Lewis. On the M&amp;S website there is no such clarity, although there are standout pieces. The retailer’s highlights have always appealed to the fashion pack (this is where the front row gets its cashmere jumpers) and a chic, putty-coloured duster coat (£69), oversized denim jacket (£49.50) and suede mule sandals in modish primary colours (£25) would earn a style tick. But there is much else besides. Sometimes comfort is prioritised over aesthetics (as with a selection of spongy-soled trainers). At other times items feel over-designed, as in the case of an orange Bardot top with a ruched, elasticated neckline and pink-patterned, frilly hemmed three-quarter-length sleeves. Taken together, it lacks a point of view. This is a problem in today’s crowded, challenging market. Retailers not only need to cut through increased competition but face a shift in attitudes around consumption, with owning “stuff” no longer deemed the height of aspiration and concerns about fashion’s environmental impact hearteningly in vogue. Ironically, the retailer benefitting from this situation is Primark, which is on the verge of overtaking M&amp;S as Britain’s biggest retailer, according to GlobalData. Its new report predicts that M&amp;S’s UK clothing market share will fall from from 9.7% in 2008 to 7.6% in 2018, while Primark’s will rise from 4.4% to 7.0%. GlobalData also anticipates that M&amp;S’s plan to close more than 100 stores will hasten Primark’s fight to steal its crown. Primark is the very definition of that scourge of environmentalists – cheap, fast fashion – and it doesn’t sell online, even in this internet-obsessed moment. But clearly, there are a significant band of shoppers who will still brave the high street as long as the offering is clear and the price is low. This week, for £26, they could fill a basket with a silver, multi-strapped bikini (£6); a slashed-to-the-navel sequin palette bodysuit (£10); a neon-pink, transparent plastic handbag (£4), plus a dress announcing their membership of the “unicorn squad” (£6). This aesthetic may not be to your taste. It won’t be to everyone’s – and that is the point."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/15/my-life-in-sex-survivor-domestic-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T09:00:13Z","webTitle":"My life in sex: the survivor of domestic violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/15/my-life-in-sex-survivor-domestic-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/15/my-life-in-sex-survivor-domestic-violence","fields":{"headline":"My life in sex: the survivor of domestic violence","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I’m writing this while a woman whose name I can’t remember is asleep in my bed.

We no longer slept in the same bed, had sex once in the seven years since our only child was born and had stopped talking. Of course, this didn’t happen overnight. I trace its beginnings to the first time she hit me. She wasn’t often violent, maybe once a year, but every time it happened I retreated a little further. I was never unfaithful. I don’t think I’m old-fashioned, but having made my vows, “for better, for worse”, I just thought this was “for worse”. With hindsight, I recognise the self-delusion. At our child’s fifth birthday party, I had a gash on my forehead and a black eye and told people I’d walked into a door. When a friend asked, “What did he do to earn a beating like that?” we both laughed along. Since the separation, I have had sex with a dozen women. In some ways, it has been wonderful. I had totally lost any sense of myself as a sexual person, so to discover there are women who want to sleep with me has been affirming. And yet. I fell in love with my ex-wife when I was 19 and have loved her every day since. Alone, free, bewildered – I feel no guilt about my new promiscuity, but I do feel great sadness.

It’s 8.53pm, the sun has set, and around 100 Yemeni American men and boys sit cross-legged on the carpet, giving thanks and breaking fast for the seventh time this month. “It’s like gaining a new life,” says Arif Huskic, a Bosnian Muslim interfaith leader who has come to pray here. “In submitting to God we’re testing ourselves.” A hundred meters down the road, in this small Michigan city’s hottest new restaurant, an alert is sent to Tharia Begum’s iPhone. Her Muslim Pro app informs her group of six Bengali American girlfriends, all college students in their early 20s, that it’s time to sip chai and demolish the plates of chicken sheesh and tabouli ready and waiting in front of them. “The first day is hard,” says 21-year-old Amina Ahmed. “But the second day, it’s like a boulder’s been dropped on you. It gets easier the deeper you go into the month.” In Hamtramck, one of America’s quickest evolving cities and purportedly the first in the country to elect a majority-Muslim city council, Ramadan is observed by an increasingly diverse population. But at a time of deep introspection for Muslims around the world, this year’s month of fast in Hamtramck brings with it a sense of foreboding and a deeper connection to community as residents grapple with a climate of heightened Islamophobia ushered in by the presidency of Donald Trump. “Since Trump won, yes, we’ve become more alert, but it kind of brought our community together,” says 21-year-old Shahria Islam, picking through the last scraps on her plate. “We look out for each other because we know we’re targets.” At just two square miles, surrounded by the city of Detroit, Hamtramck was once a hub for Polish migrants drawn to the city by manufacturing jobs at the Dodge assembly plant that opened in the 1914. The factory’s closure in 1980 led to a relative exodus of eastern Europeans who once made up around 75% of the city’s population of over 20,000 residents. Yemeni and Bangladeshi migrants now make up close to a majority of the population. The brisk transformation is neatly underscored by the array of shop fronts and local businesses that line the city’s main high street, which stretches for less than a mile. A halal supermarket stands opposite a Polish food store; a hipster cafe showcasing local art is a few doors down from a Bengali clothes shop selling decorative silks and bright hijabs that shimmer in the spring sun. The brick walls are lined with murals: one depicts two covered Muslim women, another an American eagle flexing its wings. At one hipster cafe, among bookshelves lined with old first editions and neatly stacked art magazines, Saad Almasmari starts his day handing out business cards and pitching his vision for the city to anyone who will listen. The 31-year-old, who arrived in the US from Yemen in 2009 without a word of English, was elected to the six-person city council in 2015, marking the moment the non-partisan body became a Muslim majority. The news sparked uproar among conservative commentators who branded the city in a suite of Islamophobic slurs and suggested Hamtramck was now under sharia law. Almasmari, who had campaigned on guaranteeing better funding for public schools and promoting diversity, was taken aback. “I’m just a social person. I love politics and helping people through elected office,” he says raising an eyebrow. “To see how people reacted, it was just sad.” The ambitious father of three, who runs a local ice-cream business, is now running for state office, campaigning as he fasts. “It’s tough,” he says. “You’re knocking on people’s door and they come out and drink coffee or water, while you’re fasting and tired. But you have to smile at people, you have to act as the best person ever in front of the voters, even though you’re not eating for 15 hours.” Resistance to the Trump administration’s discrimination against Muslims has been fierce among Hamtramck’s mostly liberal, multicultural populace. Thousands took to the streets here when Trump announced his first travel ban in January 2017, which targeted a group of Muslim majority countries. In April, before a supreme court ruling on the ban, over 100 local business here shut down in protest. But Trump’s ban, which includes travellers from Yemen, has had direct impact on many here. Muad Almogari, a 32-year-old science and maths teacher at the local middle school, struggles to talk about his older sister, Afriqiya, who is languishing in rebel controlled Ibb province in Yemen’s west with her husband and children. Her visa application has been held in limbo since Trump’s ban came into force, and he worries every day that she will be killed in crossfire. He works a second job at an after-school program to make enough money to send $500 a month to his sister, meaning he only just keeps up with bills for himself. “It’s always there in the back of my head,” he says. “Whether she’s still alive, and who I’d blame if something happened.” Almogari says he made the gut-wrenching decision to avoid mosque during Ramadan, his reasoning is a sobering reminder of the climate many of America’s roughly 3.3 million Muslims continue to endure in the Trump era. “I don’t feel safe there,” he says. “I feel like something is going to happen. We don’t turnaround until the prayer is done. What if someone comes in shooting with a rifle like in Canada?” The month of Ramadan sees a significant increase in outreach at the Muslim family services centre, a not-for-profit organization helping Hamtramck’s poorest Muslim families – many of whom are refugees – by distributing food donations and care packages. 49.7% of the city’s residents live in poverty, according to US census data, a figure that soars almost four times above the national average. “People are more generous at this time of the year,” says Summi Akteer, the 33-year-old administrations director, adding the centre will deliver close to double the number of food packages, around 300, than they would throughout the rest of the year. The task keeps Akteer so busy she has no time to visit mosque after work and so travels straight home to cook burgers and pasta for her two children before they break fast. Although a recent study at Harvard University indicates that Muslim majority countries with longer fasting hours – those which undergo Ramadan in the summer – are likely to experience a minor negative economic impact, countries like the US with a relatively minor population of Muslims will face no tangible economic impact. To the Hamtramck’s south sits the 7,000-capacity Keyworth Stadium. John F Kennedy descended on the venue at the tail end of the 1960 presidential election campaign, addressing a majority Polish crowd and declaring Hamtramck to be the “strongest Democratic city in the United States”. Now the stadium hosts Detroit City FC, founded in 2012, who play in the National Premier Soccer League, America’s fourth tier of professional football. The season is just getting started here and the club draws a supporter base from across the city’s different ethnic groups. Salah Hadwa, 28, is sometimes among the Northern Guard, the most vocal and loyal of Detroit City FC’s fans who descend on matches in formation and let off smoke grenades in the stands. He often works matchdays as a food vendor, selling kebabs with local entrepreneur Moortadha Obeid. During last year’s Ramadan, in which the team played seven home games, the pair would arrive at the ground by 5am, set up their stall, and sleep in the stands before kickoff in a bid to preserve energy. This year they’re thankful there will only be three games at home throughout the month, all starting much later in the day. “Detroit City FC is part of Hamtramck, and Hamtramck is part of me,” says Hadwa, as the call to afternoon prayer is heard in the distance. “I will always call this place home. It is my city.” The large US flag flying at the stadium has been lowered to half mast to mark the school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas. On the field the local high school’s American football team practice on the astroturf as Hadwa looks on. “Any change is always kind of hard for people,” with reference to the city’s evolving makeup. “But there’s no change during Ramadan. The only change are the days it happens. You never let anything affect the fast. Especially not the negative things with Trump.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/25/aston-villa-steve-bruce-solace-torrid-few-months","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T21:30:38Z","webTitle":"Aston Villa’s Steve Bruce seeks solace on pitch after torrid few months","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/25/aston-villa-steve-bruce-solace-torrid-few-months","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/25/aston-villa-steve-bruce-solace-torrid-few-months","fields":{"headline":"Aston Villa’s Steve Bruce seeks solace on pitch after torrid few months","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When Steve Bruce is asked whether work on strengthening the team will start immediately if Aston Villa win promotion to the Premier League on Saturday, the first thought that comes into his head has nothing to do with new signings. “The one thing I need this year, more than any other year, is a holiday,” he says. The Championship can be a grind at the best of times with all those Saturday-Tuesday fixtures and all the more so when a 46-game season is extended by another three weeks because of the play-offs, but Bruce is looking forward to a break for reasons that transcend football. This has been a devastating year for the Villa manager, who lost his father, Joe, in February and his mother, Sheenagh, less than three months later. The pain and grief are never far from the surface but Bruce, somehow, has managed to carry on working, trying as best he can to lose himself in the job while also taking solace from the heart-warming response he has received from inside football. “You know something?” he says. “In the industry we’re in, there is so much negativity and so-called bad people around everywhere, and when something happens like what’s happened to me, with how cruel it is, then the number of messages of support and cards I’ve had has been quite remarkable. The football world then feels for you because to lose your mum and dad in a matter of 12 weeks has been the most traumatic experience that anybody could cope with.” Bruce pauses for a moment, puffs out his cheeks and carries on. “On a lighter note, my mum always enjoyed Wembley, so she would have been getting her outfit,” he adds, smiling. “She loved Wembley. My dad wouldn’t have gone. He’d have said: ‘I can’t stand all that crap, Steve. I don’t know how you do all that and stand there, I couldn’t do that for the life of me.’ But my mum was a total one-off and my biggest supporter, and she was terrific.” It is extremely moving listening to Bruce and not surprising to hear him say that, in the context of what he has been through over the last few months, winning promotion with Villa would be the most satisfying achievement of his managerial career. In truth, it has been a difficult assignment at Villa from day one. Appointed in October 2016, when Villa were 19th in the Championship, Bruce remembers sitting down with Steve Round, the technical director, after his first game and having a brutally honest conversation about the state of the club. “My initial thought, and Steve agreed with me, was: ‘Steve, we’ve got to stop the rot here and just keep the club in the Championship.’ That’s how low I thought it had got.” Years of failure had taken their toll. “There was no association with the players [and the fans] any more, it had broken,” Bruce says. “So to try and mend that, the only thing you can do is try and get a bit of honesty and endeavour back and win a few matches. I do believe the supporters have enjoyed seeing what we have got at the moment. It has taken some time and certainly wasn’t there when I arrived. There were times when they wanted to rip my head off and rip the heads off the players.” Bruce recruited experienced campaigners to turn things around, including Glenn Whelan, Ahmed Elmohamady, John Terry and Mile Jedinak, all of whom “could handle playing for Aston Villa”, and also made the most of the loan market by adding Robert Snodgrass, Josh Onomah, Sam Johnstone and Lewis Grabban. Yet the player he “practically tried to build a team around” was already at the club. Jack Grealish, who burst on to the scene in an FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool three years ago, has been outstanding in the second half of the season, so much so that Bruce thought the 22-year-old had an outside chance of making England’s World Cup squad. “He’s got that ability to get you off your seat and go ‘wow’, which is quite unique in this country,” Bruce says. He hopes Grealish will give Villa “another year whatever league we are in”, but no one inside the club is under any illusions about the ramifications of defeat against Fulham. “There will be difficult times ahead, I would have thought,” says Bruce, alluding to concerns about the potential financial fallout. For Bruce, however, it is all about thinking positively, which has not always been easy over the last few months. The 57-year-old, who is chasing a fifth promotion to the top flight, deserves a break in more ways than one, and few outside Fulham will begrudge him if he heads off on holiday as a Premier League manager once again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/may/26/uk-biggest-fund-standard-life-gars-alan-miller","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T06:00:49Z","webTitle":"‘Ridiculously complex’: Top financier blasts UK’s biggest fund","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/26/uk-biggest-fund-standard-life-gars-alan-miller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/may/26/uk-biggest-fund-standard-life-gars-alan-miller","fields":{"headline":"‘Ridiculously complex’: Top financier blasts UK’s biggest fund","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s the biggest single stock market fund in Britain, holding nearly £20bn of small investors’ cash. Yet while the FTSE 100 has soared, hitting a record high this week, the fund, managed by Standard Life, has made nothing for investors for five years. Now Alan Miller, husband of anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller and a senior figure in the fund management industry, is calling it “potentially one of the greatest mis-selling scandals in the UK”. The fund is called Standard Life Global Absolute Return Strategies (Gars). It was launched in 2006 with a golden promise – a hedge fund for the masses that would make 5% a year more than savers would get from bank accounts and, crucially, without the usual volatility of the stock market. In the early years the money gushed in. The UK’s biggest investment advisers, Hargreaves Lansdown, put Gars on to its “Wealth 150” list of top funds for small investors. Very quickly it became the UK’s top-selling fund. But over the past five years the fund’s performance has dived. Someone who invested in Gars in May 2013 has seen their money grow just 0.7% since then, compared with the 43.4% gain in the FTSE All Share Index. Over the past year, as the FTSE 100 has reached a new peak, the fund has fallen by 2.8% in value. The returns on Gars are so poor that even if investors had left their cash in the bank five years ago at the current historically low deposit rates, they would have earned more. “It has been marketed to advisers [to sell on to ordinary customers] and institutions alike on the basis of an impossible dream,” says Miller, pointing to the fund’s marketing material. Standard Life tells investors that the fund “aims to provide positive investment returns in all market conditions over the medium to long term”. But Miller dismisses this as pure fantasy. “This is complete balderdash. How can any fund produce positive returns in all market conditions?” The Gars fund uses derivatives to “short” some stocks and markets – in other words, make a bet that the price is going to fall – while going “long” in others. By any measure it is among the most complex funds sold to small investors in the UK, judged by its latest fund factsheet. It tells investors that the fund is invested in a number of “relative value strategies”, including a “Swedish flattener v Canadian steepener”, while its “directional strategies” include “Long INR v CHF”. INR is the Indian rupee and CHF is the Swiss franc. “It is incomprehensible,” says Miller. “I challenge that anyone, advisers or consultants, could possibly understand the strategies in which the fund participates.” Miller, who runs SCM Direct with his wife Gina, has been a constant thorn in the side of the fund management industry, campaigning against high charges. He describes Gars as “a busy fool”, racking up charges for investors by incurring significant dealing costs. “In short, this is an expensive, ridiculously complex, derivative-based fund with significant trading costs and counterparty risks accompanied by a delusional aim. “I am never sure which amazes me more – that the Financial Conduct Authority allows such a ridiculously complex fund to be sold to retail investors, or how many institutions and their advisers still invest in it given its recent performance?” Standard Life investment director Chris Nichols rejects any suggestion of mis-selling. “Mr Miller is entitled to his opinion, but I am very confident we can face down any accusation of mis-selling. We have made every effort to ensure clients understand and certainly have never tried to dumb things down.” He adds that until the end of 2015 Gars was meeting its targets, but that an unexpectedly “stretched and elongated period” in which interest rates have stayed low has hurt the fund. “It is our critical priority to restore confidence in the fund,” he says, adding that it remains popular with investors looking for a safety-first approach and low volatility. What about the financial firms that sold the fund? Hargreaves Lansdown says it removed Gars from its recommended list in 2013, but insists it can still make sense within a “diversified portfolio”. It said: “It’s a plodder rather than a leaper and as such will endure periods when it looks pedestrian,” it said. While Miller is the fund’s harshest critic, he is far from alone in observing its performance failings, and in recent year it has suffered significant outflows. Brian Dennehy of FundExpert says: “We used to be supporters of this fund, but have been selling out for the last five years, with little remaining. It has always been difficult to understand what is precisely driving the fund at any one time. Even a cursory tracking of performance in recent years would have got you out of this fund. You didn’t need to understand what was under the bonnet, you just needed to observe that it had stopped moving forward.” One group of advisers remain loyal to the fund. Standard Life has set up an advice business, called 1825, which has snapped up IFA firms around the UK. It said Gars accounts for “5% of the total portfolio fund allocations” made by 1825 advisers. Another group that heavily invests in Gars is Standard Life employees. Standard Life said: “The largest single investor within Gars continues to be Standard Life’s defined benefit scheme for employees.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/25/north-korea-suummit-donald-trump-white-house","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T11:52:56Z","webTitle":"The North Korea farce makes it clear again: Trump is dangerous | Simon Tisdall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/25/north-korea-suummit-donald-trump-white-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/25/north-korea-suummit-donald-trump-white-house","fields":{"headline":"The North Korea summit farce makes it clear again: Trump is dangerous","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This is where hubris and arrogance lead. By indefinitely postponing his summit with Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, in a fit of petulance and political cowardice, Donald Trump has squandered a golden opportunity for peace on the Korean peninsula, plunged the Asia-Pacific region into a period of renewed uncertainty, blindsided America’s allies, and resurrected the dread prospect of nuclear war. All may not yet be lost. But that’s no thanks to Trump. The author of The Art of the Deal thought he alone could pull off what had eluded successive presidents in Washington. He prematurely hailed Kim’s decision to free three US citizens as a major breakthrough. He basked in utterly ludicrous talk, notably from Boris Johnson, of a Nobel peace prize. When Kim made clear “denuclearisation” did not mean what Trump thought it meant, he meekly offered more concessions. In short, Trump messed up. He rashly promised more than he could deliver. Then, when Kim balked at unrealistic US demands, he got cold feet. North Korea’s measured response offers some hope. The US decision was regrettable, it said. But Pyongyang remained open to talks with the US at any time. Trump should study this statement to see how the diplomatic game works. It cast the White House in the troublemaker role usually reserved for Pyongyang. It grabbed the moral high ground before a watching world. And it reiterated the North’s longstanding aim: to establish direct, bilateral communication with the US, bypassing the stalled multilateral talks process. Attempts to make the best of a bad job cannot hide the possibility that a rare chance to bring North Korea in from the cold may have been permanently missed. Most worrying is the effect of this epic snub on Kim and his apparently genuine efforts to improve relations with the west. Sceptical North Korean generals will say, “We told you so,” and push for more, and bigger, nukes and missiles. Kim’s own position could be in jeopardy. His politically and personally risky policy of reform at home and engagement abroad was blown apart by Trump on the very day he voluntarily blew up his nuclear test site. At risk, too, are Pyongyang’s rapprochement with South Korea and President Moon Jae-in’s exemplary bridge-building. Trump was the undeserving beneficiary of Moon’s efforts, which took flight at the Winter Olympics. That opening may have been blown, thanks also to his national security adviser, John Bolton, his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and other lower-order Team Trump chicken hawks. Moon declared himself “perplexed” – a feeling probably shared in Tokyo. Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, has worked hard and thanklessly to keep Trump on course. China’s leaders will experience mixed emotions as they survey the smoking ruins. Increased regional instability and resumed US sabre-rattling on its doorstep are not in Beijing’s interest. Nor will China welcome further, alarming evidence of Trump’s whimsical irrationality. On the other hand, the upset is a timely reminder to Kim about who, when the fog clears, are his only true friends – and the centrality of Beijing to any eventual security deal. China may also be less inclined to observe US-inspired international sanctions. Indeed, a return to the Obama-era policy of maximum economic pressure may no longer be credible. If so, military options will once more gain traction in Washington. Given Trump’s now familiar mercurial behaviour, it’s possible all this could change tomorrow – even that the June summit will be back on again. Trump indicated as much on Friday, suggesting airily that he and the North Koreans were “playing games”. This is no way to conduct a deadly serious nuclear weapons negotiation. And it raises a much bigger question. How much longer can the international community pretend that having a narcissistic amateur running the White House is a tolerable or even manageable state of affairs? Just look at the global wreckage after 18 months of Trump. A landmark climate change pact trashed. Protectionism, trade wars and divisive border walls on the rise. Hopes of peace in Israel-Palestine, and dozens of Palestinian lives, sacrificed to the presidential ego. A potentially catastrophic dereliction of duty under way in Syria. Continuing appeasement of Russia. And a new Middle East war in the making, after Trump’s unilateral renunciation of the Iran nuclear deal. It is no exaggeration to say US authority and credibility on the world stage are now at stake. This is not leadership. It is day-by-day, manmade chaos masquerading as policy. It’s not America First. It’s America Foolish. Yet there is no end in sight to the damaging tomfoolery. Trump does not learn from his mistakes. He just makes bigger ones. For Britain, soon to host him, the Korean lesson is clear: this US president should carry a health warning wherever he goes. Keep him at arm’s length. For he is weak, cowardly and dangerous – and not, on any account, to be trusted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/may/25/donald-trump-north-korea-summit-reversal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T15:03:22Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump says North Korea summit could be back on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/25/donald-trump-north-korea-summit-reversal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/25/donald-trump-north-korea-summit-reversal","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump says North Korea summit could be back on","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Donald Trump has suggested his summit with Kim Jong-un could still go on as planned, marking yet another dramatic reversal for the US president who just a day earlier canceled the meeting in a letter to the North Korean leader. “We’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday, adding that his administration was in talks with Pyongyang and the summit was still possible on its originally scheduled date of 12 June. “They very much want to do it. We’d like to do it,” he added. Asked if North Korea was playing games, Trump responded, “Everybody plays games.” Trump tweeted later on Friday that the US was having “very productive talks” with Pyongyang about the possible summit. The president’s comments came after North Korea said it was still willing to engage in direct talks, calling the planned summit between Trump and Kim “desperately necessary”. “We express our willingness to sit down face-to-face with the US and resolve issues anytime and in any format,” North Korea’s vice foreign minister Kim Kye-gwan said in a statement. “Our commitment to doing our best for the sake of peace and stability for the world and the Korean Peninsula remains unchanged, and we are open-minded in giving time and opportunity to the US.” Earlier on Friday, Trump welcomed the statement as “warm and productive”. “We will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace,” he tweeted. North Korea’s response moved to place the blame for the failed meeting on the US. It has consistently worked to portray itself as the driver of progress in a relationship that has remained hostile for over six decades. Kim Jong-un has been crafting an image of a responsible statesman against an erratic Trump. “Internally we have been quietly giving President Trump high marks for making a decision no other American president had the courage to pursue,” Kim Kye-gwan said. Trump abruptly called off the summit – which was set to take place in Singapore – on Thursday, blaming “tremendous anger and open hostility” in recent North Korean statements. But Pyongyang said Trump’s “unilateral cancellation of the summit was unexpected and very regrettable”. US officials also complained North Koreans did not show up to preparatory meetings and would not answer calls. US allies in Asia were blindsided by Trump’s cancelation. The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, called an emergency meeting just before midnight local time, saying: “I am very perplexed and it is very regrettable that the North Korea-US summit will not be held. “Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the establishment of permanent peace are historic tasks that can neither be abandoned nor delayed,” Moon said. A photo of the meeting released by the presidential office showed Moon with a deep frown. North Korea “remains sincere in … making efforts on denuclearization and peace building”, said Cho Myoung-gyon, the South’s minister in charge of inter-Korean affairs. Japan’s foreign minister, Taro Kono, said it was “meaningless to hold a summit if it does not bring about progress”, but added he would continue to support the idea of a Trump-Kim meeting at a later date. “The important thing is not the meeting itself but that there are opportunities to move towards resolving the nuclear and missile issues,” the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters. John Tierney, executive director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said: “The first rule of diplomacy is to always consult your allies, yet our key allies in the region were blindsided by the move. President Trump can blame North Korea’s hostile rhetoric for his decision, but the reality is that the Trump administration had no unified diplomatic strategy from the beginning.” Jim Mattis, the US defense secretary, told reporters that diplomats were working to get the summit back on track and said there could be “possibly some good news”. National security experts were nonetheless left puzzled by the mixed messages coming out of the White House, which some argued would undermine talks. “Official statements by the president were once taken as their word,” said Samantha Vinograd, who served on Barack Obama’s National Security Council and also served under the Bush administration. “In the span of 24 hours, we’ve gone from President Trump writing an actual letter to Kim canceling the summit, to a day later saying the summit might be back on. “Why does anyone believe him? Would this lead any other world leader, whether an ally or an enemy, to think it’s just a negotiating tactic? Vinograd also questioned how the Trump administration planned to engage with Pyongyang on policy if the conversation was so fixated on logistics. “That doesn’t give me a lot of confidence that we’ve made progress with the North Koreans on the substance of the negotiations,” she said. Senator Lindsey Graham, a hawkish Republican from South Carolina, said he had spoken with Trump directly and insisted the president was still committed to the negotiations. “He’s made a decision – the president has – that he’s going to end North Korea’s nuclear program,” Graham told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Friday. “It’s only a question of how and when.” The Associated Press contributed reporting"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/25/flotation-of-saudi-oil-giant-aramco-likely-to-be-delayed-until-2019","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T16:05:51Z","webTitle":"£75bn flotation of Saudi oil giant likely to be delayed until 2019","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/25/flotation-of-saudi-oil-giant-aramco-likely-to-be-delayed-until-2019","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/25/flotation-of-saudi-oil-giant-aramco-likely-to-be-delayed-until-2019","fields":{"headline":"£75bn flotation of Saudi oil giant likely to be delayed until 2019","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The stock market flotation of Saudi Arabia’s state oil company is likely to be delayed until next year, according to the country’s energy minister, confirming mounting speculation that the world’s biggest IPO was running behind schedule. Saudi Aramco plans to raise $100bn (£75bn) by selling a 5% stake, dwarfing the $21bn raised by China’s Alibaba Group and valuing the business at $2tn. Stock exchanges in London, New York and Hong Kong have been lobbying for the right to float the company, with Saudi officials repeatedly maintaining it was on track to take place later this year. In January the firm lauded a royal decree converting Saudi Aramco into a joint stock company, a key step allowing it to have more shareholders than its existing one, the Saudi kingdom. However, industry watchers have been increasingly sceptical that the timeline was likely to be kept, with British officials saying recently that the 2018 target would be missed. Doubts have also been fuelled by the lack so far of any prospectus for investors. On Friday, the Saudi energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, appeared to officially confirm a delay. “Most likely it will be in 2019 but we will not know until the announcement has been made,” he told a conference in St Petersburg. “The timing I think will depend on the readiness of the market, rather than the readiness of the company or the readiness of Saudi Arabia,” said Falih, who added that the company was ready. The IPO of Saudi Aramco is a crucial part of the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman’s “Vision 2030”, a plan to diversify the country’s economy away from oil. One sign that London is a frontrunner to host the flotation is that Saudi Aramco has engaged a reputation firm to see what “key stakeholders” think of the firm. On Friday the Saudi-dominated oil cartel Opec and Russia signalled the beginning of the end for their production cuts. For the past 18 months the crude producers, who account for more than 40% of global supplies, have been reducing output to bring supply and demand back into balance. Oil prices recently hit $80 a barrel, in part because of the Opec curbs but also because of the US reimposing sanctions on Iran and production falling in crisis-stricken Venezuela. The oil cartel is under pressure from the US, China and India to stabilise prices. Donald Trump said in April: “Opec is at it again.” He tweeted: “Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!” Opec’s secretary general, Mohammad Barkindo, said on Friday that the tweet had sparked a discussion about easing production cuts. “We pride ourselves as friends of the United States,” Barkindo said. Sources told Reuters that Opec and Russia are likely to increase production by about 1 million barrels a day. The news resulted in oil prices falling back to $77. Experts said the market had flipped quickly over the past six months from a world awash in oil to one where there are concerns over supplies. Alan Gelder, the vice-president of oil markets at analysts Wood Mackenzie, said: “All of a sudden you’ve got Opec saying we’ve taken barrels off the market and the International Energy Agency declaring they’ve [Opec hit their target]. “Meanwhile, Venezuela is declining and the market is not sure if that decline will stabilise or keep going. You’ve got an uncertain volume that will be taken off by US sanctions on Iran. And you’ve got the big source of supply in recent years, which is US [shale] production in the Permian [basin], now appears to be infrastructure-constrained.” The analyst said the signals from the Saudis and Russians made the prospect of oil hitting $100 a barrel – as the French oil giant Total recently said was possible – less likely. Gelder said a meeting of Opec and Russia next month would likely result in them agreeing to increase production."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/27/jess-phillips-i-had-an-abortion-and-will-fight-for-rights-for-everyone","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T05:00:15Z","webTitle":"I had an abortion and I will keep fighting for this right for all | Jess Phillips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/27/jess-phillips-i-had-an-abortion-and-will-fight-for-rights-for-everyone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/27/jess-phillips-i-had-an-abortion-and-will-fight-for-rights-for-everyone","fields":{"headline":"I had an abortion and I will keep fighting for this right for all","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"One thing might be pulled out of what I am writing, the most pedestrian thing, the most common. But it will still be the thing that is talked about even if I am simply one in every four women. My abortion was nothing special. I cannot remember the date it happened. I never wonder. It was my third pregnancy and I have gone on to have another since then. Still, I wrote a book about speaking the truth and didn’t include this fact. I like to think it’s because it’s not a big deal, but the truth is I still worried about the reaction, especially from my constituents. But the women in Ireland telling their stories inspired me and the result gives me faith in how far we’ve come. I have two memories of it. The first was bumping into the doctor who had done my consultation in the wine aisle at Sainsbury’s. I felt awkward, but of course he didn’t recognise me – I am one in four, remember. The second thing was the waiting room. I remember the luggage of the women I sat among, each bag with Ryanair flight tags on. These women were not a mile from their home. They would never run in to the clinic staff in their local Sainsbury’s. These women had been trafficked by a state incapable of taking responsibility for their health. I wept every day last week, not for what might have been but, instead, with hope for what was coming in Ireland. I shall allow myself this week to read every uplifting story told on #hometovote. I can now fold up my slogan T-shirt and put away my “Repeal” necklace and fight again, because we must not convince ourselves that the battle has been won. Vigilance is vital. When I went with my husband to that clinic, there were no protesters outside, no one filmed me, shouted at me, made me feel as if I was a murderer. The same cannot be said for today. Today, there are protesters and we are fighting the backlash of wars we thought we had won. In Wales and Scotland, braver policymakers than those who sit in Westminster have ensured that women seeking early abortion pills from the NHS can undergo the process (akin to having an early miscarriage) in the comfort and security of their homes. Currently, women are forced to sit in a clinic to take the medication and in the worst cases then have their “miscarriage” on the bus home. I have had a miscarriage and I can tell you I would rather not have done so on the bus from Waterloo. No legislation is needed to make this happen; it is simply a decision in the gift of the chief medical officer in each nation, in agreement with their health minister. So come on, Jeremy Hunt, why are you so silent? Theresa May claims to be a unionist. However, she seems to ignore that she is in fact the prime minister of Northern Ireland as well, where women are still unable to access abortion at home. In spite of the glorious decision in the Republic of Ireland, there will still be Ryanair bags at Birmingham abortion clinics but from Belfast instead of Dublin and Cork. Challenge the government on this and they will spout stuff about devolution, which doesn’t really stack up when thinking of women miscarrying on buses in Bury St Edmunds. So it shouldn’t make any difference to women in Belfast either. Political will is what it takes. There is no way, for example, that May would allow Northern Ireland to stop all cancer care. Every time Labour women get together to try to press forward on the issue of women’s reproductive rights, we sit in fear that we cannot push for any shift in our own laws (unchanged since 1967) because we worry that our efforts could backfire and result in us going backwards. Maria Caulfield MP, the Conservative vice-chair for women, says she wants to start the debate of reducing the time limit on abortion to 12 weeks. The only time I have ever been made to feel like a stupid girl who killed her baby was listening to Caulfield speaking in parliament on the issue. I was in fact the married mother of one at the time of my abortion. The government gave some of the proceeds of the tampon tax money to a pro-life (that is, anti-choice) charity to spread their bile. Our worries are real. Theresa May and her “I am a feminist” T-shirt do not bring me comfort. We must not take our eye off the ball – we can cheer for our Irish sisters this week but this week we must press on, because while Ireland steps forward much of the world steps back. Perhaps my stepping forward – revealing my abortion –will be newsworthy in a way Jeremy Hunt’s prostate exam wouldn’t be. The battle to make women’s health a mundane reality is far from won."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"education/2018/may/25/tories-academies-policies-are-failing-primary-age-children","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T15:18:27Z","webTitle":"Tories’ academies policies are failing primary age children | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/25/tories-academies-policies-are-failing-primary-age-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/may/25/tories-academies-policies-are-failing-primary-age-children","fields":{"headline":"Tories’ academies policies are failing primary age children","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Michael Rosen questions the success of school academies (Education, 22 May) but does not mention the worst case scenario that can occur – closure. Burnt Yates school, in north Yorkshire, a small jewel of a rural primary school with excellent buildings, fields and woodland and an active and generous trust, must close at the end of this academic year. When it was backed into a corner it could not find an academic chain to take it on; amalgamation came to nought and now the school must close. Burnt Yates school was founded and endowed in 1760; over 250 years of excellent education have taken place since then, supported until recently by one of the very best education authorities in the country. After a series of disastrous decisions by the current local authority, a poor Ofsted report put the seal on the school’s fate. Huge efforts were made by parents, governors, trustees, our MP and the local community but to no avail. The money was not there and closure was the only way forward. I blame Michael Gove. Without his academies plan and the virtual destruction of local accountability, Burnt Yates and the six other north Yorkshire schools that have already closed recently would be still providing excellent relevant education to rural communities. We are poorer because of what is happening. Andrea Ives Headteacher, 1970-1984 • The civil servant quoted in Michael Rosen’s latest Letter from a curious parent was being economical with the truth. His department does publish data about sponsored academy primary schools, which have been forced out of council control. SATs results continue to show that these schools (and free schools) do worse than average. That is not in itself surprising because sponsored academies have more pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. The more telling statistic is that results should get better when sponsored academies have had more time to “improve”. They don’t. I was a primary school governor in Cornwall. The governors were jettisoned. The head jumped before he was pushed. The school disappeared, taken over by a neighbour. SATs results under the inaptly named ACE academy chain are further below average than ever. Last year’s results at other ACE schools were not a lot better. The inadequate supervision of academies has allowed ACE to take on more schools and open a new free school despite modest results.

Those who bothered to open what looked like junk mail discovered that part of the road had been sold to a private company and they would have to buy a £2.50-a-week permit to leave their cars outside their homes where free parking had been available for 50 years. They also had to pay a £75 deposit or face a £60 further charge. One resident, Elizabeth Thomson, was caught unawares, having been away. “I came back on Sunday night in the dark and rain and parked where I have for the past 10 years,” she says. “I woke up the next morning to a £60 parking ticket, and, in the daylight, I could see two signs warning of charges which had apparently gone up on Friday evening. “Most of my neighbours were upset because they’d been fined on Saturday morning. The letter had made no mention of when the charges would come into force, and they were imposed two weeks before the parking bays had been marked out, and less than two days after the letters were received, giving insufficient time to apply for a permit. Overnight, our road was turned into a private car park.” The residents’ plight exposes the injustices of unregulated parking enforcement which controls parking on private land, including supermarkets, stations and hospitals. There are no rules on how much notice a company must give before imposing fees and restrictions. Although legally private parking enforcers are not allowed to issue fines or penalties, they can charge for costs incurred when their terms and conditions are breached. Many demand three-figure sums for minor breaches of their terms. The £1.5bn industry earns most of its revenue from these charges, which are supposed to deter motorists from abusing the system, but which are increasingly imposed on those who have paid in good faith but fallen foul of a minor technicality. Last year, the number rose 26% to 5.5m, fuelled by automated number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras which record vehicles entering and leaving car parks. Campaigners claim inadequate signs, unreasonable terms and exorbitant demands by some operators exploit motorists, and simple measures such as automated barriers and ticket machines synchronised with cameras, are avoided to boost revenue. The Observer has featured the cases of drivers charged for confusing the letter O and zero when keying their number plate into a ticket machine. Others have been threatened with court action for calculating the length of their stay from the time stamped on the ticket, rather than the time cameras clocked them entering. The Aldershot residents are likely to be among many who are suddenly faced with punitive costs as housing associations sell off garages and parking areas to investment companies, and private companies are hired to enforce new restrictions. Thomson lives on a former council estate of roads and cul-de-sacs built in the 1960s and sold to a housing association 30 years later. They have now discovered that only part of each cul-de-sac had been adopted by the council. The sections at the end, containing homes and garage blocks, remained in the ownership of Vivid Housing Association. Last year, Vivid sold off the garages and adjoining land to Conshurst Investments, which introduced the parking restrictions, including bollards to prevent residents reaching their driveways. One blue-badge holder now has to leave his car a five-minute walk away from his home. Vivid says it sold the land to fund more affordable housing and was only obliged to notify those who rented the garages. Stephen Davies, director of Conshurst, says Park Direct was contracted to enforce new controls, and claims Conshurst manages the site well, preventing fly tipping or dumping of vehicles. But he confirms Park Direct receives no payment from Conshurst for its services or any part of the permit fee, adding: “I can’t see how they could earn anything else other than levying charges.” Park Direct has not responded to our requests for a comment. Punitive ticketing has soared since wheel-clamping was outlawed on private land six years ago. The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 allows private parking firms in England and Wales to pursue the registered keeper of a vehicle for unpaid charges, regardless of whether they were the driver. They can obtain addresses from the DVLA provided they signed up to one of the two accredited trade associations, the BPA and the IPC. Both require members to abide by a code of practice and to cooperate with their independent appeals process. Critics question their impartiality, given they are funded by member companies. In February, a private member’s bill calling for statutory regulation of the industry received its second reading. A similar bill is being proposed in Scotland. Last year, the Society of Chief Officers of Trading Standards in Scotland inspected 71 car parks and found one in three were in breach of trading law. Meanwhile, motorists have to take pot luck with the appeals schemes. The IPC has instructed members and appeals adjudicators to overturn charges issued when a zero is confused with an 0, as the mistake is too trifling to constitute a breach of terms and conditions. Popla – the appeals process operated by the BPA – however, has found against many who have made the same mistake. It says it’s unable to allow an appeal based solely on mitigating circumstances, even if it’s clear that the driver paid. The last resort is legal action and a court may decide a charge for a typo is unreasonable under the terms of the Consumer Rights Act. The Aldershot residents are on shakier ground, according to Sarah Garner, a solicitor at DAS Law: “An owner of land has the right to determine parking restrictions,” she says. “As no contract was previously in existence, reasonable notice would not have to be provided to change existing parking terms. “However, to be bound by the terms of a contract, an individual would have be aware of what they were agreeing and, if residents had not opened the letters, and there was no signage, they may be able to argue they were not legally bound to comply.” Thomson, now told she owes £160, has refused to pay on principle. “I can’t believe that roads that have been used as roads for the past 50 years can be converted overnight into private car parks and it be accepted as legal,” she says. When it pays to appeal Bob Hawkes’s refusal to pay an unfair parking charge notice was vindicated when Parking Eye, Britain’s biggest private parking firm, took legal action against him and had its case dismissed by a court. Hawkes had parked at a pay-on-exit car park at the Royal Free Hospital in London when taking his wife to A&amp;E and paid the £3 demanded after entering his car registration in the ticket machine. “A week later I received a demand for £100 for underpayment,” he says. Popla, the independent appeals service, upheld the charge when he complained. When Hawkes refused to pay, Parking Eye – which earns an estimated £25m a year from charge notices – launched legal proceedings. “My initial view was the machine was faulty because it had charged me for one hour rather than two,” Hawkes says. “I then discovered that the automated number plate recognition cameras that record vehicles entering and leaving were not linked to the payment machine.” The court dismissed the case when Parking Eye’s solicitor was unable to prove the ticket machine had been functioning correctly. Parking Eye says it operates an audited appeals process. “If a driver disagrees with our decision they have the option to appeal to Popla.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/25/number-of-windrush-cases-passes-5000-mark","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T13:51:15Z","webTitle":"Number of Windrush cases passes 5,000","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/25/number-of-windrush-cases-passes-5000-mark","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/25/number-of-windrush-cases-passes-5000-mark","fields":{"headline":"Number of Windrush cases passes 5,000","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The number of potential Windrush cases reported to the Home Office has passed the 5,000 mark. They are among a total of 13,000 calls to a specialist unit set up within the department last month. The Home Office also disclosed that more than 850 people now have documentation following an appointment with the dedicated team. The latest figures were revealed as the Home Office quietly announced the departure from the department of the director general of immigration enforcement, Hugh Ind. Ind, who is moving to work at the Cabinet Office, was one of a number of officials questioned by the home affairs committee over Windrush and removal targets. Amber Rudd, the then home secretary, told the committee that there were no targets for deportation and then was forced to resign when leaked letters emerged that suggested she knew that there was. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, announced on Thursday that legislation had been introduced to bring into force a package of measures designed to help end the crisis. Under the government’s scheme, fees for citizenship applications will be waived for Commonwealth nationals who settled in the UK before 1973 and children of the Windrush generation who joined their parents before they turned 18. Applicants will need to meet the good character requirements in place for all citizenship applications – but they will not need to take a “knowledge of language and life in the UK” test or attend a citizenship ceremony. Members of the Windrush group who have left the UK but are seeking to return will be able to apply for relevant documentation free of charge. Last week, it emerged that 63 cases are being investigated in detail as part of efforts to check whether anyone was wrongly removed or deported as a result of the failings. Theresa May’s “hostile environment” policies introduced when she was home secretary require employers, NHS staff, private landlords and other bodies to demand evidence of people’s citizenship or immigration status. Members of the Windrush generation, who arrived in the UK from 1948 onwards, as well as their children, have been wrongly targeted by the policies. Among those caught up are people forced out of work, in some cases for years, and unable to claim welfare support, as well as individuals wrongfully detained and in some cases deported. Lawyers have begun preparing group compensation claims on behalf of members of the Windrush generation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/25/fans-left-with-invalid-tickets-in-ed-sheeran-anti-tout-scheme-viagogo","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T12:16:44Z","webTitle":"Fans left with 'invalid' tickets in Ed Sheeran anti-tout scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/25/fans-left-with-invalid-tickets-in-ed-sheeran-anti-tout-scheme-viagogo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/25/fans-left-with-invalid-tickets-in-ed-sheeran-anti-tout-scheme-viagogo","fields":{"headline":"Fans left with 'invalid' tickets in Ed Sheeran anti-tout scheme","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Fans holding tickets for Ed Sheeran’s UK stadium tour purchased through secondary ticketing site Viagogo were denied access to the first night in accordance with previously publicised plans to crack down on touts and inflated resale prices. Joint promoters Kilimanjaro Live, DHP Family and AEG Presents have cancelled more than 10,000 tickets to the tour, which kicked off at Manchester’s Etihad stadium on 24 May. In July 2017, Kilimanjaro Live contacted ticket holders to remind them of the “very detailed” terms and conditions relating to entry and resale restrictions. The promoters advised anyone with tickets bought through Viagogo to seek a refund through the site and gave them the opportunity to buy a new ticket at the face value of £150. The scheme is available in advance or on the day of the concert. Still, reportedly hundreds of fans were angry after being asked to buy new tickets for the concert at Etihad stadium when their Viagogo purchases were deemed invalid, the BBC reports. Viagogo directed the BBC to its FAQ section, where it claims that concert promoters who deny entry to fans holding resold tickets are “highly unfair and in our view, unenforceable and illegal”. Many fans pointed out that not everyone would have sufficient funds to pay £150 per ticket prior to receiving a refund from Viagogo. Kilimanjaro Live chief executive Stuart Galbraith told the BBC that anyone who can’t immediately afford to buy new tickets will be given the opportunity to purchase tickets for a different date. Galbraith said: “Everyone we’ve dealt with today – and we’ve dealt with hundreds – we’ve given them advice about how to receive refunds against their fraudulently traded tickets, and we’ve sold them face-value tickets. So we’ve achieved what Ed wanted us to.” He gave the example of one customer who had paid £4000 for four tickets that purported to include a meet-and-greet with Sheeran — when no such option exists. Sheeran’s manager Stuart Camp said in a statement: “This one example perfectly highlights the need for some strong action from the government against profiteering secondary ticket marketplaces.” Galbraith added: “Last night produced several interesting bits of evidence of mass flouting of consumer laws and we will be referring all of the information we have gathered to the Competitions and Mergers Authority and National Trading Standards for further investigation.” Sheeran’s management advised anyone affected to seek instructions on FanFairAlliance.org and reminded fans that Twickets is the only authorised point of resale, as it caps prices at face value plus 10%. “Our whole process has been to try to deal with as much of this as possible in advance. We don’t want to inconvenience people queuing and, to be honest, we don’t want to deal with this ourselves on the day.” In March, the Advertising Standards Authority took action against Viagogo, StubHub UK, Seatwave and GetMeIn! over the misleading presentation of pricing information on its websites. In April, the UK competition regulator said the website had ignored its demands to make changes and would be taken to court for breaching consumer protection laws."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/may/27/project-fear-coming-true-after-all-two-years-later-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T06:00:17Z","webTitle":"Two years after the Brexit vote, Project Fear may be coming true","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/27/project-fear-coming-true-after-all-two-years-later-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/27/project-fear-coming-true-after-all-two-years-later-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Two years after the Brexit vote, Project Fear may be coming true","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"One of the features of the Brexit vote is that it shows economics doesn’t matter very much. At least not to the 52% who voted to leave the European Union, and who the pollsters tell us still largely feel as they did on 23 June 2016. That seems strange when the debate about Scottish independence focused for much of the time on the possible economic gains and losses. But there was no doubting, when the Brexit votes were counted, that George Osborne’s Project Fear had been smashed on the rocks of public indifference. Osborne warned that the Treasury’s best minds had reached a terrible conclusion: that leaving the European Union would knock 6% off economic growth by 2030, costing each household £4,300 a year. Last week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the UK was already following the trajectory mapped out by the Treasury. He said the UK had already lost almost 2% of predicted growth and 4% from household incomes. This translates into a £900 loss per household. Most of the damage, he said, was Brexit-related. The result is that the economy is £40bn smaller than it would have been without Brexit; it’s possible to show that this amounts to a £15bn loss of tax revenue, or £300m a week. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable was appalled by this confirmation of all his worst fears. Labour MP and arch-Remainer Chuka Umunna was equally indignant that the experts had been proved right. He tweeted: “Brexit is already costing every person in this country hundreds of pounds in lower income, and we haven’t even left yet.” The public, on the other hand, appeared to be nonplussed. This is partly because the loss is a notional one, based on economic forecasts that the Treasury and Bank of England have become notorious for getting wrong over the last 10 years. More importantly, the Brexit vote was born of several factors unrelated to economics, such as reclaiming power from the European court of justice, or ending EU rules that block attempts to control the country’s borders. This is an unfortunate situation, because what Carney has to say is important. It’s true, as the Brexiters say, that much of the loss to households flows from a one-off inflationary reaction to the lower pound, which pushed the cost of imported goods higher. Yet a cliff-edge Brexit featuring only a basic trade deal – something that remains a possibility – could trigger another fall in the pound, ushering in a second dose of import-led inflation. Carney made this warning explicit in a speech last week that revealed the Bank is prepared to withdraw its plans for raising interest rates if this happens. Inflation, he said, had cut household spending power and accounted for around a third of the £900 loss. The remaining two-thirds was due to lost productivity – and that was largely due to a collapse in investment. Figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development documenting foreign direct investment show a 90% collapse in flows to the UK in 2017 compared with the previous year. Granted, the previous year was characterised by a strong recovery from a miserable 2014 and 2015. Nevertheless, a 90% fall in funds coming to the UK shows how fragile Britain’s reputation among corporate investors has become, and how positive sentiment can evaporate almost overnight. Large domestic companies are of the same mind. They are the main losers from the Brexit vote and the costly trade and customs arrangements it could usher in. They are the most averse to making investment decisions until the situation is clearer. And even then, if it becomes obvious that a hard Brexit is the most likely result, with a customs deal no better than Canada’s, they might ditch their investment plans altogether. This scenario is possible, and it’s right that Carney makes the cost explicit to the public. One day, they might want to pay attention. Disney faces battle for fairtale ending at Sky Comcast is threatening to scupper Rupert Murdoch’s fairytale ending with Disney. The cable and media group is plotting to make a knockout bid for 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets, which Murdoch has agreed to sell to Disney. Murdoch’s Fox is a lucrative business, with assets spanning the X-Men and Deadpool franchises to a 39% stake in Sky and a 30% stake in US streaming service Hulu. Disney’s $52bn all-stock deal appealed to Murdoch more than Comcast’s original cash offer last year, which was 16% higher but raised questions over regulatory and tax hurdles. But Comcast is not so easily deterred. It already has a £22bn offer tabled for Sky itself that would make it the world’s largest pay-TV company. Like Disney, however, Comcast has its eyes on global expansion and the rise of Netflix – which means taking a tilt at the wider Fox group. Disney, meanwhile, needs Fox to supercharge its belated entry into the world of streaming, having already pulled its immense film catalogue – from Star Wars to Toy Story – off Netflix in the US in preparation for its own streaming service. Because Disney already owns 30% of Hulu, Fox’s stake would give it control of two outlets over which to spread its vast entertainment fare. However, Comcast also owns major assets including the maker of Downton Abbey and Made in Chelsea as well as Pixar rival DreamWorks, creator of Shrek and Kung Fu Panda, and Universal Studios. It is well aware of the need for lots of content in a world dominated by streaming. Comcast spies global reach: only 9% of its revenues come outside the US, and pay-TV in its home market is hitting saturation and facing decline. Taking over Sky would make that 25% overnight. The strategic rationales for Comcast or Disney buying Fox are both strong. Both will have to dig deeper in order to win. FTSE 100 is no guide to UK economy’s health How bad can things be? The FTSE 100 index is on a great run. The barometer of the nation’s biggest companies last week recorded new highs around the 7900 level. The round number of 8000 is in sight. Then prepare for the big one – 10,000. So banish your Brexit blues, and enjoy the vote of confidence in the UK. Unfortunately, the above paragraph is complete rubbish. It is correct that the FTSE 100 is currently buoyant, but prepare instead to tear your hair out when a headline-seeking politician (and there will be one) claims the achievement of 8000 is some form of triumph for the UK economy. He or she will be spouting nonsense. “The characteristics of the FTSE 100 index make me marvel at people who use the index as a product or guide to enable them to ‘invest in the UK,’” wrote Terry Smith in this year’s letter to investors in his Fundsmith fund. He’s right. As he pointed out, four of the top 10 constituents gave a break-down of the UK contribution to their total sales last year and the numbers were: 1% at Rio Tinto, 3.8% at GlaxoSmithKline, 8% at AstraZeneca and 14.5% at Vodafone. Therein lies the clue to one factor behind last week’s uptick: the pound has been weak, thereby inflating the value of dollars and euros earned overseas when translated into sterling, the currency in which share prices are quoted in London. Expressed in dollars, the Footsie is still well below its highs. The idiosyncratic make-up of the FTSE 100 doesn’t matter in the sense that everyone knows what they’re getting, or should. Even the London Stock Exchange calls it “London’s global benchmark”. Is it even a good global index, though? As Smith also wrote, only 1.8% of the FTSE 100 was in information technology at the end of last year, versus 23.9% for the main US index, the S&amp;P 500. So, if you believe the IT sector is best placed to reflect global growth in the decades ahead, ignore the Footsie."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/27/madama-butterfly-glyndebourne-miskimmon-britten-sinfonia-ades-gerald-barry-review-beethoven","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T06:30:17Z","webTitle":"The week in classical: Madama Butterfly; Britten Sinfonia/Adès – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/27/madama-butterfly-glyndebourne-miskimmon-britten-sinfonia-ades-gerald-barry-review-beethoven","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/27/madama-butterfly-glyndebourne-miskimmon-britten-sinfonia-ades-gerald-barry-review-beethoven","fields":{"headline":"The week in classical: Madama Butterfly; Britten Sinfonia/Adès – review","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"No need to rehearse the strange but limited parallels of a mixed-race marriage and a groom in uniform. Indeed it all felt quite potent that sunny Saturday afternoon a week ago, the opening of Glyndebourne’s new season. Puccini’s Madama Butterfly (1904), one of the world’s most adored and desolate operas, was about to make its first appearance in the festival’s 84-year history. In a brief welcome, Gus Christie, executive chairman and acting artistic director, concentrated on topical topography. A new duchess of Sussex – not yet an opera-goer but perhaps a future patron – had been anointed hours earlier, he said, with home pride. The opening of Glyndebourne, senior member of an increasingly large and flourishing family, marks the start of the country house opera season. The company has had to hold its nerve of late, challenged by the improving quality of other festivals such as Garsington, Grange Park Opera, Longborough, the Grange, Holland Park Opera. Next month, Nevill Holt, in Leicestershire, opens a new, purpose-built theatre. Programmes everywhere are more diverse, with world premieres, community work and a commitment to involving those who cannot afford top-price tickets (screenings, streamings, performances on the beach). Glyndebourne has always led the way and yet now must struggle to keep up. Currently advertising for a new artistic director (see Guardian Jobs, closing 8 June) following the abrupt exit in December of Sebastian Schwarz, it may have managerial problems but shows no shortage of artistic vim, as Brett Dean’s triumphant Hamlet last year and a new singing competition in March this year demonstrated. On paper, the 2018 season doesn’t look the strongest (two Handel revivals may be one too many), but with a freshly cast Rosenkavalier and new productions of Pelléas et Mélisande and Barber’s Vanessa we may, a normal habit in this job, be eating our words. Butterfly is new to the festival, but Annilese Miskimmon’s staging was premiered as part of the 2016 Glyndebourne tour. Encountering it for the first time – and I gather after some reworking – I admired its perception and clarity, shorn of cherry-blossom prettiness but not without beauty; dispassionate about the cynical manoeuvres of the Japanese marriage broker, Goro, and his American imperialist client, Pinkerton, yet full of heart. The shattered optimism of Cio-Cio-San (Butterfly), intensely sung and acted, after a hesitant start, by Olga Busuioc, hit harder than ever. In Miskimmon’s reading, sensuously and expertly played by the London Philharmonic Orchestra under the eagerly responsive baton of Omer Meir Wellber, all are complicit in the deal, including the 15-year-old girl herself. She is innocent but not ignorant, perfectly aware of the American habit of securing butterflies with a pin. Pinkerton, sung with soaring, wilful, preening grace by Joshua Guerrero, waits for a “real” American bride, while delighting in this gorgeous stop-gap arrangement he’s fixed for himself. Remorse comes, all too late. The consul, Sharpless, richly and sympathetically portrayed by Michael Sumuel, alone warns him of pending disaster. The 1950s setting, designed by Nicky Shaw, takes its cue from the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which gave Japanese women a chance to settle in America with their US servicemen husbands. The opening takes place in Goro’s marriage bureau in Nagasaki, conveniently next door to a seedy, neon-lit hotel. We see flickering images of available love candidates, and cine reels about how to be an American wife. As the scene unfolds, the literal-minded will object to this functional office turning, far from completely, into the marital bedroom, but Puccini’s insistent, ecstatic score, aided by Mark Jonathan’s skilled lighting design, does the job of magical transformation. When we do see Butterfly at home, she has embraced wholeheartedly the US way of life: cigarettes, radiogram, furniture – G Plan-style (though not, in fact, since that was a British brand). She dresses, with tragic pathos, in tight skirt, jacket and heels, almost identical, except in colour, to the clothes Mrs Pinkerton herself wears in the opera’s terrible closing moments. The finest performance was that of Elizabeth DeShong, kindly, angry, desperate as the maid Suzuki, with fervent, resonant low notes. Supporting roles were well taken by Carlo Bosi (Goro), Simon Mechlinski (Prince Yamadori) and an ensemble including Jennifer Witton, Michael Mofidian, Oleg Budaratskiy. Ida Ränzlöv as the put-upon Kate Pinkerton made the most of her tiny, devastating role. For once you could believe she really was kind enough to take on Butterfly and Pinkerton’s child, while no doubt damning her husband’s crass desires. We must hope she changed the boy’s name from Sorrow (acted with still confidence by Rupert Wade). The composer-conductor Thomas Adès has likened the progress of Beethoven’s nine symphonies to the geological eras of the Earth, with No 5 in C minor – that most famous touchstone of western music – erupting out of the volcanic age. Reaching the mid-point of his Beethoven cycle with the Britten Sinfonia, Adès proved his point last week. Together with the lithe and airborne No 4 in B flat, he conducted the Fifth with febrile grandeur, as if surprised himself at Beethoven’s unpredictable, rule-breaking brilliance. The work’s tense coda, blasting into C major, had the Britten Sinfonia, playing with period awareness and little vibrato, almost rising out of their seats with the challenge of speed, volume and finesse. A feature of this series is the pairing of Beethoven with music by his committed disciple, the Irish composer Gerald Barry (b1952). You might think all composers were Beethoven devotees. Far from it. Stravinsky told Proust he detested Beethoven, though you might argue his music is full of his influence. Nicolas Hodges was soloist in the London premiere of Barry’s Piano Concerto, which is – in the most riveting fashion – more like a confrontation between giant, automated punchbags, pounding out Beethovenian scales and raucous chords in jubilant, self-possessed combat. Catch this terrific programme tonight in Norwich, or on Radio 3 iPlayer. On Wednesday at Milton Court, Adès turned pianist, with tenor Allan Clayton performing Beethoven’s An die ferne Geliebte (1816), pivotal in the history of the song cycle, though Beethoven complained he disliked writing songs. Clayton, as expressive a performer as you could wish, showed that in fact Beethoven was rather good at it. In a concert dominated by the key of E flat, including the Quintet for Piano and Winds, Adès created an atmosphere of intimacy with Britten Sinfonia principals Alex Wide, horn; Timothy Rundle, oboe; Joy Farrall, clarinet; and Sarah Burnett, bassoon. Clayton was back to perform, with comic frenzy, Barry’s Jabberwocky (2012), the text crazy enough in Lewis Carroll’s original, but now translated into French (Le Jaseroque) and German (Der Jammerwoch). If you never understood it in English – maybe I’ll end mid-sentence like Barry’s wild creation itself.

China. Beijing to Shanghai for a couple of months, with a few detours to smaller towns and villages along the way. The expedition was far beyond my comfort zone of south-east London. The trip – not a holiday, we were repeatedly told, the trip – was a result of a now-defunct British Council programme called the Prime Minister’s Global Fellowship (PMGF). Set up by Gordon Brown, the idea was that 100 18- and 19-year-olds from Britain would get the chance to travel to and learn more about the world’s so-called emerging economies: Brazil, India and China. The long application process took place in tandem with my A-levels, and while I thrived during my ultimately successful PMGF interviews, my exam preparation felt far less certain. I had discovered the arts that school year, seduced by the realisation that not only could I understand theatre, poetry and film, but I could like them, too. A decade ago, arts funding for young working-class kids was out there and I took advantage, signing up for youth programmes at my local Connexions centre (RIP) and taking free buses into central London to the Tate, the BFI, the Roundhouse and the National Theatre. As a result, I spent a lot more of my early-summer revision period at the half-a-dozen things I had signed up for than I ever did looking at my school textbooks. Some months before the trip I also voted for the first time, getting bright red hair in what I thought was a subversive way to show which political party I was backing. Few of my fellow first-time voter PMGF crew went for Brown’s Labour over Nick Clegg’s shiny Lib Dems, but we mostly united in our misery when the Tories came to power in coalition. Since then, with the exception of the London mayoral race in 2016, I (and most people I know my age) have backed the wrong horse in every election we have participated in. Our 2010 misery was short-lived, however, despite the loss. We were certain the ConDem government wouldn’t last for long, not with us getting older and having more of a say, and we were about to go abroad, for free, for six weeks. How could we complain? My summer in China was one of the most formative times of my life. The mix of us – from a variety of race, class, and religious backgrounds, but all British – was one I had never really had before we all learned so much about ourselves, the world we live in and our place in it. I received my A-level results surrounded by my cohort in a British Council building in Shanghai, and they were as mediocre as I deserved. The shock and upset was quickly pushed aside, and the rest of the summer was a joy – learning, interaction, travel. I could ignore politics back home, ignore my confusion about what to do next, and just ask questions rather than try to find answers. Returning to London, it felt like the summer was the beginning of a new chapter. And, in many ways, it was. Leaving allows you to come back, and I was suddenly certain I could take a year out, to both redo my exams and do more arts things, rather than fewer. That summer I learned that things don’t always happen how you want them to, and even better, they don’t have to.

Set in Mississippi during the civil war, Faulkner gives us a kaleidoscopic portrait of the life of Thomas Sutpen, an ambitious plantation owner. It’s one of those books that never leaves you: the intricately layered narrative is both formally inventive and wonderfully gripping. As you make your way across the south, you’ll probably be struck by how – still – the subject of slavery is either buried or minimised. Don’t make the same mistake. The three best novels about this dark chapter of US history – Toni Morrison’s Beloved, Octavia Butler’s Kindred and Alice Walker’s The Color Purple – are all set further north. Read them anyway. For something more directly relevant, go for Lalita Tademy’s Cane River, which laces fact and fiction to tell the moving tale of the author’s slave-born Louisiana ancestors. In New Orleans, give yourself a treat and head to Faulkner House Books – one of the world’s great bookshops, located in an atmospheric house where the great novelist once lived. While you’re there, pick up a copy of John Kennedy Toole’s riotous A Confederacy of Dunces. It’ll have you choking on your mint juleps.

My own hunt – as yet unsuccessful – was prompted by the actor and novelist Barbara Ewing, whose novel about a drama-school reunion, The Actresses, has just been reissued. Ewing says she cried when she first saw the cover of the 1997 edition – although it focuses on women over 50, the jacket image was a close up of a young woman’s face. This time around, she and publisher Head of Zeus have gone for an elegant photograph of a silver-haired woman that measures up perfectly to the book’s protagonists. But Ewing says bookshops aren’t interested. It seems the book world doesn’t think readers want to see women of a certain age on their novels – even if that is precisely what the books are about. Take a look at some literary novels about older women – Elizabeth Strout’s Olive Kitteridge, Elena Ferrante’s The Story of the Lost Child, Anne Tyler’s A Spool of Blue Thread, Carol Shields’ Unless – and you’ll see a lighthouse, two children wearing fairy wings, a young couple in a car and a child standing on her head. What about novels with a more commercial mind? Elizabeth Buchan’s Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman, Allison Pearson’s How Hard Can It Be? and Rebecca Wells’ Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood have plenty of older women inside their pages. But on the front there’s a sketch of a couple of glasses of wine on the table, a falling silhouette of a female and two joyous young women. Prue Leith’s The Choral Society features the disembodied legs of three women, which sounds like progress. But according to the blurb they’re all in their 50s. Let’s just say their legs look ... amazing. The Actresses aside, I can’t find a single novel that features an older-looking woman on its cover. Ewing’s novel was forged from her sorrow at the way parts dry up for women actors over 50 – an issue that is still very much alive today. As Hilary Mantel says, women over 50 are the invisible generation. Publishers who avoid older women on book jackets and booksellers who turn up their noses at the new edition of Ewing’s novel are playing into this narrative – and making a big mistake. Women, and in particular older women, have always made up a disproportionate amount of readers. Why not acknowledge that they do, in fact, have faces, after all?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/25/talking-horses-alex-frost-regret-as-steve-harman-gives-up-bha-chair","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T11:15:37Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Alex Frost's regret as Steve Harman gives up BHA chair","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/25/talking-horses-alex-frost-regret-as-steve-harman-gives-up-bha-chair","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/25/talking-horses-alex-frost-regret-as-steve-harman-gives-up-bha-chair","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Alex Frost's regret as Steve Harman gives up BHA chair","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Friday’s best bets, by Chris Cook Alex Frost, whose Alizeti Consortium is taking over the Tote, has spoken for the first time of his disappointment at Steve Harman giving up his position as chairman of racing’s ruling body, the eventual result of their meeting at the Cheltenham Festival. Frost praised Harman’s qualities and noted his good relationship with members of the government, giving racing access to power it has not always enjoyed. “I don’t think it’s been a great result for anybody, really, I don’t think there are any winners out of that situation,” Frost said. “The interaction we did have, I thought he was tremendously professional and I’ve only got good things to say about him.” Harman agreed this week that he will step down from his role as chairman of the British Horseracing Authority in November and become instead a BHA consultant, liaising with parliamentarians over the future funding of horse racing. Board members responded by agreeing to set aside concerns about his explanations of his meetings with Frost. An investigation had already concluded that Harman did not allow a conflict of interest to arise in his meeting with Frost, which makes the end of his chairmanship seem a very expensive outcome. Frost, a former banker at Merrill Lynch, evidently has reservations about the BHA in light of its treatment of Harman, for all that he expresses it guardedly. “I’m very used to an industry that’s well regulated; the FCA is tremendously effective and the SEC in the US is very, very effective. Good industries need good regulating. This has not been a great scenario for anyone, frankly.” Referring to Harman’s new role, Frost said: “I think that tells you that the government were very, very approving of what he was doing and I think that’s the ultimate accolade. You saw what [culture secretary] Matt Hancock said about him last week, he was extraordinarily positive. That’s a great indication of somebody who’s doing something very meaningful for the sport.” Today’s racing for me is all about Juneau (3.20) at Bath. I make no attempt to disguise from you that this is a recovery mission because I really fancied Mark Johnston’s filly at Beverley last time. She looked the winner, too, when she made a big move around the field off the home turn, but was then swamped by the well backed Neverbeen To Paris. The winner looked really useful and I still think so after a third place at Catterick yesterday, where he failed to handle the undulations. Juneau gets to race from the same mark, having looked like a winner waiting to happen on her last two starts. Please let today be the day. She’s 11-8. At Haydock, Shepherd Market (3.30) is backable at 2-1 and that’ll do for me about a filly who looks the form standout for this novice contest, having gone close at Listed level when last seen in October. She’s from the Clive Cox stables, which has been among the winners. Her main rival, Feline Groovy, ran well on her debut but those who finished right behind her have done nothing for the form. I like 3-1 about Swiss Chime (2.00) for Goodwood’s opener. Richard Hannon’s zippy filly can show the benefit of two previous starts. Pat Dobbs rides for the first time and may help her settle a bit better than she has been doing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/25/material-environments-review-watch-art-take-shape-right-before-your-eyes","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T14:44:40Z","webTitle":"Material Environments review – watch art take shape, right before your eyes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/25/material-environments-review-watch-art-take-shape-right-before-your-eyes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/25/material-environments-review-watch-art-take-shape-right-before-your-eyes","fields":{"headline":"Material Environments review – watch art take shape, right before your eyes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In all likelihood the exhibition I saw at the Tetley in Leeds will be different to the one you will see if you are stirred to make a visit. There is a chance Keith Harrison’s giant red balloon will have inflated to the rafters, and Phoebe Cummings’ botanical clay sculptures may have undergone a growth spurt reminiscent of Audrey II from Little Shop of Horrors, while Harold Offeh will probably have collected more vinyl LPs with the title The Real Thing. Material Environments is a work in progress. Rather than its pieces being researched, prepared and concluded ahead of time, they are developed in the gallery, right in front of the audience. The space lends itself to this idea because it is made up of a series of individual rooms, like a corridor of artist’s studios where we are invited to pop in and watch a concept take shape. Evidence of artists experimenting is everywhere. There are remnants of sugar next to Harrison’s piece. Apparently he had recently been refuelling his sculptural distillation process for a special event that weekend. An astral dipole radio telescope is positioned on the roof of the Tetley’s restaurant by Serena Korda to add to her audio piece. Cummings leaves footprints and fingerprints all over the clay in her large-scale installation. Her scalpels and moulds sit in a glass-fronted cabinet for all the world to see – there is no secret creative process here. A number of the artists are here in the gallery. While Harrison wanders around with his sugar, Korda speaks to me about her sound installation Clairaudience, and her visit to Todmorden, a UFO hotspot in Yorkshire where she recorded the piece. The curatorial decision by Ben Roberts to essentially produce a live artist-in-residency was a good one. It removes contemporary art from an inaccessible pedestal – not only can we see art in creation but we can ask the artists about their approach. Indeed, audience interaction is central to the works. The gallery’s annual micro-festival, the Tetley Weekender, was this year subtitled Experiments Workshop, encouraging visitors to get involved in the process of creating art. There was clay crafting, science experiments, glass harp playing and performance. Offeh led Reading the Realness, where participants performed a transcript of a conversation between the presenters of The Real, a US talk show, and the former civil rights activist Rachel Dolezal, who caused a worldwide furore when her parents revealed she is white. The Tetley, it turns out, is a great place for experimenting and researching because it has a history of its own. Once a brewery, it now acts as a starting point for artistic innovation. Harrison’s Bad Shit reflects the purpose of the old Tetley offices: his red balloon sits passively in the manager’s office, pumped up by the distillation process happening in 13 barrels or “worker bees” in the general office next door. And a photograph from Joanna Piotrowska’s ongoing series Shelter – in which the subject rearranges chairs and desks to create a sort of den – resonates all the more when pinned to the wall of an old office. With UFOs, distillation, nature and the lounging pose of black male singers on album covers in the 1980s as concepts in this exhibition, you’d be excused for struggling to find a thread. Certainly, Offeh’s video work Snap Like a Diva, which features the artist dancing, snapping and posing in a variety of dazzling outfits, is very different to Cummings’ interest in 19th-century rococo-style candlesticks. But the diversity of subjects makes for a truly insightful look at the varied practices of artists working today as they research, experiment, collect, craft and create before your eyes. At the Tetley, Leeds, until 8 July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/30/thailand-punks-against-junta-repression-military-political","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T12:30:51Z","webTitle":"'This country has no freedom!': how Thailand's punks are railing against the junta","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/30/thailand-punks-against-junta-repression-military-political","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/30/thailand-punks-against-junta-repression-military-political","fields":{"headline":"'This country has no freedom!': how Thailand's punks are railing against the junta","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“It’s been four years, motherfucker!” – this is how a group of Thai punks promoted their gig, earlier this month, marking the fourth anniversary of military rule in the country. The provocative slogan, directed at junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha, helped the event’s Facebook page go viral, piquing the interest of pro-democracy activists and putting the small underground scene in the national spotlight. A larger than usual crowd showed up at the concert, which was held at a monument commemorating student-led protests in 1973. Those protests succeeded in bringing down a despised military dictatorship – but only after troops opened fire on the crowds, killing at least 77. Such atrocities are a recurring horror in Thailand, where the state also killed its own people in 1976, 1992 and in 2010, when around 90 pro-democracy “red shirt” protesters were killed during military crackdowns led by General Prayuth. However, in 2014, Prayuth sat back and watched as rival protests against the elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra, whom the red shirts supported, paralysed Bangkok. When he finally did intervene, it was not to support the government but to seize power himself. Although the junta has its supporters, opposition is widespread and only kept in check by oppression. Elections have been promised for 2019, but even if they do go ahead, the signs are that Prayuth is aiming to use them as a way to legitimise his power and remain in control. Outside the gig, uniformed police stood guard but allowed people to move in and out freely. Undercover agents worked inside, filming and taking photos. Among the crowd of punk kids were some stalwarts from the pro-democracy movement, keen to take part in any activity against the junta, even if it meant subjecting their ears to noisy and strange music. I recognised a group of older women – referred to as “aunties” in Thai — whom I knew to be red shirt activists. One of them, a nurse in her 60s from just outside Bangkok, told me she had no idea about punk – Thai country music is more her style – but she came along because she’s angry about the state of the country. “It’s been four years of military rule now,” she complained. “We need elections.” As bands such as Shock Shuck and Drunk All Day treated the crowd to three-chord riffs and four-letter expletives aimed at Prayuth, I chatted to one of the event organisers. “The Thai punk scene in the past has only cared about partying,” hesays. “I organised this event because I think punk should be rebellious. I care about freedom and rights.” The thrash metal band Killing Fields certainly don’t play party music. Their lyrics and imagery deal with dark periods of Thai history, such as the massacre of students at Thammasat University in 1976, which is still quite a taboo subject in Thailand. A gruesome photo from the atrocity will be familiar to fans of the US punk band Dead Kennedys. Blood Soaked Street of Social Decay and Anarthipathai (Thai for anarchy) aren’t light entertainment either. Both bands played blistering sets of politically charged grindcore that got the crowd slam-dancing, with dozens of pairs of Dr Martens, Converse and Vans stomping furiously on an anti-Prayuth banner laid out on the ground. Mhee, the drummer and spokesperson of Blood Soaked Street of Social Decay – often styled as BxSxSxSxD – is pessimistic about Thailand’s political prospects. “The whole world is moving on but we are still stuck in the same place,” he told me, referring to the country’s vicious cycle of elections, coups, protests and massacres. He distrusts all forms of authority but concedes that “democracy is the ‘least worst’ system because it allows for accountability. With a dictatorship, you can’t check on them or criticise them.” Music hasn’t been this political in Thailand since the tumult of the 1970s, when bands such as Caravan grew out of the popular uprising and pioneered a wave of socially conscious folk-rock, known in Thai as “songs for life”. But after the trauma of the 1976 student massacre, the progressive movement grew weary and the counterculture soon faded away. Since the 80s, Thai music has been dominated by bland pop and soft rock, churning out love songs with the same sugary vocal delivery. When youth cultures were imported from overseas – punk, metal, indie, hip-hop – the style was imitated flawlessly but the sense of rebellion often seemed to have been lost along the way. “Thai kids just aren’t interested in politics” is a common refrain. But a deep and protracted political crisis has convulsed Thailand for more than a decade now. And while the younger generation seemed uninterested at first, there are signs that this could be changing. Since the 2014 coup, young Thais have been bravely leading the small but determined resistance movement against it. And if punk isn’t your thing, then politics has been popping up in other youthful cultural forms, too: a quarter of a million people follow the satirical comic strips of “kai meow” (cat’s balls) on Facebook; a vibrant street-art scene has started targeting the junta with murals; hobbyists make politically themed designer toys that can sell out in minutes, and a young gender activist recently made a retro-style board game that mocks the country’s regressive politics. Such examples might not be indicative of what the average young Thai is doing, but that’s the point. These are the creatives, the social influencers and trend setters – being subversive is what the cool kids are doing. Mhee thinks the internet has given people a greater voice. “Young people have always been interested in politics,” he says. “But now they have a space to convey what they think to the public, so other people can support their opinion.” Social media certainly helped the bands at the “four years” gig reach a wider audience; first when promoting the concert, and then afterwards, when clips and photos of the event’s dramatic climax went viral. As headliners Anarthipathai finished their set, attempts were made to set the anti-Prayuth banner on fire, but it proved remarkably resilient to the flames – a perfect metaphor for a country struggling to rid itself of a stubborn dictator. To accommodate the delay, the band moved effortlessly from D-beat to slow psych jam, giving two punks more time to douse the banner in lighter fluid to get it burning. When the flames finally engulfed the dictator’s face, the crowd cheered and the show was over. The police immediately swooped in to make arrests. A dozen or so punks were shepherded on to the back of a police pickup while the crowd berated the officers. “Only in Thailand! This country has no freedom!” screeched one of the red shirt aunties. “Are you proud of yourself? Are you proud of the job you do?” shouted a young punk woman at the police. The atmosphere was tense but as the vehicle pulled out, a grinning punk in the back shouted: “Democracy for ever!” and a huge cheer filled the air, followed by laughter. Punk’s been through a lot over the decades but it’s not dead yet, at least not for the people who still believe in it – and the same is true for Thai democracy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/28/monday-best-tv-peter-kay-care-share-king-lear","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T05:20:45Z","webTitle":"Monday’s best TV: Peter Kay’s Car Share – The Finale; King Lear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/28/monday-best-tv-peter-kay-care-share-king-lear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/28/monday-best-tv-peter-kay-care-share-king-lear","fields":{"headline":"Monday’s best TV: Peter Kay’s Car Share – The Finale; King Lear","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Peter Kay’s Car Share: The Finale 10pm, BBC One Although Peter Kay has spent 2018 out of the spotlight due to what the comic has described as “unforeseen family circumstances”, he has still managed to put out the final two episodes of his beloved Bafta-winning sitcom.

Kim has worked for months to craft an image of a senior statesman and peacemaker, hoping to break decades of hostilities with a country North Korea has called its “sworn enemy”. Trump cancelling the summit further reinforced the narrative Kim is willing to talk while the US agitates for regime change. “The crowning glory of the summit is still important to Kim, but he’s gained a lot of legitimacy and attention in the run up without having to give up any nuclear weapons,” said Euan Graham, director of the international security program at the Lowy Institute. “Now North Korea will posture as the injured party and Trump’s timing, cancelling at same time as North Korea was closing its nuclear test site, shows Pyongyang was trying to act in good faith.” Just hours before the summit was called off, North Korea said it had completely closed its only known nuclear test site, collapsing tunnels used to test weapons in front of a group of about 30 international journalists. The North has also announced a moratorium on any missile tests. “This has made it hard to sell a return to maximum pressure to South Korea, and 10 times harder to sell to the Chinese,” Graham added. China accounts for over 90% of the North’s trade and the two share a border stretching 880 miles (1,420km). China has traditionally been resistant to back international sanctions against Pyongyang at the United Nations, but after a nuclear test in September agreed to radically reduce trade. But with Kim seen to be open to dialogue while Trump appears to be rejecting his overtures, China may quietly permit trade to resume, allowing North Korea to continue to build its economy. While the past few months of diplomacy have been a boon for Kim, Trump’s cancellation of the summit has damaged South Korean president Moon Jae-in’s standing. He had worked harder than anyone to ensure the US-North Korea summit happened, with much of the initial contact passing through South Korean officials. The language in Trump’s letter cancelling the meeting seemed to point the finger at Moon for miscommunicating who exactly was pushing for a meeting. The White House also gave no advanced notice to Moon, forcing him to hastily call a midnight national security meeting. Any daylight between the US and the South will also benefit Kim. North Korea has always sought to drive a wedge between the two allies. There are 28,500 US troops stationed in South Korea and the two regularly hold military exercises that infuriate Pyongyang. “Kim has broken maximum pressure by halting provocations and coordinating with the Chinese,” Vipin Narang, a politics professor who focuses on nuclear proliferation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said before Trump cancelled the summit. “North Korea has worked hard over the past few months to constants appear the magnanimous party in the eyes of the international community.” After news of the cancellation broke, Narang said on Twitter that North Korea’s measured reaction was “a smart statement from North Korea. Puts ball back squarely in Trump’s court”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/02/australiana-20-how-cultural-cringe-became-cool","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T22:46:56Z","webTitle":"Australiana 2.0: how cultural cringe became cool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/02/australiana-20-how-cultural-cringe-became-cool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/02/australiana-20-how-cultural-cringe-became-cool","fields":{"headline":"Australiana 2.0: how cultural cringe became cool","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In the 1980s, Australia was awash in a tide of bright and colourful Ken Done tea towels and rocking a Coogi knit was considered the height of sophistication. In the midst of Expo ’88 mania, everyone sported clothing emblazoned with splashy images of Sydney Harbour Bridge, koalas and Australiana chic. It was bold, brash and people couldn’t get enough of it. By the mid 1990s however, this wave of colour and cultural celebration had faded into a puddle of cultural cringe, in which anything remotely Australian was met with disdain and embarrassment. Yet fashion is a cyclical industry and what falls from grace will inevitably come back into vogue. Fairy bread greeting card from La La Land, $6.95; top: Molly Coombs Marr fairy bread, paddlepops, Iced Vovo and Bubble O Bill earrings from $42.50 Over the past few years, an increasing number of independent labels have taken ownership of these symbols that were once the subject of mockery and made them, well, cool. Australiana 2.0 has arrived. In markets and boutique shops across Australia, you can find Iced VoVo earrings, tea towels featuring hipster koalas and Vegemite and Golden Gaytime ice-cream enamel pins. Pete Cromer, whose label of the same name creates prints and key rings of colourful stylised budgies, koalas and kangaroos, likens the irreverent nature of his designs with a “rebirth” of appreciation of all that is Australian. “It’s part of a resurgence, like Kath and Kim – things that are daggy are now also kind of cool. People of a certain generation are more familiar with it and we’re seeing it in a new light.” Cynthia Sear, an anthropologist who researches consumerism and capitalism at the University of Melbourne, says many people enjoy the novelty factor, especially those who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s. “These items are quite innocent but they’re also quite authentic and genuine, and there’s a bit of irony in them, too.” And unlike other national emblems, such as the Australian flag that has long been the centre of political debate, there’s not a lot that’s political about a pair of banana-shaped earrings. “These things don’t polarise and they don’t involve issues of race or Indigenous politics. It’s a happy way to celebrate being Australian.” “There’s quite a bit of anthropological theory right now about how we identify ourselves; we’re a more global world now and it lends itself to us thinking about who we are. With the resurgence of these innocent symbols, it’s a way to embrace Australiana that isn’t complicated.” Cromer agrees, adding that it’s a celebration of a culture that many people grew up in and share similar experiences they can bond over. “I think back to my grandma and she loved Iced VoVos and we can now celebrate the way we grew up, because that’s part of our culture. They’re our icons because we all share similar stories and experiences with them.” At a market in Melbourne’s historical Royal Exhibition Building, huge swaths of people mingle, jostling for position in front of each stall. One of the stalls, McKean Studio, sells colourful metal bracelets that have city skylines etched into them. Kate McKean, who opened the business four years ago, says what started as a hobby has found an eager market for those who want a “quality” symbol of their home. “There are those cheap stores at [Sydney’s] The Rocks and places like that sell kangaroo testicle pouches, but I wanted to create something that really celebrates a lot of the things that we love about Australia,” she says. She adds that what differentiates the new Australiana is the humour that’s laced throughout resurrected Australiana, citing our “lovable larrikin outlook” on life.

We can poke fun at ourselves and our colours are so bright and vivid and we’re just a fun place.” The evolution of cringe to cool started about five years ago, when many makers and small labels first took their products to shops and markets across the country, and where they found an unexpected but growing market. Although small and independent makers have been leading the charge of this trend, mainstream brands have also jumped on board: fashion label Romance was Born released a range with Jenny Kee, and Sheridan and Havaianas have both collaborated with Done. And bed linen label Kipp + Co had a successful run with its May Gibbs collaboration, with her Snugglepot and Cuddlepie characters featuring prominently.

Supporters in Sydney and Melbourne will join them. Salim, a father of three in his 50s, died on Tuesday after jumping out of a moving vehicle. He had been on Manus Island for almost five years, under Australia’s offshore immigration policy. Salim was a Rohingya from Myanmar – a stateless man with no country claiming him. Because he sought asylum by boat, Australia would not take him. PNG gave him refugee status, but as a developing country that struggles to provide healthcare to its own citizens, Salim’s ailments were beyond it. On Manus Island, the Australian-financed contractors scaled back healthcare and other services, and by all appearances he fell through the cracks. The Australian director of Human Rights Watch, Elaine Pearson, said Rohingya refugees were not able to return home, given the situation in Myanmar. “It’s a travesty that Australia has forced them to spend the last five years playing a waiting game on a remote Pacific island while living in an insecure environment with cutbacks to mental health and other services.” Salim had epilepsy and severe mental illness. Doctors4Refugees repeatedly lobbied for him to be brought to Australia for treatment of his epilepsy, psychosis and other ailments. According to advocates, Rohingya refugees on Manus also petitioned authorities regarding his plight. “He has seizure attack almost every day and it is really frightening to all of us,” they wrote. “We are sure that you (ABF, IHMS, Broadspectrum, Wilson Security) are well aware of his sickness. He should not be here at this stage as this environment is worsening his health to such an extent we fear for his life.” The Manus provincial police commander, David Yapu, told Guardian Australia police had launched an investigation into his death and determined it was suicide. He offered his condolences to Salim’s friends and family, and, in PNG’s Post Courier newspaper, warned of more suicides among a group of people under pressure and struggling to cope. “There is great need for the Australian government and PNG government to help ease the burdens of these fellow human beings who are beginning to resort to unthinkable acts of violence and self mutilation,” Yapu said. Salim’s wife did not know her husband was dead until she received a phone call from an Asylum Seeker Resource CEntre employee, who had called to offer condolences. Neither PNG nor Australian authorities and service providers had called to inform her. The Department of Home Affairs told the Huffington Post questions should be directed at the PNG government. Someone in the Australian government, however, did find time to provide background to a reporter on Salim’s history, including alleged assaults. Citing “government sources”, the report in the Australian said Salim was the subject of dozens of incident reports, including an alleged attack on a nurse. The Greens senator Nick McKim described the action as “clearly designed to smear the legacy of a man who’d died less than 12 hours before”. In Canberra, the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, deflected questions on this from the MP Adam Bandt, refusing to be given a “moral lecture” by the Greens. Advocates have despaired at what else they could have done. Though Salim’s poor health was well known to them and other refugees, one said he was beyond reach and no longer engaging. Help for him and for others similarly ill was required on the ground, she said. But after the closure of the centre, torture and trauma counsellors were never reinstated. Last week, Amnesty International labelled the move “inexplicable”. The day before Salim took his own life, the home affairs department conceded the service no longer existed, but insisted that if a particular specialist or mental health pathway was required it could be “turned on”. There has been no offer of extra counselling services following Salim’s death, despite it being witnessed by several refugees. Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz Muhamat and Kurdish refugee Behrouz Boochani said they and others blamed the Australian government for Salim’s death. “These politicians are happy taking a bath with our blood. There’s blood on your hands, your shame, your guilt,” Muhamat told Guardian Australia. “His death creates a lot of depression among the refugees. It came at a time when everyone is disappointed by the US [resettlement] results.” “The refugees are deeply saddened by the news of another death. All of us knew him and we were aware of his illness,” Boochani said. “But the Australian immigration chose to ignore him. His death is the seventh one on Manus.” The department of home affairs referred questions to the PNG government. • Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/true-north/2018/may/25/doug-ford-isnt-for-the-little-guy-hes-a-mercenary-for-the-millionaire-class","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T14:04:10Z","webTitle":"Doug Ford isn’t “for the little guy” – he’s a mercenary for the millionaire class | Martin Lukacs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2018/may/25/doug-ford-isnt-for-the-little-guy-hes-a-mercenary-for-the-millionaire-class","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/true-north/2018/may/25/doug-ford-isnt-for-the-little-guy-hes-a-mercenary-for-the-millionaire-class","fields":{"headline":"Doug Ford isn’t “for the little guy” – he’s a mercenary for the millionaire class","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A recent episode perfectly captures the appeal of Ontario Tory leader Doug Ford. Asked about a delayed mining plan in the province’s north, this is how he answered: “If I have to hop on a bulldozer myself, we’re going to start building roads..it will benefit local people but it is also going to benefit everyone in Ontario.” The statement quickly went viral. In a single gesture, witness the dizzying acrobatics of right-wing populism. There’s the posture of an unflinching maverick, spitting on his hands and getting the job done. There’s the plain-spoken concern for the common man and woman. And then there’s the actual result: a resource scheme that would enrich multinational corporations – who’d help themselves to a 10-year tax holiday – while trampling Indigenous rights and razing one of the last intact wild areas in Canada. The spectacle has nevertheless dazzled most of the media. The result has been the frequent amplification of Doug Ford’s claim to be an outsider, in alliance with the “little guy,” crusading against the elite – the ones he says “drink champagne with their pinkies in the air.” Never mind that he inherited a multi-million dollar business from his father, a conservative politician. Never mind that he has coasted on the political machinery of his brother, former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford. Never mind that he spent years as a city counsellor trying to dismantle public services, has surrounded himself with Stephen Harper’s closest advisors, and is now advancing policies that would be a Trump-like giveaway to the wealthiest. Half-baked denunciations of the elite are apparently enough to eclipse an entire career of fealty to them. The clucking by the pundit and political class about Ford “being unfit for office” has only fed his image as an anti-elite populist. Lying, griping about rigged elections, lurching through gross lapses of knowledge: each time Ford has acted out, the shrieks have grown louder. But his swaggering defiance of the conventions of the political establishment – of civility, proper procedure, and credentialed authority – isn’t mere buffoonery. Getting attacked for it confirms – just as did for Donald Trump – his supposedly down-to-earth, rebellious status. In case the pundits missed it: this is a pissed-off political moment. People want to vote for rebels – and care less and less how politicians are supposed to talk and behave. They have good reason to be pissed. Over 15 years of Liberal rule in Ontario, corporate profits have hit record highs while the majority’s standard of living has bottomed out. Energy bills thanks to Hydro privatization are higher, hospital waits are longer, public transit is over-crowded, wages have stagnated, and half of Toronto struggles to pay rent, never mind the distant prospect of owning a home. Ontario has the lowest government spending of any province: this is something Premier Wynne dared to boast about. The Liberals have gone through some death-bed conversions, raising the minimum wage in the face of pressure from social movements like the Fight for $15 and Fairness. But it’s too little to alter the slide into deepening economic and racial inequality, or the perception of an aloof, indifferent government. So it’s no surprise that when Ford thumbs his nose at the norms of status quo-politics and takes pot-shots at the elite, it resonates. Except he’s chaneling all that anger and discontent not into shaking down the elite, but into shovelling our collective wealth into their hands. When it comes to Ford’s stated policies, the bubble of fake populism only grows larger. A tax-break for low-income earners? Alongside his roll-back of the new minimum wage, it actually leaves them poorer. The tax-break for the middle class? That would in fact benefit the most wealthy. And those corporations that whinged about a slight increase in worker’s wages? They’re getting a $1.3 billion giveaway. Welcome aboard – you’re being taken for a ride on the corporate gravy train. Meanwhile, Ford has offered abundant signs – as Rinaldo Walcott and Naomi Klein detail – that he will scapegoat the most vulnerable. He’d restrict abortion access and replace the sex-ed curriculum, scrap a cap-and-trade climate program, and boost a mushrooming police budget. Canada’s white supremacists are cheering him on. And he’s already been caught conducting backroom talks with real-estate tycoons to open Ontario’s unique green-belt to a fire-sale of reckless development. So what was that about Ford’s folksiness? Nothing but a front for an assault on working people and the environment. The way to win against Ford’s fake populism isn’t to hem and haw about his antics. The way to win is with a real agenda of social justice and redistribution. The good news is that Andrea Horwath and the NDP are offering the beginnings of that alternative – and Ontarians are starting to pay attention. The party is pledging slightly higher taxes on corporations and the richest to pay for drug and dental coverage, more affordable housing and childcare, and debt relief for students; taking back Hydro into public control; making Ontario a Sanctuary province that provides access to services regardless of immigration status; and ending racist carding by police while destroying the collected data. Their program is far from perfect – and comes after years of a rightward slide – but it represents a crucial opportunity to concretely improve the lives of an overwhelming majority of Ontarians, and move the province in the right direction. As the NDP surges in the polls, the fear-mongering has already started. The Tories and Liberals are smearing the party as “extremist,” absurdly predicting labour unions will march in “indefinite strikes,” and stoking racist fears about migrants and refugees. Expect the warnings about a potential NDP government to reach an apocalyptic pitch: businesses fleeing, the credit rate dropping, a province beset by economic chaos. It’s just a taste of the corporate pressure that will be applied to the NDP if they win – against which the only counterweight will be organized and assertive social movements. Doug Ford is still betting that voters will be less concerned about the substance of his populism than about his shallow stunts and rhetoric. But it looks more and more likely that he might be proven wrong. Ontarians are catching on that an out-of-touch, silver-spooned con-man isn’t out to defend “the little guy” – he’s a mercenary for the millionaire class.

Its notable mostly for the severity of the online backlash, and Foley’s subsequent comical turn as “guy who didn’t realise the microphone was turned up quite so loud.” That the Daily Telegraph should gift such an incendiary line with a screaming front page headline should surprise no one, given the paper’s unmatched consistency as an amplifier of the politics of hate. This is the water we all swim in now: Pauline Hanson’s shambolic ascendency may be stalled for the moment, but there is still, as yet, no obvious political penalty for bareknuckle political assaults on whole groups of people based only on their skin colour, heritage or religion. And there needs to be, because while amateurs like Hanson try to wrench momentary advantage from these provocations, professionals like home affairs minister Peter Dutton are using them in more systematic ways. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday At the most extreme end of the scale, Australia’s inhuman and bipartisan experiment in collective punishment of refugees claimed another life on Tuesday, when a Rohingya man trapped for nearly five years in immigration detention killed himself on Manus Island. His death traces back in an unbroken line to the arms race over refugee policy that has disfigured Australian politics now for decades. Not just any refugees, as the recent debacle over the proposed fast-tracking of visas for white South African farmers made abundantly clear, but specifically refugees fleeing carnage and ethnic cleansing in the Middle East and south Asia. Orchestrated panics over African “gangs”, the fevered aggression heaped on Yassmin Abdel-Magied, and the crushing over-policing and jailing of Aboriginal people all play to the same underlying dynamic, rising and falling with each new fabricated moral panic, all pointing in the same direction. Nothing here is new, or even uniquely Australian. We’re seeing the deadly harvest of an almost scientific application of the principles of “othering” to our community. Described as “a set of dynamics, processes, and structures that engender marginality and persistent inequality across any of the full range of human differences based on group identities,” the term describes a range of social and political tools, some subtle, and some as blunt as an all-caps headline in a low-rent newspaper, designed to consolidate a particular identity at the expense of someone else. Identifying how it is done is easier than agreeing on why it is reaching such harmful magnitudes, or what to do about it. It can’t be a coincidence that this same pattern is on the rise in the United States and Europe, and India, and Japan, and Myanmar, and China. For the political convenience of weak leaders seeking to consolidate a base of support by offering a sense of common identity and protection from these formless “others”, it must be nearly irresistible, because it’s a pattern that echoes back through history as far as we can read. This alone doesn’t quite explain why global corporate media oligarchies, the Murdoch empire first among them, are such ardent promoters of the technique. One explanation comes to mind, however. Hypothetically, if you were the architects and beneficiaries of an economic system that was extracting extraordinary wealth from the lands and labour of an entire planet, and in so doing had created the most extreme forms of global inequality in the process, you might want to think about how to manage the social tensions that would inevitably arise. Doubly so if the scale of your endeavour had even started affecting the climate. If you were even peripherally aware of history, you’d know that people subjected to lifelong exploitation, forced into a precarious existence or buried under annually compounding debts will, eventually, wheel guillotines into the town square and start taking names. The pressurised anger and stress has to go somewhere – as Bengali polymath Rabindranath Tagore bleakly mused, “crowd psychology is a blind force. Like steam and other physical forces, it can be utilised for creating a tremendous amount of power”. The greater the inequality – perceived or actual – the greater the potential for outbreaks of this tremendous power. Rather than having it directed at them, our hypothetical architects and beneficiaries might choose to deflect this anger and discontent at someone else, someone other. With all the resources of modern psychology and mass media networks at hand, they might even get quite good at it. Buttressed by a punitive regime of surveillance and enforcement to keep the wayward among us in line, such a pressure cooker can be kept intact for a time, as more recent history shows. So perhaps it is not a coincidence that Dutton has taken so ardently to the task of race-based deflection and enforcement at the same time as his prime ministerial and treasury colleagues have been organising tax cuts for the already extremely wealthy and dispensing untold public largesse to the corporate sector at every opportunity. They are one in the same project. None of this will come as any comfort to the family of the man who took his life on Manus Island, or to those still trapped behind the wire. But it does throw a harsh spotlight on those who claim to offer a better alternative to the self-interested syndicate currently occupying the ministerial wing of Parliament House, and their state and territory colleagues. Fortunately for all, we don’t do guillotines in this country any more, but one enduring lesson of history is that unity eventually prevails over division, and we’ll sure as hell see you in the town square some day soon.

The findings, published in the Medical Journal of Australia on Monday, found that of 158 samples of “gluten-free” dishes from 127 randomly selected restaurants within the city of Melbourne council, 9% contained detectable gluten and were not compliant with the Food Standards Australia New Zealand definition of gluten free. Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder, not a food intolerance or allergy. It causes the immune system to attack the bowel after the ingestion of gluten, a protein found in grains such as wheat, spelt and barley. Sign up to receive the top stories every morning This immune system reaction causes inflammation and damage to the small bowel. Over time, the tiny finger-like projections in the bowel, essential for nutrient absorption, flatten and die. After eating foods containing gluten some sufferers experience severe reactions, such as diarrhoea and stomach pain, although others have no visible symptoms. But ingesting gluten puts those with coeliac disease at risk of developing serious conditions in the long term such as cancer, infertility and osteoporosis. The only way to treat coeliac disease and avoid serious complications is to adhere to a lifelong, strict, gluten-free diet. The study was led by Dr Jason Tye-Din, laboratory head at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, and a gastroenterology consultant at Royal Melbourne hospital. He said even “just a few crumbs” of foods containing gluten could be harmful over time and lead to impaired growth in children or some types of cancers. But his research team found some restaurant staff did not even know which grains contained gluten. “Lots of staff believed that spelt was gluten free for example, and maybe this is because it is often promoted as an alternative to wheat,” Tye-Din said. “But it is not safe for people with coeliac disease.” There was also a lack of knowledge about what the Food Standards Australia New Zealand standards were. Only 10% of food service staff had good knowledge of its code, the study found. “Franchise businesses tended to do better when questioned about coeliac disease and we speculate perhaps this is because their staff get uniform training and there is a higher degree of consistency,” Tye-Din said. “Some customers are now starting to specify to waitstaff they have coeliac disease because they feel as though they might be lumped into those who follow a gluten-free diet less strictly. But they shouldn’t have to specify and it shouldn’t matter why someone is gluten free. If a restaurant says something is gluten free, then it should be.” Tye-Din said he and his colleagues undertook the study after being baffled by patients who were not getting better despite following a strict gluten-free diet. He said while it may be safer for those with coeliac disease to avoid eating out, this was not realistic and would affect their quality of life. Rather, restaurants should be educated and empowered to provide safe food. A city of Melbourne councillor, Beverley Pinder, said the council was working with the food businesses that failed to meet requirements to help them to train staff and investigate their suppliers. “We want to safeguard members of the public who need to follow a gluten-free diet, as well as business owners who want to provide this option,” Pinder said. “We want everyone who visits a food business across the city of Melbourne to feel safe and to know that if something says it’s gluten free, it actually is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/may/28/aboriginal-health-groups-applaud-coalitions-8m-pledge-to-fight-htlv-1","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T21:14:16Z","webTitle":"Aboriginal groups cautiously welcome Coalition's $8m pledge to fight HTLV-1","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/28/aboriginal-health-groups-applaud-coalitions-8m-pledge-to-fight-htlv-1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/28/aboriginal-health-groups-applaud-coalitions-8m-pledge-to-fight-htlv-1","fields":{"headline":"Aboriginal groups cautiously welcome Coalition's $8m pledge to fight HTLV-1","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Doctors and Aboriginal community-controlled health organisations working on the frontline against HTLV-1 have “cautiously” welcomed the federal government’s decision on Friday to set up an $8m taskforce to combat the deadly virus. Earlier this month Guardian Australia revealed HTLV-1 is endemic in several central Australian Aboriginal communities, which have the world’s highest rates of the fatal, human immune virus for which there is no cure and no treatment. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Donna Ah Chee, the chief executive of Congress – Australia’s biggest Aboriginal community-controlled health organisation – said the announcement was welcome news, but “the role of Aboriginal people is critical in shaping the response and it cannot be left to a taskforce of experts alone”. “There must be respect for local knowledge, promoting culturally acceptable and appropriate health information and care,” she said. Congress is working with the central Australia academic health science centre to convene a workshop in early August to discuss appropriate responses to HTLV-1, bringing together Aboriginal health services, Alice Springs Hospital, key research institutions and invited experts. “There has been much publicity on this in recent weeks and now it is time to take stock and carefully consider the issue,” Ah Chee said. “We cannot have a top-down, kneejerk reaction, and we all need to work together to make sure this does not occur. “We want to achieve consensus on the current state of knowledge, identify gaps in knowledge that require further research and consider whether there is a need to change current clinical guidelines for health practitioners in relation to HTLV-1. “As long as this new funding announcement can assist us to do what is needed then it is a very welcome announcement.” The $8m taskforce announced on Friday will be led by the commonwealth’s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy. It will bring together Aboriginal communities, relevant health providers, researchers, clinicians and all levels of government “to look at HTLV-1 and other emerging communicable diseases in remote communities”, said the health minister, Greg Hunt. Dr Lloyd Einsiedel is an infectious diseases clinician with the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute based at Alice Springs hospital, and has been working to raise awareness of HTLV-1.Einsiedel said he was pleased the government had acted so quickly and he was looking forward to seeing who will be appointed to do this crucial work. Guardian Australia understands the taskforce will particularly focus on partnering internationally to improve a global understanding of the virus. As Guardian Australia first reported last month, researchers in Japan are conducting clinical trials of a potential vaccine, and the UK has a national centre to treat the estimated 20,000 to 30,000 people there living with HTLV-1. Clinicians in both countries expressed alarm at the high rates of the virus in central Australia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/25/liverpool-real-madrid-champions-league-final","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T11:00:44Z","webTitle":"Liverpool and Real Madrid prepare for battle of attack-minded aristocracy | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/25/liverpool-real-madrid-champions-league-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/25/liverpool-real-madrid-champions-league-final","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool and Real Madrid prepare for battle of attack-minded aristocracy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ils sont les meilleurs. Sie sind die Besten. These are the champions! At least they are if you squint a little. When Liverpool and Real Madrid walk out at the Olympic Stadium in Kiev, neck hairs prickling to the wonderfully overblown strains of Tony Britten’s choral Champions League theme, they will do so in the capacity of genuine European aristocracy. By the end of Saturday night these two clubs will have won five of the past 14 Champions Leagues between them and almost a third of all European Cups since the competition was born more than half a century ago. There is a purity even in the prospect of meringue white versus Anfield red, a skein of emotional authenticity in the flags, the songs, that shared folk memory of so many other floodlit triumphs. There is, of course, another side to this. Some will question the right of either team to proclaim themselves the best in Europe when between them these two champions in waiting finished a combined 42 points behind Manchester City and Barcelona in the weekly grind. Not that there’s anything new in this. The last reigning domestic champions to lift Europe’s shiniest trophy were the peak Messi-Pep Barcelona of 2011, evidence either of the dilution of the competition’s purity or of its sheer depth of quality, depending on where you choose to stand. This time, though, the disjunct is pronounced. For Madrid a fourth title in five years would install this team as unassailable masters of the modern age. At home they have two league titles in the past decade. Liverpool haven’t been champions of England in more than a quarter of a century. Die Meister. Die Besten. Les grandes équipes! And yet for all the gripes there are certain unassailable qualities in both these finalists, peaks that have been beyond the rest of Europe this year. Not least that visceral commitment to attack embodied in the headline acts Cristiano Ronaldo and Mo Salah. Nobody else has scored more goals in the competition this season than these two teams. Nobody else has had more shots on target or attacked with such cavalier conviction. Liverpool have scored or conceded 53 goals in the tournament proper en route to Kiev, Madrid 45. By way of comparison, Manchester United conceded five and scored 13 across eight games in the course of a meek last-16 exit that felt as if it came from another sporting age altogether. Attacking football is in vogue, state of the art among winning teams, although not simply the annihilating slow death of possession football. Liverpool are 10th when it comes to average minutes in possession of the ball this year, Madrid fifth. Victory has instead come through periods of sustained attacking heat, a way of playing that some have called the surge or the blitz. Liverpool did not win in Germany, Portugal and Manchester by wearing their opponents down but by conjuring up those famous attacking spells, moments where they simply flip the switch and enter the Red Zone, a team playing through a kind of synchronised rage. Madrid were almost laughably fortunate in the second leg of their semi-final against Bayern Munich at the Bernabéu, hanging on as the ball trickled or dribbled away from the vital touch so often that there was a kind of hysteria in the stands by the end. But that tie, like the previous round against Juventus, was won by trusting in the cutting edge at the other end, the absolute conviction that at some point those strengths will tell. To borrow a line from Gary Player, the more Real Madrid keep on winning the Champions League in haphazard attacking fashion the luckier they seem to get. Either way, the vocal majority who seemed so underwhelmed by the dogged, reactive football on show in Saturday’s FA Cup final can at least be assured of something else in Kiev. There will be extremes of attacking intent. There will be defensive slackness. There will be goals. Talking of which: enter the big two. It is, of course, misguided to obsess over individuals in what is more than ever a team sport. But this is unlikely to stop anyone doing it – relentlessly, and with an increasing reverence for the power of the star player, a sport of endless close-ups and grand-scale personality obsession. The Champions League final dishes up a little more in the way of ultimacy here, with a meeting of Ronaldo and Salah: football’s reigning golden goal-dalek, the current owner of the Ballon d’Or, versus the Premier League’s own man of the season. It has been almost too easy to pitch this final as a shootout between two players who have 25 Champions League goals between them. But sometimes you just have to go with it, not least when both embody and enact the most extreme strengths of their own team; and when they have a little more in common as players than might at first seem the case. Zinedine Zidane has already announced that he wouldn’t take Salah in his Madrid team. It is hard to imagine him saying anything else on the eve of the final, just as there is no real comparison to be made here, at least not yet. Ronaldo is an all-time phenomenon, remarkable for his sustained, relentless productivity. Salah has been operating somewhere close to this for nine months now. But still, we are in the late days now of the Messi-Ronaldo godhead, a conjoined supremacy that has been soundtracked by a rolling sub-debate about succession, about the next of the next-besters. Salah’s 42 goals this season (to Ronaldo’s 41) have elevated his status, a newbie face among that raft of pretenders. In terms of style – left-footed, jinky, shaggy-haired – Salah has most often been compared to Messi. But the fact is that he is probably closer to Ronaldo. Both run relentlessly, popping up in the top five attackers for metres covered in the Champions League this season. Like a mid-20s Ronaldo, Salah is a power-runner with wonderfully quick feet and the ability at his best to basically make the game up in front of him. Salah is yet to reach anywhere near the same heights. But in his best moments he looks a bit like a product of some advanced gene-splicing Ronaldo-Messi experiments: the body of a shaggy-haired, left-footed jinker, but the direct style of a sprinter, a cutting edge rather than a playmaker. In Kiev, Salah and Ronaldo will once again be key to the attacking tempo of the competition’s two highest scoring teams. There has been a slight adaption with Madrid. These days they like to push you back and keep possession, to load balls into the box knowing Ronaldo will eventually find the tiny pocket of air he requires to combination punch the ball into the back of the net. With Liverpool the best moments have all been about the surge and the blitz, led so often by Salah. The Olympic Stadium was originally known as the Red Stadium of Trotsky, and after that as the just the Red Stadium. The ability of the team and their fans to turn the air red on Saturday night, to generate that shared driving energy, will be key to Liverpool’s chances. Either way, it promises to be a thrilling, extreme and in its own way entirely apt meeting of the knockout cavaliers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/26/michael-cohen-profile-trump-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T13:25:47Z","webTitle":"Michael Cohen: inside the strange world of Trump's fixer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/26/michael-cohen-profile-trump-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/26/michael-cohen-profile-trump-russia","fields":{"headline":"Michael Cohen: inside the strange world of Trump's fixer","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Just before he got his dream job as Donald Trump’s right-hand man, Michael Cohen was quoted in a 2007 tabloid news story hyping a Trump condo development in New Jersey. “Trump properties are solid investments,” said Cohen, who by then had bought at least three. Trump’s decision to hire Cohen has served the president well over the years, particularly for tasks requiring a mix of bluster and discretion – skills Cohen might have picked up in his days as a personal injury lawyer or in the taxi cab business. But with prosecutors closing in on Cohen, his lifelong investment in Trump is beginning to look shaky. The question now is: will one of the president’s most devoted lieutenants decide, at some point, to cut his losses and cooperate with prosecutors investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia? On 9 April, FBI agents raided Cohen’s residence, hotel room, office, safety deposit box and electronic devices, seizing evidence of potential crimes described by the government as relating to Cohen’s “business dealings”. An indictment of Cohen is “likely”, a federal judge wrote in a separate case. The raids were conducted after the special counsel heading up the Russia investigation, Robert Mueller, referred information to an independent team of federal prosecutors in the southern district of New York, effectively carving out the Cohen case and protecting it from any potential move by the president against Mueller. If Cohen, 51, is charged with a crime, he may suddenly have the opportunity to prove his oft-avowed loyalty to Trump in a dramatic way – by going to prison, instead of agreeing to side with Mueller, as three other former Trump aides already have. Former Trump campaign adviser Sam Nunberg, who has worked closely with Cohen and calls him a “teddy bear”, told the Guardian that he had urged Cohen not to take his loyalty to Trump too far. “If Michael did something outside the scope of any of his duties for Donald Trump, then that’s Michael’s problem,” Nunberg said. “But he should not go to jail for anything that he did for Trump. And if he does, then he deserves all the terrible things that will happen to him in jail.” Cohen did not respond to a request for comment and has previously denied all wrongdoing through his lawyer, who did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has claimed that the investigation of Cohen “doesn’t have to do with me”. But as a Trump employee who for 12 years enjoyed unusually close access to the boss and was entrusted with the most sensitive errands, Cohen is inextricably caught up in Trump’s world and could be poised to hasten its unraveling. Cohen’s official title in the Trump Organization, which he left after the election to continue to advise Trump on a personal basis, was executive vice-president and special counsel to Trump. In practice, Cohen’s duties were both idiosyncratic and expansive, ranging from putting together foreign real estate deals to telling off reporters to buying the silence of women linked romantically to Trump. “If somebody does something Mr Trump doesn’t like, I do everything in my power to resolve it to Mr Trump’s benefit,” Cohen told ABC News in 2011. “If you do something wrong, I’m going to come at you, grab you by the neck, and I’m not going to let you go until I’m finished.” It was in this bulldog capacity that Cohen set in motion the chain of events that has drawn him, and by extension the president, into legally vulnerable territory. In October 2016, Cohen set up a shell company to pay off the pornographic film actor Stormy Daniels, who has said she had an affair with Trump beginning in 2006, which Trump has denied. But after the election, Cohen began to use the company, Essential Consultants LLC, in a new way, to collect millions of dollars for himself from clients eager for the new president’s ear. Those clients allegedly included foreign entities. A bank flagged the transactions and prosecutors appear to be weighing charges against Cohen that could include bank fraud, wire fraud and campaign finance violations. The pressure from that investigation and Cohen’s loyalty to Trump are pulling him in opposite directions. But if he is now the man in the middle, Cohen was once very much on the fringes, as a hustling lawyer working out of a taxi stand in Queens, with his eyes on the Manhattan skyline. Five Towns Cohen was raised in the village of Lawrence, in the Five Towns section of Long Island, in the shadow of John F Kennedy airport. The son of a nurse, Sondra, and an ear, nose and throat surgeon, Maurice, a Holocaust survivor from Poland, Cohen attended a Jewish day school and later the Lawrence Woodmere Academy. He has said he grew up admiring Trump, and read the Art of the Deal, Trump’s magnum opus, twice. In college at American University in Washington DC, Cohen drove a Porsche and had a business importing luxury cars, the New York Times reported. One of his college roommates, the New York artist Laurance Rassin, would go on to play a strange role in the Trump campaign, giving interviews as a random Trump supporter at a 2016 taping in which TV host Dr Oz reviewed Trump’s medical records. “He’s been healthy – he says he’s been healthy. I believe him,” Rassin said. In 1992, Cohen graduated from Thomas M Cooley law school in Lansing, Michigan, which has been featured on more than one list of the worst law schools in the country. Upon returning to New York, Cohen set up a personal injury law practice, bringing charges of negligence on behalf of auto accident victims in many cases, according to a deposition obtained by Rolling Stone. At least one of his clients was indicted on insurance fraud charges, the magazine reported. At his office near the foot of the 59th Street bridge in Queens, Cohen shared space with a taxi cab management company, a business he entered through his marriage in 1994 to Laura Shusterman, the daughter of a Ukrainian immigrant and taxi operator. The couple eventually built taxi companies that owned dozens of medallions in New York and Chicago, worth millions at the peak of the market. At one time, Cohen has said, he carried a pistol in an ankle holster. On Tuesday, a longtime partner of Cohen’s in the taxi business, Evgeny Freidman, a Russian immigrant, agreed to cooperate with prosecutors to avoid prison time on charges that he had failed to pay more than $5m in taxes. Known as the “taxi king” of New York City for the volume of his business, Freidman could shed light on Cohen’s private cashflow, which in recent years has included a $26m loan Cohen made with his father-in-law to a second taxi magnate, also a Ukrainian immigrant, who is shifting into the legalized marijuana industry, the Associated Press revealed. Cohen distanced himself from Freidman, denying they were partners. In those years before the Trump Organization, meanwhile, Cohen scrambled for other investments that included a failed partnership with two other Ukrainian immigrants on a casino cruise business run out of Miami Beach, Florida. He also helped set up two medical practices, an acupuncture clinic, and two medical billing companies, with a doctor at one of the offices later pleading guilty to a fraud scheme, the New York Times reported. Cohen’s role, if any, in operating the businesses remains unclear. The through line in Cohen’s ventures from the era were his partnerships with immigrants from Ukraine or Russia. In one purported real estate deal, Cohen was accused of civil fraud over a $350,000 check he had received from a Russian hockey player. Cohen testified that he did not recall where the money went and he was not charged with a crime. Until the presidential election, Cohen held a minority stake in a Brooklyn club owned by his uncle, Morton Levine – “Uncle Morty”, in the family – whom the FBI accused in 1983 of providing medical services to the Lucchese crime syndicate, according to the Times report. Levine was never charged with wrongdoing. But the club, El Caribe, was used as an office by the Russian mob boss Evsei Agron, who was assassinated in 1985, and by his successor, Marat Balagula, who was later convicted of credit card fraud and gasoline bootlegging. Seemingly far from such intrigue, Cohen and his wife started a family, having two children, a son who plays baseball and a daughter who just graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. And they began buying Trump real estate. Trump time Cohen first came to Trump’s attention, the way he has told it, by helping to resolve a board dispute in one of Trump’s buildings. When the Trump Organization job offer came up, Cohen has said, he quit his law partnership on the spot. Early in his Trump tenure, Cohen scouted a dead-end golf course project in Fresno, California, and stood as the chief operations officer of Affliction Entertainment, a mixed martial arts company Trump was promoting. “He told me that he studied martial arts,” former Affliction vice-president Tom Atencio told the Daily Beast. “He was a really nice guy.” Later Cohen spearheaded Trump real estate projects or attempted projects in the former Soviet states of Russia, Georgia and Kazakhstan, including with partners that have been subject to US sanctions or suspected of money laundering, the New Yorker reported. Along the way, Cohen showed a willingness to defend Trump against all comers, even if – or especially if – it meant getting nasty. “I’m warning you, tread very fucking lightly, because what I’m going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting,” Cohen told a journalist reporting in 2015 on a sexual assault claim against Trump by ex-wife Ivana Trump. “You understand me?” But Cohen did not get rough only with reporters. A lawsuit brought against Trump this spring by Stormy Daniels, born Stephanie Clifford, accuses Cohen of “attempts to intimidate Ms Clifford into silence and ‘shut her up’ in order to ‘protect Mr Trump’”. Cohen has asserted fifth amendment protections against self-incrimination to avoid testifying in the case. Underlying his occasional pugnacity, Cohen appears to harbor a vulnerable side that includes a deep-seated fear of disappointing Trump. “Not you or anyone you know will embarrass me in front of Mr. T when he asks me what is happening,” Cohen texted an associate, Felix Sater, when their efforts to broker a deal for a Trump tower in Moscow had foundered, according to messages obtained by BuzzFeed News. Cohen added: “After almost two months of waiting you send me some bullshit letter from a third-tier bank and you think I’m going to walk into the boss’s office and tell him I’m going there for this?” By all accounts, Cohen was wounded when Trump did not offer him a White House job, in a decision that has been linked to machinations by Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner. “Boss, I miss you so much,” the Wall Street Journal quoted Cohen as telling Trump in a long-distance phone call in the spring of 2017. “I wish I was down there with you. It’s really hard for me to be here.” It was not the first time that Cohen had reason to feel betrayed by Trump, who reportedly embarrassed Cohen at his son’s bar mitzvah – showing up late and then giving a speech describing how Cohen had begged him to come – and sidelined Cohen at the presidential inauguration. Nunberg, who was fired from the Trump campaign in 2015 over racially charged Facebook posts, said he tried to warn Cohen that his loyalty to Trump would not be reciprocated. “He called me to meet a week after I was fired,” Nunberg said. “I said to Michael, I told him, ‘get your head out of your ass, for once, with him [Trump]. He has no loyalty to anyone. He plays favorites. He doesn’t appreciate you.” Essential Consultants When he set up Essential Consultants LLC in October 2016, Cohen filed paperwork with First Republic bank designating the company as a vehicle for modest commercial and residential real estate deals, the New Yorker reported. Then the money started to flow. Between November 2016 and January 2018 it came in: $600,000 from AT&amp;T, the telecom giant; $1.2m from Novartis, the Swiss drug maker; $580,000 from Columbus Nova, an investment firm linked to a Russian oligarch, Viktor Vekselberg, who had met Cohen at Trump Tower during the presidential transition; $150,000 from a Korean defense contractor; and reportedly millions more in additional deposits from sources that have not yet been publicly identified. The money flowed out, too: more than $1m to personal accounts belonging to Cohen; separate checks written to Cohen for more than $100,000; additional funds to cover credit card bills, car payments, social club dues, the New Yorker reported. Trump has denied knowledge of the payments. Apart from a $130,000 payment to Daniels, it’s not clear what disbursements from the account were directly related to Trump. What is clear is that Cohen was impressed with the potential of his latest enterprise. “I’m crushing it,” he told an associate at the time, according to the Washington Post. In the salad days after the inauguration, Cohen hoovered up money from elsewhere. The Washington-based law firm and lobbying powerhouse Squire Patton Boggs agreed to pay Cohen $500,000 for a year’s work. Ukrainian sources paid Cohen $400,000 to set up a White House meeting between Trump and the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, the BBC reported on Tuesday. But not everyone Cohen approached wanted in on the deal. Uber reportedly rejected Cohen’s advances, as did Ahmed al-Rumaihi, the head of Qatar Investments, who said Cohen hit him up for $1m at a restaurant in New York’s Peninsula hotel. “He just threw it out there” as a cost of “doing business”, Rumaihi told the Washington Post. Not all of Cohen’s new clients were pleased with his work. Novartis held only one meeting with him, and the lawyer who arranged it later quit the company. AT&amp;T’s CEO called the decision to hire Cohen “a big mistake”, and the company’s top lobbyist was forced to retire. There was one other notable payment that came Cohen’s way in 2017. A financial disclosure form filed last week by Trump revealed that the president had “reimbursed” Cohen for unspecified expenses in the $100,001 – $250,000 range. ‘An attack on our country’ Not only did Cohen have a ringside seat during the election to continuous contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives, he would have firsthand knowledge of Russian investments in Trump properties in the United States and abroad. Working alongside Cohen on those deals were Trump’s children, potentially making any cooperation between Cohen and prosecutors viscerally threatening to Trump. Trump, who called the Cohen raid “an attack on our country in a true sense”, has repeatedly erupted about the case, accusing the New York Times of “going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me” after the paper published this quote about Cohen from the former Trump adviser Roger Stone Jr: “Donald goes out of his way to treat him like garbage.” “Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if it means lying or making up stories,” Trump tweeted. “Sorry, I don’t see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media!” But there are signs the strain is getting to the president’s famously loyal lawyer. Vanity Fair quoted him as telling a friend last week: “I just can’t take this anymore.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/25/liverpool-roberto-firmino-champions-league-final","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T09:20:43Z","webTitle":"Liverpool’s Roberto Firmino: shy, strong-willed – and a complete striker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/25/liverpool-roberto-firmino-champions-league-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/25/liverpool-roberto-firmino-champions-league-final","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool’s Roberto Firmino: shy, strong-willed – and a complete striker","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What distinguished Roberto Firmino in the eyes of Hemerson Maria were not two overhead kicks the 17-year-old scored against his Figueirense team, although they convinced the coach to sanction the teenager’s transfer from Clube de Regatas Brasil (CRB) on first sight. It was a conversation they shared several months later when he found Firmino alone, almost 2,000 miles from home and refusing to go back to Maceió. “We had played a state league game, under-17s, and afterwards there was a recess, I think one week or more without any activities,” he recalls. “All my players travelled to be with their family, except Firmino. I remember that he was alone in Florianopolis. His parents had stayed living in Maceió. The last time Firmino had seen them was seven months earlier but he decided to stay in Florianopolis. He said to me: ‘I want to stay here. I need to practice more, I don’t want to lose time. I will stop only after I make something good with my life.’ I was surprised. He is shy but he has a strong personality and mentality. He knows what he wants in his career and his life.” Firmino’s father, José Roberto Cordeiro, was a hawker on the streets of Maceió when his son started with CRB. When José went to a game at CRB, the club he supported, it was not to watch Firmino but to sell beer, water and soft drinks outside. He could not afford a ticket. A decade later there is a ticket with José Roberto Cordeiro’s name on. It is for Saturday’s Champions League final at NSC Olimpiyskiy Stadium in Kiev. VIP section. His son, central to Liverpool’s hopes of defeating Real Madrid, has made something good with his life. Behind the flamboyant dress sense, the bling, the maverick goal celebrations and the no-look finishes there appears a radically different side to the centre-forward. Shy. Quiet. Introverted. The words crop up whenever those who have been part of the 26-year-old’s career are asked to describe him. Or at least from those who will describe him. Firmino asked his immediate family and closest friends to politely decline interviews in the buildup to a final that demands singular focus. Nothing can get in the way of his dream. It has always been that way. Nene Zini, an agent for Firmino, explains: “When he moved to Hoffenheim [aged 19] I asked him twice about how it was going, if he liked the city, the country, the new life. He was living alone, no family were with him there. I was concerned but he said he hadn’t any problems. But I didn’t feel confident so I said: ‘My job is to help you. Whatever you need, tell me. I will do everything for you.’ And Firmino replied: ‘No worries. I am fine. If I wasn’t happy I would have left the club and the country.’ I didn’t understand him then but I understand now. He is shy, a man of few words, but he has a strong personality.” The Brazil international, selected for the World Cup following an outstanding season, is “a footballer from his head to his toes” in the words of Jürgen Klopp. There is no greater champion of Firmino than the Liverpool manager. “I order a song for Bobby!” Klopp told LFCTV this week. To him, songs for Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané but only a chant for the conductor of Liverpool’s devastating attacks makes little sense. It suits Firmino, however, to have Salah taking the spotlight. He revels in his selfless role even though, as the PFA Premier League team of the season testified, with Firmino absent, his influence can be overlooked outside Anfield. “This constant discussion about whether he’s undervalued or whatever in public,” said Klopp. “This never happened for one second either in the club or in the team.” Thierry Henry, a sound and independent judge, described Firmino as “the most complete striker in the league”. It is an education to track his movement and work-rate through a game, albeit also a struggle to focus on one player given the range of threats in Klopp’s attack. No Liverpool player covered more ground in the Premier League than Firmino. His total of 347.7km is remarkable for a forward and underlines his importance to Klopp’s system and the manager’s reluctance to withdraw him even with a comfortable lead. He covered, on average, 11.3km per game. No Liverpool player made more sprints in the Premier League. With 2,353, Firmino comfortably eclipsed Salah in second place by 366 and averaged 76.3 sprints every 90 minutes. No Liverpool forward made more interceptions than Firmino, his 18 double the amount made by Mané in second. Salah made five. Firmino’s 15 goals and seven assists in the league played a major part in Liverpool qualifying for the Champions League. In Europe, however, Firmino’s influence and end product have been arguably greater. With 10 goals – 11 when the one against Hoffenheim in the qualifier is included – he and Salah have scored more in a single European campaign than any other player in Liverpool’s European history. Firmino has also provided seven assists, giving him direct involvement in 42.5% of the record 40 goals Liverpool have scored from the group stage onwards. “This is my best year as a professional footballer,” he reflected last week. It started very differently. Hemerson Maria, coach of Vila Nova in Brazil, explains: “When we started to work together at Figueirense I called Roberto ‘Alberto’ for two weeks. All the time I shouted ‘Alberto, Alberto, Alberto’ and he never corrected me. I said Alberto and he listened and obeyed the instructions. After two weeks my colleague asked me: ‘Why are you calling Roberto as Alberto? His name is Roberto, Roberto Firmino’. I didn’t know! I asked Roberto why he never said the correct name to me. But he is very shy and said: ‘It’s fine teacher, no worries.’” He may be more forceful when reminding Madrid of his name in Kiev.

The madcap mercenary returned in his sequel vehicle last week, and with a few unexpected friends in tow: both Matt Damon and Brad Pitt made cameo appearances in the film, though a viewer would be forgiven for having missed them. Pitt appeared for all of eight seconds as the vanishing Vanisher, and Damon was unrecognizable under a mound of facial prosthetics and makeup for his role as an obese country boy. Known to wrap in-jokes around other in-jokes then baked into a third in-joke, Deadpool has made a stock in trade out of blink-and-you’ll-miss-it gags such as these. This comes in the wake of the revelation that Black Panther included such an Easter egg as well, deploying Daily Show host Trevor Noah’s South African accent for the voice of Shuri’s ship’s onboard computer. Pop cinema is littered with these “secret” cameos, moments in which an actor pops up without fully making themselves known, leaving a surprise for audiences that enjoy scanning the credits for familiar names. Read on for a survey of such low-profile performances – they could be hiding anywhere: Assorted music stars, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire The Yule Ball is the hottest event on the social calendar at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and of course the administration must land the rock band du jour to provide the evening’s entertainment. The whimsical all-male Weird Sisters go unnamed in the film due to a protracted legal battle with real-life Canadian outfit the Wyrd Sisters, but still had the honor of being portrayed by some incognito alternative legends. Jonny Greenwood, part-time Radiohead guitarist and part-time soundtrack composer for the likes of Paul Thomas Anderson and Lynne Ramsay, lent his six-string talents to Mike Newell’s production, as did Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker and his bandmate Steve Mackey. Chris Martin, Shaun of the Dead Genre prince Edgar Wright has no shortage of A-list fans, a handful of whom have passed through his set for an afternoon. Coldplay singer Chris Martin showed up – pre-conscious uncoupling – as a zombified husk of himself in this 2004 horror homage, lurching around as one of the undead camped outside the Winchester in the film’s grand finale. (Martin also made a more discernible cameo earlier on, appearing as himself on a TV broadcast within the movie.) Peter Jackson and Cate Blanchett, Hot Fuzz For his follow-up in 2007, Wright wrangled even more admirers and hid them even more tactfully. In a nod to his stint in the world of cheap-o oddities prior to the move to Middle-earth, Peter Jackson made a split-second appearance as a psychotic murderer dressed up in a Santa suit, stabbing a cop through the hand. An even bigger coup came in the form of Cate Blanchett, hidden behind the hazmat suit and facemask of a crime scene forensics team. As our hero’s exasperated ex-girlfriend Janine, Blanchett refused a spot in the credit roll and even donated her fee on the film to charity. George Harrison, Monty Python’s Life of Brian By 1979, George Harrison’s Beatlemania days were long behind him, and he needed something to keep him busy between highly acclaimed solo albums. A vocal supporter of the Monty Python comedy troupe, Harrison took it upon himself to secure the lads financing for their feature-length successor to the cult classic Holy Grail. As a token of their gratitude, the Monty Python team stuck a robustly bearded Harrison in the corner of one scene as the “owner of the Mount” Mr Papadopoulos, a local all too eager to glad-hand a bit with Jesus Christ. Harrison would later lend another helping hand to a film production, shepherding Withnail &amp; I through the production process. Lloyd Kaufman and Toxie, Guardians of the Galaxy James Gunn got his start as a hand-for-hire at Troma Entertainment, the lovably disreputable schlock factory out of which the Toxic Avenger once slithered. Gunn cut his teeth with such films as The Tromaville Cafe and Tromeo and Juliet, forming a lifelong bond with mentor Lloyd Kaufman. When Gunn received Marvel’s keys to the kingdom with a galactic-sized budget on Guardians of the Galaxy, he knew he had to kick a little back to his roots. During the interlude at the space jail, a rabid-faced Kaufman appears near a Toxic Avenger-looking monstrosity, both cheering with bloodlust – and perhaps a hint of pride? – for a prison yard brawl. Cameron Diaz, Cameron Crowe and Paul Thomas Anderson, Minority Report If anyone’s got a deep Rolodex, it’s Steven Spielberg, and with his stature in Hollywood, he’s not so much calling in favors as he is calling in golden opportunities. Among those who responded to the call: director Cameron Crowe (who had already snuck Spielberg into his film Vanilla Sky) and Cameron Diaz, both of whom fill out a train car as shifty-looking extras. Legend has it that Paul Thomas Anderson was present on the locomotive as well, and while he remembers shooting his piece, he has confessed that he can’t locate himself in the frame. Daniel Craig, The Force Awakens Once upon a time, James Bond and Luke Skywalker were neighbors. Spectre shot at England’s Pinewood Studios at the same time as The Force Awakens, and for star Daniel Craig, hopping from one universe to another was as simple as walking over to the next soundstage. He donned the stormtrooper’s shiny white helmet for one scene, in which his evil lackey threatens our hero Rey after she can’t quite get the hang of the Jedi mind trick. Identifiable only by his coarse British accent, Craig vehemently denied his involvement with the renewal from a galaxy far away right through its release. Bill Hader and Ben Schwartz, The Force Awakens The reopening of the Star Wars narrative gave the people a new champion in BB-8, a roly-poly droid prone to slapstick humor and fits of cuteness. For his “voice” of indecipherable bleeps and bloops, director JJ Abrams tapped expressive funnymen Ben Schwartz and Bill Hader to provide a foundation. The two actors read actual lines of English-language dialogue, which was then worked back through a talk-box into the automated audio output humming from BB-8’s internal speakers. Outdoing R2-D2’s signature scream was an unenviable task, but merchandising sales would suggest they did a bang-up job. Bill Murray, Dumb and Dumber To Sure, his utility in the film may be solely the setup of a belabored Breaking Bad parody. But from Garfield to Rock the Kasbah, nobody has ever really understood how Bill Murray chooses the work he takes. Never peeking out from beyond his gas mask, Murray does his most convincing Walter White routine as Harry’s affable, meth-cooking roommate. Even when he’s cooking for the elusive 99% purity potency, he goes about his business with the geniality of a mother baking a batch of cookies. “Best day of my life,” Murray mutters from inside the suit, and the simple humility of his intonation makes you want to believe him. Glenn Close, Hook Close was a household name by 1991, having made her mark in such erotic, mature fare as Dangerous Liaisons and Fatal Attraction. Still, she snuck by most of America as Gutless the Pirate, her distinctive jawline veiled by a particularly scratchy-looking beard. Gutless learns the hard way never to bet against the nefarious Captain Hook, sentenced to a time-out in the fearsome “boo box”, a metal chamber in which a pair of nasty-tempered scorpions are your only company. Close would cross-dress again years later for Albert Nobbs, albeit in a more dramatically committed, scorpion-free capacity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/24/congress-fbi-classified-briefing-trump-collusion-informant","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T22:56:22Z","webTitle":"Classified collusion briefing features top lawmakers, FBI … and Trump's lawyer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/24/congress-fbi-classified-briefing-trump-collusion-informant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/24/congress-fbi-classified-briefing-trump-collusion-informant","fields":{"headline":"Classified collusion briefing features top lawmakers, FBI … and Trump's lawyer","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Two much anticipated congressional briefings on the FBI’s use of an informant in the investigation into potential Russian collusion with the Trump campaign in 2016 featured an unusual guest on Thursday: Donald Trump’s lawyer Emmet Flood. Flood, along with the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, attended two separate briefings. The first was held at the Department of Justice initially for two top Republicans, Devin Nunes, the chair of the House intelligence committee, and Trey Gowdy, the chair of the House government oversight and reform committee. However, Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, eventually joined them after an outcry that the meeting would be partisan. In particular, the presence of Nunes, who was forced to step aside from oversight of the Russia investigation for much of 2017 after an ethics complaint over disclosure of classified information, raised concern from Democrats. In addition to Schiff being invited to the first meeting, a second meeting was held in the Capitol for the Gang of Eight, a bipartisan group that includes party leaders in each chamber of Congress and on both the House and Senate intelligence committees. However, the presence of Flood, Trump’s White House lawyer for the Russia investigation raised eyebrows. “Emmet Flood’s presence and statement at the outset of both meetings today was completely inappropriate … his involvement – in any capacity – was entirely improper, and I made this clear to him,” Schiff said. In a statement, the White House said that Flood and Kelly went to the Department of Justice and Capitol Hill “to facilitate meetings between Members of Congress, DOJ, FBI, and DNI. Neither Chief Kelly nor Mr Flood actually attended the meetings but did make brief remarks before the meetings started to relay the President’s desire for as much openness as possible under the law.” The statement from the White House added: “They also conveyed the President’s understanding of the need to protect human intelligence services and the importance of communication between the branches of government. After making their brief comments they departed before the meetings officially started.” In an interview with Politico, the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is also representing Trump, said that information from the meeting could help accelerate the investigation. “We want to see how the briefing went today and how much we learned from it,” said Giuliani. “If we learned a good deal from it, it will shorten that whole process considerably.” The FBI director, Christopher Wray, deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, and director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, conducted the briefing about the informant’s contacts with the Trump campaign. Trump has seized on the FBI’s use of an informant to accuse what he calls the “criminal deep state” of spying on his campaign. Through tweets and media surrogates he has alleged that the Mueller investigation is on a “witch-hunt”. Trump escalated his offensive against the inquiry on Sunday when he tweeted: “I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes – and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!” That tweet was followed on Monday by a White House meeting with Wray, Rosenstein and Coats where they agreed to allow Kelly to arrange Thursday’s meetings with congressional leaders. Democrats left the meeting unimpressed. In a joint statement, the four who attended the second briefing said: “Today’s Gang of Eight briefing was conducted to ensure protection of sources and methods. Nothing we heard today has changed our view that there is no evidence to support any allegation that the FBI or any intelligence agency placed a ‘spy’ in the Trump campaign, or otherwise failed to follow appropriate procedures and protocols.” The House speaker, Paul Ryan, who attended the first meeting after a scheduling conflict meant he could not go to the second one, defended it in a statement. “As always, I cannot and will not comment on a classified session. I look forward to the prompt completion of the intelligence committee’s oversight work in this area now that they are getting the cooperation necessary for them to complete their work while protecting sources and methods,” said the Wisconsin Republican."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/25/frydenberg-again-delays-giving-protection-to-threatened-woodlands","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T06:24:24Z","webTitle":"Frydenberg again delays giving protection to threatened woodlands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/25/frydenberg-again-delays-giving-protection-to-threatened-woodlands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/25/frydenberg-again-delays-giving-protection-to-threatened-woodlands","fields":{"headline":"Frydenberg again delays giving protection to threatened woodlands","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Conservation groups have accused the environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, of allowing political interference in the scientific assessment of threatened species listings. Frydenberg has delayed, for the third time, granting an endangered listing to woodlands eligible for protection under Australia’s national environment laws. A notice published on his department’s website says the minister has postponed a decision on the poplar box grassy woodlands on alluvial plains, a type of grassy eucalypt woodland found in New South Wales and Queensland, until the end of November. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The reason given is the minister wants to be able to consider any recommendations from a review into the interaction between the national environment law – the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act – and the agriculture and food production industries. The review was announced by the government at the end of March, almost a year after the independent threatened species scientific committee recommended the woodlands for an endangered listing. Humane Society International, which nominated the woodlands for protection more than five years ago, said it was concerned the minister was shifting the goal posts in a scientific process that was originally due to conclude before the review was even launched. “This latest deferral from minister Frydenberg is particularly galling – yet another excuse to avoid his responsibility to list poplar box woodlands as endangered,” the HSI head of programs, Evan Quartermain, said. “The scientific committee’s advice delivered to the minister more than a year ago leaves no doubt that the woodlands warrant listing, and neglecting to act on this advice puts remnants of the ecosystem in need of protection at unnecessary risk.” Quartermain added the organisation was concerned the threatened species listing process had been included in the terms of reference for the review. He said any changes to the EPBC Act that allowed political intervention or factors other than threat status to be considered during the listing process would be a blow for evidence-based decision making. Under the act, environment ministers are only allowed to consider whether an ecological community meets criteria for listing and the effect a listing might have on its survival when making decisions about whether to grant nationally threatened status. However, the public can make submissions to the environment and energy department about potential threatened species listings during the listing process. Guardian Australia revealed in April national and state farmers’ groups and Tasmanian Liberals had lobbied Frydenberg not to grant threatened status to two ecological communities awaiting decisions from the minister. Environment groups have expressed growing concern that political lobbying by the agriculture industry has begun to influence the threatened species listing process, despite a productivity commission report last year showing there are fewer EPBC referrals from farming than any other sector. In response to questions from Guardian Australia, Frydenberg said the review into the interaction between environment laws and agriculture was “about getting the balance right to deliver the best environmental and economic outcomes”. “It builds on the Productivity Commission’s 2017 report into the regulation of Australian agriculture, which found that improvements could be made to reduce the complexity of regulation and the actions requiring compliance with the act,” he said. Australian Conservation Foundation policy analyst James Trezise said the decision to delay the listing of the woodlands again “demonstrates a deeply troubling trend toward political interference in the scientific listing process under our national environment laws”. “The government is trying to hide behind its agriculture review, when in fact it’s bowing to pressure from industry lobbyists,” Trezise said. “This is further evidence that we need a new generation of environment laws that actually protects nature, with decisions made by an independent body free from political interference.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/24/bishop-michael-curry-reclaiming-jesus-washington","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T02:40:23Z","webTitle":"Bishop who lit up royal wedding tells Washington crowd: 'Love your neighbor'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/24/bishop-michael-curry-reclaiming-jesus-washington","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/24/bishop-michael-curry-reclaiming-jesus-washington","fields":{"headline":"Bishop who lit up royal wedding tells Washington crowd: 'Love your neighbor'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Bishop Michael Curry, the minister who electrified the royal wedding between Meghan Markle and Prince Harry with a powerful sermon on love, returned to the US with a message for his countrymen: “Love your neighbor.” Curry, the most senior figure in the American Episcopal church, joined Christian faith leaders in a candle-lit vigil and protest procession to the White House on Thursday. “Love your neighbor. That’s why we’re here,” Curry told a rapt audience at the National City Christian church in Washington before the processional. He continued, his voice building, as audience members rose to their feet cheering wildly: “Love the neighbor you like and love the neighbor you don’t like. Love the neighbor you agree with and the neighbor you don’t agree with. Love your Democrat neighbor, your Republican neighbor. Your black neighbor and your white neighbor, your Anglo neighbor, your Latino, your LGBTQ neighbor. Love your neighbor. That’s why we’re here.” Organizers said as many as 2,000 people attended the service, with the audience spilling on to the steps of the neoclassical building and an overflow room across the street. As dusk fell, a procession of clergy and people of faith silently carried votive candles from the church to Lafayette Square, a park facing the White House. The demonstration is part of a wider movement known as Reclaiming Jesus, which was formed by group of progressive Christian leaders, including Curry. They co-signed a declaration of principles that rejects Trump’s “America first” agenda. At the White House, the leaders of the movement formed a prayer circle and took turns reading the declaration. “We believe two things are at stake: the soul of the nation, and the integrity of faith,” the declaration states. It outlines six principles and what they say are the corresponding Bible verses as justification. “We reject ‘America first’ as a theological heresy for followers of Christ,” the declaration says. “While we share a patriotic love for our country, we reject xenophobic or ethnic nationalism that places one nation over others as a political goal.” It continues: “We reject the resurgence of white nationalism and racism in our nation on many fronts, including the highest levels of political leadership.” It states that Christians should reject the “growing attacks on immigrants and refugees, who are being made into cultural and political targets” and “the practice and pattern of lying that is invading our political and civil life”. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Before the vigil, the leaders of the movement repeatedly stressed that their action was non-partisan. Jim Wallis, the president and founder of Sojourners, a progressive Christian magazine and a leader of the movement, declared that the demonstration was “not about Donald Trump” but had a higher purpose of healing the deep divisions in the county. But those in attendance were decidedly progressive. There were Women’s March T-shirts, pins showing support for the Parkland students anti-gun violence movement, Black Lives Matter signs and several people wore rainbow colors in support of LGBTQ rights. “I know they said this is not a protest but this is a protest for me,” said Moya Harris, the executive minister at Metropolitan AME church in Washington. “I’m resisting what is going on down the street and resistance is part of my faith.” After the vigil, a crush of reporters trailed Curry shouting questions in vain about the royal wedding and the president. Did you speak to the royal couple about Trump, a cameraman asked. Curry laughed: “Oh Lord no.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/25/north-korea-leaves-door-open-for-desperately-necessary-trump-summit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T08:33:45Z","webTitle":"North Korea leaves door open for 'desperately necessary' Trump summit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/25/north-korea-leaves-door-open-for-desperately-necessary-trump-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/25/north-korea-leaves-door-open-for-desperately-necessary-trump-summit","fields":{"headline":"North Korea leaves door open for 'desperately necessary' Trump summit","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"North Korea has said it is still willing to hold direct talks between its leader Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, calling the planned summit “desperately necessary” to resolve potential hostilities after the US cancelled the meeting. “We express our willingness to sit down face-to-face with the US and resolve issues anytime and in any format,” North Korea’s vice foreign minister Kim Kye-gwan said in a statement. “Our commitment to doing our best for the sake of peace and stability for the world and the Korean Peninsula remains unchanged, and we are open-minded in giving time and opportunity to the US.” North Korea’s response moved to place the blame on the US. It has consistently worked to portray itself as the driver of progress in a relationship that has remained hostile for over six decades. Kim Jong-un has been crafting an image of a responsible statesman against an erratic Trump. “Internally we have been quietly giving president Trump high marks for making a decision no other American president had the courage to pursue,” Kim Kye-gwan said. Trump on Thursday abruptly called off the summit, which was scheduled for 12 June in Singapore, citing “tremendous anger and open hostility” in recent North Korean statements. But Pyongyang said Trump’s “unilateral cancellation of the summit was unexpected and very regrettable”. US officials also complained North Koreans did not show up to preparatory meetings and would not answer calls. During a television appearance, Trump left open the possibility talks could still be held. “It’s possible that the existing summit could take place, or a summit at some later date. Nobody should be anxious. We have to get it right,” he said. “If and when Kim Jong-un chooses to engage in constructive dialogue and actions, I am waiting.” US allies in Asia were blindsided by the announcement. The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, called an emergency meeting just before midnight local time, saying: “I am very perplexed and it is very regrettable that the North Korea-US summit will not be held.” “Denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and the establishment of permanent peace are historic tasks that can neither be abandoned nor delayed,” Moon said. A photo of the meeting released by the presidential office showed Moon with a deep frown. North Korea “remains sincere in ... making efforts on denuclearization and peace building”, said Cho Myoung-gyon, the South’s minister in charge of inter-Korean affairs. Japan’s foreign minister, Taro Kono, said it was “meaningless to hold a summit if it does not bring about progress”, but added he would continue to support the idea of a Trump-Kim meeting at a later date. “The important thing is not the meeting itself but that there are opportunities to move towards resolving the nuclear and missile issues,” the chief cabinet Secretary, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters. John Tierney, executive director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said: “The first rule of diplomacy is to always consult your allies, yet our key allies in the region were blindsided by the move. President Trump can blame North Korea’s hostile rhetoric for his decision, but the reality is that the Trump administration had no unified diplomatic strategy from the beginning.” The South vowed to continue dialogue with North Korea on denuclearisation, while foreign ministers from South Korea and the US said they would continue working towards a US-North Korea summit. Mike Pompeo, Washington’s top diplomat, said there was “clear will” to continue dialogue with Pyongyang during his call with his South Korean counterpart, according to Yonhap news agency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/25/ryan-sessegnon-fulham-washday-feat-john-terry","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T09:00:42Z","webTitle":"Ryan Sessegnon’s washday feat shows news cycle is spinning out of control | Jacob Steinberg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/25/ryan-sessegnon-fulham-washday-feat-john-terry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/25/ryan-sessegnon-fulham-washday-feat-john-terry","fields":{"headline":"Ryan Sessegnon’s washday feat shows news cycle is spinning out of control","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"To south-west London, where startling news emerged when Fulham’s Supporters Trust held its AGM on Tuesday. An awed hush fell over the room as Alistair Mackintosh, the club’s CEO, told an anecdote that left everyone wiping away the tears. On one occasion this season, Mackintosh revealed, Ryan Sessegnon had a doping test after a night game and by the time he was done everyone had gone, the kit man included. So Sessegnon took his kit home, washed it and ironed it before bringing it in the next day. The story ended there, leaving us to speculate whether Fulham saw fit to frame the hallowed kit in the boardroom at Craven Cottage or offered to donate it to the British Museum, but it wasn’t long before people on social media were talking about “a real nice touch from one of the nicest kids you’ll ever meet”. Some called for Sessegnon to be handed the Nobel Prize for Real Classy Touches. Greg Clarke, head of the Football Association, announced plans to sell Wembley to Sessegnon. Word filtered through to Steven Spielberg, who immediately bought the film rights. “Never has there been a greater act of selflessness,” the director of Schindler’s List said. “I’m thinking of calling it Washing Ryan’s Privates.” The hero in question could not be reached for comment after a whirlwind 24 hours. Partly because much of the previous paragraph is made up. And also because this column has come to the conclusion that asking Sessegnon about his laundry would represent a career low, especially when every other football writer is either penning a feature about Mohamed Salah’s childhood in Egypt or trying to find a room for the night in Kiev. But this is where we are at the moment, gushing at the revelation that Sessegnon is capable of using a household appliance (just wait till you hear about the time he used a microwave without any assistance), and in reality this says more about us than him. There is, of course, plenty of excitement about an 18-year-old who has been brilliant and fearless during Fulham’s carefree charge to Saturday’s Championship play-off final against Aston Villa. Yet headlines about a man washing his clothes feel like a stretch. Admittedly, speaking as a former teenage boy, I can appreciate why there will be parents dumbstruck at the fact that Sessegnon didn’t just burn his clothes after realising that the kit man had left the building. Even then, though, we seem to be reaching a point where so much information is there to be devoured that ordinary things take on a peculiar significance, such that news of Harry Kane’s appointment as England’s World Cup captain featured references to his brave struggle to develop a taste for fish, as though the 24-year-old father of one is actually a nine-year-old boy whose parents are trying to wean him off fish fingers. Fair play to Kane for learning to appreciate the nutritional benefits of grilled salmon. But with Sessegnon’s washing machine adventure also the subject of much deeper analysis than it deserved, it was becoming clear that people cannot help but patronise footballers, even unintentionally. This felt misguided, not to mention a bit hypocritical given that I boiled a kettle that contained no water a couple of nights ago. Continue down this path and we’d be asking Gareth Southgate whether his players have sent out a message to the rest of the world by remembering to pack their shinpads for the school trip to Russia. But righteous indignation at the growing trend of infantilisation does have its limits. There is another side to the argument and that became clear when the tale of Sessegnon’s hardship was followed by claims that Villa are willing to let John Terry, who is a 37-year-old adult, miss both games against Chelsea next season if Steve Bruce’s side win promotion to the Premier League, news of which brought to mind the defender’s ludicrous Stamford Bridge farewell last year. Terry, remember, helped to arrange it so that he could be substituted in the 26th minute against Sunderland, which is reminiscent of the bit in the Dynasty reboot where one of the characters throws herself a lavish fake wedding, complete with peacocks luxuriating in indoor fountains. Nothing but the best! Even though, as one underling points out, peacocks can’t swim. Even though, as none of Terry’s Chelsea team-mates dared say out loud, walking off in the minute that matched his shirt number marked him out as football’s Mariah Carey. Now our captain, leader and legendary party planner is rumoured to be thinking about a follow-up. Some players refuse to celebrate when they score against their old clubs, even holding their arms in the air to apologise for the grievous sin of scoring a goal for their current employer. Terry, however, could be about to take it up a notch. Having rejected offers from Premier League clubs last summer in order to avoid having to play against Chelsea, for whom he made 717 appearances across 22 years, he would be in quite the pickle if Villa went up. Worryingly for all concerned, the final against Fulham takes place on 26 May. It is a sign. But fret not: Villa have recognised the gravity of the situation. Forget about what would happen if they needed to beat Chelsea to stay up or what Terry would do if he ends up managing a team in the same league as his old club. Some things are too precious – like the captain’s armbands that Terry dug out of storage and shaped into the number 26. Let’s just hope he put them in the wash first."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/06/canada-weed-legalisation-cannabis-marijuana-vendors-marketing-tactics","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"How do you market weed when you can't market weed?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/06/canada-weed-legalisation-cannabis-marijuana-vendors-marketing-tactics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/06/canada-weed-legalisation-cannabis-marijuana-vendors-marketing-tactics","fields":{"headline":"How do you market weed when you can't market weed?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As Canadian companies rush to cash in on the impending cannabis legalization, they’re running into a major hurdle: they can’t advertise their products. In a sharp departure from decades of flashy, vibrant campaigns for tobacco and alcohol, federal regulators have opted to come down hard on the cannabis market, forcing utilitarian and subdued packaging with heavy restrictions on advertising. The result is companies getting as creative as possible – and trying not to break the law in the process. With conventional advertising largely prohibited, social media is quickly becoming a new frontier for companies to test messaging. Tweed, the main subsidiary of multibillion-dollar Canopy Growth, scatters its social media profiles with posts in a not-so-subtle indicator of its product. MedReleaf, a medical cannabis company, has released a “cannabis inspired” beer, with 4.20% alcohol content – but no cannabis. “You have to be creative in what promotions you do,” says Luvlina Sanghera, head of Jekyll+Hyde, a Toronto-based marketing firm advising cannabis companies. With all of its restrictions, she likens the current state of the industry to the prohibition era. Health Canada has strict proposed advertising rules: companies can’t promote people or events, celebrity endorsements have been ruled and, most critically, promotions of “glamour, recreation, risk, excitement or daring behaviours or a positive or negative emotion” are prohibited. Instead, by hosting concerts and gallery shows and showcasing early iterations of future products – and ensuring those products don’t contain cannabis – companies are able to sidestep advertising restrictions. Some products raise questions about how much companies are adhering to the spirit of the proposed regulations. Health Canada told the Guardian that after the legalization of cannabis, the current iteration of the Cannabis Crunch box would likely be in violation of the law. Companies have reason to be wary of running afoul of advertising rules: violations can carry penalties of $250,000 to $5m – and between six months to three years in jail. San Rafael skater By launching its beer, MedReleaf wants to evoke a nostalgia for California cannabis culture. But while companies bet on cannabis-flavoured products to build a future customer base, others remain deeply skeptical. “The purists out there won’t buy it. The market’s way smarter than that,” says Robin Ellins, owner of Friendly Stranger, one of Toronto’s oldest cannabis culture shops. Funded by a multibillion-dollar cannabis company, Tokyo Smoke has gone to great lengths in using a small red oval on black to identity its brand – an aesthetic similar to what mock-ups of government-approved marijuana packing might look like. But even social media pages laden with allusions have limits: on their various platforms, there are no images of cannabis plants or people smoking. Royal Canadian Cannabis is hoping to use augmented reality, where digital overlays are projected on to a smartphone screen, to help amplify the nondescript government packaging with pop-up information and animations. “On its face, it’s abiding by the regulations, but when you look at it through a smartphone, this kind of changes it. Does that still comply? It’s a very interesting space,” says lawyer Amanda Branch. With broadly interpreted rules, companies see the incentive in pushing up against the limits as a delicate balancing act. “There are benefits to getting your ads out there and getting your name known for when cannabis becomes legal,” says Branch. “But at the same time, you want to strictly comply; you don’t want to be the person who Health Canada is making an example of.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/24/richard-spencer-charlottesville-conspiracy-trial","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T21:06:25Z","webTitle":"Richard Spencer acted like gang boss, Charlottesville conspiracy trial hears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/24/richard-spencer-charlottesville-conspiracy-trial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/24/richard-spencer-charlottesville-conspiracy-trial","fields":{"headline":"Richard Spencer acted like gang boss, Charlottesville conspiracy trial hears","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The white nationalist Richard Spencer boasted “we own these streets” during a conspiracy to commit racially motivated violence last summer in Charlottesville, Virginia, a court has heard. On 11 August, neo-Nazis and other white nationalist supporters marched through the University of Virginia campus with torches, chanting racist abuse. A day later, as attendees of a rally clashed with counter-protesters in town, a car was driven into the crowd, killing 32-year-old activist Heather Heyer and injuring 19 others. A civil lawsuit accuses 25 far-right individuals and groups of conspiring to commit the violence. At a federal courthouse in Charlottesville on Thursday, Judge Norman Moon heard arguments brought by 19 of them seeking to have the case thrown out, claiming they had a first amendment right to free expression and should not be held directly responsible for the bloodshed. But Karen Dunn, an attorney representing 10 Virginia residents who brought the suit last October, told the court that, following the march with torches, Spencer declared to a crowd: “We own these streets. We occupy these grounds.” She argued this was an “overt” claim for credit and “sufficient to keep him in the case at the motion to dismiss stage”, comparing Spencer to a drugs gang boss who says “well done” to one of his foot soldiers. Dunn added: “The leaders in a conspiracy didn’t always have their specific fingerprints on the conspiracy but they did organise it and they took credit for it after the fact.” Moon questioned whether merely claiming credit for an event was sufficient evidence of Spencer’s involvement. Dunn insisted: “It is evidence of his participation in the conspiracy to do violence … Mr Spencer was not just some passive participant in this. He was an organiser, he was a leader. He was the person who, after this march took place, stood before the crowd to say the objective had been achieved.” An official court order shows that Spencer, a notorious alt-right leader who wants to create an “ethno-state” for white people, was expected to address the judge on Thursday. But he did not appear in court, where about 80 people were gathered in the public gallery. He told the Guardian by phone that this was due to a “security issue”. Instead, despite struggling to raise legal fees, he was represented by attorney John DiNucci, who sought to downplay the significance of Spencer’s remarks last August. “That doesn’t prove there was a conspiracy … There is certainly no allegation I can find that Mr Spencer or another defendant intended for a vehicle to cause death or injury,” DiNucci told the court. The court heard how white nationalists used private online chatrooms such as Discord to encourage the bringing of weapons, wearing of uniforms and a march with torches that had not been granted a permit. Attorney Roberta Kaplan, also for the plaintiffs, told the court: “We’re talking about racially motivated violence as a result of a carefully coordinated conspiracy … What we allege is that armed groups of men wearing Nazi insignia, carrying weapons, marched around the synagogue not only chanting Nazi slogans but saying they would burn it down.” She added that online communications had included discussing the legality of running someone over with a car as well as overtly racist statements such as: “If you beat up a nigger, it’s not really beating someone.” But attorney James Kolenich, representing most of the defendants, denied that the elements of a conspiracy had been established. “What’s not clear from the complaint is that there was a pre-existing plan to commit violence … We are arguing that torches, chants, raising your voices are part of a political rally and protected under the first amendment. The fact the defendants are scary-looking individuals and doing scary-looking things isn’t assaultive.” Michael Peinovich, a white nationalist, spoke on his own behalf in court, acknowledging that his podcasts are “bombastic”, “shocking” and “offensive” to some people. “I’m the kind of person for which the first amendment was designed,” he claimed. He insisted that there was nothing he had broadcast or tweeted that could be construed as inciting violence. As the hearing ended, Moon indicated that he would reach a decision “reasonably soon”. This article was amended on 25 May 2018 to clarify the number of people accused in the lawsuit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/24/north-korea-coin-trump-summit-white-house-discount","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T20:18:05Z","webTitle":"'Deal of the day': White House online shop crashes as North Korea coin discounted","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/24/north-korea-coin-trump-summit-white-house-discount","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/24/north-korea-coin-trump-summit-white-house-discount","fields":{"headline":"'Deal of the day': White House online shop crashes as North Korea coin discounted","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Donald Trump summit with Kim Jong-un may be over. But the opportunity to buy a coin commemorating the doomed meeting is not. In fact, it just got cheaper. The White House Gift Shop slashed the price of the “President Trump United States and Korea Summit Coin” on Thursday, after Trump cancelled the planned meeting with the North Korean leader. The online store selling the coin crashed, reporting an error message that the server was “too busy”. A note on the White House gift shop website described the coin, which comes in a black velvet case, as the “deal of the day”. The deal of the day price is $19.95, down from the regular price of $24.95. The product description said the coin, designed to celebrate the summit, “will be made whether or not the summit occurs”. According to the White House gift shop, this is because “the theme is coming close to peace and celebrates the act of communication among countries”. The description adds that people buying the commemorative coin can request a refund if the summit does not occur. But according to the gift shop, “most supporters have said they want this heirloom of political history regardless of outcome”. An associate at the White House visitor center told the Guardian “a lot of people have called” asking how they can get their money back on the coin. Staff at the gift shop did not answer the phone. The White House communications agency struck a commemorative coin to celebrate the summit earlier this week. It shows Trump and Kim in profile, with the American and North Korean flags in the background. The White House Gift Shop said the $19.95 coin is “not identical” to that coin. The discounted coin also features the South Korean president Moon Jae-in.

In the space of 25 minutes wild hopefulness gave way to grim haplessness as their second innings subsided from 235 for six to 242 all out. No one was predicting an England victory overnight but it was reasonable to expect that the rearguard action might still be in operation at noon and that they could head to Leeds this week with something to savour. Instead they will travel north humbled and humiliated, with their confidence in shreds having been thrashed on their own patch at headquarters by a side ranked seventh in the world, two places below them – though that will change if England perform as ineptly at Headingley. Pakistan won by nine wickets; they performed superbly but unspectacularly like solid old pros who understood the prevailing conditions precisely. And they are supposed to be the callow side. Pakistan bowled full and straight and let the ball swing and seam a little; they batted with grit and patience and they caught their catches. That was more than enough to overwhelm an England team in some disarray. The England collapse on Sunday morning was numbing. Jos Buttler had batted with great authority on Saturday but in the second over he pushed forward to Mohammad Abbas and was struck on the pad. He reviewed but with no great optimism. Then the new ball polished off the rest at a rush. Mark Wood and Stuart Broad were both caught behind and last man out Dom Bess lost his off stump. Mohammad Amir and Abbas were in clover, taking four wickets each in the innings. In pursuit of the 64 runs needed to win Pakistan lost Azhar Ali to a fine delivery from Jimmy Anderson. Thereafter there were few alarms. Unlike the first innings, Bess made several deliveries turn but in a hopeless situation he was nowhere near accurate enough to exploit the rough developing outside the left‑handers’ off stump. Rather than inform us about the long-term prospects of Bess excelling at this level, this simply demonstrated what an excellent cricket pitch had been provided at Lord’s, even though England had been woefully unable to exploit its properties. It seamed at the start; it flattened out and if we had reached the fifth day it would have spun. The scale of this defeat has been so emphatic and unexpected that there will be a hue and cry, which will incorporate calls for the sacking of Trevor Bayliss and/or Joe Root – it seems a little bit early to demand the head of the new national selector, Ed Smith. Of course, Bayliss and Root will continue unless Andy Flower, who is standing in for Andrew Strauss this summer, makes the most spectacular of interventions so early in his role as a locum. Yet it would be a surprise – and a mistake – if England arrived in Leeds with exactly the same squad. This does not feel like one of those occasions where a defiant selector or coach bellows “same team, different performance, please”. So these are interesting times for Bayliss and Smith and there will be an early indication of how they view the selection process. At Lord’s we have witnessed a listless, tepid performance from the batsmen, many of whom look haunted by the prospect of another failure that might terminate their careers. The inclusions of Buttler and Bess were modest successes and, if nothing else, they surely highlighted the benefit of fresh faces and minds, which see challenges rather than almighty burdens. At crisis moments like this selectors must clarify their priorities. They can become tortured and confused if they decide that “fairness” is priority number one; that should not be the case. Priority number one is to pick the best team for the next match. It might be unfair to drop Mark Stoneman for Headingley after just one Test this summer but it is incredibly hard to conclude that he is currently England’s best bet at the top of the order. All the signs are that Stoneman can be only a modest Test batsman; to achieve that he has to be in good form and full of confidence. Patently that is not the case at the moment. Indeed, we may be reaching a stage when dropping him is almost doing him a favour. By the same token Dawid Malan, even though he has a little more credit in the bank, does not really convince. He battled hard in the Ashes series; indeed, he looked more comfortable than most on harder, bouncier pitches. Since then Test cricket has been a struggle. It might be even more unfair to omit Malan for Headingley but it must also be a consideration. Despite witnessing the capriciousness of the selectors in the 80s and 90s my view is that the trend now is to slavishly stick to the same men until the evidence that they should be dropped is incontrovertible. Maybe it is time to anticipate a decline. The problem for Smith and Bayliss is that the names of likely replacements are not obvious. Just about the only potential England opener yet to march out with Alastair Cook is Middlesex’s Nick Gubbins, who has enjoyed a prolific start to the season. If he has a weakness against spin, which has been suggested, it is unlikely to be critical against Pakistan at Headingley. Other alternatives are, by definition, not entirely convincing – otherwise they would already be in the team. They range from the 33-year-old James Hildreth to the 22-year-old Joe Clarke, neither of whom has played Test cricket, to recent has-beens such as James Vince and Keaton Jennings. My impression, albeit after a solitary Test this summer, is that it is time to twist rather than stick."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/2018/may/27/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T20:00:33Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/27/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/may/27/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• An article about a new range of Royal Mail stamps featuring classic artworks was headlined: Buy a modern masterpiece – for 65 pence (24 May, page 10, G2).

In that sense, the party’s current leadership is no different from earlier incarnations. Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, offered a bold manifesto at last year’s election, one which made it clear that they are agreed, in ambition if nothing else, with their nemesis Margaret Thatcher that “economics are the method; the object is to change the soul”. Since then Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell have sketched out, admittedly in dry policy documents, a number of instruments of their revolution. But they have shied away from making a coherent public case for notions of progressive values, radical democracy and collective action. That is a mistake, not least because a programme that seeks to transform Britain must conquer minds as well as spirits. It has been left to others to make the argument. Last week in Renewal, an academic journal, two leftwing thinkers – Martin O’Neill and Joe Guinan – outlined the size and scope of Corbynomics. They credit Karl Polanyi, an Austrian economic sociologist, for inspiring Mr Corbyn’s policies. Polanyi warned that capitalist systems quickly become dominated by markets, where values are framed by cash. The result is the “annihilation (of) the natural substance of society”. He argued, perceptively, instead that cooperation was more important to humans than competition. If reciprocity was considered, then the notion of what was valuable could be broadened to better represent society’s health. Corbynomics has been framed in such moral terms – and that is a very good thing. At its heart of Labour’s shake-up is a plan to give workers more bargaining power and influence over economic decisions by supporting co-ops and employee-owned firms. It also seeks to constrain Big Finance by creating a national investment bank and a network of regional public banks. And by putting major utilities, railways and the postal service back into public hands it will remove large sections of society from their current market disciplines. This decentralising of economic power is long overdue. As our Alternatives column reveals, Corbynomics is happening in small-scale ways across Britain, but it needs political patrons. When capitalism fails, it can jeopardise the very functioning of democracy. Today wage stagnation, shredded public services and job insecurity form the backdrop to the brash populism of Brexit. What is missing from Labour’s plans are creative fiscal and monetary ideas. Labour’s manifesto pledged only to undo the austerity imposed since 2010 and has fiscal rules defined in terms of restrictive financial ratios. A progressive agenda requires government spending to take up the slack when private spending falls without constraint. All companies – co-operatives or not – need spending to maintain income and to generate wealth, irrespective of how that wealth is redistributed. Mr Corbyn’s reticence may be because he does not want to give his political opponents a target. Yet he risks being outflanked. Today’s Tories seem to be ditching their austerity rhetoric, conscious that it is a vote-loser. Being floated is a five-year inflation-busting spending boost for the NHS to make good on Brexit promises without squeezing other departments or raising taxes. If this were to happen, Tory MPs would embrace what was once economic anathema: deficit spending and rising government debt. Mr Corbyn ought to be like a general on a war footing during peacetime. If he loses his edge, then an electorally ambitious, unprincipled government may make him pay for his timidity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/may/27/roger-piantoni-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T15:30:06Z","webTitle":"Roger Piantoni obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/27/roger-piantoni-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/27/roger-piantoni-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Roger Piantoni obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The footballer Roger Piantoni, who has died aged 86, was the fulcrum of the exciting France team that took third place in the Swedish World Cup of 1958. A highly accomplished ball player, an inside-left who often scored with his powerful left foot as well as fashioning chances for others, he scored 18 goals for France in 37 appearances. In the 1958 World Cup finals he was a key component of a dynamic French outfit that was also inspired by Raymond Kopa and Just Fontaine. Piantoni scored the third goal when, in the team’s opening match, France annihilated Paraguay 7-3 in Norrköpping. On the same ground he got the fourth French goal when Northern Ireland were beaten 4-0 in the quarter finals, and he scored a late second in the quarter final, which France lost 5-2 to Brazil after being reduced to 10 fit men by an injury to the centre-half Robert Jonquet. The only match in which Piantoni did not play was the third-place play off fixture, in which France trounced West Germany 6-3. To go with his third place World Cup medal, Piantoni won an impressive number of honours in domestic French football with Reims, with whom he won the Ligue 1 title in 1958, 1960 and 1962 and the French Cup in 1958. With Reims he also got to a European Cup final in 1959, which was lost 2-0 to an all-conquering Real Madrid side. Piantoni, though partly of Italian extraction, regarded himself as very much a man of Lorraine, where he was born in Etain, the son of an amateur footballer who played for the local team, La Mouriere, after being released from a German prisoner of war camp. His mother died when he was only two years old, and he was brought up in nearby Piennes by his grandparents, who had left Italy as children. He played his first football as a boy in the Piennes town square with, among others, a fellow future France international, Thadée Cisowski. Piantoni was a prolific goal scorer in youth football, once bagging 18 goals in a single match. Asked to explain the power of his left foot, he responded that he had as little idea as a boxer asked about his knockout punch, but remembered with amusement the time when, as a small boy about to take a corner, he heard a spectator say: “Ah, look at the little chap; he’ll never make it.” He tried to work on improving his right foot, but concentrated still more on his formidable left. Joining the Piennes club in a local league, in the 1949-50 season he scored 35 times and was leading scorer in the competition. That brought him to the attention of the top flight club Nancy, for whom he signed in 1950. Essentially an inside-left, his favourite role, he adapted himself to the inside right position at the request of one of his Nancy managers, Jacques Favre, and he felt that it helped him: “It enabled me to assess the play better, and above all to bring off better breakaways. Also to move much more quickly into position to shoot with my left foot.” Piantoni played at Nancy for seven years before transferring to Reims. They were already one of the best teams in Europe, with players such as Jonquet and Fontaine, and were further strengthened by his addition. Piantoni played well in the 1959 European Cup final in Stuttgart at No 10, but Reims were unable to cope with Real Madrid’s Alfredo Di Stéfano, who scored the crucial second goal. Piantoni left in 1964 to join Nice for two seasons before retiring from the game in 1966. His last international cap had come in 1961, in a 5-1 defeat of Finland in a World Cup qualifier at Parc des Princes, in which he scored. Piantoni had no great ambitions to become a manager, but was happy enough to take on a job as player-coach at the minor French club Carpentras, from 1967 to 1971. In 1970 he became a member of the federal council of the French Football Federation, a post he held until 1988. A family man and a devotee of French history and detective stories, Piantoni especially enjoyed holidays on the banks of the Loire. There, he said, he could feel in touch with his country’s past. • Roger Piantoni, footballer, born 26 December 1931; died 26 May 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/may/27/chennai-super-kings-v-sunrisers-hyderabad-ipl-final-2018-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T17:12:07Z","webTitle":"Chennai Super Kings  beat Sunrisers Hyderabad to win the IPL 2018 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/may/27/chennai-super-kings-v-sunrisers-hyderabad-ipl-final-2018-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/may/27/chennai-super-kings-v-sunrisers-hyderabad-ipl-final-2018-live","fields":{"headline":"Chennai Super Kings  beat Sunrisers Hyderabad to win the IPL 2018 – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Congratulations to CSK and commiserations to Sunrisers, particularly the wonderful pair of Kane Williamson and Rashid Khan. Thanks for your company, bye! After two years on the naughty step, CSK have won the IPL on their return. Shane Watson played the innings of his T20 life, maybe all his life, blitzing 117 from 57 balls. His last 109 runs came from 41 deliveries. CSK WIN BY EIGHT WICKETS WITH NINE BALLS TO SPARE 18.3 overs: Chennai Super Kings 181-2 (Watson 117, Rayudu 15) Rayudu slams four through the covers to complete an immense victory! 18th over: Chennai Super Kings 177-2 (Watson 117, Rayudu 11) Watson takes CSK to within two of victory with two brutal straight drives for four off Kaul. 17th over: Chennai Super Kings 166-2 (Watson 108, Rayudu 10) That’s it! Watson limps a single off Rashid to reach an astonishing century: 51 balls, seven fours, eight sixes. And he took 11 balls to get off the mark! The milestone liberates him sufficiently to hit Rashid Khan’s last two balls for four. CSK are going to win at a canter. 16th over: Chennai Super Kings 154-2 (Watson 98, Rayudu 8) So much for playing Kumar with respect. Rayudu has just Leatherfaced a short ball over long off for six. A single brings Watson on strike, and he steers a single to move to 98 and keep the strike. CSK need 25 from 24 balls. As Rob Key and Mark Butcher have just said on Sky Sports, CSK’s tactics have been excellent. Kumar and Rashid Khan, who have been played with respect, have bowled six overs for 22. The rest have bowled nine overs for 122. 15th over: Chennai Super Kings 146-2 (Watson 97, Rayudu 2) Rashid Khan returns to the attack, and if he takes five wickets in an over this might just get interesting. Rayudu is happy to play out a testing over that includes a big appeal for LBW from a googly. It was given not out but Sunrisers had little choice but to gamble on a review. I thought it hit him outside the line, and replays confirm my eyesight is not quite as bad as I feared. Not out. CSK need 33 from 30 balls. 14th over: Chennai Super Kings 145-2 (Watson 97, Rayudu 1) Watson deflects Brathwaite to third man for four to move into the nineties, and then he pings a slower ball over midwicket for his eighth six! This is an utterly ridiculous innings. He had eight from 16 balls; now he has 97 from 48. A scintilla of hope for Sunrisers. Brathwaite produces a nasty bouncer that Raina gloves through to Goswami, who takes an outstanding leaping catch. It’s given not out but Sunrisers review and Raina, who knows he’s gloved it, walks off long before the third umpire officially overturns the decision. 13th over: Chennai Super Kings 131-1 (Watson 86, Raina 31) Sandeep Sharma returns in place of Shakib, whose first over went for 15. It’s much of a muchness to Watson, who smashes three consecutive sixes and 27 from the over! He can’t run so he’s blasting the ball to all parts. It’s a stunning display of hitting. He has smashed 78 from the last 29 balls, including seven sixes! CSK were cruising a minute ago; now they are doing whatever comes after cruising. They only need 48 from 42 balls. 12th over: Chennai Super Kings 104-1 (Watson 60, Raina 31) Brathwaite comes into the attack. Watson tries to steal an overthrow and winces with pain; it looks like he’s pulled something. He can barely run - so he just drags Brathwaite into the leg side for four to bring up the hundred. CSK are cruising at the moment. They need 75 from 48 balls. “Evening Rob,” says James Lane. “Did you catch Michael Slater’s kurta-cleavage during the break? I’m still getting flashes.” I missed it as I went to get a coffee. It’s times like these when Catch Up TV really doesn’t come into its own. 11th over: Chennai Super Kings 95-1 (Watson 53, Raina 29) Watson brings up a brilliant, ballsy fifty by sweeping Shakib’s first ball of the innings for six. Watson made nought from 10 balls, eight from 16, but he kept his nerve and has bashed 43 off the last 17. Raina ends another great over for CSK with a sweet straight six. Sunrisers are in urgent need of a wicket or, failing that, a dot ball. “What are your thoughts about ECB’s new 100-ball format,” says Sahil Pandita. “Is it really required? What difference does 20 balls make?” It means the BBC can fit the games into a certain timeslot. It’s hard to see any other reason for it. That said, I’m not as against it as most people. T20 is a free-for-all in terms of innovation so yeah, do your worst. My main concern is what it means for poor old Statsguru. 10th over: Chennai Super Kings 80-1 (Watson 45, Raina 22) CSK are playing Rashid Khan with total respect, aiming for nothing grander than a single off every ball. They manage four off the first five deliveries – and then get some bonus runs when the last ball scuttles away for four leg byes. CSK need 99 from the last 10 overs. This is going to the last over, maybe to the last ball. 9th over: Chennai Super Kings 72-1 (Watson 43, Raina 16) CSK are targeting Kaul. Watson monsters a straight six and slices a low full toss this far short of Rashid, charging in from deep point. The next ball is slower, picked and belted to long off for four. Watson, who made eight from his first 16 balls, has since made 35 from 14. And poor Kaul’s first two overs have gone for 16 apiece. 8th over: Chennai Super Kings 56-1 (Watson 28, Raina 15) It’s time for Rashid Khan, the best T20 cricketer in the world. One way or another, his four overs will probably decide this match. Raina is a key man, having played Rashid well in the past. CSK play low-risk cricket throughout his first over, content to milk five singles. Well played. 7th over: Chennai Super Kings 51-1 (Watson 26, Raina 13) Kumar is replaced by Siddarth Kaul, whose second ball is flicked majestically for six by Watson. He slices the next delivery high over the off side, just short of Rashid Khan running in from the boundary. A brilliant over for CSK – 16 from it - continues when Raina helps two poor deliveries around the corner for four. CSK need 128 from 78 balls. 6th over: Chennai Super Kings 35-1 (Watson 19, Raina 4) Sandeep Sharma also continues into a third over. Watson hammers him towards cow corner, where Rashid Khan saves three runs with the most nonchalant grab on the run as the ball bounces up. Watson eventually gets hold of one later in the over, clouting Sharma miles over midwicket for six. He follows that with four more and then Raina survives a run-out referral after a neat bit of footwork from Sharma. A desperate slide saved Raina. This is great stuff now. “Two weeks ago, my expectations of “Hamilton” were recklessly high - and, when I saw the show, surpassed,” says Gary Naylor. “On Tuesday, my expectations of Rashid Khan were recklessly high - and, when I saw the lad, surpassed. How lucky we are to be alive right now.” 5th over: Chennai Super Kings 20-1 (Watson 7, Raina 2) Kumar continues into his third over, with Williamson keen to ram home Sunrisers’ advantage. Four from the over. This is exquisitely tight, the atmospheric equivalent of Spandex trousers that are a size too small. Sunrisers would love to get rid of Raina before Rashid Khan comes into the attack. At the moment they won’t want to get rid of Shane Watson, who has struggled to seven from 15 balls. “Watson’s been a disgrace so far,” says Hari. “Think he’s tiring from a long tournament but he essentially got Faf out there through all those dots.” 4th over: Chennai Super Kings 16-1 (Watson 5, Raina 0) CSK need 163 from 16 overs. A huge wicket for Sunrisers! Sandeep Sharma duped du Plessis with a fine slower ball that was toe-ended miles in the air. Sharma called for the catch himself and took it confidently. 3rd over: Chennai Super Kings 10-0 (Watson 0, du Plessis 10) This is an extraordinary start from Kumar. He extends his sequence of dot balls to 10 (T-E-N) before du Plessis works the 11th to backward point for a single. Make that five singles: a narcissistic throw from Hoola flies to the boundary and gives CSK four bonus runs. Watson was easily home so that was not the brightest bit of cricket from Hoola. 2nd over: Chennai Super Kings 5-0 (Watson 0, du Plessis 5) Sandeep Sharma shares the new ball. His second ball is blasted through the covers for four by Faf du Plessis, Sunrisers’ nemesis five days ago. That aside it’s a harmless over for SRH. Shane Watson has nought from eight balls. 1st over: Chennai Super Kings 0-0 (Watson 0, du Plessis 0) Bhuvneshwar Kumar starts the innings with a brilliant maiden to Shane Watson. The first and last deliveries of the over were storming legcutter that beat the outside edge. That is a helluva tone to set for the innings. Innings break Sunrisers would surely have taken that total at the start, though they might regret scoring only 18 from the last two overs. I’d say they are slight favourites, particularly if Rashid Khan works his not inconsiderable magic. See you soon for the CSK innings. 20th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 178-6 (Pathan 45) The last over, bowled by Thakur, goes for 10. He started very well, conceding four from the first four balls. Then Brathwaite clunked a pull down the ground for six, a ridiculous shot, before holing out off the final delivery of the innings. Chennai Super Kings needs 179 to win the 2018 IPL. 19th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 168-5 (Pathan 42, Brathwaite 15) Ngidi bowls an outstanding penultimate over of the innings – only eight from it. And it would have been a lot better had Brathwaite not dumped the last delivery over wide long on for six. 18th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 160-5 (Pathan 41, Brathwaite 8) What a shot from Carlos Brathwaite! His first ball a wide from Bravo; the second, the first legitimate delivery of his innings, was a slower one that he picked and redirected over long off for a huge six. Pick that out! Bravo’s last over goes for 16, including another vicious hit for four from Pathan, and he ends with nasty figures of 4-0-46-1. 17th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 144-5 (Pathan 35, Brathwaite 0) That was the last ball of an over in which Pathan cuffed Ngidi down the ground for six more! This is an immense performance from the big man, who has scorched to 35 from 18 balls. “If Chennai lose this final it will be their fifth loss in an IPL final,” says Sahil Pandita. “I always wonder whether it is better to reach lots of finals and lose most of them or reach some and win all of them. The agony must be too much to handle.” I think I’d rather win three and lose five than win two and lose none – not only do you win one more, but the wins mean more because of the defeats. Hooda falls, flipping Ngidi straight to the substitute Shorey at deep backward square leg. 16th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 134-4 (Pathan 27, Hooda 1) Pathan survives a potential run out when Bravo fails to take the ball cleanly in his follow through – but Shakib goes next ball, clouting a low full toss to extra cover. He made a handy 23 from 15 balls, and we’re going to have a timeout. 15th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 126-3 (Shakib 22, Pathan 21) The dangerous Pathan makes room to smack Sharma over extra cover for six, the highlight of another decent over for Sunrisers. They are inching towards a score that will be very competitive with their bowling attack. 14th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 117-3 (Shakib 20, Pathan 14) A short ball from Thakur is flashed square on the off side for four by Pathan, who looks in the mood today. 13th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 108-3 (Shakib 18, Pathan 7) The new batsman Yusuf Pathan glides Sharma for four to get off the mark. Though the dismissal of Williamson is a big blow, Sunrisers are still right in this game. “Dear Rob,” says Aditi Prabhudesai. “This is off topic but do you get much grief for not having a Twitter account? I sometimes wonder if I am a sane person since I am not given to much Tweeting.” I don’t really get any grief, only a smug sense of moral superiority and regular pangs of regret that I once had a Twitter account. Williamson has gone! He is so angry with himself. He charged the first ball from Karn Sharma, who saw him coming and slipped it well wide of off stump. Williamson ran past the ball and MS Dhoni completed the stumping. 12th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 101-2 (Williamson 47, Shakib 18) Sunrisers have defended some low totals in this year’s IPL, so they are pretty well placed at the moment – especially with Williamson anchoring the innings so immaculately. He smacks Bravo’s first two deliveries for four, a princely extra-cover drive followed by a fierce pull. Kevin Pietersen once said that talking to Andrew Strauss about the IPL was like trying to explain gangsta rap to the vicar. Watching Williamson play T20 is like seeing a classical musician try their hand at gangsta rap, and be absolutely brilliant at it. 11th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 90-2 (Williamson 37, Shakib 17) Oof, that was desperately close. Williamson, making room outside leg stump, sliced Jadeja just wide of the diving Ngidi at short third man. The ball raced away for four, and then Shakib muscled consecutive deliveries to leg for six and four. Seventeen from the over, and Shakib has 17 from seven balls. 10th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 73-2 (Williamson 32, Shakib 6) Chahar returns to bowl his final over, a good one that goes for only three. He ends with figures of 4-0-25-0. 9th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 70-2 (Williamson 30, Shakib 5) A misfield from Watson helps the new batsman Shakib get off the mark with a boundary. Both sides will be fairly happy with this position. But so much depends on Williamson. Gone! Ravindra Jadeja strikes with his third ball, angling a delivery through Dhawan’s attempted slog sweep. That’s a really big wicket. 8th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 62-1 (Dhawan 25, Williamson 28) Dwayne Bravo, a T20 superstar for over a decade, concedes only one run from his first four balls – but then Williamson smacks 10 off the last two balls of the over! He picked a slower ball and slapped it over extra cover for four; then, when Bravo slipped a low full toss towards leg stumps, Williamson lifted it high over long leg for six! He is playing beautifully. Of course he is; he always does. “It’s not just England’s frailties against spin that are a problem, but also their attitude,” says Aditi Prabhudesai. “For example, their insistence on playing biff bang bosh when the conditions are screaming for a measured approach. Their rigidity will cost them a knockout match in the World Cup for sure.” They were better in the winter, when they played sensibly to win lower-scoring games against Australia and New Zealand. It felt like a bit of a breakthrough, though we won’t really know until July 2019. 7th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 51-1 (Dhawan 24, Williamson 18) The legspinner Karn Sharma comes into the attack. Dhawan hoicks a flat, hard sweep for four to bring up the fifty for Sunrisers. He and Williamson are delivering yet again; after a slow start they’ve scored 34 from the last three overs. 6th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 42-1 (Dhawan 18, Williamson 16) Thakur replaces Ngidi and starts with a wide. His third legitimate delivery is smoked over long-on for six by Dhawan, which allows Sunrisers to milk singles for the rest of the over. “Looking at the performance of the English players in the IPL, it is quite clear that they struggle still against spin, especially the likes of Alex Hales and Jason Roy,” says Hari. “I think England are an unbelievable limited overs side in flat conditions but are definitely going to struggle when there is a bit in for the bowlers especially the tweakers.” The middle order are generally good players of spin. But yes, the flatter the better. I’ve a suspicion there will be a pitchgate (sic) during next year’s World Cup. Anyone out there? The players are having a quick unscheduled drinks break, since you asked. 5th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 30-1 (Dhawan 9, Williamson 14) You can understand Sunrisers’ approach, given their strengths and weaknesses, but the scoreboard pressure is starting to manifest itself in one or two desperate shots. Williamson top-edges a pick-up shot off Chahal for six, the first of the innings. Two balls later he pulls smoothly and authoritatively for four. Thirteen from the over, a good one for Sunrisers.u can understand Sunrisers’ approach, given their strengths and weaknesses, but the scoreboard pressure is starting to manifest itself in one or two desperate shots. Williamson top-edges a pick-up shot off Chahal for six, the first of the innings. Two balls later he pulls smoothly and authoritatively for four. Thirteen from the over, a good one for Sunrisers. 4th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 17-1 (Dhawan 8, Williamson 3) Sunrisers are batting cautiously, scared of losing another wicket – so much so that Ngidi’s second over is a maiden to Williamson. 3rd over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 17-1 (Dhawan 8, Williamson 3) CSK have made a dominant start and look less nervous than Sunrisers, who can take only three singles from Chahar’s second over. “This live blog is a pleasant surprise!” says Don Mihsill. “One of the undertouted benefits of leagues like IPL, Big Bash etc is the opportunity it provides players from less prominent nations to develop their game by playing in pressure situations, with and against some of the best professionals going around. These chances were simply not available to an earlier era (the young Nepali leggie Lamichanne is another one;). For growing the game, these leagues are a powerful tool. They’re well marketed, pay well, scout for the best talent (irrespective of nationality). It also makes a talented youngster in a country where cricket may be the third, fourth or fifth sport, actively contemplate honing their skills. Afghanistan are due to play India in their debut test. Their bowling attack will include Mujib, Rashid and Nabi - all participants in the IPL. I’m guessing they won’t be overawed and will be quite used to Indian conditions.” Yes, agreed. I cannot wait to see how Rashid Khan gets on in Test cricket. 2nd over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 14-1 (Dhawan 7, Williamson 1) It’s a strange thing to say at one down in the second over, but Sunrisers really need a partnership. So much depends on Dhawan and the captain Williamson. He pushes Ngidi for a quick single to get off the mark. A hideous start for Sunrisers. Goswami comes back for an ill-judged second run and is miles short when MS Dhoni breaks the stumps. 1st over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 6-0 (Goswami 3, Dhawan 2) A false start for CSK: Chahar’s first ball is a high full toss that is no-balled, which means a free hit for Dhawan. He can only chip it for a single. Chahar pulls it back thereafter, with no boundaries in the over. Any predictions? The noggin says CSK - they are more experienced, less dependent on key players and have had more rest this week. But Sunrisers have Rashid Khan and Kane Williamson, so I’m going for them. Chennai Super Kings Watson, du Plessis, Raina, Rayudu, Dhoni (c/wk), Bravo, Jadeja, Chahra, K Sharma, Thakur, Ngidi. Sunrisers Hyderabad Dhawan, Goswami (wk), Williamson (c), Shakib, Hooda, Pasthan, Brathwaite, Rashid, Kumar, Kaul, S Sharma. That’s a bit of a surprise, as it means Sunrisers’ superb bowling attack will know what total they have to defend. The toss was a minor shambles, with TV’s Sanjay Manjrekar not having a clue who won it. MS Dhoni and Kane Williamson managed to sort it out between them. Hello. Let us give thanks to England: their generous acquiescence this morning means there is no Test match to cover, so we’re going to liveblog the IPL final instead. A match like this needs no introduction, and not only because I’ve been caught cold by the change of plan. What’s an IPL anyway? Today’s matinee show has a simple pitch: it’s CSK’s veterans against Sunrisers’ innocents, most notably the wonderful Afghanistan legspinner Rashid Khan. He produced one of the great performances to beat KKR in the semi-final: he hit 34 from 10 balls (!) and then took three for 19 from his four overs. Rashid is part of the best bowling attack in the competition; CSK have the best batting line-up. They also have more experience and have already beaten Sunrisers three times in this year’s competition, although two of those were extremely tight. It’s too close to call - but call it we will, for the love of the game and being paid, so that we can buy bread ‘n’ spread. Our commentary starts with the toss at around 2pm BST."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"theguardian/2018/may/27/death-of-rp-not-a-cause-for-celebration","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T15:41:19Z","webTitle":"Death of RP not a cause for celebration | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2018/may/27/death-of-rp-not-a-cause-for-celebration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2018/may/27/death-of-rp-not-a-cause-for-celebration","fields":{"headline":"Death of RP not a cause for celebration","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I would like to challenge Laura Barton’s assertion that the death of RP is a good thing (G2, 23 May).

First, too many young people move about the care system – a third of those leaving care aged 16-plus have had between five and 10 placements – often resulting in mental health problems. Second, very few young people do well at school and in their GCSEs – only about 7% go on to university – contributing to high levels of unemployment; and third, young people leave care at a younger age than other young people leave home – half of 20- to 24-year-olds in the UK are living with a parent, whereas most young people leave care between 16 and 18. Paradoxically, although since 1997 successive governments have strengthened the law and policies to support care leavers, these measures have resulted in little change in outcomes. This will only change if leaving care services can build on a foundation of stability, help with education and mental health problems, and gradual transitions to adulthood – as most other young people living with their families can expect. Prof Mike Stein University of York • Daniel Lavelle’s article draws attention to the need for continued support post-18 to give care leavers the best start in life. Having worked as a residential social care worker and a registered residential manager for the Together Trust, I know all too well how important it is to offer support, guidance and, as Ian Dickinson says, to have belief in our looked-after children. This will equip them with the skills and confidence to fulfil their own potential. For the people in the article, this support had not always been there. At Together Trust we are committed and passionate about keeping the children in our care safe and supported. This passion and empathy are core values that we look for in our recruitment of staff. In fact, we have recently recruited one of our care leavers; a true testament of our commitment to person-centred care. We have worked in partnership with other charities to highlight that 18 is just too young to leave care – we want to see support extended to 25. I welcomed the new Children and Social work Act 2017 that came into effect this April. We want all care leavers to be able to live their lives to the full and work closely with partners such as local authorities, to ensure that support for looked after children and care leavers continues to improve. Jill Sheldrake Service director of Together Trust • For this young man to share his experiences is extremely courageous, and is required reading for all in residential child care as a spur to positive practice.

Struggling businesses including the department store chain House of Fraser, the children’s retailer Mothercare and the Carluccio’s Italian restaurant chain are all seeking CVAs, where property owners accept lower rents to help a tenant avoid financial collapse. But they are meeting with growing resistance from major property companies, alarmed by the growing list of CVAs sought this year by chains including Prezzo, Jamie’s Italian, Byron, New Look and Carpetright. Property companies Legal &amp; General and Westfield are among about a dozen landlords plotting opposition to the imminent CVA by House of Fraser, owned by China’s Sanpower. They are weighing up plans to make demands in return for their approval, such as detailed financial forecasts, an equity stake in the 169-year old department store chain or a cut of its future profits. Restructuring experts from consultancies Begbies Traynor and JLL are advising the property companies, who can block the CVA and demand improved terms if more than a quarter of landlords rebel against the company’s proposed terms. Begbies Traynor partner Mark Fry said: “Landlords represent pension funds, investment funds – they’re spending the ordinary man in the street’s money. So when rents aren’t paid, that affects the performance of these funds. It’s not just about rich property owners.” The move by House of Fraser’s landlords is part of a broader seam of discontent in the property industry about the burden placed on landlords by CVAs. Martin Greenslade, the chief financial officer of Land Securities, the UK’s largest commercial property owner, said CVAs should only be used an emergency option to prevent collapse. “Where a business has genuine trading difficulties, a CVA can help provide the necessary breathing space to restructure and raise new funds to avoid administration,” he said. “In general, we are happy to support these agreements. Where the operating performance of a business is fine but its ownership structure has excessive debt or management simply wants to improve its operating profits by reducing rents, we do not believe that the CVA process is fair or appropriate. “For some smaller landlords, the financial impact of a CVA-imposed rent reduction can be very significant. The CVA should not become a management tool to improve profitability at their expense.” Some retailers have also become frustrated with the CVA system after watching rivals with weaker finances secure lower rents than them. Fashion chain Next is to insert a “CVA clause” into its lease agreements under which its own rents must also be reduced if any of its landlords’ other tenants agree a CVA. Dan Simms, the head of retail agency at real estate business Colliers, said landlords were often railroaded into agreeing rent cuts because, in many cases, CVAs are voted on not just by landlords but by other creditors who won’t share the pain of rent cuts. “If you’re all lined up and they say they’re only going to shoot the two on the end, the rest will say ‘fine thank you’,” said Simms. “The more it happens, the more other retailers think they should do it and dump 20% of property liabilities for little cost. It’s an opportunistic bandwagon.” Simms said rent reductions should be accompanied by other measures to repair a company’s finances, such as debt restructuring and cost cuts, adding that the government would come under pressure to reform the system via legislation. “Some landlords are grouping together to start to say this is not right and not equitable,” he said. “Resistance and pressure will really be ramping up over the next few weeks.” Revo, which represents retail property companies, has written to the Commons housing, communities and local government select committee warning of a trend for CVAs. In a letter to committee chair Clive Betts, Revo blamed financial advisers for recommending that retailers seek CVAs, warning of “grave concerns about the advice being given to parties seeking to enter into such arrangements”. Betts responded with a promise to look into anything that “could lead to a proliferation of empty shops and a general look of dereliction on high streets up and down the country”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/may/27/rotherham-v-shrewsbury-league-one-play-off-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T16:57:31Z","webTitle":"Rotherham 2-1 Shrewsbury: League One play-off final – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/may/27/rotherham-v-shrewsbury-league-one-play-off-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/may/27/rotherham-v-shrewsbury-league-one-play-off-live","fields":{"headline":"Rotherham 2-1 Shrewsbury: League One play-off final – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here’s the match report from Nick Miller. Congratulations, Rotherham, who can look forward to Villa Park, Stoke, The Hawthorns and the Liberty. Commiserations to Shrewsbury, who get to go to Sunderland. The best team won, it has to be said. Now, one play-off to go. Coventry v Exeter on Monday. Who will be travelling to the New Meadow? Rotherham manager Paul Warne speaks They went toe to toe with us, I am really proud of my group of lads. It was a horrendous 12 months last year. [On Wood] I call him my wrecking ball. He is prepared to break his nose for the team. His attacking and defending set pieces was the difference. The only person I didn’t want to beat was [Shrewsbury manager Paul Hurst] Hursty, but Hursty will go on to great things. Two-goal hero Richard Wood speaks. I am speechless. We’ve come so far from last season, it was terrible. To turn it around in the manager great credit. To get a brace has never been heard of. I see my kids crying in the stands. That’s what it’s all about. I am proud to do it for them. Richard Wood the two-goal hero, while Shrewsbury experience the desolation of losing in the play-off. Rotherham were the better team. One, last desperate attack from Shrewsbury but the ball ends up in Rodak’s hands. And that’s it! 120 mins: A whiff of a chance, but then Richard Wood, our hero, steps in to quell the danger. He can barely stand up straight or walk, but they shall not pass. 120 mins: There are two added minutes here. 118 mins: Break on for Shrewsbury? No, Rotherham get men back. And at the other end, Williams weaves into the opposing area. He goes down. Penalty? Don’t be daft. He went down in stages. 116 mins: Rodak has to come out to claim the ball. Rotherham beginning to camp a little deeply for comfort. They get a break when Godfrey crops down Vaulks, who has stud marks right down the back of his calf. Nasty business. 115 mins: Shrewsbury free-kick now. Whalley’s free-kick went a long way and Rodak had to dig it out. Rotherham’s keeper did well and then Williams helped shut down a danger that is quelled by a silly foul by John-Lewis. 113 mins: Rodman, bandaged up, cramped up, rises to win a header and also smiling. Some stones on the man. 112 mins: Shrews have played 62 matches this season, more than Liverpool or Manchester City, so it is little shock to see their players going down with cramp. 111 mins: It’s all Rotherham, still, and that’s bad news for Shrewsbury fans. Their small squad, which was punching above its weight, looks to have seized up. 110 mins: Off goes Joe Newell, the creator of that Wood goal, and on comes Anthony Forde, no slouch himself as an attacker. Paul Warne continuing to be progressive. 109 mins: Rotherham on the attack. Williams, outstanding since coming on, up against Beckles again, and this time the Shrews defender does well. 108 mins: Here come Shrewsbury. Beckles on the charge. Calls for a pen? No, the opposite. A goal-kick. 107 mins: Will Rotherham sit back on this? They have been on the front foot all game, and that has been the difference. 106 mins: OK, 15 minutes to save the Shrews. And for the Millers to see this out. The huddles break and the second half of extra time can begin. The two Pauls can do no more now. Jenny Britnell emails in: “c’m on you Shrews.! We are following your commentary - somewhat nervously on slow internet connection in the middle on the English Channel - it will all be over before we know it - literally ..” Sorry to be the bearer of such bad news. 105 mins: Half-time in extra-time. Credit must go to Joe Newell’s set-piece for that Wood goal. 105 mins: At the other end, the heroic Wood clears the danger of a Shrewsbury attack. Two minutes added in this period of extra-time. 104 mins: The guilty party there was Shrewsbury’s John-Lewis. He cannot even use tiredness as an excuse, as he was a second-half sub. It was a forward’s attempt to defend. Who else but Richard Wood? This time it wasn’t a header, but a centre-forward’s finish from another well-worked free-kick. 102 mins: Sadler yellow-carded for a tackle on Williams. The referee recognised its cynicism. 101 mins: Nolan knocked over, by Lavery, to ease a bit of pressure in extra-time. 99 mins: Newell’s free-kick is high, and Dean Henderson again comes for the ball to get it clear. He is never slow in coming forward. Eventually, Towell gets a shot in that flies miles over. 97 mins: A break in play, as goalscorer Rodman has bleeding from his bonce. 96 mins: Whalley’s corner is cleared. Ryan Williams on the run. Whalley commits the foul, and he is on a yellow card. This referee has let plenty go without being as, well, negligent as Anthony Taylor in the Championship game. 95 mins: Williams ran at Beckles, but this time the Shrewsbury defender did his job well. Godfrey surges to the byline and wins a corner at the other end. 94 mins: Penalties have a magnetic pull on these occasions and it is difficult to see beyond them at this point. 93 mins: Sadler makes a hurried clearance. Rotherham piling it on again, but Joe Newell’s shot is poor. 91 mins: It’s leggy stuff, as might be expected, with Omar Beckles, who looks cream crackered, lamping the ball into touch when he had team-mates on. Rotherham will look to target Beckles, though they have done that all day, to be fair. Here we go, then. The team talks are done. Shrewsbury have made all three subs, while Rotherham have one to go. Michael Connellan emails in: “Hi John, Great coverage of the game - thanks. Thought I’d point out that Richard Wood is not just a leader on the pitch. Off the pitch, he supports a type 1 diabetes charity, JDRF, following the diagnosis of his son with the condition. Nacho has type 1 diabetes and he won the Champions League yesterday.” And extra-time beckons. Some tired legs around and some heavy duty work for the masseurs to come. And the managers. Which of the two Pauls can outsmart the other? 90 mins+5: What a save! Williams cut in from the right-hand side. His shot was arrowing into the goal...but Henderson got a firm hand to it, somehow. That was the one! 90 mins+4: Shrewsbury digging in, and Jay Emmanuel’s efforts to force a run down the wing are stopped by a series of agricultural tackles. 90 mins+3: Rotherham the team pushing the hardest here. 90 mins+2: Nsiala came across to stop a Williams run. Another Rotherham corner. Henderson came a long way to get nowhere near it, and is lucky that Will Vaulks cannot get a shot on target. 90 mins: 5 (FIVE!) minutes of added time has been declared, and both teams look tired enough to concede. 88 mins: Wood was the target again for a Rotherham corner, but Riley got in his way. 87 mins: Chances at both ends. Whalley has a shot saved by Rodak and when Smith looked to be pushing through, John Nolan’s tackle stopped him. 86 mins: Michael Hann tweets in again. Our original estimate not far off, then. 85 mins: Oof, close. Rotherham’s Smith went close, but just as he seemed to have to got past Henderson, the goalkeeper managed to get a claw on the ball. 84 mins: In these times of high-profile goalkeeping mistakes, thoughts go out to the goalies. 83 mins: An understandable slowing of hostilities at this late stage. Here’s when the cramp starts appearing, and as Kevin Keegan famously said, that is worse than a broken leg. 81 mins: Into the last ten minutes we go, and it’s hugely difficult to work out which way this one is going. Extra-time seems like it would be the favourite. 80 mins: Michael Hann, a colleague at Guardian Towers, tweets in: “Am at Wembley. Can’t help feeling they would get better crowds with better pricing. £80 for our seats among Shrews fans at side. Yes, it’s Wembley but it’s also L1 football.” 79 mins: Lavery again in the mix as Rotherham try to find their winner, but John-Lewis, at the other end, has a shot on goal from the right side of the box. Rodak dived and was beaten, but so was the post. 77 mins: Shrewsbury at last have a chance to get on the attack, but fail to make much of their chance to either get breathing space or find a potential winner. 76 mins: Lavery is finding the same space that David Ball found in the first half, and has another effort on goal. 75 mins: Rotherham sub: On comes Williams for Taylor. 73 mins: And Lavery should have scored! In an inside left position, he had the goal gaping and tried a chip. Vaulks now fires one in. Rotherham have recovered their dominance now. 72 mins: Final Shrewsbury sub: Joe Riley has come on for Bolton at right-back. 70 mins: Rotherham sub: Wood, so excellent in that first half hour, got tired and has left the field to be replaced by Lavery. 69 mins: Rotherham piling it back on now. Vaulks’ shot squirts through and Henderson makes the save when he was unsighted. 67 mins: That Shrewsbury goal brought back memories of well-worked free-kick, but mine has failed me. Initially thought it was like this Brolin goal from 1994 but there was actually one more touch by Shrews. 66 mins: Rotherham, so effervescent, have gone a bit milky here. Shrewsbury are now the team exerting their power. 64 mins: Substitution: Morris cannot soldier on for any longer. He rips his own shirt in rage and punches the wall in anger as John-Lewis comes on for him. 62 mins: Carlton Morris down, and for the second time. Looks to be the end of his afternoon. The initial tackle from Wood had the Rotherham player wincing. But Morris seems determined to carry on. 59 mins: After so much sludge from Shrewsbury that was liquid stuff. In pre-match, Paul Hurst had suggested he would work on free-kicks. It was Sadler’s pass from Whalley’s initial kick that made it and Rodman was through on goal. What a goal, from a beautifully worked free-kick. 57 mins: Carlton Morris is fouled, and this is a promising position for Shrewsbury. 56 mins: Morris had taken a bit of a kicking, so Payne brings on fresh legs to try and energise a flagging effort from Shrewsbury. 54 mins: Stefan Payne, leading scorer for Shrews, is coming on for Bryn Morris. That’s a rejig of the strikeforce. 53 mins: Shrewsbury still struggling badly with Rotherham’s bombardment. Looks like a change is on its way for the team behind. 51 mins: Another Rotherham free-kick. Let the aerial duels commence. 49 mins: Rotherham corner. Wood v Beckles? Not this time, but another corner swiftly happens and Nsiala is marking Wood in any case. Henderson was baulked as he climbed to catch. Nsiala was all over Wood, in the same style that Beckles chose. 48 mins: Worth mentioning that there were no half-time subs made. Beckles gets chance to make amends. Meanwhile, Carlton Morris found space up front. He pinged the ball across goal but no colleagues around to convert it. 47 mins: Paul Hurst has shed the tracksuit top, having presumably worked up a sweat in the Shrewsbury dressing room. 46 mins: The second half is back underway. What can Shrewsbury find? Can Rotherham keep up their excellence? Other stuff to look out for today: Captain Richard Wood did all the damage for Rotherham. Omar Beckles has not known what to do with Wood’s surges forward for set pieces. David Ball missed the penalty Beckles conceded and then Wood took matters into his own hands by scoring Rotherham’s goal. United’s main worry is that Shrewsbury surely cannot be as bad as that in the second half. And will Beckles run out for the second 45? 45 mins: Into added time in the first half. Shrewsbury have a free-kick after a foul by Wood but fail to force even a corner from another weak attempt. 44 mins: Beckles, trying to make amends perhaps, charges forward, and almost forces an opening. He might be fearing that his match might end at half-time here. Paul Hurst needs to change something. 42 mins: Rotherham’s choice of playing toward their own fans has paid dividends. Shrews fans have barely had a close-up of their heroes. Henderson, in Shrewsbury’s goal, dives and can’t get to a Richie Towell shot, which just drifts over. 40 mins: Carlton Morris released by Nolan down the channels, but he has nobody for company. His team-mates are having to get through far too much defending to be able to indulge in some “total football” attacking. 38 mins: Beckles panics again when the ball is aimed for Wood again. It’s a barrage, and it’s a shock at this point that Rotherham aren’t leading by more, or that they haven’t won more penalties. Do Shrewsbury have a defender on the bench? 37 mins: Nasty challenge from Shrewsbury’s James Bolton sees him collect a yellow card. This time on the free-kick, Wood is being picked up by Carlton Morris. 35 mins: Reminder that Shrewsbury have lost all four previous visits to Wembley. And this occasion does seem to have frozen them somewhat. 34 mins: Paul Hurt looking less smiley now. His team have been much the poorer side. 33 mins: Wood made an unchallenged run on Beckles, clearly mindful of that penalty, and other ref warnings, and who seemed to let his opponent go. Rotherham exploited the space beautifully. And it comes from that one-on-one battle once more. Beckles this time let Wood go and the centre-back launched a header that Henderson could do nothing about. 31 mins: Beginning to look like Shrewsbury have worked out what to do with David Ball. He has become far more peripheral. 30 mins: Beckles, up for the corner, almost got to the cross. Next, Nolan creates a chance for Carlton Morris, whose flicked header drifts past the post. 29 mins: Shrewsbury win a corner. Nolan’s cross swept behind by Morris. 28 mins: Beckles’ clashes with Wood seem likely to give rise to another penalty for Rotherham. The Shrews defender just can’t stop feeling up his opponent and the ref keeps warning him to stop. 26 mins: First booking of the day? Shaun Whalley led with his elbow as he smashed into Rotherham’s Mattock. Meanwhile... 24 mins: Ball has a shot blocked. Another corner. This time Taylor’s ball is into Henderson’s arms, and after an initial drop of the ball, he takes hold. 22 mins: Can Rotherham keep this up? They have exerted far greater energy so far. Ball’s passing finds Taylor in space, but the offside flag is waved. Some real danger from Ball, who has been excellent, a ball-player of distinction. 21 mins: Another free-kick, another infringement. This time, Rotherham’s Smith is penalised. 20 mins: Shrews chance! Rodman just couldn’t get to a Shaun Whalley cross. 17 mins: Rotherham much the better team. They are hunting hard for the goal they should really have already. A corner is won, but Wood fails to climb highest. It looked like Beckles - again - was guilty of manhandling. 16 mins: David Ball is eager to make up for that missed penalty, and went on weaving run, and Nsiala has to come across to stop Rotherham’s twinkle-toed forward. 14 mins: John Nolan forces a corner. That’s better from Shrewsbury, but the delivery needs to be better. It’s taken short for Alex Rodman to fire a shot that’s blocked. 13 mins: Shrewsbury yet to get going at all. They are going for some route one stuff. 12 mins: Rotherham still having the better of it, really pushing on for this, and Shrewsbury making the type of hurried interventions that led to that penalty. 11 mins: Reminder that Dean Henderson is on loan from Manchester United, where he is rated most highly. Agonising for Paul Warne, Rotherham boss, on the sidelines. David Ball stepped up coolly, too coolly and Shrews keeper Dean Henderson read it right. Right height. Beckles clatters Wood. Ref Robert Jones had no choice but to give it. 7 mins: Nsiala close to conceding a pen? The ball hit his thigh and bounced into his hand. Corner given instead to Rotherham. 5 mins: Shrewsbury trying to get underway. Whalley got buffeted by Mattock, and that’s another free-kick. It comes to nothing. So far the deliveries have betrayed understandable nervousness. 3 mins: Ball is getting the Grealish treatment already. Nsiala clattered him and the referee was really rather lenient with him; a yellow card seemed most likely. 2 mins: Rotherham go close. David Ball escapes down the flank, and centres a pass that Joe Newell was closest to. Promising for United. Worrying for Shrewsbury. 1 min: Looks like Shrewsbury are planning to press hard from the start. On the sideline, Paul Hurst has a big smile across his face, and a tracksuit on. A few minutes ago, he was wearing a suit. Tony Pulis-chic, let’s call it. Rotherham get it underway. The teams swap ends after the coin toss. Rotherham will kick towards their fans for the first half. Kick-off draws near, and it looks more a day for ice cream and cold beer rather than 90 minutes of football which can make or break careers. Paul Hurst, Shrews manager, played his entire career for Rotherham, and spent five years with United manager, Paul Warne, as his team-mate. The two Pauls shared a manly embrace in the tunnel earlier this afternoon. Their respective teams are currently on the Wembley turf meeting the EFL suits. Like Saturday’s match, it is very hot at Wembley and that made for heavy fatigue and some tetchy behaviour. Last time Rotherham were in the play-off final, they beat Leyton Orient on penalties in the 2014 final. This was how manager Steve Evans celebrated. Shrewsbury have recent memories of Wembley which may not be too sweet. Their loss to League Two Lincoln was a big shock. The bookmakers’ odds suggest Rotherham are quite warm favourites, and that may be a result of the two teams’ late-season form. Shrewsbury spent 200 days in an automatic promotion spot, having been expected to struggle against relegation in pre-season. It is estimated that Rotherham will bring 14,000 fans down to Wembley, while 11,000 Salopians make their way east. That means Wembley might be quite empty, begging the question of why the national stadium has to host this game (beyond money), though the flipside of that is that fans all want to see their team play at the hallowed ground (or the redux that opened in 2007). Let’s look back at yesterday’s match while also looking forward to next season. Saturday’s Championship play-off got the EFL’s showpiece weekend off to a cracking start. There might have been just one goal in it between Fulham and Villa, but that game had just about everything else, including an incredibly laissez-faire refereeing performance from Anthony Taylor. Jack Grealish will have a sore leg, riven with studs from Ryan Fredericks, as well as banging head. Now, who gets to join reluctant, pained Villa in the second tier of English football? Eight points, though only a single place, separated Shrewsbury and Rotherham in the regular season. The Shrews’ hopes of automatic promotion collapsed in the latter weeks as Blackburn and Wigan surged clear. Promotion would be a step into territory lost in the mists of time. The club has not been in the old Second Division since 1988-89, and even played a season of Conference football in 2003-04. Rotherham are bidding to return to the division where they collected just 23 points last season. Paul Warne has done a fine salvage job at the New York Stadium, just as Paul Hurst, linked with a move to Ipswich come what may, has done at the New Meadow. As always with these fixtures, what follows the final whistle (perhaps after ET +P) will be a clear divide between triumph and desolation. And that’s why we watch these games."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/28/union-leader-maryam-pougetoux-france-hijab","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T10:17:40Z","webTitle":"A student leader is the latest victim of France’s obsession with the hijab | Rokhaya Diallo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/28/union-leader-maryam-pougetoux-france-hijab","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/28/union-leader-maryam-pougetoux-france-hijab","fields":{"headline":"A student leader is the latest victim of France’s obsession with the hijab\r\n","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“She wears a particular veil that covers all her hair, the neck: a hijab”. Last Tuesday on French TV two men – a pundit, Thomas Legrand, and celebrity host, Yann Barthès – described in detail a woman’s outfit before labelling it “the opposite of feminism”. Few people in France appeared surprised. For the past two weeks the hijab has once more been at the centre of a national debate that has verged on hysteria. It all started on 12 May when the political scientist Laurent Bouvet, known for his activism and sometimes referred to as a “gladiator of secularism”, published on his Facebook page an image taken from a televised interview with the elected president of the Sorbonne branch of the national student union (Unef), Maryam Pougetoux. The interview was about student protests against government reforms, but Bouvet’s attention was caught not by Pougetoux’s comments but by the hijab that surrounds her face. The reaction on social media was immediate. On Facebook, the prominent socialist Julien Dray said: “As a founding member of Unef … the union leadership that approves this young woman as a leader defiles all the struggles we led in the universities.” The minister of the interior, Gérard Collomb, joined in, describing Pougetoux’s appearance as “shocking” and referring to “young people that can fall for Daesh’s thesis”. The cyberbullying that followed has included publication of Pougetoux’s telephone number. The satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo put a caricature on the front page, giving her ape-like, coarse features. The overpowering impression is of a woman’s politics and achievements completely overwhelmed by her physical appearance. So what did Pougetoux do wrong? She dared to wear a religious symbol while being a union leader. Bouvet asserted that he was simply observing an inconsistency: “How is it possible simultaneously to defend progressive/feminist principles (contraception, abortion, marriage for everyone …) and ostentatiously display religious belief?” It is striking how many people seem willing to judge the choice to wear a scarf while hearing nothing from Pougetoux herself. How can one interpret the meaning of a garment without asking the opinion of the women who wear it? She had some defenders, too, in a debate that completely took over the airwaves. La République En Marche MP Aurélien Taché, himself a former Unef leader, said “I believe it’s up to the students to choose their representative and that they don’t need us for that.” The controversy came just a few weeks after another row about a Muslim woman, the first veiled candidate on the French version of the television singing competition The Voice, Mennel Ibtissem. The discovery of Facebook posts in which Ibtissem had appeared to question whether the 2016 Nice lorry attack, in which 86 people were killed, should be classified as terrorism, led to her withdrawal. My point is not to defend these comments. But the fact is that for three decades now, controversy around the headscarf in France has been never-ending: visibly Muslim women have again and again been singled out for criticism, denied their own agency or intellect, and prevented from engaging in public life. As the furore around Maryam Pougetoux shows, France is stuck in an identity crisis, unable to recognise all its citizens and apparently frightened of its own multicultural reflection. • Rokhaya Diallo is a writer, journalist, film director and activist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/27/ethiopia-pardons-abducted-briton-on-death-row-andargachew-tsege-yemen","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T12:30:10Z","webTitle":"Ethiopia pardons abducted Briton on death row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/27/ethiopia-pardons-abducted-briton-on-death-row-andargachew-tsege-yemen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/27/ethiopia-pardons-abducted-briton-on-death-row-andargachew-tsege-yemen","fields":{"headline":"Ethiopia pardons abducted Briton on death row","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Briton who has spent four years on death row in Ethiopia after being abducted at an airport in Yemen has been pardoned. Andargachew Tsege, an opponent of the regime in Addis Ababa, first came to the UK in 1979. He holds British citizenship and was sentenced to death in his absence nine years ago. His wife, who has not seen him in four years, told the Guardian that she expected him to be back at their home in London this week. Tsege was abducted during a stopover in Yemen while travelling from Dubai to Eritrea and forcibly flown to the Ethiopian capital. He had previously been secretary general of Ginbot 7, an opposition party that called for democracy, free elections and civil rights in Ethiopia. Last year the heads of both branches of the legal profession in England and Wales urged the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, to intervene more forcefully in the case. Johnson had said he would not interfere in the legal systems of other countries and that calling for Tsege’s release would not be helpful “at this stage”. Tsege’s partner, Yemi Hailemariam, said she hoped Tsege, 63, would be released from jail by Monday and back home in London by the end of the week. “He has been pardoned due to what are called ‘special circumstances’,” she said. “Although he was born there, the rule is that once you take up another nationality you lose your Ethiopian nationality. He’s a British citizen and so doesn’t have a valid permit to stay there. The only obstacle would be getting a flight back to London but there’s one every day.” Hailemariam, who lives in London with the couple’s three children, said that she has not seen her husband in four years. “I wasn’t allowed to visit him,” she said. “I only spoke to him by phone once. So I’m waiting for him to call me. He’s beginning to have medical issues so it’s a good time for him to come home.” His daughter Menabe, 18, has promised the first thing she will do is “tackle and hug” him, Hailemariam said. “They have missed him over the past four years and so much has changed. There’s been a change of prime minister in Ethiopia and he has accelerated the pardoning begun by his predecessor. They have kept their word. They are releasing a huge number of people,” Hailemariam said. The British ambassador in Addis Ababa, she added, had been “amazing” in providing support and help. The Foreign Office has supported Tsege’s family during his detention. The case has been raised repeatedly with the Ethiopian government. A spokeswoman said: “Foreign Office staff are assisting a British man following the announcement of a formal government pardon in Ethiopia, and are in close contact with his family.” The human rights organisation Reprieve said Tsege’s abduction was politically motivated and welcomed the pardoning. Maya Foa, the charity’s director, said: “After four unbelievably hard years on death row this is wonderful news for Andy, his partner and their children. The new Ethiopian government should be recognised for what they have done today. The most important thing now is that Andy is released from prison and able to reunite with his family as soon as possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/may/27/giro-ditalia-2018-final-stage-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T17:28:42Z","webTitle":"Giro d'Italia 2018:  Chris Froome confirms sensational win – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/may/27/giro-ditalia-2018-final-stage-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/may/27/giro-ditalia-2018-final-stage-live","fields":{"headline":"Giro d'Italia 2018:  Chris Froome confirms sensational win – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Thanks so much for all your contributions, insight and humour over the last few weeks. We’ll do it all again next year. What a Giro its been – look out for much more reaction on these pages over the coming hours and days. I’ll leave you with a reminder of Sean’s report. Froome, the Giro d’Italia winner, speaks! “It was great to be able to soak up the atmosphere in Rome, the monuments and the crowds, that didn’t disappoint. I don’t think it’s sunk in yet, I’m sure it will once I’ve got a bit of time to reflect. It’s just incredible to have three leaders’ jerseys in the space of 12 months, an incredible feeling – I’m still pinching myself, I can’t believe it.” Nice hashtag. And here is our on-the-finish report from Sean Ingle! Enjoy it! Great Bennett stat ... Carapaz finished fourth, Pozzovino fifth. It’s been a wonderful, intensely fought three weeks. And what a scene to finish it. He crosses with his Sky team-mates, arms aloft! It’s been a formality all day – but what a remarkable, fantastic achievement from the British cyclist, who is the first of his nationality to win this event! Dumoulin finishes second, Lopez third. Froome will be in soon – he’s being cheered home by the crowds on either side and is enjoying a nice chat with team-mate David de la Cruz. Stage 21 top three, then: 1 – Sam Bennett 2 – Elia Viviani 3 – Jempy Drucker What a final 500m that was, especially given Bennett was all alone and Viviani flanked by three team-mates. Such speed at the end there. And now we wait for Froome et al, who are I think about eight minutes away. Viviani takes the points jersey, by the way. Well! Bennett timed it perfectly and burst through at the end! Viviani seemed to have just done enough but no, Bennett took it after a dashing late run! Brilliant stuff right at the end. 1km to go: Quick-Step have three men in front of Viviani and they’re going past the Colosseum one last time ... three or four men in the hunt ... possibly more ... 2km to go: It’s anybody’s game now, this stage – Manuele Boaro is now in front, not long to go ... “Froome had probably been the most tested rider in the last six or seven years,” emails David W. “With the biologic passport and peeing in a cup 150/365 days a year, one spurious test for an approved inhaler which has virtually zero chance of improving performance as used becomes kind of silly doesn’t it? Can’t we just except he’s one tough man and a great champion?” 4km to go: Froome and company are a good 10 minutes behind, so we’ll finish in about 15 minutes I expect. 6km to go: Viviani is now back on his way, but the stage is being led by Mattia Cattaneo – we have a late break in which five riders are separated by seven seconds. 9km to go: We have four out in front now and Viviani has an issue, a chain problem I think, which has put him right off the pace! 12.5km to go: We have a sprint now, Juul Jensen and Kuznetsov not giving much until ... now ... when they’re absorbed in the pack. And now the game is on! 15km to go: Ballerini has won the “Combativity” prize, I believe. So many gongs up for grabs at a Giro! Keep your analyses coming, everyone! 21km to go: The stage winner surely won’t come from Juul Jensen and Kuznetsov, much as they keep the pace for now. Viviani is being tipped by the pundits on my telly but Bennett will give this a real go in the final lap. 23km to go: Miguel Angel Lopez, who will finish third, takes the white jersey, remember – that’s won by the best young rider, and the 24-year-old Astana rider has been massively impressive in this Giro. 26km to go: Nineteen seconds between the peloton and those two leaders, Juul Jensen and Kuznetsov; a further six minutes for the maglia rosa group. No more mishaps on Rome’s bumpy roads to report, thank goodness. 31km to go: The maglia rosa group are five minutes or so behind the lead. There’s no need to worry. This is all done. 35km to go: Juul Jensen is out in front of Vyacheslav Kuznetsov, with three laps or so left for them. Hearing that Pinot, by the way, is out of hospital but needs an extended period of complete rest. He’s on the mend but was in quite a bad way, pushing himself beyond the limit. 38 km to go: What are we thinking for the sprint showdown between Viviani and Bennett? It’s imminent, I think. Bennett sounded confident in an interview that was aired just now but Viviani has the whip hand ... 40km to go: We have under four laps left, Froome is in a little group of his own that’s three minutes 20 seconds back, and the peloton is 32 seconds off the pace. 43km to go: Eugert Zhupa, the Albanian, won the last intermediate sprint – the final one of this Giro! 45km to go: Neilands has been overhauled, I think, by Chris Juul Jensen. Going at a fair lick there now, and we should be done in the next hour or so. 51km to go: Quick-Step are running the show in the peloton, and why not? 52km to go: A very strung-out, broken-up race now with a front group that wants to race and a remainder that really don’t. 56km to go: Bike change for Paolo Simion, but he’s back up and running. A few people getting some bumps and niggles as we go on now. 57km to go: Krists Neilands, a talented young Latvian, is currently out in the lead. And why not? It’s not exactly the most intense of occasions and it’s a chance to make a bit of a name for yourself for those interested. Let’s just remember the good times. 64km to go: Around 20 riders in the break, I think, who are 46 seconds ahead of the maglia rosa gang. 67km to go: We have a possible casualty, it’s Alex Dowsett of Kapusha. Scuppered by the road, I think, but looks like he will be back up with a wheel change. Davide Ballerini took the first sprint there and will win the sprint competition! “What a bunch of softcocks!” blasts Bernard Devoy in an excellent beginning to his email. “They ride Paris Roubaix and the Strada Bianchi, but a few cobbles in Rome cause them to neutralise the race and go for a training ride. I came here to watch professionals race! As I finished that sentence (I type slowly) the breakaway has started, thank god.” From Andrew Mullinder: “It’s been an amazing Giro, which has cemented its place as the best GT of the three – although the breaking of Yates and Pinot suggests they might have gone a bit too far with the course this time. Anyway, best and worst moments were the same: Froome’s 80km, swashbuckling solo effort to vault into the maglia rosa. “Best because it’s one of the finest, most remarkable sporting feats I’ve ever seen, breaking away on the 10%-incline gravel of the mighty Finestre, daredevil descending and an iron will. Worst because I wasn’t thrilled to my core, as I have ought to have been. The sport is too tainted, and Sky push the rules too close (beyond?) their limits for that. It’s sad, because it was effing incredible, as is the sport itself.” “PS, Typing from a Moscow contemporary dance academy, passing the time during, erm, between performances. Can anybody beat that for weird Giro MBM watching?” One of the better ones I’ve seen ... but if anyone can beat Andrew’s MBM fixation, please try! Darren Kendall wonders: “Is this the time we can start saying Froomey is a cycling great ... he has to be! He was all but wrote off by everyone this past week. Sheer class &amp; brilliance shone through ... as for the cloud that hangs over him &amp; Sky I think it will be put to bed ... ! I don’t believe for a minute he would put his name, career &amp; all he has achieved for the issue that hangs over his name! As for Sky questions may remain &amp; maybe answers are needed.” 73km to go: This has been a borderline farce, really, and highly anticlimactic, but at least some pace is picking up now and we can get to the exciting part of the stage before long. Ha, yes, neither road race is particularly ripe for overtaking! 78km to go: The stage has been neutralised, so Froome is our winner, basically. Everyone has to honour the final few laps through and those who want to sprint will – there’s a bit of movement at the front of the peloton and we’ll see some sort of a break before long I think, the pace is quickening. If you like your drama a touch more immediate, John Brewin is on hand with a football MBM – the second half of the League One play-off final between Rotherham and Shrewsbury is afoot, and Rotherham are winning 1-0. 82km to go: The Trevi fountain looks nice and blue. 85km to go: At the end of this lap the GC race will be neutralised – all times will stand. What was a formality for Froome is now even more so. 87km to go: We could make jokes about Roman roads here, couldn’t we? A number of potholes and issues with the course’s quality seem to be what caused Froome, acting as a spokesman for everyone else, to pass on the riders’ wishes. 88km to go: Yep, that seems to be decision made all round. If I were outside now, and more specifically in Rome, I’d go and sunbathe for an hour or two. 90km to go: “Apparently they were unhappy with the transfer from yesterday’s stage and now they feel the course has too many dangerous spots (according to L’Equipe tv channel),” explains Fiona Fallon. Thanks Fiona; I guess they want to make sure that any sprint takes place without endangering maglia rosa contenders or anyone else. 91km to go: News! The riders have been hot in discussion and Froome, having a chat with the course directors, is outlining their wish for a neutralisation once they get to 22km from home – two laps to go. That basically means that those final kilometres will be a straight sprint and the GC will be over. So if we’re patient and hold on here, we’ll have some fun in an hour or so! 94km to go: Now Viviani, who we expected to be sprinting later, is in lengthy conversation with Froome. They’re discussing a neutralisation – it seems like the riders are rebelling a little here. Andrew Woods writes: “What’s with all the Yates praise? Overcooked TT , and early effort. Lack of nous, good young rider but not GC contender.” Scathing! 96km to go: There seems to be a bit of disquiet about the course here, among the riders, with conversations being had with the organisers who are driving alongside. Nothing’s changed yet. I think it must relate to exactly when, and how, this turns from a saunter into an actual race. Mike Barron replies to Tom Shaw, and I’m staying out of this: “British? Yes he’s great cyclist developed by Teams Sky and GB, but that was down to him looking at where he’d get the support he needed to succeed. He’s a Kenyan who lives in Monte Carlo ...” 98km to go: Froome and Dumoulin have been having a nice old chat throughout this. All very brotherly here. Are you not entertained? 102km to go: Still looking for your Giro highs and lows – there’s not a lot of racing out there just yet. My highs and lows probably both centred on Simon Yates: what an effort it was from him, but what a shame he couldn’t quite keep it up. Is he a good news story the sport badly needs? 104km to go: For what it’s worth, the maglia rosa group are stationed 2min 25sec behind the leading party as we speak. They’re currently whizzing past the Colosseum! Pimp my bike! 107km to go: There was some talk that Dumoulin refused to shake Froome’s hand yesterday; that was total nonsense, it has been confirmed. It’s not really been That Kind Of Giro at all. 110km to go: On Froome, and any doubts surrounding that ride two days ago – does anyone really think that, after all that’s happened and been said and done, he and Sky would do anything that compromised them now? I really don’t; I think any insinuations are well off. 111km to go: Isn’t Rome lovely? I haven’t been since one of those endless-summer interrailing trips in about 2003. This is whetting the appetite for a return. You said it! 113km to go: I’m sure we will see some racing here later on but for now it’ll be very much a few processional laps. Froome is being sprayed with liquids, boozy or not, from the sides and is currently clutching a pink wine vessel. I’m not suggesting he is drinking wine, in fact he’s just handed it back. But that’s the celebratory vibe we are working with. “Regarding Gary Todd’s comment on getting behind Froome,” begins Tom Shaw. “His sin, apparently, is to not have a ‘Personality’. Generally posted by people who would be screaming about what an arrogant tw** he was if he was anything other than the polite and inoffensive person he is. He’s by far the best cyclist Britain has ever produced and has a claim to be the top sportsman too.” A reminder that your top three are (1) Froome (2) Dumoulin and (3) Miguel Angel Lopez, who capitalised on Pinot’s ailment yesterday. Richard Carapaz is 47 seconds behind Lopez but that’s going to be too much to alter the standings at the top. Nice. Any more on-scene snaps, send them in! In about two and a half hours we will, surely, hail Chris Froome as the first British winner of the Giro. Froome speaks now: “I’m lost for words, it’s such an emotional moment for me being in the pink jersey going into Rome. An amazing, amazing feeling.” Tom Dumoulin speaks about his team-mate Sam Oomen, who is ninth in the maglia rosa standings and has had a brilliant Giro: “He’s amazing, a young and cool guy, laid back and a similar character to me. When I was his age I was walking into the same issues as him, sometimes making the same mistakes. He’s a really cool rider.” Christopher Brown writes: “Stage 19 one of the greatest solo rides of all time. Equally impressive stage 20, to not only hold off Dumoulin, but to have the legs and the courage to attack at the end and claim the win. Hat doffed, Mr. Froome, hat doffed.” Yes, it was really expert stuff from Froome yesterday. I don’t really think Dumoulin had it in him to attack with conviction but, when he did try near the end, he was seen off in style. I believe Thibaut Pinot, who had such a sad, unlucky day yesterday and ended it in hospital, won’t be taking part today. He had dehydration and a fever, and it’s just not worth taking the medical risk of going out there again. Here’s an email from Gary Todd, sent to me earlier, reminding British cycling fans that they should get behind Froome: “Three points I make to these people. Both himself and Sky have been extremely stupid and careless. That said he’s hardly been taking EPO. For him to withdraw from cycling until the process is completed would let his supporters down and I would have have thought would be in breach of contract with sponsors. If you love cycling and you are British you must be mad not to think he is the greatest British sportsman of all time. If that is the case then get behind the lad.” It’s effectively Elia Viviani vs Sam Bennett in the points classification, of course – that’s the most up-for-grabs battle out there today. Viviani has 306 points and Bennett 232 ... will that be turned around? Should be some fun sprinting out there todau. So I’ll open this up now, and hopefully your emails will come flying in: what has been your high point in this Giro, and what about your low? Hello! Here we are for the Giro’s last knockings – it’s the last day in Rome, if you will, and it’s also the day that will see Chris Froome crowned winner unless something very, very odd indeed comes to pass. He is 46 seconds ahead of Tom Dumoulin and this, remember, is essentially a procession today for a man on the verge of something very special and, yes, controversial in some quarters: 10 loops of an 11.5km circuit around some of your favourite Roman sights. So we may as well relax and enjoy, particularly as the TV direction during this Giro has often tended to favour snazzy shots of the surroundings ahead of the actual action. And of course we can discuss the highs and lows of a remarkable few weeks.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. First up, two reviews of Graham Greene’s Our Man In Havana. It’s pleased paulburns: A delightful satire on the British Secret Service, with which Greene was intimately acquainted. A true balance of wit, humour, seriousness, tragedy and crime which was a worthy inspiration to John le Carré, and not a trace of froth and bubble. Captures Cuba just before the fall of Batista as well as the movie Godfather II. He also knows how to end a book properly. Greene at his best. And Gretsch83 had interesting tactics for approaching the novel: With a miniature whisky bottle and copy of Buena Vista Social Club by my side, I’ve been reading Our Man In Havana. It matches a dry wit to occasional flashes of real jeopardy, and what a shame Greene felt the need to dismiss this as one of his “entertainments” as it’s a better written work of literature than the majority of serious presentations. Perhaps Graham Greene would approve. But then again: only miniature? Elsewhere, PlumedCrest100 is approaching the end of Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall: It is quite easy to feel as if you are walking around Henry’s court listening to the whispers of the sharp-elbowed courtiers when truly engrossed in the book because of Mantel’s careful rendering of the times and Cromwell’s world. I particularly like her portrayal of Catherine of Aragon, it is easy to forget that she was a woman with a cultivated mind who acted with a good measure of dignity whilst her husband degraded her. Mantel’s depiction of Thomas More is also interesting, she seems to show him and Cromwell as two sides of the same coin, equal in viciousness, zeal and devotion to the king. Though of course, More’s devotion to Henry falters because of the strength of his belief. Wolf Hall was also in the headlines again last week, but a more “hidden gem” attracted the attention of originalabsence: Adam Thorpe’s “superlative” Nineteen Twenty-One: I’m only on page 39 but it looks the great WWI aftermath novel. The art and craft is exquisite. Why this novelist and poet isn’t rated perhaps the UK’s finest, most subtle literary talent I’ve no idea. This post was followed by a recommendation for Thorpe’s Still from MissBurgundy: Still is very long, stream of consciousness, based on an impossible premise. I’m sure many people gave up on it as it was available in every good charity shop in the 1990s, and can often be found today. I thought it was a work of genius. Virginia Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway didn’t quite grab Veufveuve: I admired this book, for its technique and innovativeness, but I found I couldn’t love it. I think that despite the immense interiority - the book is nothing but interiority - I still felt that I was on the outside looking in, watching each character as they move about, and never really knowing them (this is especially true of Clarissa Dalloway herself). It feels alienated and alienating. Perhaps that is the point? There were no such doubts about Coast to Coast by Jan Morris from Vesca: Originally written in the 50s (although my version has definitely been updated some time in the 60s) this is Morris in America. Or rather, the United States of America. And that’s why I love Jan Morris. I love the way she makes me think about the complexity and diversity and history and sheer vastness of a place that popular culture likes to reduce to pizza and presidential elections and Hollywood movies: Key West, barges on the Mississippi, uranium prospectors (yes, you read that right), why residents in Washington didn’t get to vote, local newspapers, and all. Finally, Bruce Springsteen’s Born To Run has been speaking to vermontlogger: Enjoying listening to this on CD. It’s read by Bruce himself, with feeling and character, and it’s impressive, both as a life story and as a piece of writing – direct, robust, unpretentious, articulate, and highly self-aware. A very cool guy. I don’t think anyone could argue with that. Interesting links about books and reading Millennials don’t like ebooks as much as paper books either.

For the Australian fans making their way there on a baking June day in 2006, it was just another few steps at the end of a long and often agonising journey back to the World Cup finals since the Socceroos’ only previous appearance, in 1974, also in Germany. The landmarks of that barren run are all too familiar: New Zealand, Scotland, Israel, Argentina, Iran and Uruguay had all left their scars on the memory. It would be hard to argue against John Aloisi’s penalty against Uruguay in November 2005 that ended that run as the single most critical and emotional moment of Australia’s recent World Cup history. But you could also easily make the case that the last 10 minutes of the opening game in the finals, against Japan in Kaiserslautern, meant as much. Les Murray, having lived every moment of the journey, called it “a poignant moment” as he introduced the SBS coverage. “After a 32-year wait, Australia will walk on the pitch behind me, face the sun and engage in a game of football that will captivate all in our country like few have done before.” Even he could scarcely have imagined how true that would turn out to be. Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day The context was critical. The A-League had just completed its first season and Australia had recently been accepted into the Asian confederation, potentially putting both the domestic and international side of the game on a whole new footing. The Socceroos had their finest crop of players in decades – of the 14 players who ultimately got on the field against Japan, seven were with Premiership clubs, two in Serie A, one in La Liga and two in the top divisions of Switzerland and the Netherlands. All this meant Australia had both their greatest opportunity to make progress at a World Cup, and the most urgent need to do so, to reinforce the mood of change and optimism. And with Brazil and Croatia completing the group, a win against the relative minnows Japan was crucial if the Socceroos were to have any chances of making the knockout stage. The narrative of Australia’s return to the biggest world stage was matched by the setting: Kaiserslautern’s wonderful, steep-sided stadium was packed with 46,000 fans, most of whom had made their way there from the other side of the world. For many Australians it was the first taste of the incredible noise of the disciplined Samurai Blue fans that would become all too familiar in the years to come. If Murray, the fans and the thousands watching at home in the middle of the night were in danger of getting swept away by emotion, coach Guus Hiddink was there to keep the players’ heads clear (although he too would lose his cool as events unfolded). Hiddink recalled years later how he had tried to add self-belief and tactical nous to the Australian players’ traditional qualities. “They had passionate hearts, [but] tactically and strategically it was not in balance with the super commitment of the guys.” He was so successful that the tactics website Zonal Marking rated Hiddink’s Australia one of the teams of the decade for its “highly unusual formation”, using three defenders and a single striker (Mark Viduka), with the six others in various fluid midfield combinations. But for most observers the tension blotted out any appreciation of tactical niceties. Viduka had an early double chance awkwardly kept out by Japan’s keeper, Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi, and for the Socceroos all the old anxieties came flooding back when they went behind in the 26th minute. Shunsuke Nakamura’s cross from the right seemed to be routine for Mark Schwarzer, but the goalkeeper was edged out of the way by a combination of Japan’s strikers Naohiro Takahara and Atsushi Yanagisawa, and the ball bounced gently in. Schwarzer later claimed the Egyptian referee admitted he had made a mistake, but that was of little use on the field, as Australia faced the prospect of the tamest elimination imaginable. Needless to say they did not want for effort. Brett Emerton and the surprise selection Luke Wilkshire ploughed relentlessly up and down the field in the unrelenting heat. And there were chances. Just before Japan’s goal a lovely Viduka touch set up Mark Bresciano, whose effort was saved. Harry Kewell thrashed a left-foot shot inches over, and a Bresciano free-kick went just wide. In the second half, substitute Josh Kennedy missed with a free header, and Kawaguchi saved brilliantly from Viduka’s free-kick. If there was one hope left, it was that fitness would tell – as Lucas Neill told it, Hiddink had been “flogging the whip” in training. And it was Neill who finally opened the door with six minutes of normal time left. Kawaguchi failed to deal with the defender’s long throw, and amid the chaos substitute Tim Cahill dug the loose ball out from under a defender for the ugliest, most beautiful goal in Australia’s history – their first in a World Cup finals tournament. Five minutes later Cahill received the ball from Aloisi, also on as a sub, just outside the box. One touch to control. One to shift the ball to his right. One too many? But the Japanese defenders were too tired to close down, and Cahill’s third touch whipped it against Kawaguchi’s right-hand post, back across goal, off the other post and in. Commentator Simon Hill, understandably losing any pretence of neutrality, let loose: “Oh, it’s a wonderful moment in Kaiserslautern!” Finally, Aloisi surged through the flagging defence to tuck away a third two minutes into added time, wheeling away to be engulfed by a disbelieving bench. Not all the hopes and dreams of those euphoric moments have been realised, of course. Here we are, 12 years later, with a struggling A-League and a team going to the World Cup with vastly less top-level experience than the 2006 squad. It feels like a long way back down the hill. Yet Kaiserslautern’s legacy remains. As an emotional Murray said after the game, “Australian football has made its mark on the world stage”. It left an enduring belief in fans and players alike that Australia don’t have to be there just to make up the numbers. When it all comes together, they can write part of the story too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/26/ireland-made-up-its-mind-on-abortion-years-ago-say-campaigners","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T08:57:35Z","webTitle":"Ireland made up its mind on abortion years ago, say campaigners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/26/ireland-made-up-its-mind-on-abortion-years-ago-say-campaigners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/26/ireland-made-up-its-mind-on-abortion-years-ago-say-campaigners","fields":{"headline":"Ireland made up its mind on abortion years ago, say campaigners","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ireland has profoundly changed its attitudes towards women, campaigners have said after a behavioural survey showed most voters made up their minds to repeal abortion laws years ago. The details of an exit poll by the broadcaster RTE, released in full on Saturday morning, confounded all expectations with no urban-rural divide, little gender difference in voting and only one in 10 saying they had been influenced by posters or religion. The only age group to vote no were the over-65s. Colm O’Gorman, the head of Amnesty International in Ireland, which campaigned for the yes vote, said, while the expectations had been that Saturday’s count would be close, attitude surveys it had conducted in 2015 had shown deep changes in thinking on abortion. This was borne out by the RTE poll, which predicts a vote of 69.4% in favour of reform, with 30.6% against. More than 75% said they had not changed their mind on abortion in the past five years, suggesting their support for reform far predated the announcement of a referendum two months ago. Some 82% said they had not changed their mind on how they were going to vote during the campaign. More than three-quarters said they were influenced by personal stories they heard in the media or by people they knew. Only 10% said they were influenced by the poster campaigns and only one in 10 cited religion as a motivating factor. Some 8% said they were influenced by the death of Savita Halappanavar during complications in her pregnancy in Galway in 2015. Predictions of a major urban-rural divide failed to materialise, with 63.1% of those in rural areas projected to have voted yes compared with 70% in Dublin. Farmers, who were also expected to vote no, came out in favour, with 52.15% voting yes, according to the RTE exit poll. Those who are projected to vote yes are: Women – 72.1% Men – 65.9% Dublin – 70% Rural – 63.1% Farmers – 52.15% The motivation for voting choice was also revealing: Already knew how I would vote – 75% Stories in the media – 43% Campaign posters – 10% Direct contact with campaigners – 7% Over-65s – 41.3% 18- to 24-year-olds – 87.6% 35- to 49-year-olds – 72.% 50- to 64-year-olds – 63.75 Voters who had backed the no campaign were motivated largely by the desire to protect the life of the unborn (76%). Ivana Bacik, a prominent campaigner for abortion reform in Ireland, told RTE: “I’m overwhelmed by the exit poll. For those of us who have campaigned for many years on this issue, it’s an incredible day to see people have voted in support of women’s rights. “What changed people’s opinions is that, for many years, we’ve all become aware of the immense harm the eighth amendment has caused over the years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/27/going-to-get-worse-red-fire-ants-detected-in-queenslands-scenic-rim","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T22:02:02Z","webTitle":"‘Going to get worse’: red fire ants detected in Queensland's Scenic Rim","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/27/going-to-get-worse-red-fire-ants-detected-in-queenslands-scenic-rim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/27/going-to-get-worse-red-fire-ants-detected-in-queenslands-scenic-rim","fields":{"headline":"‘Going to get worse’: red fire ants detected in Queensland's Scenic Rim","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"One of the world’s worst invasive pests, red fire ants, have been detected outside a containment zone in Queensland’s scenic rim. The ants, destroyers of crops and harbingers of doom for many forms of outdoor recreation, are considered a potential $45bn problem should they become widely established in Queensland. The discovery comes as the Invasive Species Council prepares to release a discussion paper raising alarm at the country’s handling of threats to biodiversity. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The report says the federal government has, for the past six years, refused to assess or list any more invasive species as part of a “deliberate strategy to limit funding demands”. Red imported fire ants were listed as a “key threatening process” (KTP) in 2003, with a corresponding “threat abatement plan” (TAP) set in 2006. The Queensland Farmers’ Federation president, Stuart Armitage, said the ants, which were native to South America but were first detected in Australia in 2001, could have significant environmental and social impacts. “Fire ants attack indiscriminately, potentially destroying the way of life for many Queenslanders and costing the state $45b over 30 years,” Armitage said. ‘No barbecues on the lawn, no backyard cricket’ “It may not be well understood, but if fire ants become permanently established, people in affected areas wouldn’t be able to enjoy our natural amenity or recreational areas. That means no camping, no barbecues on the lawn, no backyard cricket and no outside pets. “Vast areas of the state’s natural environment, including world heritage areas and national parks, are prone to fire ant invasion.” Armitage said the threat to agriculture was also significant and the nursery industry in south-east Queensland was already grappling with the problem. “A lot of people seem to think that biosecurity is just a problem for agriculture – it’s not. Everyone has a role to play and a general biosecurity obligation.” Fire ants have been detected in Brisbane, Sydney and the Gladstone region. The ants were eradicated from Sydney and Gladstone, but a biosecurity zone remains in place in south-east Queensland, covering much of Brisbane and stretching to the Scenic Rim. The latest find was about a kilometre from the boundary of the biosecurity zone, near Anthony in the Scenic Rim. It follows detections in the Lockyer Valley in April and at Beerwah, on the Sunshine Coast, last year. ‘Too little funding’ for invasive species The Invasive Species Council is preparing to release a report, seen by Guardian Australia, critical of the national approach to KTP listings, which are designed to identify big threats to biodiversity, and the TAP process, which is about preventing damage and mitigating those threats. The report says seven cases were refused for listing, including one that was knocked back by the federal government against the advice of the threatened species scientific committee. “Stymieing further invasive species listings appears to be a deliberate strategy to limit funding demands because there is far too little funding for abating the already-listed KTPs,” the report says. The council’s chief executive officer, Andrew Cox, said Australia’s notoriously strict biosecurity and quarantine processes were heavily geared towards threats to the agricultural industry. Threats to the environment, he said, were not given the same priority. “It’s only going to get worse as the current emerging pests spread throughout the landscape and as new ones arrive. We still haven’t turned off the tap while we’re cleaning up the mess,” Cox said. “Our biosecurity system is not strong enough for the environment.” Goats are listed as a threat, but the abatement plan is almost 20 years old and hasn’t been reviewed since 2005. Goat numbers are steadily increasing and the species is destructive to native vegetation. But because goats were harvested for meat, Cox said “the agricultural interests prevail”. Other examples of failures of the KTP process include feral deer, which Cox said were spreading across Tasmania, NSW and Victoria, angering many landholders. Buffel grass, another rejected listing, is actively planted by graziers in the Northern Territory but ecologists are concerned about its spread and impact in arid environments, particularly in Uluru-Kata Tjuta national park."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/26/week-in-patriarchy-immigrant-families-ice","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T13:00:57Z","webTitle":"The US is ripping immigrants' families apart.

Up until Kilauea began erupting this month, his full-time job was taking visitors on three separate volcano-related tours. Now, with Hawaii Volcanoes national park closed and the district of Puna inundated with lava, two of those three tours are cancelled until further notice. “As of this morning, the road where I’ve been conducting tours for a decade is no longer there,” he said. “Things are changing.” Hawaii island’s $2.4bn tourism industry is struggling in the wake of the Kilauea volcano eruptions, with bookings for May through July down 50%, according to the Island of Hawaii Visitors Bureau. Businesses on the island are doing their best to convince tourists that it’s still safe to visit. If tourism falters much longer, Collier reasoned, there’s still plenty of work in the astronomy industry located on this 13,000-foot-high dormant volcano. Mauna Kea – the largest peak in the world when measured from its base on the seabed – is a mecca for astronomers, as well as tourists. But his feelings about the volcano are mixed: it is eruptions like Kilauea’s that created the island in the first place. “Pele has awoken and is wreaking her destruction upon us, but I never forget that without her I would not have this beautiful place to call home,” he said. “We all understand the balance of these forces here on Hawaii island.” Doug Arnott, who owns the tour company Collier works for, Arnott’s Lodge &amp; Hiking, said he’s far more concerned with the potential economic disaster than he is about Kilauea, which is located about 30 miles away from his hometown of Hilo. The decision by major cruise lines to cancel their regular stops in the port of Hilo have been especially frustrating, he said. “What’s happening is only affecting a very small slice of the island,” he said. In the last couple weeks, he said, five regular cruise ship stops have been cancelled. When those visitors don’t come, he has to cancel his tours. Until the eruption, tourism on Hawaii was growing. In 2017, the 1.7 million people visited “The Big Island” and spent 14% more than the year before, according to Visitors Bureau statistics. Now, the future looks uncertain – volcanologists have no ideas when the eruption might end. Arnott said the island has to adjust. “We need to find different ways for people to visit,” he said. Allen Hartvigsen, the general manager at the popular Hilo Coffee Mill, is one of those trying to adjust. Since the eruption and the drop off in tourism, especially from cruise ships, Hartvigsen has had to cut employee hours by 60%. In the past few days, he’s gone door-to-door trying to drum up business, asking local businesses if they’ll carry his coffee. “I’m just walking into stores the old fashioned way, doing cold calls and shaking hands like I used to 30 years ago,” he said. In the meantime, he’s trying not to lay any of his employees off, and hoping that visitors return. “We’re receiving phone calls every hour from families that are cancelling their Hawaii vacations or are considering it,” said Jason Cohn, the vice-president of Sales and Marketing for Hawaii Forest &amp; Trail, a tour guide company. He said that so far his company is expecting a 30% decrease in revenue. “It’s a shame because other parts of the island have been absolutely beautiful these past couple of days, and not to mention safe places to view the incredible activity that’s happening from afar.” In Pahoa, near the heart of volcanic action, the highway is often clogged with cars. But the bohemian downtown remains dismally quiet, according to Amedeo Markoff, a business owner and board member of the Pahoa Mainstreet Association. “If this goes on,” he said, “there is going to be a second disaster: an economic one.” Markoff said he was unhappy with a statement given by Hawaii’s governor, David Ige, last week in which he asked visitors and residents to “stay out of Puna and Pahoa”. “If what he’s saying is true, and it’s dangerous to be here, then we should evacuate,” Markoff said. “But we’re still here. There’s a misconception that Pahoa is dangerous right now, but we’re used to lava and we know how to deal with it.” Recently, the air has also become a concern, with the Hilo medical center seeing a moderate increase in the number of people coming with symptoms related to volcanic smog and haze, which can begin with dry eyes or a scratchy throat. Rebekah Blakey, 31, of Los Angeles, and her sister arrived on Hawaii on 17 May, the same day that Kilauea sent an ash plume 30,000 feet in the air. They rebooked accommodations in the north of the island, but said they did occasionally feel effects from from the volcanic smog. “Our eyes have been a bit watery,” she said, “and on certain days, we didn’t feel great”. Back on the summit of Mauna Kea, the sun is setting on a thick layer of clouds. It’s incredibly quiet; the vastness of space seems to swallow the sound. The air is clear, too, all traces of vog gone above the cloud cover. Collier munches on a pack of astronaut’s ice cream from the visitor’s center while his tour passengers amble around on the Mars-like surface, snapping photos of the view. He tells them: “This is going to be one of the best sunsets of your life.” • This article was amended on 28 May 2018 because an earlier version referred to astrologists.

That means finding money; a serious amount of money. A funding crisis is brewing. Many would contend that it is already upon us. More than half of trusts are thought to have finished the last financial year in deficit. Hospital bosses say that understaffing is an acute problem. The number of GPs relative to the size of the population is falling. Spending on primary care has gone down. Waiting times are rising and targets are being missed. This deterioration in performance is also showing up in declining public satisfaction ratings. The high achieved as a result of New Labour’s big spend on health during Tony Blair’s time in office has been followed by a slide downwards since 2010 that has recently got worse. The chief executive of NHS England, Simon Stevens, is openly campaigning for more money. So is Jeremy Hunt, who only has a few more weeks to survive in office before he becomes the longest-serving health secretary. They seem to be having some success with Mrs May, who recently acknowledged that the NHS cannot go on lurching from one financial emergency to the next and suggested that she wants to bring forward a long-term funding settlement. The fierce wrangling within her government is about how much, how soon and where the funds are going to come from. A well-timed joint report by the non-partisan Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Health Foundation has examined the future demands of a growing and ageing population. It comes to the bracing conclusion that the NHS requires at least an extra £1,200 a year per household over the next 15 years. This is simply to sustain a “status quo” health service, delivering roughly the same levels of provision as now. If Britain has a more ambitious desire for a “modernised” NHS, then the bill comes in at around £2,000 a year per household. The report’s authors haven’t snatched these big numbers from thin air. They come to this conclusion only after examining other means of enhancing health care. Improving productivity is sometimes touted as an answer. “Getting more from less” was a popular mantra in Whitehall in the early years of austerity. Productivity in the health service has been going up and faster than across the economy as a whole. Further efficiencies are possible, and smart technologies may help, but these will not be enough to bridge the gap between performance and public expectations. Forget a Brexit dividend for the NHS. That never existed anywhere except in the imaginations of Boris Johnson and his fabulist friends. There’s no crock of gold at the end of that non-existent rainbow. In the government’s internal debates between ministers, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, has been particularly insistent that any extra cash that is found for health is not portrayed mendaciously as a Brexit windfall. The government could find more money by adding to borrowing, but there are limits to that, especially for a country that is still accumulating debt. Relying on borrowing to take the strain is not a sustainable, long-term solution. The government could choose to spend less on other things in order to find more for health. In fact, for the past eight years, this is a choice that the Conservatives have made. Although health spending has been rising more slowly than at any time since 1948, it has fared better than other areas of government activity. The NHS has been “ringfenced” from the full blast of austerity that has been imposed on rival budgets. Every extra billion that is spent on health at the expense of other areas of public spending is a billion less to spend on education or housing or justice or transport or policing. As the report notes: “There is barely any defence or housing budget left to cut.” Reductions in other areas of spending – this is notably the case with the severe squeeze on local government – have blown back on to the NHS by displacing needs on to hospitals and GPs’ surgeries. Even if it were desirable, cutting elsewhere to find extra cash for health simply doesn’t look viable. Ministers responsible for other departments have their own spending and electoral challenges to be anxious about. Sajid Javid, the new home secretary, survived his first encounter with the Police Federation by as good as telling them that there would be no further cuts to police numbers. The defence secretary is locked in a ferocious argument with the Treasury about the state of the armed forces. Tory MPs think that pressures on school budgets were one of the factors that hurt them at last year’s general election. Many are lobbying hard for more cash, not less, for education. Having considered the alternatives, the report’s authors conclude: “If we want to even maintain health and social care provision at current levels, taxes will have to rise.” This is an argument that splits the government. The health secretary finds it persuasive; the chancellor does not. Mr Hammond has told colleagues that he recognises the case for more spending on health, but he doesn’t accept that it needs to be so much more that he ought to put up taxes to raise the money. He was badly burnt by his 2017 budget when he tried to increase taxes on the self-employed only to be forced into retreat by a backbench revolt. Since then, the Tories have lost their parliamentary majority and the chancellor doesn’t trust opinion polls that suggest voters are willing to pay more in tax for the health service. The health secretary took that argument between them into the public domain when he recently contended that a tax rise for the NHS would be popular with the public, providing there was sufficient reassurance that the money will not be wasted. Some people in government have flirted with the idea of a special tax earmarked for health in the belief that this would be more palatable to voters. That doesn’t look like a runner. Hypothecated taxes have several disadvantages and are hated by the Treasury. Another idea that has been floated is to copy what New Labour did. Gordon Brown part-financed the large increase in health spending announced in Tony Blair’s second term by increasing national insurance contributions by a penny in the pound. It is questionable whether doing that again would pass a fairness test. National insurance contributions are levied on workers. They are not paid by the retired, who would feel the greatest benefit from increased spending on health and care. A member of the cabinet once bluntly, but accurately, remarked to me that the NHS budget is “spending on old people”. It is those of more advanced years who consume the bulk of NHS spending. The main source of future funding pressures is demographics: the population is getting older and care for those with chronic conditions is demanding an increasing proportion of resources. The old have the greater needs and also the greater means. As a group, they have accumulated wealth that the young as a group do not. The idea that the retired ought to be asked to contribute more towards their care once had appeal to Theresa May. During last year’s general election, she argued that some social care costs should be met from the financial gains accumulated in the property owned by older voters. What she proposed was effectively a form of postmortem wealth tax. In principle, it was not unreasonable to ask pensioners to contribute to the costs of their care from their property equity. In campaign practice, this policy turned out to be calamitous for Mrs May. Labour damned it as a “dementia tax”. A lot of older voters were frightened and angered. Tory candidates reported that it went down like a bucket of cold sick on the doorstep. Mrs May suffered the ignominy of scuttling this manifesto flagship within days of launching it. I am not surprised to hear from her cabinet colleagues that this experience still haunts the prime minister and is never far from her calculations about how to deal with this combustible issue. She wants the government to spend more on health. Colleagues believe that the prime minister has been persuaded that the funding gap needs a substantial answer, not a temporary fix that will be dismissed as no better than sticking plaster. She would like to be in a position to announce a significant new settlement in time for the NHS’s anniversary. What she still hasn’t resolved is how she is going to find the money to pay for a decent birthday present. • Andrew Rawnsley is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/26/kingdom-choir-karen-gibson-royal-wedding","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T11:56:23Z","webTitle":"‘It brings the spirit joy’: Britain’s godmother of gospel on why her choir stole the royal wedding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/26/kingdom-choir-karen-gibson-royal-wedding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/26/kingdom-choir-karen-gibson-royal-wedding","fields":{"headline":"‘It brings the spirit joy’: Britain’s godmother of gospel on why her choir stole the royal wedding","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Gospel is spreading, and we can praise Karen Gibson for that. The silver-coiffed conductor of the Kingdom Choir came close to stealing the show at the royal wedding last week, with a stripped-back, tear-inducing performance of Stand By Me. The choir pulled off the impossible feat of following Bishop Michael Curry’s fanfare of a sermon, with Gibson controlling her own and the singers’ passions to bring calmness before the wedding vows. “We didn’t know Michael Curry was going to be there,” she said. “He wasn’t at the runthrough. But my back is to him and I hear this voice, and I’m watching the choir getting all excited because his style of preaching is exactly what we’re used to – but we’re actually in St George’s Chapel, listening to a black gospel preacher. We want to say ‘hallelujah’ and ‘amen’ but of course we can’t, we just have to hold ourselves in.” Since the wedding, Gibson and her London-based choir have been in the eye of a whirlwind, performing for TV in the US and around the world, and dealing with a deluge of interest on social media and beyond. Stand By Me has been streamed more than 100,000 times on Spotify and watched on YouTube more than 10 million times. The choir’s website has crashed twice. There is talk of a collaboration with Sheku Kanneh-Mason, the cellist who played while the Duke and Duchess of Sussex signed the register, and on Friday the choir filmed with the BBC drama Call The Midwife. People have even painted fan art of her – and more. “They did a Bad Lip Reading of us,” she said, pulling out a phone to show a parody video of the wedding. “If you make it on to that, then you’ve made it.” The attention is also offline. “People get so excited when they know it’s me,” she said. “They hug me in the street. People scream through the car window. People saying how it made them cry. I didn’t think that people would be so engaged with the song but people have thanked us over and over again.” That overnight success has been 22 years in the making. After 11 years in IT, Gibson was made redundant and fell into teaching at a south London school. Eight years later she moved into music fulltime in 1996. One of those who encountered Gibson in her early years was Gareth Malone, TV’s Mr Choir, before either had been on TV, when he saw her teaching schoolgirls. “She just went ‘Right!’, and she started, full tilt, gospel,” he said. “In the time it took me to pack up my bag, she had got them all singing this piece she was teaching them and it was amazing.” The Kingdom Choir was named when she was asked to bring her then nameless choir to Songs of Praise for the BBC show’s 35th anniversary. “I went to sleep and the name that I dreamt of was the Kingdom Choir. I couldn’t think of anything else.”Since then the Kingdom Choir has performed at the Queen’s Jubilee, the 1995 VE day commemoration, with the Spice Girls, Elton John, for Bill Clinton, Desmond Tutu and with Joan Armatrading as a surprise for Nelson Mandela when he spoke at the London School of Economics. None was as momentous as the wedding of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, Gibson said. “It’s because we were invited to a private ceremony, even though it’s televised and millions of people were watching. It’s a very special thing, a wedding – it’s an honour, because there are vows being performed, a union, a coming together. It’s history being made. Even with ordinary people, this is family history, we’re spending the rest of our lives together.” She got the call when she was on a bus in Battersea, two months ago, and a few days later they were at Kensington Palace to meet the couple. “We did a little sing-song for them,” Gibson said. “They seemed really in love. They were really into each other. And spoke as one. They are like any other couple in life and any other couple who want to get it just so.” Prince Charles had suggested a gospel choir, she said, but Stand By Me had to be exactly right, so she asked Mark De-Lisser, a former Kingdom Choir singer who has worked with Adele and Jessie J, to do the arrangement. “They wanted it done in a very specific way. We got lots of instruction about how it should be performed. They sent us a couple of links, a Tracy Chapman version. They didn’t want it to be too rhythmic and you can hear that in this arrangment. If we were to do it in a strictly gospel style, it would be a lot more florid – they wanted it really stripped back.” That complemented the relative simplicity of the couple’s other decisions, she said: the duchess’s “demure, simple” dress and her subtle makeup. “I think they had a very clear idea of how they wanted the service to go. If we did a full-on gospel number it wouldn’t have worked so well.” Gospel really is spreading. Malone said he has had no trouble finding gospel choirs for his tour, “even in places you wouldn’t expect, like Preston or Newcastle”, and Gibson agrees – one of her community choirs, Gospel on the Rise, performed last night in London and she was out delivering leaflets on Friday. “It’s not mainstream, but you have so many community gospel choirs up and down the country. They’re blowing up, absolutely blowing up,” she said. “People love music. When you add that to the themes of hope, love, joy, healing, redemption - it’s got to affect your spirit. I’ve taught Buddhists, I’ve taught Muslims, I’ve taught witches, and they have absolutely loved it. “Whether you’re a Christian or not, it does something for your spirit. I believe that when you’re singing, the sound comes out and the words go in and if they’re words of joy then they’re going to cause joy. They’re going to bring joy, they’re going to bring peace and healing. they’re going to bring hope. It’s not scientifically tested but I keep seeing the same thing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/27/dan-snow-rewrites-history-female-spitfire-pilots","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T04:59:15Z","webTitle":"Don’t rewrite history, even if you get an awkward Spitfire question | Catherine Bennett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/27/dan-snow-rewrites-history-female-spitfire-pilots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/27/dan-snow-rewrites-history-female-spitfire-pilots","fields":{"headline":"Don’t rewrite history, even if you get an awkward Spitfire question","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"If it’s understood that children are expected, by around eight, to have discovered the reality of Father Christmas (Tooth Fairy and Easter Bunny apostasy may kick in earlier), and to be capable of hearing the goldfish didn’t go to meet the other goldfish in heaven, at what point – a celebrity historian having made the case for this additional myth – should parents reveal that female pilots never flew Spitfires in Second World War dogfights? Too early and you rob these innocents of the pleasure of imagining the women swooping – like Father Christmas’s sled, only deadlier – above a moonless Channel. Too late and, given the ever more complex invention required to sustain the fiction, the children may come to mistrust parents or carers, which is not to dispute the value of their disappointment as a valuable introduction to historiography. Some of us had to wait until we read EH Carr: “Study the historian before you begin to study the facts.” For now, this latest child-rearing dilemma is probably limited to parents emulating Dan Snow, history graduate and battlefield expert. Interviewed for a parenting podcast on how he encourages “a love and interest of history in his children”, Snow explained why concerned parents might sometimes feel – not unlike some Turkish, Chinese, or Holocaust-denying historians – that the past, unembellished, is unworthy of present needs. In his case, a Snow daughter had asked, during a visit to an air museum, why all the Spitfire pilots were male. A useful moment – best get it over with – to mention that opportunities for girls have not always been unlimited? But the historian was reluctant, he says, to expose his daughter to the grim “realities of pre-20th-century gender relations”. It may say more about mainstream feminism than it does about Snow that the equal right to participate in a combat with a life expectancy of four weeks has rarely been an important part of the debate. No wonder it leaves parents who do hanker after martial sacrifice struggling with the facts. Or as Snow puts it: “Having [then] to explain to her why all the pictures of women are of them in ballgowns or in formal dress looking quite wooden and all the pictures of men are of them rampaging around having a great time, being heroic and climbing mountains, shooting things, being soldiers. That is something I struggled with.” Maybe the “night witches”, as the Germans called Russia’s female pilots, operated too far away to help. As for British non-combatants: if women were critical to the war effort, the contributions they were permitted behind front lines, whether in factories or on farms, raising children or working at Bletchley, are perhaps difficult to valorise, even when photographed, from a rampaging point of view. Even the women recruited, after they were judged less conspicuous, by the Special Operations Executive, may therefore appear, from this perspective, less than ideally exuberant. Look, for instance, at Vera Leigh, a former fashion designer, and Diana Rowden, reportedly “a very good shot”, when photographed in uniform a few years before their deaths in a concentration camp. And Violette Szabo: heroic, yes, and executed for it in 1945 – but did she ever rampage? His personal struggle over, Snow found some photographs, online, of women in Spitfires and told his daughter they were Second World War combatants, rather than auxiliaries. “Now at some stage,” he said, “she’s going to learn that I lied to her and she’s going to find out that women weren’t allowed to do active front-line service so I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it.” Even minus a rampaging or shooting element, there is something nearly heroic – aside from its possible implications for his judgment as @thehistoryguy – about the scale of Snow’s ambition, in finessing the evidence of hegemonic masculinity. Any parent planning to follow suit should bear in mind that, for consistency’s sake, the work of inspirational gender reimagining ought to begin well before the Trojan War (the women were inside the horse), take in the Roman Empire (try Trajan’s Column), and only becomes more challenging after the battle of Hastings. Though an absence of female fighters in the Bayeux tapestry could, I suppose, be attributed to their modesty, when they came to record the battle in the fancy needlework at which they also excelled. Later, stress women’s castle-defending in the English Civil War, assert that witches were a small but valued part of the community and emphasise that nowhere, in The Charge of the Light Brigade, does Tennyson explicitly state that no women rode – as, you gather, Snow totally would – into the jaws of Death. Similarly, hidden inside those First World War trenches were many young women, “having a great time”, longing to get blown to pieces. No need to complicate things, by inventing shell-shocked women, or ones shot for desertion, as were 306 British and Commonwealth soldiers. More challenging, surely, pending the big patriarchy reveal, will be protecting the kids from contemporaneous discouragement. “What did that BBC man say about the tennis player, Daddy?” “Who is Carrie Gracie, Daddy?” “Daddy, are women allowed in the Bank of England?” Forget, for now, the Spitfire pilot gender imbalance: what about the one at easyJet? Perhaps, like the man who successfully shuts out post-unification Germany in the film Good Bye, Lenin!, parents really can sustain, for a time, the pretence that political exclusion, Disney princesses, religious laws, the Presidents Club, gender pay gaps and men such as John Inverdale do not exist. Though there might be some difficulty, even within Snow’s peerlessly equal opportunities household, in concealing society’s continued preference for, say, mountaineering and other muscular, male-dominated heroics above endurance in drudgery, and the quieter victories over marginalisation. There being, it emerges, no more eager advocate of the Invictus world view than the history guy himself. • Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/26/victorian-government-pledges-to-introduce-jail-terms-for-wage-theft","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T01:53:01Z","webTitle":"Victorian government pledges to introduce jail terms for wage theft","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/26/victorian-government-pledges-to-introduce-jail-terms-for-wage-theft","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/26/victorian-government-pledges-to-introduce-jail-terms-for-wage-theft","fields":{"headline":"Victorian government pledges to introduce jail terms for wage theft","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Employers could be thrown behind bars for wage theft if the Labor government is re-elected at the November Victorian election. The premier, Daniel Andrews, made the announcement in his speech to party members at the Labor state conference on Saturday. “Whether you’re a convenience store chain or a celebrity chef, if you deliberately and dishonestly underpay your workers, if you deny or deprive them of what is rightfully theirs, you will face jail,” he said. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Employers will face a maximum jail term of 10 years and businesses could be fined up to $950,000. The legal process for ripped-off workers to recover wages will be expedited – court fees will be lowered, cases will be heard within 30 days and the process simplified. There has been increasing concern about wage theft and unions have stepped up campaigning on the issue. The Labor party announcement was welcomed as a “game changer” by United Voice, which represents hospitality workers. The union’s Victorian secretary, Jess Walsh, said the state’s renowned cafe culture was made successful by workers who were “having their wages stolen every day”. “They’re putting employers on notice that they won’t be silent any more. We’ve seen that when workers speak out and name and shame venues, other employers take notice and change their behaviour too. “Making wage theft a crime is a game changer for young hospo workers. The choice will be clear – pay the legal minimum award, or face jail time. Employers won’t be able to just ignore or intimidate their staff when they speak out, because the stakes will be a whole lot higher.” James Lea, a bartender, said the move was long overdue. “Everyone I know who works in hospitality has had wages stolen from them,” he said. Andrews also announced stronger penalties for employers found culpable for workplace deaths. “That doesn’t just mean thousands of dollars in fines, that means millions and it’ll mean jail time – up to 20 years.” There had been 234 workplace deaths in the past decade in Victoria, he said. Employers whose negligence leads to the death of an employee or site visitor will face fines of almost $16m and individuals could face up to 20 years in jail. WorkSafe will be responsible for prosecuting employers. Hundreds of Labor delegates gathered at Moonee Valley Racecourse on Saturday morning for the annual event. On Sunday, the conference will debate about moving Australia Day from 26 January to 9 May, which marks the date federal parliament first met. Three Melbourne councils – Moreland, Yarra and Darebin – have stopped referring to 26 January as Australia Day. The federal government has stripped the latter two of their ability to host citizenship ceremonies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/26/oisin-murphy-derby-breakthrough-roaring-lion","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T11:02:00Z","webTitle":"The Derby 2018: jumps start puts Oisin Murphy on path to breakthrough","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/26/oisin-murphy-derby-breakthrough-roaring-lion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/26/oisin-murphy-derby-breakthrough-roaring-lion","fields":{"headline":"The Derby 2018: jumps start puts Oisin Murphy on path to breakthrough","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Which winning jockey in the Derby at Epsom also rode a winner of the Gold Cup at Cheltenham? It is a trick question, of course, but it will have a fair answer if Oisin Murphy can steer Roaring Lion to victory in the most celebrated Classic of all at Epsom next Saturday. At only 22 Murphy is already established as one of the Flat weighing room’s leading riders and the No 1 jockey for Sheikh Fahad al-Thani’s Qatar Racing. His roots, though, are in jumping, both over National Hunt obstacles and in the show-jumping arena, and his first job in racing was as a stable lad and work rider with his “Uncle Jim” – better known to jump fans as Jim Culloty, one of four winning trainers in the Cheltenham Gold Cup who also won the race as a jockey. “I show-jumped as a child and then when I was 15 I moved in with my Uncle Jim and rode out every morning,” Murphy said at Bath on Friday. “I’d have done the schooling on Lord Windermere [Culloty’s 2014 Gold Cup winner] and also Spring Heeled [the Kim Muir winner] before they won at Cheltenham as novices. “I was never going to be a jump jockey because I was quite small, but I certainly enjoyed my time there and Jim was very good to me. He’s certainly one of the reasons that I am where I am, because it was his idea to send me to England to be an apprentice and he organised for me to go to Aidan O’Brien’s and then Andrew Balding’s. He’s been very good to me.” Murphy attracted plenty of attention before his first Derby ride in 2014, aboard Ed Dunlop’s 100-1 shot Red Galileo, because he was still an apprentice and his only previous experience of Epsom on Classics weekend was as a 17‑year‑old stable lad leading up a runner in the Oaks. Even then, however, he had a composure that marked him out as a potential star, and Dunlop was convinced to book him after watching Murphy’s accomplished ride to land the Group Two Temple Stakes on Hot Streak a fortnight before the Classic. Four years later he is on John Gosden’s 6-1 second-favourite and apparently more matter-of-fact about it than ever. “I’ve ridden in plenty of races where I hoped I’d win and didn’t, so it will be the same,” Murphy says. “I’ve had many disappointments and many good days, and that’s the joys of being a jockey. I’ve ridden favourites in Group Ones and felt before the race that I was on the best horse and things went wrong, and people will feel in this race that Saxon Warrior deserves to be favourite and certainly on the balance of things he should be. But that doesn’t mean I can’t beat him. That’s what I’ll be hoping for, though obviously it’s not a two‑horse race.” Murphy has ridden Group or Grade One winners in Dubai, Canada and France but after 39 attempts he is still waiting for his first success at the highest level in Britain. He came agonisingly close when he was touched off aboard Lightning Spear in last week’s Lockinge Stakes, and there would be no better place to start than Epsom on Derby day. “Roaring Lion was very professional at York and that was his third race of the year, so I’d hope that he’s getting more mature with every run,” Murphy says. “I’ve ridden in these sorts of races frequently now and until I see the draw and the make-up of the race I won’t really think about tactics. Obviously John [Gosden] will have his say and so will Sheikh Fahad, but I could be sat second or I could be sat last, it depends how the race goes. “I’m really looking forward to it because these horses are really hard to find and I might not get as good an opportunity in the race for a long time. But I’m certainly not nervous about it.” Race tips Aidan O’Brien’s Saxon Warrior, who took the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket on his first start of the season, is without doubt the likeliest winner. Saxon Warrior won the first Classic in the style of a middle-distance horse, prevailing despite the one-mile trip and not because of it, and that form gives him the beating of Masar and Roaring Lion. Ryan Moore, his jockey, is the best in the business and O’Brien is aiming to win for the fifth time in seven years. The important question, though, is whether he is as likely a winner as 5-6 would suggest, and at such cramped odds in a big field of lightly raced improvers, there are grounds for suggesting the answer is no. Hazapour, the Leopardstown Derby Trial winner, seems sure to attract support after Frankie Dettori was booked to ride, but his form leaves him plenty to find. That leaves Roaring Lion and Young Rascal as the obvious each-way alternatives, and the surprise here is that Young Rascal, the guaranteed stayer of the pair, is twice the price.At 12-1 each-way, he is the best bet in this year’s Derby field by some distance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/26/england-eddie-jones-front-foot-barbarians","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T21:00:06Z","webTitle":"England’s Eddie Jones looks to get on front foot against Barbarians","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/26/england-eddie-jones-front-foot-barbarians","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/26/england-eddie-jones-front-foot-barbarians","fields":{"headline":"England’s Eddie Jones looks to get on front foot against Barbarians","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The end-of-season encounter with the Barbarians at Twickenham on Sunday will be no frolic for Eddie Jones. The England head coach is smarting from a Six Nations campaign that started positively before three successive defeats dumped the champions into fifth place, their lowest finish in the tournament. The slump has not persuaded Jones that his squad needs an overhaul. While injuries and the unavailability of players from Saracens and Exeter, who were contesting the Premiership final on Saturday, forced him to delve into his supply cupboard for a team to face the Barbarians, he says he knows 70% of the players who will be going to the World Cup next year and that what he needs to assess is the back-up. “We have 22 players currently unavailable and that leaves a hole,” says Jones, who is using this weekend to decide who will replace the injured Cameron Redpath and Jack Willis in the squad for next month’s tour to South Africa. “New guys have an opportunity but it will also be about how the 22 come back. We know our best players and probably our best team but, outside the top 23, players have an opportunity to put up their hands. We are always open to new talent coming through. “Our reflection on the Six Nations has been positive. We have worked out where we can make a difference to the team going forward. Like any team in the world, we need our best players on the field but we are in a position to get back on to the front foot. We had 17 players on last year’s Lions tour and England have never won a Six Nations after one. “History does not keep repeating itself for no reason. A Lions tour is difficult and players feel fatigue at certain stages following one. Some of ours were not at their best during the Six Nations but that does not mean they are not good enough to win the World Cup. “We used the Six Nations to push the players: I wanted to find out if mentally they had a question mark in their head in what was an important period for us going forward. If we were good enough, we would have won but we were not and know what we have to do. The Barbarians is an important game from a selection point of view because you can see how players operate at a higher level.” Jones says he had been focusing in training on set pieces, attack and defence, not to mention the breakdown, the area where England most struggled in the Six Nations. England players who were used to penalties being routinely awarded to the attacking side in the Premiership struggled, as they had for their clubs in Europe, when a contest for possession was encouraged. He is fielding a specialist openside, Tom Curry, against the Barbarians and the Sale flanker is adept at winning turnovers. “Everything we do is geared to winning the World Cup,” says Jones. “I have been frank about that from the start. We finished the Six Nations as the No 1 team in the scrum and the lineout but where did that get us? Usually, set-piece dominance would get you into the top two or three but the way the game has evolved means the breakdown is the most important area. “You have to use the ball in the scrum when the ball reaches the feet of the No 8 and the maul is being refereed completely differently now. That has reinforced the breakdown as a crucial area and we were not great there in the Six Nations. Tom Curry is an out-and-out seven so that improves our personnel while we work on mind-set. Wales seem to have any number of sevens. Why? I don’t know.” Players such as Henry Trinder in the centre, the hooker Jack Singleton and Zach Mercer at No 8 have the opportunity to impress in positions where England are looking for depth, while Elliot Daly is being viewed as the World Cup full-back, but it is an afternoon when a team that has had the turning circle of a cargo ship needs to show it can change course quickly when confronted by the unexpected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/31/alan-davidson-picks-his-all-time-australia-xi","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T11:00:18Z","webTitle":"Alan Davidson picks his all-time Australia XI","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/31/alan-davidson-picks-his-all-time-australia-xi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/31/alan-davidson-picks-his-all-time-australia-xi","fields":{"headline":"Alan Davidson picks his all-time Australia XI","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For such an incredibly difficult job the first decision is straightforward; Mark Schwarzer starts in goal. If I’m allowed a bench then Mark Bosnich is on it just in case, but you can’t go past Australia’s most-capped international, someone involved in so many iconic moments. In defence I’ve got a back four of Lucas Neill, Joe Marston, Craig Moore and Stan Lazaridis. Joe was before my time but he was the original pioneer of Australian football, going overseas and playing in the 1954 FA Cup final for Preston. The other three excelled when the Socceroos were flying, great leaders, all enjoying long club careers at the highest level. I realised later that I hadn’t found room for Paul Okon and almost shuffled things around to include him as a centre-half, but he has to miss out this time I’m afraid. My midfield three has Craig Johnston and Tim Cahill either side of Ned Zelic. Tim picks himself, obviously. Australia’s record goalscorer, he has an amazing ability to score great and crucial goals. In a 4-3-3 you need a player like Ned who can control the game in front of the back four. It’s a shame he didn’t feature more often in green and gold but his class would shine through in a team like this. Craig might seem a controversial choice considering he didn’t play for the Socceroos, but he remains a proud Australian. He beat a path for everyone that came after him in the modern era, achieving more than any one on the world stage playing for Liverpool when they were the best team in Europe. I want to honour that. I think he deserves to be recognised and I think it would be a disaster if Craig wasn’t in this team. It was tough leaving out Johnny Warren – he did so much for the game – as well as Mark Bresciano, who was such a quiet achiever and a terrific role model and mentor. Up front we’ve got goals and creativity with Ray Baartz, Mark Viduka and Harry Kewell. Ray was a great target man in the 1960s and 70s and should now be a superstar but he was badly injured against Uruguay shortly before the 1974 World Cup and his career was cut short. I would have loved to include goal machine Attila Abonyi but you can’t leave out Kewell or Viduka, can you?

The Australian also confirmed it would be a like-for-like replacement rather than a quick fix and dismissed suggestions Gustard’s position on the South Africa tour next month would be undermined by his departure immediately after the three-Test series. Jones has started interviewing potential replacements and all are English. That would appear to rule out two Australians – Brad Davis, currently employed by the Ospreys, and the Scotland defence coach Matt Taylor – while strengthening the chances of Shaun Edwards, Alex Sanderson and Shaun Wane. Edwards, who holds the position with Wales, is preparing for their summer tour while this week the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, said he would reluctantly let Sanderson leave. Wane, meanwhile, will leave Wigan Warriors at the end of the season – the Super League grand final is in October – and has been linked with a switch of codes. Jones watched Wigan’s victory over Castleford last month and yesterday said Gustard’s replacement did not need to be in place before November. Asked if he felt an obligation to appoint an English coach, Jones said: “I am just thinking of the candidates we are interviewing at the moment, they are all English.” Gustard said this week he was going to South Africa out of a sense of obligation after accepting the Harlequins job. “[Gustard] is a committed professional, he is a good guy and I have no doubt he will give 100% for us,” added Jones. One of Gustard’s final assignments – and his last Twickenham appearance under Jones – will be to nullify the threat posed by the Barbarians, not least Chris Ashton, who has been named at fullback following a stunning first season with Toulon in which he scored a record-breaking 26 tries. Ashton is currently unavailable for England as he is based overseas and he has never been capped by Jones – thanks in no small part to two controversial lengthy suspensions. He revealed earlier this week, however, that he is desperate to play for his country again and while he has two more years at Toulon, said, “I still have an open mind”, when asked if he would consider a return to the Premiership. Jones said: “If he comes back and plays, and plays well, then he’s obviously in contention. He’s been playing well. He’s playing in a different position and he’s done some good things in that position. But he’s not a guy in my selection zone at the moment because he’s not eligible.” Opposite Ashton will be Elliot Daly, who gets a rare outing at full-back with Mike Brown switching to the left wing and Danny Cipriani making do with a place on the bench. George Ford and Chris Robshaw are named as co-captains – having also shared the role against the Barbarians last year and Samoa in the autumn. Tom Curry is at openside flanker while there are four uncapped players in the side – the hooker Jack Singleton, the lock Elliott Stooke, the No 8 Zach Mercer and the outside-centre Henry Trinder. Beno Obano may have been a fifth but he was ruled out after a knee injury suffered last week as England’s Brighton curse struck again. Bath confirmed Obano would be out of action for up to a year, having joined Sam Jones, who sustained his career-ending leg injuries during a judo session, Anthony Watson, Jack Nowell and Denny Solomona as injury victims on the south coast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/may/25/uk-council-planners-overworked-underpaid-abused-kevin-mccloud-hay-festival-experts-say","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T10:53:44Z","webTitle":"UK's council planners overworked, underpaid and abused, experts say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/25/uk-council-planners-overworked-underpaid-abused-kevin-mccloud-hay-festival-experts-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/25/uk-council-planners-overworked-underpaid-abused-kevin-mccloud-hay-festival-experts-say","fields":{"headline":"UK's council planners overworked, underpaid and abused, experts say","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Council planners are the most understaffed, underpaid, overworked, abused and depressed workers in Britain, which is a cause for concern because they are responsible for creating and determining the quality of environments we live in, according to a panel of experts at the Hay festival. “The average chief planning officer earns the same salary as a Tesco bakery manager and has done for the past 15 years,” Kevin McCloud, the presenter of Channel 4’s Grand Designs, told an audience at the literary festival in Wales. “The difference is that Tesco has a full complement of bakery managers, whereas across the country our planning departments roughly operate at 50% of what they should be doing, especially after the cuts ... they were a soft target.” McCloud was sharing a stage with the sustainable development entrepreneur Solitaire Townsend and Juliet Davenport, the founder of the company Good Energy. Townsend said she had spent a month in a UK planning department and “it was the tiniest, most understaffed, most underfunded, most depressed group of people I have ever worked with”. Davenport, who once shared office space with Wiltshire county council planners, said: “I always remember one poor girl, she was almost weeping on a daily basis because she was being shouted at constantly. “We should have a bit more sympathy with the planners ... they are so underfunded, they are undertrained, under-equipped to do the job they need to do. Everybody is going to shout at them if they get it wrong.” All this was important, McCloud said, because these people play such a big role in creating quality environments. “Apart from train drivers, they are one of the most responsible jobs in the world. They are hugely important and yet we don’t value them. They’ve had seven years of training and they are so underpaid and poorly respected. We all want to give them a hard time.” He said it was normally a junior member of the department saying no to planning applications because that was quicker and easier than saying yes. The session, titled Small is Beautiful ... Or is it Anymore, was one of a cluster of events that were part of the Hay on Earth Forum exploring food supply and energy production. McCloud also said the UK would be a lot better off if there were a return to council house building on the scale of the 1950s, and that people should spend less time on their phones. “What we should all be doing is putting down our laptops, getting off the social media; we should stop tweeting and we should all go and hug our neighbours,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/25/pray-alexa-church-england-tech-amazon-assistant-anglican","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T11:42:52Z","webTitle":"Alexa, when did the Church of England become so tech-savvy? | Andrew Brown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/25/pray-alexa-church-england-tech-amazon-assistant-anglican","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/25/pray-alexa-church-england-tech-amazon-assistant-anglican","fields":{"headline":"Alexa, when did the Church of England become so tech-savvy?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Thomas Cranmer’s Book of Common Prayer was well ahead of its time when in 1549 it addressed “Almighty God, unto whom all hearts be opened, all desires known, and no secrets hid” – but it would take nearly five centuries for the church to turn this vision into technology. For now there is a Church of England “skill” – a set of canned responses – on Alexa, Amazon’s virtual assistant which can give its answer to 30 religious questions. It doesn’t answer the interesting ones though. “Alexa, ask the Church of England how can I be saved?” produces a silence easily interpreted as baffled, and I don’t think this is because the Church of England long ago decided that I couldn’t be. Religion exists to answer the questions and supply the needs that couldn’t possibly be bought with money. But Alexa is a piece of consumer technology. It exists to make it easy to buy things, listening patiently for you to express a certain kind of wish. What Amazon gets out of this deal is obvious: reliable information about which of its customers are seriously interested in the Church of England; information which can be used to sell them other things. What’s in it for the Church, though? Obviously there is some favourable publicity to be had, in a week when the Sun printed an entire sermon across a double-page spread. There is also the hope that it will reach half-believers, or cultural Christians, who can quickly find their nearest church, or hear a prayer for the day (read by a human being and not a robot). The machine will even say grace before a meal it you ask it to. Why you should want to do so is something Alexa can’t explain. I asked it the great question which opens the Westminster Catechism, one of the foundational documents of puritanism: “Alexa, ask the Church of England what is the chief end of man?”. The correct answer is: “To glorify God and enjoy him forever.” Alexa, though, was silent. That isn’t really surprising. There are all sorts of questions that can reduce the Church of England to silence of polished evasiveness. When I asked “does God exist?”, Alexa didn’t give me an answer. Instead, it talked about what it feels like to believe in God, a rather surreal experience when I remembered that I was talking to a robot. “See. It’s been well briefed!” said the Church’s communications officer. But actually, it’s simpler than that. The program can only respond to trigger words and phrases which it recognises, and then only with formulaic responses. But this shouldn’t be blamed on the Church of England. No large and respectable organisation wants to get into a theological controversy. For a second opinion I asked Google if God exists and the robot voice answered solemnly “everyone has their own opinion about religion”. Religions have always taken advantage of technology: the most obvious example is the spread of printed Bibles when printing was young; but throughout the 19th and 20th centuries Christians, and especially missionaries, made use of innovative techniques to get the message out. The word “propaganda” itself originates from the Vatican, while evangelical Christians worked on hymns that would embed their message in unforgettable tunes. In the 20th century it was the American religious right that invented database marketing, while the merchandising skills of charismatic megachurches are almost up there with Disney’s. But the established churches have been incredibly slow to understand the digital revolution. The online deconstruction of authority which we have seen in politics over the last 10 years is an echo of the same loss of central control that had happened in the big Christian denominations in the years before. Fake news flourished on far-right religious sites before it crossed into the mainstream, and international alliances against the liberal order were being formed to destroy the Anglican communion long before the wider world had heard of Trump, Farage, or even Putin. The Vatican’s website is still a confusing mess, whereas the unofficial websites which agitated for Alfie Evans were slick and forceful. So the emergence of this Church of England Alexa skill really is a surprise. Obviously, everyone else will have to retaliate. The Humanists, the Muslims, the Catholics, the conservative evangelicals and even the Richard Dawkins Foundation will have to launch their own Alexa skills. Google and Siri will get in on the act as well. It’s all invaluable marketing information, after all. The resulting cacophony of canned replies will be indistinguishable from what passes for religious debate online today, but no one will have to type to participate; they can simply speak into the empty air. • Andrew Brown is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/may/27/gente-de-zona-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T12:52:34Z","webTitle":"Gente de Zona review – gleeful spirit of Havana leaves crowd intoxicated","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/27/gente-de-zona-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/27/gente-de-zona-review","fields":{"headline":"Gente de Zona review – gleeful spirit of Havana leaves crowd intoxicated","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Bailando” is the word reverberating off the walls. Translated literally as “dancing”, it’s not only the name of Gente de Zona’s most popular song (and their opener for the show), it also perfectly encapsulates the night’s mood. Before the show has begun, the crowd is already buzzing, waving Cuban flags in the air, clapping their hands and moving their waists in time with the warm-up DJ. If you’ve never heard of the Cuban duo Gente de Zona, they are by any definition a big deal: combining reggaeton with the traditional sounds of mambo and son cubano, the duo are hugely popular in Latin America, their tracks breaking a billion views on YouTube. Judging by their charming stage personas and infectious music, it’s not hard to understand why. At their backs, the soft lilt of the live guitar brilliantly complements the scraping sound of the merengue güiro, and the trumpeters and trombonists deliver a bold, metallic sound that penetrates each melody. During a particularly dynamic performance of Traidora, the guitar’s bass is turned up and the room feels more like a tiny Havana bar than a west London concert venue. The atmosphere is reminiscent of a carnival, complete with the rhythmic sound of bongos and bass that leaves you winded. The only thing missing is the extravagant costumes – the two men wear plain, dark outfits, their musicians in all white – but the revelry remains. They sing in Spanish with playful smiles on their faces, shake their hips at a crowd who shriek excitedly, and lead singer Alexander Delgado stops singing for a brief moment to kiss his co-star Randy Malcom Martinez on the cheek, throwing a wink at the audience. Just as hips begin to tire, the blast of the brass immediately revives them. In the last song, Delgado drapes a giant Cuban flag over his shoulders and repeats the word “Cuba!” – the scream that follows infuses the room with renewed vigour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/16/gardens-what-to-do-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T09:59:42Z","webTitle":"Gardens: what to do this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/16/gardens-what-to-do-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/16/gardens-what-to-do-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Gardens: what to do this week","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Plant this The pretty pincushion flowers of astrantias start blooming this month.

The journalist and author revealed to Axios that he has signed with publisher Henry Holt, who released the first book, for a follow-up. “It’s untitled, unscheduled, unfocused,” he said of its content. But Wolff did add that, as expected: “It’ll obviously deal with American politics at this point in time.” Fire and Fury became a publishing sensation on release in January, selling over 2m copies in the US alone. It came from Wolff’s unprecedented access to Trump’s cabinet, including former strategist Steve Bannon, who spoke critically of the president and his family. Bannon also described a meeting between Donald Trump Jr and a Russian lawyer as “treasonous”. “The book has been authorized … I don’t deny anything from what is inside,” Bannon said in March, claiming that, “not even one person” at the White House had denied anything in the book. He added: “The book is what it is. The reader can judge what he reads.” The administration has openly condemned Wolff’s book. “This is a guy who made up a lot of stories to try to sell books, and I think more and more people are starting to see that his facts just simply don’t add up,” the press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said. Trump himself has also tweeted repeatedly about his feelings, referring to Wolff as a “discredited author” and a “total loser”. “I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book!” he tweeted. “I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist. Look at this guy’s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!” Fire and Fury is also set to be turned into a TV series with ex-BBC chief Michael Jackson picking up the rights in a reported seven-figure deal.

Gena Turgel, who survived the Kraków ghetto, a death march, Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, spent much of her life teaching British schoolchildren about the horrors of the Holocaust. Karen Pollock, the chief executive of the Holocaust Education Trust, said Turgel was “the most beautiful, elegant and poised lady. Her strength, determination and resilience were unwavering, her powerful and wise words an inspiration. “Gena dedicated her life to sharing her testimony to hundreds of thousands in schools across the country. Her story was difficult to hear and difficult for her to tell, but no one who heard her speak will ever forget. A shining light has gone out today and will never be replaced.” Turgel was 16 when the Nazis bombed her home town of Kraków, Poland, in September 1939. Two years later, she, her mother and four of her nine siblings moved to the ghetto, with only a sack of potatoes, some flour and a few personal belongings. One brother was shot by the SS in the ghetto; another fled and was never seen again. A sister and her husband were shot after being caught trying to smuggle food into the Płaszów labour camp. In the winter of 1944-45, Turgel, her mother and sister were sent to Auschwitz. Later she and her mother were forced to join a death march, leaving behind the sister, whom they never saw again. They eventually arrived at Bergen-Belsen, where Turgel worked in a hospital. “When I arrived in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, I saw heaps of bodies lying around. Not just one or two but mountains as high as a tree in the garden,” she told the Sun in 2015. “You could not distinguish if they were men or women – bones, skeletons, children’s bodies. You can’t possibly imagine the state of the place, it was horrendous.” She helped care for Anne Frank, who was dying from typhus. “She was delirious, terrible, burning up. I gave her cold water to wash her down,” Turgel said. “We did not know she was special, but she was a lovely girl. I can still see her lying there with her face, which was so red as she had a breakout. And then she died.” On 15 April 1945, the British army liberated Bergen–Belsen. Among the soldiers was Norman Turgel, whom Gena married six months later wearing a wedding dress made from a British army parachute – now in the Imperial War Museum in London. The British press called her the Bride of Belsen. Jonathan Sacks, a former chief rabbi, said Turgel was “one of the most remarkable Holocaust survivors I had the privilege to know”. He said: “She was a blessing and inspiration to our community. Her work to educate generations about the horrors of the Holocaust was as powerful as it was tireless. Throughout her life, she lit countless candles in the human heart and helped bring much light to the world.” Turgel’s memoir, I Light a Candle, was published in 1987."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jun/08/former-congo-leader-jean-pierre-bemba-wins-war-crimes-appeal-international-criminal-court","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T16:03:40Z","webTitle":"Jean-Pierre Bemba's war crimes conviction overturned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jun/08/former-congo-leader-jean-pierre-bemba-wins-war-crimes-appeal-international-criminal-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jun/08/former-congo-leader-jean-pierre-bemba-wins-war-crimes-appeal-international-criminal-court","fields":{"headline":"Jean-Pierre Bemba's war crimes conviction overturned","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The former Congolese vice-president, Jean-Pierre Bemba, has had his convictions for war crimes and crimes against humanity overturned. The appeals chamber of the international criminal court in the Hague decided by a majority on Friday to acquit the former politician following an earlier hearing. The 55-year-old warlord commanded a militia that committed mass murder, rape and pillage in neighbouring Central African Republic, the court ruled at the end of his original trial in 2016. The verdicts were considered a legal landmark, since it was the first time the ICC had convicted a defendant of either rape or “command responsibility for the actions of their troops”. According to a legal principle established by other UN tribunals, a commander can be found responsible for failing to take action to stop crimes he knows are being committed by subordinates. There were cheers from Bemba’s supporters in the gallery when the appeal decision was announced by the five-judge panel, headed by judge Christine Van den Wyngaert. Bemba had been found guilty of two counts of crimes against humanity (murder and rape) and three counts of war crimes (murder, rape, and pillaging) committed in CAR between October 2002 and March 2003. His troops had entered the country to prop up the president, Ange-Félix Patassé, who was eventually ousted. He was subsequently sentenced to 18 years in prison. His appeal was against both the sentence and the verdicts. Bemba, who fled the Democratic Republic of the Congo after losing a presidential poll, was arrested in Belgium in 2008 and transferred to the ICC’s detention centre in The Hague. His trial started in November 2010 and lasted four years. It heard from 77 witnesses. His defence lawyers insisted he had no control over his 1,500 troops. “There is not a single documentary piece of evidence that shows any orders passing from Bemba and going to his troops in Central African Republic,” his lawyer Kate Gibson said in her closing argument at the original trial. Bemba will remain in custody on account of another case in which he was convicted of offences against the administration of justice, the ICC said in a statement. In a majority opinion supported by three of the five judges, the ICC appeals chamber said the trial court had “erroneously convicted Bemba for specific criminal acts that were outside the scope of the charges as confirmed” The court added: “The trial chamber erred in its evaluation of Bemba’s motivation and the measures that he could have taken in light of the limitations he faced in investigating and prosecuting crimes as a remote commander sending troops to a foreign country.” Two of the five judges, Sanji Mmasenono Monageng and Piotr Hofmański, issued a dissenting judgment upholding the convictions. The ruling will be considered carefully by other UN war crimes tribunals which have faced similar disputes over legal definitions of the command responsibilities held by generals and senior politicians in charge of troops who commit mass rapes, murders and other offences. Fiona McKay, a former ICC official now working for the Open Society Justice Initiative, said: “This was the first ICC case with a major focus on the use of rape as a weapon of war and testing the notion of command responsibility. The acquittal decision is a major blow to the ICC prosecutor’s office, given the vast resources that have been devoted to this case, which has lasted for more than 10 years.” Rupert Skilbeck, director of thr UK based human rights group Redress, said: “This is a devastating outcome for the more than five thousand victims who participated in the trial and had waited 15 years to see justice done and to receive some form of redress for their suffering. “Some victims contracted HIV after being gang-raped by MLC soldiers. Others were rejected by their families and ostracised by their communities, and many have been left to fend for themselves, without access to basic antiretroviral drugs, psychological or economic support.” The ICC’s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, said she regretted the “troubling” decision. “Today’s judgement does not deny that Mr Bemba’s troops committed the crimes which resulted in great suffering in the Central African Republic at their hands,” she said. “The carnage and suffering caused by those crimes were very real, and they are recognised. “From the outset of our investigations, my office has worked tirelessly, with the plight of the victims foremost on our minds and guided our actions, and will continue to do so.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/08/the-guardian-view-on-labour-and-brexit-too-timid-too-tactical","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T16:14:06Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Labour and Brexit: too timid, too tactical | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/08/the-guardian-view-on-labour-and-brexit-too-timid-too-tactical","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/08/the-guardian-view-on-labour-and-brexit-too-timid-too-tactical","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Labour and Brexit: too timid, too tactical","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If Labour followed Napoleon’s advice never to interrupt an enemy who is making a mistake, it would never speak of Brexit. It has sometimes felt as if this is the opposition strategy: letting the Conservatives stew in their own calamity, avoiding engagement with the issue except when forced to say something. Events of the past week demonstrate the pattern. Labour has tabled an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill calling on the government to retain every benefit of membership of the single market. This is advertised as seeking “the softest possible Brexit”. This is a welcome new tone, but the aspiration for seamless trade with Europe is uncontroversial. The problem, as Theresa May has discovered, is the impossibility of achieving that goal while rejecting obligations of membership – contributions to EU budgets; acceptance of European court arbitration; free movement of people. The implication of Labour’s new line is that it would compromise on those points, yet the front bench is shy about saying so. What is billed as new policy is largely a rhetorical swerve, forced on the opposition by changes to the withdrawal bill in the House of Lords. Many opposition MPs support a peers’ amendment urging membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), which would keep the UK in the single market. A bunch of Tory MPs like that model, too, which makes it possible that the government could be forced to obey. Instead, Labour whips will split the soft Brexit vote, letting Mrs May off the hook. Why? A reasonable argument is that the EEA is an imperfect, off-the-shelf model that would lock the UK into too subordinate a relationship with Brussels, and that Labour cannot be seen to settle for such a mediocre deal. A fuller explanation includes divisions in the party on a range of Brexit issues: immigration control; the feasibility of another referendum; whether or not the single market is an impediment to a radical left economic programme. Those tensions are in part ideological, but also reflect the awkward electoral calculus for a party whose members are broadly pro-European but whose seats in parliament include many leave-voting areas. So Jeremy Corbyn combines deference to the referendum outcome with reluctance to sound too enthusiastic about Brexit. It is not an easy balance. The longer this goes on, the likelier it gets that frustration and disillusionment build on all sides. A year has passed since last year’s election and Labour has not built on the momentum it gathered then. Ambiguity around Mr Corbyn’s Brexit instincts was an advantage when leavers and remainers could each think their needs might be met by Labour. That effect is wearing off. A difference now is that departure day is much closer and Mrs May’s methods have brought the process to a murky impasse. Tory squabbling this week shows yet again how the prime minister is hemmed in by fanatics in her party. Michel Barnier, the commission’s chief negotiator, on Friday sounded justifiably dismissive of the government’s latest incoherent customs proposal. Labour has accepted the logic of maximum integration with the single market and customs union, thereby usurping terrain of economic rationality vacated by the government. But Mr Corbyn looks too often as if he has been bounced into sensible EU stances. When Labour does the right thing on Brexit it squanders the advantage by doing it gradually, almost reluctantly. The defence of that approach is that, on such a fissile subject, the opposition is better off lying low, avoiding upsetting people and waiting for the Tories to fail. That approach isn’t working, perhaps because it views Brexit through a narrow lens of party advantage when the crisis is of national dimensions. The vacancy is for politicians who will be unflinchingly honest about the difficulties ahead, the shape of the compromises required, and their cost. It is not enough to be ready, for the sake of party cohesion, to shuffle towards “the softest possible Brexit”.

However, in one of the boldest investigative stories of recent years, Hungarian film-maker Bernadett Tuza-Ritter’s shocking film shows, in almost full view, the exhaustion of being entrapped as a slave and what it takes to get out of it. The bravery in front of and behind the camera deserve high praise. The documentary will surely be used in anti-slavery campaigning in Hungary and beyond in the EU, and it deserves the widest audience. Marish, the captured woman of the title, has been an unpaid domestic worker for a woman named as Eta in the film for 10 years. Aged 53 but looking at least 25 years older, Marish has been separated from her family and friends, and stripped of her possessions and dignity. Psychologically broken, she is all facial lines, skinny bones, painful body and utter resignation when we first meet her. But in the 18 months during which Tuza-Ritter follows her, her confidence grows and her awareness of the brutality of Eta and her family becomes stronger and more intolerable. Eta and her brattish family are only heard off screen. It was a condition of their agreeing to the film being made, but the technique only lends them an even more sinister air. They are hard taskmasters with voices from the ether, and we’re left to imagine what these monsters must look like. Petty grievances over the amounts of sugar in coffee carry the threat of physical violence. Every moment has to be accounted for. Marish has been forced to take out loans on behalf of the family. This is a deeply abusive relationship. Tuza-Ritter, at least to begin with, was a novice on issues of modern slavery, and it’s probably for that exact reason that her observational filming is so bold. Having met Eta by chance, and effectively paid her for Marish’s screen time, we suspect that even she didn’t initially realise the cruel scale of what she had uncovered. A more experienced film-maker or campaigner, or one working less independently, might have been more cautious about going alone into a slave house, but this one just keeps going, asking Marish unintentionally naive questions to which she responds with shocking frankness. Early on, as Marish goes to her early morning day job (she also earns money for Eta), she casually tells the story of how her daughter was lost to her because of the cruelty of her “owner”. This level of trauma is almost unwatchable. Some films might have stopped at the point at which the director discovered the misery of Marish’s life, or turned into a legal procedural in which the authorities attempt to free the slave. But, even though we never hear her voice or off-camera opinion, we feel Tuza-Ritter senses a growing trust from Marish, and subtly encourages her to think about another life. Marish begins to tell secrets about her hopes and plans, and the act of saying them out loud starts a chain of rebellion. Early in the film, Marish is clear that there is no one to help her and nowhere to go. Watching her say this, we know it isn’t true – Tuza-Ritter and ourselves as viewers are there and we’re desperate to help. It’s amazing what someone simply paying you attention and listening to you can do. The arrogance of Eta, in allowing a documentary-maker to film her slave, with no suspicion that it might expose her, backfires on her spectacularly. Marish eventually becomes a hero in joyous fashion, and the depths of harrowing suffering in the first half of the film are surpassed many times over by the euphoric state in which she ends the film. This is far from an an uplifting watch, but it does surprisingly end with some hope. And it is wonderfully constructed, as well as being beautifully shot for a film made in such extreme conditions. This is the story of one woman’s dangerous bid for freedom, empowered by a documentary-maker without whom she would have remained lost, remarkably captured as it happened at close quarters. Beyond the personal, though, it is a much bigger story about an EU member state where slaves can openly be captured and worked to physical and mental exhaustion, and where there is no effective law for preventing it. The film is an outstanding personal and social-justice achievement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/08/wales-recall-rhys-patchell-first-test-argentina-rugby-union","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T15:09:14Z","webTitle":"Wales pluck Rhys Patchell from the wilderness to hunt Pumas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/08/wales-recall-rhys-patchell-first-test-argentina-rugby-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/08/wales-recall-rhys-patchell-first-test-argentina-rugby-union","fields":{"headline":"Wales pluck Rhys Patchell from the wilderness to hunt Pumas","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rhys Patchell makes his first start for Wales since his uncomfortable evening at Twickenham in February when the swagger he had shown against Scotland the week before melted into uncertainty after the fly-half had been verbally targeted by the England head coach, Eddie Jones. Dan Biggar and Gareth Anscombe have each twice worn the No 10 jersey since then but – with the former moving from Ospreys to Northampton and so curtailing his availability for the national side, and the latter not as adept as Patchell at getting his backline moving – the Scarlet has another opportunity 15 months out from the World Cup with the Wales head coach, Warren Gatland, using the two Tests against Argentina to assess his options. “Rhys started the Six Nations well, but found the step up against England a bit of a challenge,” Gatland said. “I don’t think it was down to the pressure but the intensity. We told him to get back on the horse quickly and he will be better for the experience, which I hope to see on Saturday.” Anscombe played in the victory against South Africa in Washington last weekend without suggesting he was an upgrade on Biggar, one of several Lions Gatland has rested this summer. Patchell has fellow Scarlets inside and outside with Wales looking to profit from the familiarity as they develop their expansive game. Patchell needs an inexperienced forward pack to deliver. Gatland has chosen an eight with a combined cap total of 65, six fewer than the Argentina captain, Agustín Creevy. It is a bold selection in a country renowned for its set-piece prowess, but the Pumas no longer play 10-man rugby and, despite a dismal record since reaching the semi-final of the last World Cup, they are heartened by the performance of the Jaguares in Super Rugby this year. The Jaguares are on course for the play-offs after six successive wins and 14 of the starting lineup on Saturday played in the side’s last match, a 29-13 victory against the Sharks. The one exception, the former Leicester flanker Pablo Matera, was unavailable for that game. “We must take advantage of all the good that has been done by the Jaguares,” said the Argentina coach, Daniel Hourcade, who has not enjoyed a notable success since victory against South Africa two years ago. “Wales will study us not on how we played in November but on Super Rugby so we must provide an element of surprise.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/23/blind-date-joab-polly","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"Blind date: ‘What was I hoping for?

How unappreciated does something have to be before you consider it lost? Also, lost to whom? As a Virago author, I am proudly, painfully aware that my book was paid for – literally and figuratively – by the art of women who are now dead. There wouldn’t be a taste for the kind of gothic body-horror in my debut, Promising Young Women, had Angela Carter not been serving it under a cloche in the mid-80s. There wouldn’t be a space for female humour if Nancy Mitford hadn’t carved it out with a scalpel. There wouldn’t be a thirst for workplace romances if Charlotte Brontë hadn’t drawn up the template for them. My first book was written by telling all these women – and many others – to turn around so I could smooth my paper between their shoulder blades. And yet, all of my favourite authors went through a period of lostness before they were picked up by some gutsy publisher. In many cases, that publisher was Virago: in 1978, Virago Modern Classics set out to publish either women who were out of print, or whose work didn’t get the respect it deserved, and changed the literary landscape in the process. There are writers who are beloved within their niche, who have thriving fanbases, but still might not have a single book in Waterstones. Are they lost? Lost until someone finds them, I guess. But lost, as a status, is a transient one. The following books have all endured some kind of success, some kind of loss, and at least a few of them will have you saying: “What do you mean, lost? I saw that in an airport WH Smith!” To this, I have no answer. These are simply the books that I want to push into people’s hands, that they might not find elsewhere. The books, you’ll realise, that your library was lost without. 1. Kindred by Octavia Butler This is often cited as the first science fiction published by a black woman, but you don’t need to put Kindred in the category of “firsts” to find it brilliant. It follows 26-year-old Dana, a black woman moving in with her white boyfriend, who is periodically sent back in time to a pre-civil war Maryland plantation. Here, she’s forced to protect her distant white relatives from destruction while they abuse her and other slaves. It is the marker you should judge all other time-travelling narratives by. 2. Home Cooking by Laurie Colwin I have limited interest in adjectives, and food writing is full of them. Even good food writing I find hard going. Or at least, I did, until someone gifted me this slim little paperback. It’s full of gross references to 80s food, such as creamed spinach. Regardless, it’s a tragicomic exploration of life and friendship through food, something every food writer wants to achieve, but Colwin truly pulled out of the bag. 3. Are You Somebody? by Nuala O’Faolain I had always wondered, when reading Nora Ephron, if Ireland ever had an equivalent. Someone witty and female who would not only call a spade a spade but acknowledge the blade, the handle and the funny way it sticks out of the earth. Recently, I discovered that person in Nuala O’Faolain. Her memoir Are You Somebody? is equal parts hilarious, tragic and wonderfully gossipy. “Years after I was in Hull, Philip Larkin apologised. ‘I was asked to look out for you,’ he said. ‘But I’m afraid I couldn’t be bothered.’” 4. Passing by Nella Larsen Passing is one of those books you’re either obsessed with, or have never heard of. A gem of the Harlem Renaissance, it follows two black women, the married Irene and the beautiful Clare, who has committed to a life of “passing” as white and is now homesick for the culture she abandoned. There were thousands of “tragic mulatto” narratives being peddled in Larsen’s day, and most of them had a very similar arc: light-skinned black girl tries to “become white”, fails, is rejected by both cultures and dies tragically. Most of them are worth leaving in the cultural dust. Passing both follows the genre and subverts it completely, its use of Irene as narrator making it a compelling psychological drama as well as an investigation of race and class in Harlem in the early 20th century. 5. Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady by Florence King Republican, southern, and gay, King was the definition of an equal-opportunities hater. She was the Dorothy Parker of the American south, and because Dorothy Parker figures are much better suited to chic cocktail bars than they are to sweltering wraparound porches, she has largely flown under the radar. In her own words, “even my different drummer had a different drummer”. 6. One Pair of Feet by Monica Dickens This wartime nurse may have been a descendant of Charles Dickens, but she had very little interest in feigning compassion at the discomfort of others. This reads more like a diary than a memoir, with none of the usual ego and self-preservation of autobiography. 7. Dolly City by Orly Castel-Bloom When a book’s very first page includes the butchering and eating of a pet goldfish, you know you’re in for a bumpy ride. Baby stealing, grave-digging, pet-eating, Holocaust jokes – you name it, this Tel Aviv nightmare has it. A cult classic about motherhood and, in particular, Jewish motherhood, Dolly City is horrifyingly dark yet ceaselessly comic. 8. Angel by Elizabeth Taylor It took me becoming a Virago author to finally understand that there are two very different Elizabeth Taylors. Angel is the story of a teenage girl with a preternatural taste for melodrama who ends up writing a bestseller whose success baffles even her publishers. You can’t help but think that it’s a sly wink from Taylor, who wrote a score of books and dozens of short stories, toward the industry as a whole. 9. The Young Visiters by Daisy Ashford What better way to fill the ninth spot on this list that with an author who was actually nine when she wrote her book? What’s fascinating about the story is that, while it was written by a child, it is definitely not a children’s book. It’s a serious society novel, and takes itself hugely seriously. It ends up being an unwitting parody not only of literature, but of adults as a class of people. “Bring three glasses of champaigne commanded the prince and some ices he added majestikally. The goods appeared as if by majic and the prince drew out a cigar case and passed it round. “One grows weary of Court Life he remarked. “Ah yes agreed the earl.” 10. The Brontës Went to Woolworths by Rachel Ferguson “I was so rasped with life that I hit Goldsmith’s tomb with my umbrella. I said, ‘I’d give five pounds if somebody’d come along and tell us both how clever we are.’” At a certain point, you’re going to run out of Mitford novels to reread. Fear not, good sister, because if wry, absurd novels about posh sisters are your drugs of choice, this is your crack.

The party’s spring conference overwhelmingly supported calls for Scottish ministers to set up a publicly funded infrastructure agency after the Guardian disclosed new evidence that firms in offshore tax havens invest heavily in Scottish government-sponsored building projects. Research for the Guardian and the Ferret website found offshore firms stand to earn more than £1.7bn from contracts to build and run 47 new hospitals, motorway upgrades, schools, health centres and colleges overseen by an agency set up by the SNP government, the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT). The SFT uses a less costly form of private financing than previous methods, but Scottish government data shows those 47 schemes will cost £2.7bn to build. Once their financing and maintenance costs are included, the total bill will rise to £8bn over the next 30 years. Scottish taxpayers have still to pay off about £20bn from earlier and more costly private finance initiative schemes initiated in the 1990s by the Conservatives, and then used heavily by Labour, and in some part by the SNP. Anne McLaughlin, a former MSP, told the party conference that the public infrastructure company suggested by the pro-Scottish independence CommonWeal thinktank would be “democratically accountable”. It would keep these building projects “in the public sector for the public good”, she said. In a further vote, the conference also urged public sector pension funds to invest in a proposed new Scottish investment bank being set up by ministers in Edinburgh which focused on ethical projects and “the public good”. The Guardian also revealed that public sector pension funds run by 14 English and Scottish councils, and one for the Environment Agency, have invested hundreds of millions of pounds in SFT projects that are controlled by offshore companies. Dave Watson, head of policy for the public sector union Unison Scotland and an expert in pensions, said ministers could already insist that public pension funds sign up to the “fair tax mark” which prevented them from investing in tax avoidance schemes. “It is simply wrong that public money and our members pension contributions should be invested in tax avoidance mechanisms. Billions of pounds of revenue are lost every year that could have been invested in vital public services,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/jun/09/for-the-record-observer-corrections","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T23:04:35Z","webTitle":"For the record","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/09/for-the-record-observer-corrections","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jun/09/for-the-record-observer-corrections","fields":{"headline":"For the record","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Marina Kostalevsky is editor, not co-editor, of the new volume of Tchaikovsky letters (“Tchaikovsky and the secret gay loves censors tried to hide”, News, last week, page 15).

The biggest mysteries of 2018 – so far","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It has been 74 days, 14 minutes and 23 seconds since the world first learned that someone once bit Beyoncé. However, despite the internet’s best efforts to discover the culprit, the mystery of #WhoBitBeyoncé remains stubbornly unsolved. It’s not just Beyoncé’s biter befuddling us all: we’re less than halfway through the year but already 2018 has raised more questions than it has answered. Here are some of the weirdest unsolved mysteries of the year so far. The mystery of the vanishing water bottle We know Trump is terrified of sharks, but is the president petrified of water? An incident at the Weird House this week suggests this might be the case. During a Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) hurricane preparedness meeting on Wednesday, Trump inexplicably took his water bottle off the table and put the offending object on the floor. A split second later an apparently H2O-phobic Mike Pence did the same. While the other people around the table did not bat an eyelid at this behaviour, the internet was immediately intrigued. What was going on? The most generous explanation is that step one of hurricane preparedness is removing all table-standing water bottles to the safety of the floor, and Trump and Pence were simply attentive students. Another theory is that Trump is playing three-dimensional chess with water bottles and this stunt, which went viral, is a genius move designed to distract us from the real issues. Alternatively, one might consider the idea that nothing Trump does makes sense, and Pence is an obsequious pawn who does anything his master does. Why was there a festering sock-sack in the White House? No, I’m not talking about Steve Bannon. On 17 May, Saagar Enjeti, a White House correspondent for the Daily Caller, tweeted a photo of a ziplock bag stuffed full of wet socks that, inexplicably, was lying on the floor of the White House briefing room. Five days later, he tweeted another picture of the socks which, it seems, hadn’t been claimed. I contacted Enjeti this week to find out if there had been further developments and he informed me that the socks seem to have gone. One hopes, to a far better place. Why do human feet keeping washing up in Canada? In May a severed foot inside a hiking shoe washed up on the shores of British Columbia. This was the 14th human foot since 2007 to be discovered on the coastline. Over the years there have been various theories regarding the feet: a serial killer, a mafia calling card, something to do with the new series of Twin Peaks. The mostly likely hypothesis, though, is modern footwear. Most of the feet found are sneakers; their robust but lightweight material protecting a foot from decomposing, while pulling the foot towards shore. But who knows, in the future we may find it was all a grim guerrilla marketing campaign for a new type of Air Max. Where was Melania? The first lady recently spent almost a month out of the public eye, sparking fervent rumours about her whereabouts. However, she reappeared this week, as Trump has vociferously pointed out. On Wednesday the president tweeted that that the media: “Reported everything from near death, to facelift, to left the WH (and me) for NY or Virginia, to abuse. All Fake, she is doing really well!” Later on Wednesday Melania Trump sat next to her husband at the Fema hurricane briefing where she did not appear fazed by the bizarre water bottle maneuverings. “She went through a little rough patch but she’s doing great,” Trump announced at the briefing. Of all the bizarre things to have happened in 2018, Melania going missing is probably the least mysterious. Hearing nonstop news about your husband’s affair with porn stars, coupled with having to undergo kidney surgery, certainly constitutes a “rough patch”. So while Melania’s whereabouts for a month may remain a mystery, her motives from disappearing from the public gaze are not. Who bit Beyoncé? In March, the actor Tiffany Haddish told GQ magazine that she once saw a fellow celebrity bite Beyoncé on the face at a party. The internet immediately dropped everything it was doing and started a crazed search for the mysterious biter. A shortlist of suspects was immediately drawn up and elite task forces created to investigate the issue. Chrissy Teigen told US Weekly that people have “honestly texted me mood boards about this, like actually full CSI, with pictures of actresses connected with red string as to where in the country they were that night.” It was quickly decided that Sanaa Lathan, from Love &amp; Basketball fame, was the culprit. Lathan, however, denied these rumours. The case of #WhoBitBeyonce remains open. Why was Kim Jong-un’s letter to Trump so large? Earlier this month Trump was presented with a letter from North Korea’s Kim Jong-un which came in an extremely large envelope. No one is sure why the envelope was so large, however some believe it was an attempt to make Trump’s hands look small. We’re also not clear what was in the envelope, although White House officials have confirmed that Trump has read its contents. Perhaps we will know more next week: Trump is meeting with Kim in Singapore on 12 June. No doubt he will use the occasion to inform Kim that he too has envelopes in his stationary cupboard, and they are much bigger and more powerful than his. Did the audioclip say Yanni or Laurel? Actually, that wasn’t a mystery at all. It’s obviously Laurel. Why was a car dangling from a Toronto bridge? Last month a burned-out Honda Civic was found dangling from a bridge in Toronto. It was quickly lowered to the ground by the fire department but nobody knows why it was there. A preliminary theory, that it was a prop for a movie shoot, was quickly retracted and the case still isn’t solved.

So, to discover in a report released on World Oceans Day that mussels bought from UK supermarkets were infested with microplastic seems like a final irony in the terrible story of the plasticisation of the sea. According to the study by the University of Hull and Brunel University London, 70 particles of microplastic were found in every 100 grams of mussels. There’s a vital disconnection here – highlighted by the bottled water you drink to wash down your moules-frites, and the fact that 89% of ocean trash comes from single-use plastic. No sea is immune from this plague, nor any ocean creature, from the modest mussel or zooplankton to the great whales. I have just returned from Cape Cod, where, due to pollution and other anthropogenic effects, the North Atlantic right whale may be extinct by 2040 – a huge mammal about to vanish from the sight of the shores of the richest, most powerful nation on Earth. On the pristine, remote Cisco Beach on Nantucket, I watched a grey seal watching me – only to realise the sleek pelage of its midriff was bound with an orange plastic bag. Last month, off St Ives in Cornwall, I saw a cormorant tugging helplessly at a monofilament of fishing line that had trussed its bill to its arched neck. The underwater photographer Andrew Sutton sends a selfie from Costa Rica: he is holding miles of illegal plastic long line, tangled like a grotesque bouquet. From Sri Lanka to the Mediterranean, our summer holiday idylls become places of mortality. That we cannot look underneath what Herman Melville called “the ocean’s skin” is part of the problem. It is as if, defeated by the sea’s mystery, we punish it for defying our dominion. And so, it wreaks its revenge, feeding our own rubbish back to us. Shakespeare’s Ariel looked down into the ocean and saw “something rich and strange”; we look down and see our consuming society reflected back at us."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/16/richard-powers-interview-overstory","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T09:00:41Z","webTitle":"Richard Powers: ‘It was like a religious conversion.

Hokey attractions line the route – theme parks, rollercoasters, mini-golf – in a shock of honkytonk tourism that ends only at the gateway to the national park. “Why would you come to the Smokies and think, ‘What I really want is a Ripley’s Believe It or Not?’” says Richard Powers, “There’s more believe-it-or-not here than there is in that place!” The three-mile hike to Albright Grove, which contains some of the park’s oldest surviving forest, is a plunge into mysteries science has barely begun to fathom. It is also a family visit of sorts. Powers is calling on the relatives who populate his latest work, The Overstory. As a botanist in his story explains, trees and humans share a common ancestor, and a quarter of their genes. “For five years I’ve been telling people I’m writing a novel about trees,” he says, with a smile, “and they’ve said: ‘Really?’” At 60, with numerous accolades, including a National book award (for The Echo Maker), Powers has long earned the right to tackle any subject he pleases. Over a 30-year career his invigorating intellect has scoured artificial intelligence and virtual reality (Galatea 2.2, Plowing the Dark), music and genetics (Orfeo, The Goldbug Variations). Whether neuroscience or nuclear warfare, the result is usually a profound new take on what it means to be alive. He has been described as “the best novelist you’ve never heard of” for so many years that ignorance is no longer much of an excuse. At the moment, however, this softly spoken man is enjoying his role as forest guide. His wry self-titled “smells of the Smokies” tour includes regular stops to rub leaves and scratch bark. A yellow birch gives off woozy waves of muscle relaxant (“wintergreen!”); rare sourwood avoided the settlers’ axe, because it made great honey. Sassafras has him particularly excited. “Delightful isn’t it, and somewhat familiar? Put it in a glass with bubbles and a couple of ice cubes … root beer!” Powers hadn’t particularly considered trees until his first encounter with a giant redwood a few years ago, while he was in California teaching on Stanford’s creative writing fellowship course. “When they’re as wide as a house and as tall as a football pitch you don’t have to be particularly sensitive to be wowed by it,” he says. “But once I started looking, I realised it’s not about the size and scale … it’s that I’ve been blind to these amazing creatures all the time.” The result was, in his own words, a “religious conversion”: not in the theistic sense, but in the sense of “being bound back into a system of meaning that doesn’t begin and end with humans”. He had addressed environmental issues before in The Echo Maker, but this time was different. “‘Environmentalism’ is still under the umbrella of a kind of humanism: we say we should manage our resources better. What I was taking seriously for the first time in this book was: they’re not our resources; and we won’t be well until we realise that.” With scientific precision, Powers’s new novel portrays the interconnected lives trees lead. Their behaviour – the ways they help and provide for each other, and other living things too numerous to count – is a direct rebuke to the way we live today. It would be easy, watching him identify the plants, fungi and mosses around him, to think he had been a botanist all his life, as opposed to a man who spent a frustrating 12 months learning to tell oak from ash. But then Powers’s ability to absorb and comprehend a subject is one of the cornerstones of his writing. He has been a dedicated “generalist” since he was a child, one of five siblings born to a school principal and his wife in Illinois. “I was curious about everything and every year was another passion,” he recalls. “When I reached 16 and it came time to start specialising, I felt a constant panic. I remember freshman year in college I had a pit in my stomach the whole year. I ended up actually checking into the clinic – I thought I had ulcers or something.” Powers studied physics, believing it would allow him to explore the big picture of life. It didn’t, nor did a master’s in literature, where specialisations became increasingly esoteric: “That’s when I pulled the ripcord and got out of academia.” There followed an identity crisis where he worked as a computer operator and programmer. “It wasn’t me, but it at least prevented me from having to commit to who me was.” Once he had his idea for his first novel – Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance, published in 1985 – a career in which he could pursue his myriad interests became possible. “I thought here it is: if I can get away with this then the possibilities for the self-reinvention are endless.” Professorial in manner, Powers may quote Mikhail Bakhtin and Bruno Latour, and be unable to stop himself comparing a page in his hiking guide to a phase diagram of crystallisation, but he engages with the world with patience and modesty. His intellect has, however, sometimes been offputting to critics who have claimed to find a lack of warmth in his writing. “Some say my characters are always geniuses,” he says. “They’re not, they just happen to have a passion, a way of organising the world, that may or may not be familiar to the readers. If someone’s walking through the woods and says, ‘I need a whiff of that sassafras,’ it tells you something about them.” His use of personal occupation as a form of characterisation is one of the aspects of his writing he is most proud of. “It’s not hot-blooded like jealousy, rage, envy, love, but for me it’s a more genuine, robust picture of who we are because for most of us our vocations shape us deeply.” He explains that he has “tried to do this slightly different thing of dramatising philosophical issues knowing that the novel of ideas [has] had its day, and that day is not now. So there’s always this compromise: how do you tell a story of intellectual passion while making it warm enough to be accessible?” In the case of The Overstory, a documentary about environmental activists from the Redwood Summer of 1990 – when guerrilla groups mobilised against the logging of California’s giant sequoias – inspired its core drama. Those who get too caught up in the human narrative, however, are in danger of missing the larger fabulist elements. Powers cites a recent review that categorised his work as part of the “grand realist tradition”. “I thought, what book have you read? I’m flattered that someone could read any of my books like that – but they’re myths.” He stops and laughs at himself. “And they’re allegories, which is even worse …” Still, he has poured plenty of himself into the nine main human characters in The Overstory. The most obvious proxy is Nick Hoel: “The introspective midwestern creator and outsider, trying to solve the tensions between that intense introspection of his temperament with the outward ambition of his vocation – that’s me.” But there’s also Mimi Ma, the engineer who represents the pragmatic path Powers might have taken; Neelay, a programmer who loses himself in alternative worlds, and Douglas, the war veteran to whom the author gave his “relentless goofy humour”. “It was like a five-year-long therapy session where I let all my multiple personalities off the leash and that was so satisfying.” You get the sense that this book changed him. For a start, it brought him to the Smokies. On a research trip three and half years ago, he realised he felt “better than I had ever felt before” and within six months, he had left Palo Alto and his well-paid teaching post at Stanford for a secluded house deep in the mountains. His wife, Jane, a French translator, works in Chicago at the University of Illinois and he has the place largely to himself. The couple have no children – he has never wanted any. “And it has been an issue with me in my life, relationships have broken off because of that.” At the same time, it strikes him as the best thing he’s done for the world: “a terrible thing to say,” he laughs, “but I don’t mean it misanthropically – just pragmatically.” When Powers isn’t hiking, he can sit on the porch listening to the whippoorwill (a nightjar), or work on his recipe for grits (his secret: toast them first). His next project will take The Overstory’s themes into science fiction, a genre still considered suspect by some in the literary world. “But when you’re asking what would it take to effect the transformation in consciousness that humans need, the only people who ask these questions are the sci-fi writers.” Powers recently read an Arthur C Clarke story in which the protagonists discover life on Venus, in the form of plants that look like rocks. “They say, ‘Finally, proof that mankind is not alone in the universe.’” He looks at the trees around him. “And I’m thinking – wait a minute, you didn’t actually have to leave Earth to find that out.” Two hours of steady ascent from the trail head, and Albright Grove reveals itself. After the dense, uniform trunks of the second-growth forest that dominates the southern Appalachians – almost every acre of these mountains was logged once the white man arrived – the old growth looks alien. Giant tulip poplars, centuries old, plug the sky; their trunks barely taper on their vertical journey. Around them, a mess of vegetation, living, dead and rotten, creates unearthly shapes. “Some people don’t enjoy the old-growth forests,” says Powers. “They find them too creepy.” But the biodiversity to be found in these all-but-eradicated spaces is the secret at the heart of his novel. “No human being has ever seen an old-growth forest that’s been clear-cut come back to the richness and vitality of what it was. Ever.” It’s one of the reasons why President Trump’s move to open up national monuments such as Bears Ears in Utah to extraction and felling is so catastrophic. “One hundred per cent of all forests would be removed if there was no consensual agreement to protect them,” says Powers. “It’s not about economics, it’s about ideology: we were told that the proper destination for mankind was domination. ‘Stop putting handcuffs on us. Let’s drain the swamp!’ That political metaphor is what they want to do to the landscape.” The modern human assumption that trees, plants and all other wildlife are “just property” is, to Powers, the root of our much greater species problem. “Every form of mental despair and terror and incapacity in modern life seems to be related in some way to this complete alienation from everything else alive. We’re deeply, existentially lonely. “Until it’s exciting and fun and ecstatic to think that everything else has agency and is reciprocally connected we’re going to be terrified and afraid of death, and it’s mastery or nothing.” To that end, Powers hopes his book will be part of the restoration of a tradition that has all but ceased to exist in modern literature. “We are incredibly good at psychological and political dramas, but there’s another kind of drama – between the humans and the non-humans – that disappeared in the late 19th century, once we thought we had dominion over the Earth. Because we won that battle. “But now we know we didn’t, actually. And until you resolve that question, how do we live coherently at home on this planet, the other two kinds of stories are luxuries.” • Richard Powers will be at the Edinburgh international book festival on 21 August.

Departing for the G7 summit in Canada, the president told reporters at the White House he was looking at “thousands of names” of people who could be granted clemency. Ali refused to enter the military during the Vietnam war and his local draft board rejected his application for classification as a conscientious objector. He received a draft-evasion conviction in 1967 and was stripped of his world heavyweight title. “He was, look, he was not very popular then, certainly his memory is popular now,” Trump said. “I’m thinking about that very seriously, and some others.” Ali was sentenced to five years in prison but he appealed and in 1971 the supreme court overturned his conviction, finding that the justice department improperly told the draft board Ali’s stance was not motivated by his religious beliefs as a Muslim. Trump’s gesture is therefore meaningless. Ali’s lawyer, Ron Tweel, said: “We appreciate President Trump’s sentiment, but a pardon is unnecessary. The US supreme court overturned the conviction of Muhammad Ali in a unanimous decision in 1971. There is no conviction from which a pardon is needed.” Trump recently granted a posthumous pardon to the first African American heavyweight champion, Jack Johnson, who was convicted in 1913 of violating a law that made it illegal to transport women across state lines for “immoral” purposes. Earlier this week, he also commuted the life sentence of a woman whose cause was championed by Kim Kardashian West. “The power to pardon is a beautiful thing,” Trump told reporters. “I want to do people who are unfairly treated like Alice [Marie Johnson].” Trump has also floated a possible pardon for TV personality Martha Stewart and potentially commuting the sentence of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted on corruption charges in 2011.

The tiny village of Fraguas, which sits in the hills of northern Castilla-La Mancha, was emptied in the late 1960s as part of a reforestation programme and was later used as a training area for the Spanish army. A group of young settlers arrived in 2013 and began bringing the village back to life with the blessing of its former inhabitants. Over the past five years, they have rebuilt houses, planted vegetables and worked to restore the overgrown village cemetery. Their activities have been opposed by the regional government, which points out that Fraguas lies in public woodland within the Sierra Norte natural park and argues that their presence is a fire hazard. Castilla-La Mancha’s high court ruled on Friday that the collective had unlawfully occupied the site and sentenced six of its members to 18 months’ imprisonment. They were also fined €2,700 (£2,370) each and ordered to reimburse the regional government for the cost of demolishing the newly restored areas of Fraguas. Although the sentences could be served on probation as they are under the two-year threshold, the court said failure to pay the fines would result in a three-year sentence. Jaime Merino, a spokesman for the collective, described the sentences as devastating and said an appeal would be launched. “We had thought we might be acquitted. We thought the trial had gone well,” he said. “There were lots of other ways [the regional government] could have done this. They didn’t have to take it to court. There could have been negotiations instead, but they went down the criminal route, which is the toughest one available.” Despite the intervention of local environmentalists, who have been acting as negotiators – and a petition with more than 77,000 signatures in support of the project – the collective now believes prison is inevitable. Merino said the six did not have the money to pay the fines. “Anyway, it’s not just the fines we have to pay, it’s the cost of the demolition, which will be decided by the regional government,” he said. “If we don’t have the money for the fines and the demolition, they’ll translate the fines into prison time, which will increase the sentence and we’ll end up in jail.“We’re pretty freaked out but we haven’t lost hope. We haven’t decided to chuck it all in and head back to the city again. No way. We’re going to fight this all the way to the end. We’re convinced that we’re doing something good, not just for us but also for the former inhabitants, who’ve been supporting us.” The satirical Spanish magazine El Jueves tweeted its support for the collective. “These squatters shouldn’t be sentenced, they should be given an award. Pardon them and put them in charge of a rural repopulation ministry - now.,” it wrote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/08/anthony-bourdain-made-food-writing-muscular-and-kinetic","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T13:24:44Z","webTitle":"Anthony Bourdain made food writing muscular and kinetic | Jay Rayner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/08/anthony-bourdain-made-food-writing-muscular-and-kinetic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/08/anthony-bourdain-made-food-writing-muscular-and-kinetic","fields":{"headline":"Anthony Bourdain 'made food writing muscular and kinetic'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Anthony Bourdain was, by his own estimation, a jobbing restaurant cook who “just got lucky”. It’s a classic bit of Bourdain understatement. It’s true he was never a chef who was going to knock down culinary boundaries – Bourdain was schooled in the French classics – but as a writer he was massively influential, changing forever what the business of food and appetite on the page could be. Before the publication in 2000 of Kitchen Confidential, his memoir of life as a line cook, food writing was, for the most part, a job for those who had pulled their sizeable bellies up to the table in the dining room. It was effete and delicate. Bourdain gave a voice to the career cooks on the other side of the kitchen door; the ramshackle, itinerant tribe of restaurant chefs, with their skin burns, tattoos, appetite for long hours and hard drugs. He made food writing muscular and kinetic. He blew the whistle on how your steak was likely to be cooked in a big New York restaurant – by being dumped in the deep fat fryer – and famously cautioned against eating sushi on Mondays, because the fish was less than fresh. Naturally enough, in time, there was a backlash. There were accusations that he was falsely glamorising a life of excess – one he had abandoned – though his fans from behind those kitchen doors wouldn’t hear a word against him. You could spot them a mile off at the public events which inevitably became part of the author’s working life: pallid skin, wild hair, clutching a stained volume they wanted to be signed. Although it was writing that gave him his profile, Bourdain’s biggest contribution to food media may well have been to television. His various series, first for the Food Network, then later the Travel Channel and CNN, had an immersive, nerdy quality that fixed the dishes he was eating to the communities and cultures from which they came. Without him, vast amounts of today’s food content – the various documentary strands, such as Ugly Delicious on Netflix – simply wouldn’t exist. I shot a sequence with him for a London-based show in the summer of 2016 at Fergus Henderson’s St John in Clerkenwell, which he regarded as a culinary temple. He made it clear it was now the mechanics of film-making that most intrigued him. He had no time for the usual artifice of TV: no retakes, no stop-starts, just shoot what happens. As he told the New Yorker in 2017: “I travel around the world, eat a lot of shit, and basically do what the fuck I want.” The fact that Bourdain’s long, rambling journey has finally come to such a sad end will leave his army of fans, including this one, utterly bereft."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2018/jun/09/green-motion-car-hire-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"Green Motion has low car hire rates – but users say there’s a sting in the tail","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/09/green-motion-car-hire-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jun/09/green-motion-car-hire-bills","fields":{"headline":"Green Motion has low car hire rates – but users say there’s a sting in the tail","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is the car hire firm with a trail of angry customers, furious at bills presented to them when they return a car for hundreds – even thousands – of pounds for damage they say is barely visible or that was there already. Green Motion, which has franchised branches at most major UK airports, appears to offer remarkably cheap deals – often a third of the price charged by major rivals. But now customers allege that there is a major sting in the tail. It is easily the most-complained about car hire firm in Guardian Money’s postbag, although the greatest number of angry customers appear to be at its branches near Heathrow, Gatwick and Glasgow airports. It vigorously denies the allegations, saying that it operates to the highest ethical standards and that some customers are just unhappy about being caught for damaging their vehicles. The complaints are not just to our consumer champions, but have also piled up in reviews on Trustpilot, groups on Facebook and forums on TripAdvisor. Customers allege that: • They are wildly overcharged for small blemishes, which may have been there before hiring – such as £400 for a barely visible scratch. • On collection, staff often fail to mark existing damage on the rental agreement. On return, staff pore over the car looking for the tiniest blemish. • Blemishes are found on the underside of bumpers and bodywork that cannot reasonably be seen when hiring. • Staff will often identify a piece of damage in a way that suggested they had prior knowledge of its existence. On TripAdvisor, one group of customers is called “Green Motion – is it a scam?”. A separate group on Facebook is trying to bring people together to launch a legal action against the firm. Others have faced battles with card providers after Green Motion refused to deal with their complaint. New customers are enticed by the very low prices that are offered by online brokers and the Ryanair website. For example, when Guardian Money searched for a car at Glasgow airport for two days in July, Green Motion’s deals were the first three on rentalcars.com. A Peugeot 108 cost £34, when the cheapest deals from Avis, Hertz and Sixt were all more than £100. How is it able to offer such low prices? Maybe an indication comes from its job adverts for vehicle inspection staff. The ads say that they will be paid a bonus, even though the job does not involve sales. When we posed as a possible job applicant, we were told that we would earn commission, although the details would only be revealed at interview stage. Many of the complainants to Money allege that the vehicle inspection staff appear to be incentivised to find damage, a claim Green Motion strongly denies. Thomas Heatley Smith was so astonished after Green Motion Heathrow charged him £390 for what he says is an almost invisible hairline scratch, that he took a video (below). It showed the scratch, as well as his discussion with the manager, which shows him acknowledging that it was a very small scratch, but saying he was still liable for the bill. Heatley Smith says the scratch could be rubbed out with just a few minutes’ work but Green Motion has stood by its “ridiculous” charge, and he has now begun a small claims court legal action arguing that the repair cost bore no relation to the alleged damage. “This company is trying to take advantage of customers who aren’t in a position to do anything about it. We would like to see them thrown into the spotlight,” he says. “They responded this week suggesting that we either rehire the car and get it fixed at our expense (along with additional charges) or, alternatively, pay a hire charge while they get it fixed as well as ‘repair costs’, and other additional charges. As you would expect we are continuing with the court process.” Dr Paul Shah* hired a car at London’s City airport. In his case the company refused to accept his Amex card, requiring him to return home for a credit card. It then insisted that, because he was two hours late in picking up the booked car, it had been rented and the only one now available would cost an extra £150 on top of the £344 he had already paid. Needing it to get to work in a hospital, he paid up. He admits he relied on staff to note the damage as he was tired. “On giving the car back they said there was a scratch at the left rear rubber/plastic bumper. I was shocked as I was sure that I had not damaged the car while it was in my possession. However, as the original form did not show this, I was told I would be liable. “The scuff was very superficial and 4-5cm length … something I did not even notice. They charged me a £1,095 excess which is outrageous. I have subsequently taken advice from independent garages which all say that it is an extremely small job.” He appealed to the British Vehicle Rental &amp; Leasing Association’s arbitration scheme but the BVRLA told him that, as Green Motion had produced an invoice and inspection report, it could not intervene. It told Money it did not question the size of the repair bill for the job required. A common complaint is that staff handing over cars at the start of a rental are blasé about the procedure, claiming lots of scratches are too small to worry about. However, some customers say that appears to all change when they return the car, at which point staff examine every panel minutely – even producing bright lights to help. Many customers have also claimed that, on returning a vehicle, staff do not go through a full examination – choosing to go straight to damage that has mysteriously appeared, often on the car’s underside which can be very difficult to see. But Green Motion is not the first car hire company to be accused of systematically overcharging for tiny scratches. In June 2017, Trading Standards in Leicester investigated Europcar UK after allegations that it overcharged for repairs, raking in profits via secret agreements with its suppliers. It was forced to put aside around £40m to cover refunds to customers who were overcharged. At the time, consumer group Which? called for a wider investigation by the government and authorities to establish if other car hire firms might be profiting from illegal charging tactics. Legal experts have warned that any firms that sought to profit from repairs could be in breach of the Fraud Act 2006, as well as the Consumer Rights Act 2015. * Not his real name Green Motion’s response Green Motion says the vast majority of its customers are satisfied with the service provided. In a statement, it said: “During the period in question (18 February to 22 May 2018), the Green Motion franchise in the UK successfully serviced 30,494 customers. During the same period, the UK customer service department received 2,282 customer queries [these are not necessarily complaints]. The total amount of queries received, many of which would be considered benign, amounts to less than 6% of the total customers serviced. This stands to reason that 94% of our customers were satisfied with the service we provided.” Green Motion examined 13 cases sent by Guardian Money. “Twelve of the cases are without doubt standard damage charges. The 13th case, where the location confirmed that there was an error, has been fully refunded.” It added: “Prior to hire, each customer is requested to undertake a full inspection of the vehicle. There is no pre-planned scams, there is just a very simple process customers are requested to follow. They just have to simply inspect the car and satisfy themselves that the condition is in line with the vehicle condition report.” It said that if, for example, the inspection took place in the dark, customers had the option to notify the company and reinspect by 10am the next day. Allegations that inspection staff receive a payback for finding damage are “completely unfounded”. It said: “The vehicle inspectors are simply looking for a change in condition. Nothing more, nothing less. We are not aware of any franchises that profit from charging for damage. At best they may cover the repair/reinstatement/refurbishment costs, but more often than not there will be losses associated to damage which have to be carried by the business.” Readers on their Green Motion experiences ● Ben Stenner has hired cars all over the world, but says he has never had such an appalling experience as he had when he hired a car to travel between Green Motion’s Heathrow and Gatwick branches. Staff took £530 from him after they claimed he caused a minor scratch – a scratch that he says is barely visible despite staff producing bright lights to justify it. “I collected the car at the same time of day as I dropped it off and it was dark. On collecting the car and being shown round it to inspect it, I was not given any light to do so. Funnily enough on dropping the car back, out came their LED spotlight and the employee suspiciously walks straight round to the rear of the car, wipes off the film of dirt and finds a scratch which I and his colleague couldn’t see. Even with a cloth and wiping it and cleaning it and with a very powerful LED light it was still very difficult to see – as my video (below) shows. “I was initially threatened with paying the excess of £1,085 only for it to be reduced to £360 and then £140.” He says staff became angry when they realised he was recording them. “Clearly they work on the basis of go in hard and offer a lower figure which you then agree to as it’s less than the ridiculous original figure. I have challenged Green Motion to show me the new damage chart [a tariff of charges] that customers are told how much they will be charged, and they have failed to supply it.” ● Vivian Lau, who lives in Hong Kong, initially paid £44.50 to rent a car, but ended up with a £420 bill, and a missed flight home, after she hired from Green Motion in London. She had taken a photo of the damaged Mercedes she was given, but says this didn’t stop Green Motion charging her the sum for the damage when she returned the car. She presented her photographic evidence that the damage was there at pick-up to staff, who admitted it had been previously damaged. But Green Motion then claimed she had also damaged the same area on the car – and therefore the charge stands. “I was the perfect target: single lady driver who is not resident in the UK, had a long-haul flight to catch after returning the car – who would in all likelihood be unable to pursue the return of the deposit. They knew I had a flight to catch and was unlikely to escalate the matter to the police,” she says. Green Motion has now refunded her in full. ● Jennie Rathbone rented a car from Green Motion’s Gatwick depot in April. In her case she was charged £290 for a scratch to the door frame that she is certain she did not cause. “I had only had the car a few hours but when it came to inspect the car on return, the staff member didn’t put the key in the ignition to check the fuel gauge, or walk around it as you would have expected. Instead he swiftly opened the driver’s door, knelt down to look at the side edge where there was a scratch, and declared I would have to pay for it. “When the staff member refused to give me his name I asked to take his photograph, to which he threatened to call the police! When I took my phone out of my pocket, both men ran inside and shut the door. I felt I was on the receiving end of a well-practised scam,” she says. ● When Heather Dryden and friends (pictured below) booked a car for a three-day walking trip to Scotland they were delighted to see that it was only going to cost £17. Despite driving just 59 miles, the group were hit with a £395 bill by the Glasgow franchise because of what they say was a tiny chip to the windscreen – a chip they’re sure they didn’t cause, and one they claim would cost a fraction of that to repair. They say they faced a long wait for a suitable car that was eventually produced wet, having just been washed. It was, they say, very difficult to spot the scratches and dents on a wet car in a poorly-lit warehouse. “We had an incident-free trip – or so we thought. On returning the car the Green Motion staff were quickly on their hands and knees inspecting the car even looking underneath, trying to find any fault they could. They claimed they had found a crack on the windscreen, which they later corrected as a stone chip. They initially charged us £495 – later reduced to £395.” ● When Leonard Foley picked up his hire car at Green Motion’s Luton off-airport site, he thought the employee was being kind when he put his bags in the boot and shut the lid. Although it was dark, he says he checked the outside of the car for scratches. He noted some damage and then headed off on an uneventful journey to attend a wedding. He says he had a similarly quiet journey back to Luton. “As soon as we arrived there was a Green Motion employee who went directly to the boot and opened the lid and pointed out scuff and scratches which he claimed we were responsible for. He then entered the back of the car to point out more damage. “He charged my debit card £1,205 in spite of the fact that they look like wear and tear over time and not something that happened in the previous two days. We definitely did not cause any damage whatsoever to the car. It’s disgraceful that this company is charging innocent people like me and the public should be made aware of this,” he says. Green Motion has since billed him £91, and returned the rest of his deposit. ● Geoff Cross’s annoyance at having to pay £5 to get a bus from Heathrow to Green Motion’s nearby depot – and his 90-minute wait to be seen by staff – were nothing to his anger at being charged £1,200 for a dent he is adamant he didn’t cause. “We then inspected the car and I pointed out many, many scratches and issues with the car ... assuming the guy would mark them all on the sheet, which he confirmed he had. When we returned the car a small dent was pointed out that I did show him but was not marked. You could barely see it. The company claimed it is 40mm long but the photo shows 20mm. No doubt they won’t get it repaired and they will use it again and again to charge another unsuspecting customer,” he says. Green Motion has since reduced his bill to £756."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/11/small-wonders-review-punchdrunk-bernie-grant-arts-centre","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"Small Wonders review – Punchdrunk take the kids to Nanny's house of mischief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/11/small-wonders-review-punchdrunk-bernie-grant-arts-centre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/11/small-wonders-review-punchdrunk-bernie-grant-arts-centre","fields":{"headline":"Small Wonders review – Punchdrunk take the kids to Nanny's house of mischief","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I’m crouched down alongside a bunch of kids and we’re shouting merrily: “Think big! Think big!” We’re with Nanny Lacey, a woman who loves to make miniature models of her life’s most magical moments. Nanny is losing her memory and will soon move into a care home. Before then, she wants to jump into one of her miniature memories one last time. We can all join her: we just have to believe. Small Wonders has been created for London international festival of theatre by Punchdrunk, and is directed by Tara Boland and Peter Higgin. It boasts all the rigour and ambition of the immersive-theatre pioneers’ shows for adults and – crucially – isn’t merely a visual extravaganza. There’s real emotion and inspiration at the heart of Nessah Muthy’s script, created in collaboration with local teenagers in Tottenham and containing happy moments plucked from their own lives. Kate Rigby’s set is full of exquisite detail and cheeky imagination. We arrive outside Nanny’s pebbledash home, tidy flower baskets hanging from the windows. The flat is crammed with 30 years of knick-knacks and is so utterly convincing that my theatre companion Qeiva, aged 11, is a little anxious. “This is someone’s home!” Qeiva whispers, and sits nervously at the back of the room. All the kids are initially intimidated, but Nanny (Erin Geraghty) and her daughter Bella (Sarah Akokhia) soon put the children at ease. Nanna talks us through the models crammed into her home and, gradually, cherished memories take over the living room. We look at a tiny model of Nanny and Bella dancing at Butlins and a disco ball suddenly spins over our heads. Nanny remembers a rainy caravan holiday and shining rainbow-lights burst through the ceiling. The real world and the imagined begin to merge. Geraghty builds a brilliant rapport with the children, who are soon anxious to help her in any way possible. There’s a certain sense of mischief that only grandparents and grandchildren share, which Small Wonders taps into quite brilliantly. Eventually, after “thinking big”, we dive headfirst into one of Nanny’s miniature creations and explore a fantasy forest. To say much more would spoil the fun but there are surprises nestling in every corner. At one point, Qeiva pulls on a vine to unleash a canopy of stars, all while munching on a biscuit. I’ve never seen her so happy at the theatre. When we return to Nanny’s flat, we find it lit up with tiny adventures. Qeiva and I spot mini models of Nanny and Bella playing around in the bread bin; dancing about on top of a broom; laughing happily in a frying pan. There’s magic everywhere we turn, now that we know to look for it. Small Wonders is at Bernie Grant Arts Centre, London, until 8 July. Box office: 020-8365 5450. The London international festival of theatre continues until 22 July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/11/yoga-with-dogs-is-crackers-but-its-my-kind-of-crackers-woof","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T10:06:54Z","webTitle":"Yoga with dogs is crackers, but it’s my kind of crackers.

Woof!","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Belgian shepherd has got snappy with a chow chow, chasing it between the mats. Ten other dogs erupt, like schoolboys egging on a punchup. Things cannot be going to plan, if there even is a plan. The teacher gamely attempts to continue, but I can’t hear what she’s saying. Taking advantage of the mayhem, a bichon frise is truffling in everyone’s bags, looking for rawhide twists. I should explain: I’m in a dog yoga class. Maybe that makes things more confusing. Doga is a system of balancing dogs on the body while in yoga poses. (“If you have a larger dog, use him as a bolster,” says the instructor.) On paper, it is an idea so nauseating it would make Anthea Turner want to declare a fatwa. Designed to nurture a dog’s sacred bond with its owner, it came from California; hard to believe. According to our teacher, doga pioneer Mahny Djahanguiri, it’s particularly good for rescues. An owner practising slow and sustained breathing will calm down an anxious animal, whose parasympathetic nervous system will respond in kind. This does sound plausible. Someone should tell the dogs. Thankfully, the class is open to non-owners, too – those who just want to hang with some mutts. A mat neighbour lends me her miniature sheltie, and I spend a few minutes hinged at the waist, clutching the impeccably manicured beast, trying not to drip sweat on to it. Extending into warrior pose, I hoist the dog like Rafiki lifting Simba at the start of The Lion King. I don’t know whether the sheltie is loving or merely tolerating this, the way my childhood dog did when I put stickers on him. But the fur is very reassuring. Doga is undoubtedly crackers, but it’s my kind of crackers. I’ve never succeeded in getting into straight yoga, and our society’s obsession with it baffles me. Yoga is an ascetic means of preparing the body for meditation. It’s about unifying with the divine, not looking buff in Lululemon. I mean, imagine if all the Hindus in Uttar Pradesh were shovelling down communion wafers as a low-cal alternative to crisps. That would be weird. Themed yoga should be even more of an aberration. Beer yoga, Harry Potter yoga, horse and goat yoga. What the hell are these? Broga, a fitness programme taught “from a man’s point of view”, replaces asanas with names such as “rock star” and “chill out pose”. A friend of mine swears by Stevie Nicks yoga, where a chiffon-clad instructor replaces devotional mantras with Fleetwood Mac lyrics. The (inaccurate) message is that yoga is fun, secular and customisable: you can go your own way. The thing is, in every other yoga class I feel awkward, Lycra-lumpy, alienated by some Blake Lively-alike telling me I am more than enough. The involvement of dogs changes everything. It’s impossible to feel self-conscious in the presence of a boston terrier curious as to why you are trying to turn into a bridge. Dogs puncture the absurdity of all human behaviours. Have you ever tried sinking into shavasana while a pomeranian puts its tongue in your ear? Ohm. Ohhhhm. Ohhhmmygod, is that piss on the floor? (Downside: there was quite a lot of piss. Not sure who to blame, but the bichon was looking sheepish.) Forget the rescue animals – at the end of the class, I feel calmer, centred and in the moment. That parasympathetic works both ways. A meeting with God may be elusive, but dogs will never let you down. When it comes to reasons to feel #blessed, they are definitely more than enough. Doga without the dogma: that’s my vibe. Down on the island with the Australian Dr Moreau Call me TripAdvisor, because I have found the least appealing B&amp;B in the world. I became aware of it after seeing a shocking video of a crocodile clamping its jaws around a small dog on the banks of Goat Island Lodge, a remote guest house in northern Australia. For 10 years, Pippa the terrier, also known as Dumb Blonde, was famed for chasing Casey the crocodile into the water, until one day the croc snapped. There are some stories you have to take a deep dive into. “This is the Kingdom of King Kai, and all the rest of them are my sub-servants,” owner Kai Hansen told Australian ABC last year, giving off unbelievable Island of Dr Moreau vibes. The king, who has a broad smile and no front teeth, came to the island 15 years ago, wanting to escape city life. How bad can Starbucks be, that a crocodile-infested swamp only accessible by an hour’s boat ride is preferable? I need to know what his job was, and how a Danish man came to buy an entire island, when most people just go to Center Parcs. Goat Island Lodge receives visitors from all over Australia, keen for a taste of … what? The snacks menu, glimpsed in the ABC video, includes “bit of bull (minced) and Ruffburger (very horny)”. What does one do there? “There was a man living here in the early days. Heard there was a dead croc upriver, disappeared with a chainsaw. Came back smelling so rotten ... I had to burn his clothes.” It’s Hemingway gone utterly wrong. Hansen is essentially un-Googleable, as he shares a name with a German heavy metal vocalist. I have to know more. Call me a dumb brunette, but I’m jumping on a fanboat. If I’m not back next week, let’s be honest, I’m probably dead. All you need is life Curiosity, the Nasa rover, has located an array of organic molecules in a 3m-year-old lake bed on Mars. Huge news. Obviously, we would prefer aliens to resemble octopuses, speak English and pose a threat to us, so that we can keep making movies. And it’s weird how gripped many of us are by the search for the fossils of single-celled organisms on another planet, when we avoid sharing lifts if possible, and screen our calls. It’s looking increasingly likely that we will discover there was life on Mars at the exact point we realise there isn’t any down here. Have a great week! • Rhik Samadder is a Guardian columnist.

In the reception, a poster reads “Newcomers to Canada Settlement Information”. Staff help new arrivals find information on citizenship, English and French classes, housing, employment and healthcare, as well as free guided tours of heritage sites across the city. A few steps away is the Innovation Hub, a “maker space” where a young woman explained to me how to use a 3D printer. This branch has three. Public libraries throughout the western world are struggling. Britain has closed hundreds since 2010, reduced hours in others and replaced many paid librarians with volunteers. In Belgium, an advocacy group called Public Libraries 2020 aims to “challenge outdated perceptions” of libraries – in part by cajoling politicians to set foot inside one. In North America, staff per visitor has fallen across the board since 2012, and circulation and visits are dropping. The “disruption” of Silicon Valley – in which Uber replaces taxis, Airbnb replaces hotels and Netflix replaces video stores – has many governments asking: why pay for physical book repositories when you can get so much reading material online? And yet researchers from Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf have ranked Canada as having the best public library systems among 30 major cities studied. (All three Canadian cities included – Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver – came in the top 10.) You can see why. Readings and events at the 575-seat theatre at the Toronto reference branch are free, and you’d be well advised to book your ticket early: a recent appearance by Roxane Gay sold out in 88 seconds. Sensibly, the researchers also rated the libraries on the availability of snacks – behind me is a cafe with Balzac quotes on the walls and urns of Margaret Atwood-themed coffee. Not bad, though no match for Montreal’s Grande Bibliothèque, where you can get a risotto dinner with wine. A full 70% of Toronto’s population makes use of the city’s public library, which houses a collection of over 10m books, ebooks, CDs, and DVDs in 40 languages. Toronto has the edge over public libraries in Berlin, Paris, Vienna, and Stockholm in its digital programmes and services. The city is up five spots since the survey was last conducted, in 2013 (when Vancouver took first place), and much of Toronto’s improvement has been in digital services. By contrast, New York, Chicago, Amsterdam, and Tokyo have comparatively less to offer at their physical locations (London, the only UK city surveyed, ranked 27th). Given that books and articles can now often be accessed by other means, the Toronto Public Library network has tried to move beyond the original (but still significant) mandate of maintaining physical collections. It sees its relevance in providing programmes and services, as well as in facilitating free, or cheap, use of technologies that might otherwise only be available in exclusive spaces, such as art schools or science laboratories. The Toronto reference library hosts Hand-a-thons, in which school groups use the 3D printers along with Arduino robotics kits to make working prosthetic hands. In the maker space a printing press, for self-publishing paperbacks, smells comfortingly of hot glue. There’s a podcasting studio and a green screen, where actors, models and real estate agents come to take headshots. A colleague is usually present to help answer questions about the scanners or photo suites, my guide explained, but right then he was setting up the VR superhero demo in the gallery. “Access to information and pathways to learning were the great equalisers of the 20th century,” says Vickery Bowles, Toronto’s head librarian. “In the 21st century, we’re increasingly dependent on access to online services, and understanding of and comfort with that technology.” Bowles sees a vital role of the public library in strengthening civic discourse and enabling political participation. Right now, the library is offering workshops on how to run for office or get involved in an election campaign (disclosure: I will be a paid panellist on a planned event in the library’s On Civil Society series). “We’re seeing more and more challenges to our democratic values and principles,” she says. The TPL receives more 90% of its annual operating budget of $200m (£115m) from the city, with additional contributions from the province, and the institution has to be careful to refrain from appearing politically partisan. Recently the TPL has seen its provincial funding drop: last year, the Liberal government announced a $1.4m cut over two years. This year it planned a $51m investment over three years into regional libraries, as well as $28m over three years for a new Digital Public Library available to any Ontario resident. But the recent election of Doug Ford – the Progressive Conservative leader who once blasted Atwood over library funding and in 2011 said he’d close his local branch “in a heartbeat” – does not bode well. But closing libraries to save money is rarely popular among Canadian voters. In 2016, Newfoundland announced a plan to close over half the province’s libraries; after a backlash, the government reversed the decision. Saskatchewan’s provincial government went through a similar reversal last year. Provincial funding aside, Bowles says the library will pursue further private-sector partnerships along the lines of their relationship with Cisco Canada, to continue providing cutting-edge technologies, and is confident of entering talks with Sidewalk Labs, the Alphabet subsidiary, should plans proceed for its city-within-a-city on Toronto’s waterfront. When I left the library and descended into the subway, I saw the bearded man who had waved me through the gate. Now he was pacing the platform. He nodded when he passed me, saying quietly, “library?” I nodded back. We recognised each other from one of the city’s least exclusive clubs, a place where the main criterion for belonging is wanting to.

Some 300 people drowned. It was not the first time that migrants had drowned in the Mediterranean. In fact, at that time it was estimated that in the previous 25 years at least 20,000 people had died trying to reach the shores of Europe. The real figure was most likely much higher. But that sinking in October 2013 was the first time that such a tragedy had truly impressed itself upon the conscience of Europe. European leaders expressed anger and outrage. The Italian government declared a national day of mourning. “I hope that this will be the last time we see a tragedy of this kind,” said Jean-Claude Mignon, head of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly. The disaster would be “a spur to action”, promised the UN secretary general at the time, Ban Ki-moon. After the tragedy, I wrote that such leaders may well be “sincere in their expressions of anger and grief”. And yet, I observed, “one cannot but be cynical about all the lamentation. The horror of Lampedusa did not come out of the blue. Much of the responsibility lies with the policies pursued by European nations.” I concluded: “The next time there is another tragedy as at Lampedusa – and there will be a next time and a next time after that – and politicians across Europe express shock and grief and anger, remember this: they could have helped prevent it and chose not to. That is the real disgrace.” And there has been a next time and a next time after that. In fact, it has happened so many times since that such tragedies barely make the news any more. That mass drowning off Lampedusa in 2013 is an apposite place from which to start a discussion on the dehumanising of the Other. Too often when we discuss hateful portrayals of migrants or Muslims or other minorities, we focus on the far right, or on groups such as Pegida, or on countries such as Hungary and politicians such as Viktor Orbán. It is certainly important that we call out such organisations and politicians and eviscerate their arguments. But we need also to recognise that the truth about dehumanisation is far more uncomfortable and far closer to home. The ideas and policies promoted by the far right and by populist anti-immigration figures have not come out of nowhere. They have become acceptable because the groundwork has already been laid, and continues to be maintained, by mainstream politicians and commentators. There is a tendency among liberals to see a great divide on immigration between the mainstream and the populists and between a more liberal western Europe and a more reactionary east. That is to distort reality. For, while differences clearly exist, the divisions are not nearly as sharp as often suggested. It is the rhetoric and the policies emerging from the mainstream and from western Europe that have helped legitimise the hostility to immigration expressed by the populists and in eastern Europe. Over the past few weeks, Britain has been racked by an immigration scandal that led to the resignation of the home secretary. The proximate reason for the scandal is the treatment of the so-called Windrush generation. The deeper cause is the deliberate creation of what the prime minister, Theresa May, called, when she was home secretary, a “hostile environment” for migrants. It nurtured a climate of suspicion in which people were deemed guilty unless they could prove themselves innocent. Hundreds of people who had lived in Britain for decades, or had even been born in Britain, were treated as “illegal immigrants” because they could not prove otherwise. Meanwhile, in France, President Emmanuel Macron has pursued his own “hostile environment” policies. After having forcibly shut spontaneous migration camps, in Paris and elsewhere, he has introduced new legislation to toughen immigration and asylum laws. It will double to 90 days the time in which undocumented migrants can be detained, shorten deadlines to apply for asylum and make the undocumented crossing of borders punishable by a year in jail and fines. Sonia Krimi, an MP from Macron’s party En Marche, has accused the government of “playing with people’s fears”, adding: “Not all foreigners in France are terrorists, not all foreigners cheat with social welfare.” And wherever you look in Europe, from Scandinavia to Spain, from Italy to the Netherlands, mainstream politicians are adopting a similar approach. Politicians such as May and Macron insist that they are simply responding to popular pressures, yet the story is more complex. In Britain, the government initially ignored the growing number of cases of Windrush generation migrants being detained, denied services, losing jobs. It was public outrage that eventually forced it to act. The public, in other words, was more liberal than the authorities. Or take Greece. Here, too, the public was, certainly initially, more sympathetic to the plight of migrants than were the authorities, whether in Athens or in Brussels. In 2016, at the height of the migration crisis, EU countries to the north closed their borders, creating a bottleneck in Greece. Suffering grievously from an economic crisis and from austerity policies imposed primarily at the behest of the EU, the people of Greece nevertheless showed an admirable moral commitment to the migrants. True, there were anti-migrant demonstrations and the far-right Golden Dawn won 7% of the vote in the 2015 general election. But mostly, Greeks, at that time, showed enormous solidarity. The island of Lesbos, close to the Turkish coast, was at the very centre of the crisis. The number of migrants who arrived on the island in the first two months of 2016 alone was larger than Lesbos’s normal population, yet the locals continued to support migrants with food, shelter and solidarity. Ground zero of European ignominy Two years on, the situation is very different. Two years in which Greece has effectively been abandoned by Brussels and places such as Lesbos abandoned by Athens. “Those wishing to visit ground zero of European ignominy,” observed the journalists Girogos Christides and Katrin Kuntz last November, “must simply drive up an olive tree-covered hill on the island of Lesbos until the high cement walls of Camp Moria come into view. “The dreadful stench of urine and garbage greets visitors and the ground is covered with hundreds of plastic bags. It is raining and filthy water has collected ankle-deep on the road. The migrants who come out of the camp are covered with thin plastic capes and many of them are wearing only flipflops on their feet as they walk through the soup… Welcome to one of the most shameful sites in all of Europe.” A camp that was built to handle around 2,000 refugees now houses three times as many, in the most appalling conditions. The EU’s primary response to the deteriorating conditions in Greece was not to help either Greece or the migrants but, rather, to establish a deal with Turkey to return undocumented migrants. The deal arrangement was meant to ease the burden on Greece. In fact, it made it worse. The numbers arriving in Greece dropped, but they were now imprisoned on the islands. Travel to the mainland, let alone beyond Greece, from the islands was barred to refugees and migrants. The scheme to relocate people to other EU member states has been a disastrous failure. The dreadful conditions in a camp such as Moria have inevitably created tensions within. Violence has become the norm. Many migrants have taken to moving out of the camp and sleeping rough, spreading violence and theft across the island and, inevitably, creating increasingly hostility among locals. The welcome that first greeted the migrants has long since gone. These two experiences, in Britain and in Greece, reveal two aspects of public attitudes to immigration that are often ignored. The first, as seen in Britain, is that while the public may be hostile to immigration in the abstract, it is frequently supportive of people and groups who are seen as having become unfair victims of the process. Public opinion is commonly set not by ideology but by perceptions of fairness. The second aspect of public attitudes, as seen in Greece, is how the understanding of unfairness is shaped by the policies enacted by mainstream institutions. At the start of migrant crisis, Greek opinion was certainly divided over the question of immigration. There was support for the far right. But there was also much greater sympathy with the plight of the migrants and a willingness to help them practically. The fact that much of that sympathy has ebbed away says little about the ingrained sentiments of the Greek people and much about the explicit failure of the EU and of both European and national politicians. “For the last three years,” says the mayor of Lesbos, Spyros Galinos, “we have been bearing an immense burden on behalf of Greece and Europe. But they have left us defenceless and alone.” The result, he observes, is “kindness has turned to anger… and where there is anger there is room for all sorts of extremism”. Indeed there is. Earlier this year, irate locals, led by far-right anti-immigrant activists, attacked Afghans in the central square of the capital, Mytilene, as they camped out in protest against their enforced confinement on the island. Some screamed, “Burn them alive” as they set upon the migrants, including children, with burning dustbins and flares. Galinos suggests that the chaos in the camps is deliberate policy on the part of Athens and Brussels – a message to other potential migrants. The bigger the mess in Greece, the harsher the conditions, the greater the deterrent for other refugees and migrants who see the country as a route into the EU. How deliberate the chaos is is difficult to know, but the consequences are clear. If EU politicians want to know why hostility to immigration has grown, or why many have turned to the far right, or why people who once welcomed migrants now try to burn them alive, they only have to look to the impact of their own policies. There is no iron law that says people must be irrevocably hostile to immigration. Many have become so because of the way that the issue has been framed by politicians on all sides. That framing has made immigration into a symbol of unacceptable change. On the one hand, politicians have recognised a need for immigration. On the other, they have promoted the idea of immigration as a social problem that must be dealt with. At the same time, politicians often express disdain for those who express anxieties and fears about immigration, anxieties and fears that politicians often present as mere bigotry and racism. This poisonous mixture of necessity, fear and contempt has helped both to stigmatise migrants and create popular hostility towards the liberal elite for ignoring their views on immigration. The contradictory needs and desires have also resulted in an incoherent, unworkable set of policies that have, paradoxically, been exacerbated by the development of free-movement policies within the EU. Freedom of movement is good and I am an advocate of such policy. The dream of free movement within the EU has, however, also spawned paranoia about the movement of people into the EU. The quid pro quo for Schengen has been the creation of a Fortress Europe, a citadel against immigration, watched over by a hi-tech surveillance system of satellites and drones and protected by fences and warships. When a journalist from Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine visited the control room of Frontex, the EU’s border agency, he observed that the language used was that of “defending Europe against an enemy”. Saving the continent from invasion That indeed has been the tenor of EU immigration policy – a sense of saving the continent from invasion. For more than three decades, policy has consisted of a three-pronged strategy of criminalising migrants, militarising border controls and externalising controls by paying non-EU states, on the other side of the Mediterranean, huge amounts of money to act as Europe’s immigration police; in effect, relocating Europe’s borders, for the purposes of immigration policy, beyond Europe. Fortress Europe has created not only a physical barrier around the continent, but an emotional one, too, around Europe’s sense of humanity. Migrants have come to be seen less as living, breathing human beings than as so much flotsam and jetsam to be swept away from Europe’s beaches. Cast your mind back to that shipwreck off Lampedusa in October 2013 with which I began. As the people on the stricken ship were dying and pleading for help, three fishing boats refused to provide aid. Why? Because, as Giusi Nicolini, the mayor of Lampedusa, put it, there is a long history of “our country bringing fishermen who saved human lives to court, charging them with aiding and abetting illegal immigration”. In 2004, the Cap Anamur, a German ship that belonged to a charity of the same name, rescued 37 migrants who had been stranded, sick and freezing in a dinghy. The Italian authorities banned the ship from landing because it might, in the words of the then interior minister, Giuseppe Pisanu, set a “dangerous precedent”. The Cap Anamur eventually entered the port of Empedocle without permission. The authorities seized the ship, arrested the crew and charged the captain, the first officer and the head of the charity with “aiding illegal immigration”. After a five-year court battle, the men were eventually acquitted. Such inhuman actions are not restricted to the Italian authorities. In 2011, a boat carrying 72 migrants left the Libyan port of Tripoli for Lampedusa. It soon ran into trouble. The migrants contacted the Italian coastguard. Nato, which had many vessels in the area, was informed of the boat’s plight by the Rome-based Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre. According to the survivors, military aeroplanes from the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle buzzed the boat. A military helicopter, thought to be Italian, even dropped bottles of water on the first day of their plight. But no one deigned to rescue the stricken boat. It was allowed to drift in open waters for more than two weeks, without fuel or supplies. Sixty-one of those on board died of hunger, thirst and cold. A subsequent eight-month-long Council of Europe investigation revealed that “the Libyan authorities failed to maintain responsibility for their search and rescue zone, the Italian and Maltese Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centres failed to launch any search and rescue operation, and Nato failed to react to the distress calls, even though there were military vessels under its control in the boat’s vicinity when the call was sent.” “We can talk as much as we want about human rights and the importance of complying with international obligations,” the report’s author, Tineke Strik, told reporters, “but if at the same time we just leave people to die – perhaps because we don’t know their identity or because they come from Africa – it exposes how meaningless those words are.” This is the reality of Fortress Europe: politicians and officials so blinded by their obsession with illegal immigration that they have lost the ability to recognise their most basic of obligations to others. The fear of allowing illegal immigrants into Europe seems to weigh heavier than the guilt of allowing fellow human beings (who just happen to be African) to die. So when the far-right identitarian movement harass MSF and other NGO rescue boats or when they attack migrant camps, we ought to remember that they are not the first to do so. They are following European officialdom. Such official inhumanity extends well beyond Europe. Because the EU’s reach stretches well beyond Europe. Over the past few years, it has stitched together a series of agreements with authorities across North Africa, the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and the Middle East to act effectively as Europe’s immigration police. The approach began initially with deals with Turkey, Morocco and Libya (in the days of Gaddafi’s rule). It crystallised with the EU emergency trust fund for Africa in November 2015, when European leaders offered an initial €2bn to be spread across 26 countries to help deport unwanted migrants and prevent people from leaving in the first place. Separately, the European commission has signed migration deals with Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal and Ethiopia. These migration “compacts” tie development aid, trade and other EU policies to the agenda of returning unwanted migrants from Europe. The EU, in other words, hands over huge sums of money for would-be or thought-to-be migrants to Europe to be apprehended and locked up before they reach the Mediterranean shores. These are some of the most unstable regions in the world. The EU has made agreements not just with legitimate governments, however unsavoury they may be, but also with regional leaders and militias, often in conflict with each other, and with the central authorities, and, de facto, with criminal gangs, too. The impact has been to distort not just the economy but political relations across this whole region. Europe’s policies have turned migrants into a resource to be exploited. A huge new kidnap and detention industry has been established, paid for by Brussels. In Libya alone, there are at least 20,000 migrants held in detention by the General Directorate for Combating illegal Immigration (DCIM), a division of the Ministry of the Interior. Thousands more are held captive by militias and criminal gangs. Amnesty International has detailed how all are held imprisoned in the most degrading of conditions and many subject to torture, sexual abuse and extortion. European governments, Amnesty’s European director, John Dalhuisen, has observed, “have not just been fully aware of these abuses… they are complicit in these abuses”. The EU’s policies, then, present an image of a continent under siege. And of nations willing to enact the most immoral policies to protect Europe’s borders and to push the problem so far away that they can pretend that it does not exist or that the problem is someone else’s. Is it any wonder, then, that many people see migrants as a threat or imagine that there is legitimacy to the claims of the far right? When Hungary built fences on its borders to keep out migrants, it was widely condemned, but what has the EU done but build fences – indeed walls – not round the EU, but in effect in Turkey, Libya, Niger and Eritrea? When Orbán called for refugees to be allowed to request asylum only from outside the EU, it was seen as unacceptable. But what is Emmanuel Macron’s policy now but just that? To build offshore reception centres in countries such as Niger and Chad? “Nobody will admit it in this town,” an EU official told the Politico website last year, “but yes, Orbán’s narrative is prevailing.” Another official put it differently. “It’s not a matter of being in line with Orbán,” he observed. “It’s just that first we had to show things are under control, then we can work on better ways of managing flows.” But “to show things are under control”, mainstream politicians, whether in Brussels, London, Paris, Berlin or Rome, have come “into line with Orbán”. Orbán himself has no doubt as to who has won the debate. As he told journalists before a European council meeting in Brussels in 2016: “The positions which were once condemned, despised, looked down upon and treated with contempt are becoming jointly held positions. And people who stand up for these positions are today being welcomed as equal partners. Our position,” he noted with satisfaction, “is slowly becoming the majority position.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/11/why-hitler-marry-eva-braun-before-suicide","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T10:30:18Z","webTitle":"Why did Hitler marry Eva Braun just before their suicides?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/11/why-hitler-marry-eva-braun-before-suicide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/11/why-hitler-marry-eva-braun-before-suicide","fields":{"headline":"Why did Hitler marry Eva Braun just before their suicides?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Why did Hitler marry Eva Braun just before they killed themselves?

Recently, I was returning to it in a Sainsbury’s car park in Macclesfield with some shopping. Hanging around the rear of the car I noticed an elderly lady wearing a Giles cartoon grandma-style hat with a flower in it and a dark ill-fitting coat. When I approached, she asked: “Young man [I’m 72!], is this your car?” When I replied “Yes”, she whimpered a little and shuffled around the rear of the car to peer in a side window. Then came the swinging 60s punchline: “Young man, I’d like you to know that I lost my virginity in the back of one of those.” I was a bit taken aback but managed to ask if she enjoyed the experience, to which she replied, “No, not really”, and shuffled off with her trolley! So, perhaps the Morris Traveller should be viewed as an essential part of the 1960s sexual revolution and the headline should be. Morris Minor Traveller – swinging 60s icon. Pat Jeater Macclesfield, Cheshire • Ian Allen mentions that the Morris Minor was used among other things as a police car. In the late 1970s my wife had a pale blue one that had previously been a police car – along with a hole in the roof where the radio aerial had been fitted. Ian Arnott Peterborough • No of course the Morris Minor Traveller is no Brexit icon as it was designed by Alec Issigonis, a European immigrant who was the son of a Greek father and a German mother.

The sheer volume of cutting-edge music online means that it can be, even for the most faithful digital trawler, a challenge to keep up – so I, along with Tayyab Amin on alternate months, will be skimming off the best bits. This month’s column features ecstatic rave breakbeats from the US, fizzing bassline bangers with big licks of Jamaican dancehall, Afrofuturistic UK techno, Colombian sound design, and more. Eris Drew – Her Damit podcast In the midwestern US, there’s a devoted network of DIY rave crews that have their “techno Christmas” at the afterparties around Detroit’s annual Movement festival. It was at the gay party Club Toilet that I first heard Eris Drew play – punctuating chaotic jungle breaks with R&amp;B melodies and garage grooves, she was a revelation. A trans woman from Chicago and resident DJ at Smart Bar, Drew calls her sound The Motherbeat. When I interviewed her earlier this year, she described this as “the healing energy contained in music that unlocks the body and forces the body to move. There’s an urgency in the music I play – I’m soaring, looking into the sun as I dance.” For this summer’s upcoming (but currently postponed) Her Damit festival near Berlin, Drew recorded a podcast that taps into this celebratory feeling. Sharda – mix for Crack magazine Bassline is a dance scene that has thrived in the UK while staying under the radar of the wider pop cultural consciousness. It was born in clubs such as Sheffield’s notorious Niche – that nightclub and its reputation are now only memories, but contemporary producers continue to draw from its rolling, euphoric sound, sprinkling it into a wider pool of sounds: R&amp;B, grime, bashment, jungle, dancehall and happy hardcore; rubbery basslines, banter-laced lyrics and cut up piano grooves. Murlo is one such example, and a club music polymath: DJ, producer, visual artist, and boss of Coil Records. The label’s new recruit Sharda has recorded a high-octane mix for Crack magazine – packed with original tracks, including a killer collaboration with Jamaican dancehall vocalist Shanique Marie titled Wanna Know for Manchester label Swing Ting that feels like bingeing on sherbet Dip Dabs in the dance. Afrodeutsche – Break Before Make; live set on NTS with Nkisi Based in Manchester, Afrodeutsche is a producer and DJ of Ghanaian, Russian and German heritage whose debut album, Break Before Make, is out now on legacy UK rave label Skam. Inspired by Afrofuturistic electro and techno, her sound feels part of a new wave of club music – less greyscale 4/4 for time-melting marathons, and more funky Afro and Latinx polyrhythms packed with sinister glee. In the latter half of Non Worldwide co-founder Nkisi’s latest show for NTS Radio, meanwhile, Afrodeutsche plays a live workout of percussive club tracks with the host. Lucrecia Dalt – Pli Colombian musician and vocalist Lucrecia Dalt’s approach to sound is elemental. Using textural snatches of nature, machinery, voices and musical recordings, the former geotechnical engineer uses the earth as a sound palette and source of metaphors, creating music that references historical events, human emotions and potential new worlds. It’s apt, then, that her sixth album (and first for RVNG Intl) is titled Anticlines, after a rock formation that has its oldest strata at the core – for Dalt, to reach out and touch a sound, aesthetic boundaries must be blurred or crossed. She also has a monthly radio show on Red Bull Radio – where, full disclosure, I also work – called Pli. Drawing on poetry, music and conversations, each episode explores a different theme, like “alienated voices” featuring abstracted vocal performances, or songs about architecture. Nina – Secret Thirteen When Hamburg club Golden Pudel almost burned to the ground in 2016, the hearts of house and techno fans across Europe sank – a rinky-dink bar coated in stickers and graffiti that looks out on to the port, Golden Pudel played its part in bringing Helena Hauff’s evil electro to the international club and festival circuit, and has a reputation for friendly dancers who love tough music. Another side of the club, though, is its willingness to play experimental strains of dub, and resident DJ Nina’s recent mix for Secret Thirteen demonstrates this. In the mix’s official blurb, a mid 20th-century abstract expressionist visual work is recommended as a companion piece to the music: an opaque stacking of fine lines, bold and faded, by Kazuo Nakamura, a Japanese-Canadian painter who once said that “scientists and artists are doing the same thing ... This world of pattern is a world we are discovering together.” In her mix, Nina paints patterns of steely ambience that vibrate with tension. This is one for the headphones. Various artists – Patina Echoes Bristol’s musical legacy has been dominated by breakthrough 90s trip-hop acts like Portishead, Massive Attack and Tricky; by dub and reggae, with the city’s strong Afro-Caribbean roots and community dances at the Trinity Centre; and drum’n’bass, championed by Mercury prize-winning Roni Size and the Reprazent crew. Since then, young producers who started going clubbing during the mid-to-late 00s dubstep and post-dubstep waves have been making techno beats that riff on the dub principles of space and bass, and one of the best outfits doing it right now is label-and-party Timedance. This month saw them release their first full-length project, Patina Echoes, a compilation of new tracks by artists from Bristol and those from further afield who share their vision."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/sep/19/nabil-fekir-lyon-manchester-city-france-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-09-19T09:10:58Z","webTitle":"Nabil Fekir’s failed transfer and World Cup glory give Lyon much to celebrate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/19/nabil-fekir-lyon-manchester-city-france-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/sep/19/nabil-fekir-lyon-manchester-city-france-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Nabil Fekir’s failed transfer and World Cup glory give Lyon much to celebrate","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The day after Nabil Fekir joined his France teammates and an estimated million supporters on the Champs-Élysées to show off the World Cup trophy, he was invited to attend another celebration. This time, there were only a few hundred people present at the Stade Francisque-Jomard de Vaulx en Velin – where his father, Mohamed, is president – to catch a glimpse of the town’s most famous son as he was made an honorary citizen. “Thank you all,” whispered a nervous-looking Fekir into the microphone as he addressed the crowd. “We did something beautiful.” As summers go, 2018 will take some beating for the player who turned 25 two days after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia. Despite seeing his proposed £53m move from Lyon to Liverpool collapse days before their opening World Cup match with concerns reported about his fitness following a knee injury, Fekir played a total of 68 minutes in six substitute appearances for Didier Deschamps’s side, including replacing Olivier Giroud in the final. “Winning the World Cup has definitely made it easier for him to move on from Liverpool,” says Dahbia Hattabi, a Lyon-based journalist for website Foot Mercato. “Fekir is a person who is not very expressive but I did not feel he was upset or affected by the failed transfer. When he returned to Lyon he said and repeated several times that it was totally digested. Although he was late to return after the World Cup, we have seen him being fully involved and focused solely on OL.” A brilliant free-kick in the 2-2 draw against Caen at the weekend – his first goal of the season – underlined that Fekir’s mind is back on the job before Lyon’s trip to Manchester City. Nonetheless, having posed for photos wearing a Liverpool shirt and even conducted a welcome interview with the club’s in-house television channel, the sudden collapse of his move must have left a bitter taste. Some reports claimed it was a result of reconstructive surgery on the anterior cruciate ligament injury he suffered against Portugal in September 2015 that caused Liverpool to get cold feet. “I asked him exactly what had happened after the match against Strasbourg in August,” says Hattabi. “And he said: ‘I have heard many things, and they [Liverpool] know the real reason.’ Anyway, it’s old history.” Back where it began in Villeurbanne – a suburb six kilometres north-east of Lyon’s centre known as the birthplace of seven-times tennis grand slam winner Henri Cochet – they are delighted their hero is still around, at least for now. “This is the first place he comes,” Vaulx-en-Velin’s vice-president Farid Berkani told Le Parisien during July’s triumphant homecoming. “He’s a model for all our young people. A big pride for us.” Fekir’s father, a former amateur player, moved to France from Algeria in 1992 and has spent the past two decades volunteering for the club in National 3 (French football’s fifth tier), which has also produced Kurt Zouma and Rachid Ghezzal among others. His son joined as an eight-year-old before returning at 13 after being released by Lyon for being too small – not the last time he would face rejection. Fekir sports a scar down the left side of his face – the legacy of a childhood accident on a visit to his relatives in Tipaza, an hour west of Algiers – and had the knee condition Osgood–Schlatter disease during adolescence. Lyon, perhaps realising their mistake and with Saint-Étienne sniffing around, re-signed Fekir in 2011 and handed him his first professional contract two years later. He established himself at the heart of an exciting young side that featured Alexandre Lacazette and Corentin Tolisso and was called up to a France junior squad for the first time in October 2014, coming on in the disastrous Under-21 European Championship play-off defeat by Sweden. Five months later, following much debate with his family, Fekir was named in Algeria’s squad for the friendlies against Oman and Qatar, only to withdraw 24 hours later after admitting Deschamps had “changed his mind”. “We are still in shock,” said his grandfather in a tearful interview on Algerian television. “We did not expect Nabil to choose France at all. We really hoped to see him one day wear the national colours, but what can you do?” Fekir made his France debut as a substitute in a friendly against Brazil but having scored his first goal in the 4-3 defeat by Belgium in June 2015, he was injured against Portugal and ended up out for nine months. There were fears he would struggle to recapture his form but last season’s 18 league goals from his favoured No 10 position after coach Bruno Génésio handed him the captain’s armband prompted Atlético Madrid and Bayern Munich to compete with Liverpool for his signature. After late interest in the transfer window from Real Madrid and Chelsea, Lyon are expected to offer a new contract to the player they value at more than €60m. Not that Fekir will concern himself with that. “Look, I’ve told you mate: I do not give a fuck,” he said in an interview with French magazine Onze at the start of February when discussing how much he is worth. “Honestly, whether it’s $20m or $10m … Pfff. I don’t make a fuss.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/10/deterring-onshore-windfarms-means-higher-energy-bills-lord-deben","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T12:31:12Z","webTitle":"Deterring onshore windfarms means higher energy bills – Lord Deben","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/10/deterring-onshore-windfarms-means-higher-energy-bills-lord-deben","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/10/deterring-onshore-windfarms-means-higher-energy-bills-lord-deben","fields":{"headline":"Opposing onshore UK windfarms 'means higher energy bills'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ministers must come clean to households about the higher energy bills they face if the UK continues to deter new onshore windfarms, the government’s top climate change adviser has said. Lord Deben, the chair of the committee on climate change (CCC), said there was no logical argument against onshore wind turbines in the parts of the UK that want them. The Conservative peer said the technology was the cheapest form of electricity generation and he hoped the government would rethink its opposition to subsidies to it. The government ended subsidies for the windfarms in 2015 but the energy minister Claire Perry has recently said she is “looking carefully” at a U-turn for windfarms built in Wales and Scotland. Last week, the government gave its backing to windfarms on remote islands, such as the Isle of Lewis. Deben told the Guardian: “There is no doubt, and I feel very strongly about it, that onshore wind is the cheapest form of electricity. If the Scots want to have it, on which basis should we say they shouldn’t have it?” Advocates believe onshore windfarms could be built for subsidies guaranteeing prices as low as £50 per megawatt hour – below the average £62.14 awarded to the latest offshore windfarms and far lower than the £92.50 for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. The payments are a top-up on the wholesale electricity price of around £45/MWh, with the difference paid by householders through their energy bills. Hinkley alone is expected to add £10-15 to annual bills by 2030. “If you don’t build onshore wind, the government has to say how much of an extra cost this is to the public,” said Deben. The CCC advises the government on how to meet its legally binding climate targets. Deben, who as the Conservative MP John Gummer was the environment secretary from 1993 and 1997, added that the government has to make “major changes” to meet its carbon targets for 2025 and 2030, implying that a shift on onshore wind could be one of those. Big British, German and Spanish energy companies have been lobbying the government for a shift on onshore wind. Keith Anderson, the chief executive of ScottishPower, said it was “completely bonkers” that the windfarms were ineligible for subsidies, given they were low cost and low carbon. “2018 has to be the year we secure the future of onshore wind,” he told a recent industry event. Millions of households have seen their energy bills rise in the past few weeks. All of the big six suppliers have increased their prices, blaming government policy costs such as the clean energy subsidies, along with rising wholesale costs. Deben also issued a challenge to housebuilders to make new homes more efficient, saying they had to face up to the “social inequity” of future generations facing unnecessarily high energy bills. “Energy efficiency is a social issue. No house should be built to condemn people in the future to having to pay a great deal for their energy,” he said. He backed better enforcement of building regulations, saying local authorities did not have the resources to check new homes properly. The peer also called on mortgage lenders to begin tying the energy efficiency of properties to the amount buyers can borrow, an idea being given a trial in Wales. His comments were echoed this week by the CCC’s chief executive, Chris Stark, who tweeted that it was “daft that we don’t give greater priority to household energy efficiency”. Deben still feels new nuclear power is needed as part of the UK’s efforts to cut carbon emissions. However, he said new technology and the falling costs of renewables meant the challenge of ensuring energy security was not as great as in the past. “The government has got to recognise that keeping the lights on, which is its first worry, is much easier than thought because you can get a huge amount of energy from offshore wind, smart grids and short-term battery storage.” A spokesperson at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: “The government does not believe that new large-scale onshore wind power is right for England but it could be right for other areas, where local public support exists.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/09/women-peter-stringfellow-sex-work-porn","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T05:00:14Z","webTitle":"While women clashed over the issue of sex work, Stringfellow just thrived | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/09/women-peter-stringfellow-sex-work-porn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/09/women-peter-stringfellow-sex-work-porn","fields":{"headline":"While women clashed over the issue of sex work, Stringfellow just thrived","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Peter Stringfellow’s stint in prison – he served a fortnight in Leeds for selling stolen carpets (rug-running, if you will) – was character-building in every sense. He credited to it all his subsequent attitudes to the law, becoming a tax-paying, straight-and-narrow citizen, which sounds like a floor rather than a ceiling, but in the business of strip-joint entrepreneurship may be more unusual than in other fields. The more practical consequence of his time inside was that it set him on the path to self-employment. And most probably in the 60s, nightclubs of the Stringfellow sensibility were pretty mainstream: he hosted the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Tina Turner, although didn’t, so far as history relates, require them to remove their clothes. In regular living memory, though, he always had the air of a slightly bilious relic. In an egalitarian age, the idea of a social space that women would avoid, for reasons of discomfort or derision, was very dated. Had the arc of history tended towards gender justice, strip joints would have just died out with Benny Hill. But then the 90s happened, and Loaded was born, and all the signifiers we had understood as sexist – breasts everywhere, fishnets, pole dancing – suddenly weren’t. Nothing about the human condition had changed, power hadn’t been redistributed, the patriarchy hadn’t been smashed, and suddenly soft-pornification was supposed to be fine. Yet it was ironic: objectification wasn’t objectionable, because nothing meant what you thought it meant. There was something dicey in all this: to know you are being inauthentic isn’t the same as authenticity. I knew that intellectually because the philosopher Paul de Man was huge in the 90s, but I only understood it in my gut when Spearmint Rhino opened in Tottenham Court Road and held open auditions in the mid-90s. I went along for a joke, for a feature (I was working at the Evening Standard, but I’m pretty sure this was my own idea, nobody made me). It was all so hilarious and post-modern: they want topless women – I’m a woman, I know how to take my top off, what a blast. I’d literally walked on to the stage before it dawned on me: these women are professional dancers; they spend their lives looking perfect, according to some idea of perfection that, like a Marvel character or Barbie, merely reminds you of the female form. Never mind feminism for a second. This is huge money; this is a cotton mill in human form. The means of production are integral to the workers (they’re their breasts, after all) but are still not owned by them. If there’s a joke here it’s a grim, Marxist one. It has sod all to do with irony. That fin-de-siècle playfulness was intellectually corrupted because it was dishonest: it pretended to be ludic rather than exploitative, but somehow, the guys at the top ended up with all the cash, which is much more like exploitation than japing around. But what came after doesn’t strike me as much better. All the moral and modesty arguments against lap dancing and nudity have disintegrated, and the 00s saw the first fully nude licences and sexual entertainment venue licences (of which Peter Stringfellow was the first UK beneficiary, in 2006). But feminists’ arguments have ossified into a stance where they cannot listen to, let alone accommodate the views of sex workers and strippers, because they’re still – in a 70s second-wave style – considered victims by definition, and therefore anything they say that doesn’t give expression to that victimhood is false consciousness. The bizarre evolution of the sex-industry debate is that those who oppose it are ranged against those who work in it, with figures like Peter Stringfellow occupying this arch-villain role that he didn’t seem to mind, and died basically untouched by. • Zoe Williams is a regular contributor to the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/08/chaos-on-the-railways-entirely-predictable","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T15:36:59Z","webTitle":"Chaos on the railways entirely predictable | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/08/chaos-on-the-railways-entirely-predictable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/08/chaos-on-the-railways-entirely-predictable","fields":{"headline":"Chaos on the railways entirely predictable","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The debacle with new railway timetables is entirely of the Tory government’s own making (Report, 6 June). It’s been obvious for years that the franchising system is both dysfunctional and has destroyed the operational economies of scale that were an essential part of the British Rail integrated network. What is truly alarming is the escalating cost of propping up the failing franchises, now in the billions and possibly about to rise yet further if GTR and Northern collapse. As your editorial (5 June) rightly says, in Chris Grayling we see a minister so fixated with privatisation and viscerally opposed to the idea of a public service railway system of the kind used all over the rest of the EU, that he has become incapable of objective judgments and unwilling to accept any responsibility. At the heart of the argument is an economic theory, peddled by rightwing ideologues for the past 40 years, that only private profit can encourage efficiency, that the state can never match the private sector, and that the only measure of market performance is price, dividends and earnings per share in a (fictional) perfectly competitive economic environment. Since none of this has ever been true of rail transport and never can be, the time has surely come for train services to be taken out of private hands and handed over to accountable local transport commissions similar to TfL. Grayling, or more likely his successor, can then put his economic theories to the test in the real world and see which performs better for the public. I have absolutely no doubt what the outcome would be. Adrian Berridge Clacton on Sea, Essex • While I sympathise with commuters around the country suffering daily rail chaos, as a leisure traveller I am very used to weekend and bank holiday services – often sketchy at best – being cancelled due to planned engineering works. We who use the train for reasons other than commuting have long known that we are viewed as second-class citizens. Nevertheless, I am astounded at the proposal (Railcards could be axed under radical plan to simplify fares, 4 June) to “simplify” fares by averaging out the difference between peak and off-peak charges and abolishing “old-fashioned and restrictive” railcards (shame on you, Guardian, for uncritically repeating that description). At a rough calculation, this would see railcard-using off-peak travellers faced with fares of around three times their current level. At a stroke, hundreds of thousands of leisure rail users would be priced off the railways. Some would take to their cars, increasing traffic congestion. Others – non-drivers like myself – would have to endure the purgatory of the long-distance coach or simply travel far less. Shorter day-trips would become almost impossible due to the near absence of rural buses. Meanwhile, rail revenue would tumble as daytime trains ran empty, and the tourism and hospitality industries would take a hit. Congratulations, Rail Delivery Group, on your visionary plan. Rob Sykes Oxford • Your editorial talked about Grayling’s “dogmatic obsession with privatisation”. All the more curious then, in your account of his tenure as justice secretary, that you omit to mention his enforced privatisation of a very large part of the probation service, and his bailing out of those private companies whose calculations about their profit margin per offender proved to be so awry. Also omitted was any reference to the standards of service delivery of some of those companies, who, according to reports from the probation inspectorate, appear to think that a telephone conversation with an offender constitutes an appropriate level of supervisory contact. Andy Stelman Bishops Castle, Shropshire • At present, here in France the rail service is badly disrupted by official strikes twice a week and trains run normally on other days. If Mr Grayling were to implement this system in the UK it might be seen as a significant improvement on the current timetable and go some way to restoring his tarnished reputation.

You could get free counselling","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A group of psychotherapists have volunteered to offer free counselling for people with anxiety related to Brexit. The organisers say the initiative is aimed at preventing people “being sucked into a vortex of gloom and doom” over the prospect of the UK leaving the EU. It came after a survey of 1,300 remain voters found many were still traumatised by the result of the referendum. Asked to express their emotions about the vote the most common words used in the survey were “devastated”, “angry”, “depressed”, “betrayed” and “ashamed”. A team of five registered therapists and psychologists from north London’s Existential Academy have agreed to offer people up to 10 free sessions of therapy. The initiative, known as Emotional Support Service for Europeans, is being led by Emmy van Deurzen, a professor of psychotherapy at Middlesex university and a passionate remainer. She said the survey revealed many people “feel their lives have been totally changed” by Brexit. In a blogpost for the British Psychological Society published on Friday, she wrote: “The vote has struck at the core of their identity and continues to dominate their everyday experience. Some are still in shock and can’t quite believe this is happening.” The scheme is likely to be dismissed as “snowflake nonsense” by those who back Brexit. But Van Deurzen claims some people are “tearing out hair in despair” . And she warned that those who don’t seek help risk their anxiety getting worse. “Being sucked into a vortex of gloom and doom is not good for any of us, and it is vital to remain positive, constructive and purposeful,” she said. Van Deurzen said the vote had already had a profound effect on many of the estimated 3.5 million European citizens living in the UK. “We know that hundreds of thousand are so deeply hurt and upset that they have already left the UK or are planning to do after Brexit,” Van Deurzen wrote. She adds: “Sometimes it almost seems as if we are on trial, as if a social experiment is being rolled out to test our personal resilience and sanity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/08/donald-trump-shows-no-sign-compromise-flies-in-g7-summit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T09:24:58Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump calls for G7 to readmit Russia ahead of summit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/08/donald-trump-shows-no-sign-compromise-flies-in-g7-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/08/donald-trump-shows-no-sign-compromise-flies-in-g7-summit","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump calls for G7 to readmit Russia ahead of summit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Donald Trump has called for Russia to be readmitted to the G7 club of world leaders, opening up a new rift with US allies who swiftly contradicted him at a contentious summit in Quebec. Although there were smiles and handshakes between Trump and his counterparts from Europe, Canada and Japan, there was no sign by Friday night that they were any closer on the deeply divisive issues of trade, climate change and policy towards Moscow. Trump made his comments on the way to the summit, saying: “Why are we having the meeting without Russia being in the meeting? Russia should be in the meeting, it should be a part of it.” In a Russian television interview due to be aired on Saturday, President Vladimir Putin said that dialogue with Trump could be “constructive”. Trump is “a serious-minded person who knows how to listen to people and respond to their arguments. This leads me to believe that dialogue may prove to be constructive.” The last meeting between Trump and Putin was a brief exchange in Vietnam last November. In meetings on Friday with Emmanuel Macron of France and Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, a jovial Trump claimed to have good personal relations with the leaders, and claimed at his meeting with Trudeau: “We’ve made a lot of progress”. After his session with the French president, Trump said: “The United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union, and we’re working it out. And Emmanuel has been very helpful in that regard. And something is going to happen, and I think it will be very positive.” However, a senior official at the summit in the resort town of La Malbaie said no headway had been made in talks about new tariffs the US has imposed on imports of steel and aluminium – and there were strong doubts that the seven leaders would be able to agree on a joint communique by the end of the two-day meeting. “It was a predictable discussion,” the official said. “Trump recited his figures on trade. The Europeans brought up conflicting figures that showed overall they had lower tariffs than the US. It was very much six against one.” A second official said that European leaders made “an attempt to set the record straight, pointing out that the EU and US have the most expansive trade and investment in the world, and 70% of all foreign direct investment”. At one point, the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, offered to visit the US to bridge the divide between the competing US and EU narratives. Trump did not accept or reject the offer, witnesses said. Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian foreign minister, said the discussions had been “cordial” but it was clear the G7 leaders were far from agreement from a common statement. She said the sherpas, officials negotiating the consensus communique, had only had a few hours’ sleep on Thursday night. “Work on the communique continues,” Freeland said. “We’ll see where we land ... It could be another late night for our hardworking sherpas.” At a working dinner on Friday night, the leaders were due to discuss foreign policy, including Trump’s talks with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, on Tuesday. With discussion of Russian policy on the agenda, Trump’s comments about Russia caused consternation among his G7 partners. The country has been suspended from the summit for four years, for its intervention in eastern Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea. It marked a dramatic break from the position taken by the Canadian hosts, Washington’s main European allies and Trump’s own state department, who all insist Moscow must withdraw from Ukraine before normal relations are resumed. Senior officials lined up to contradict Trump. Theresa May told Sky News: “Let’s remember why the G8 became the G7. And before discussions could begin on any of this, we would have to ensure Russia is amending its ways and taking a different route.” Trump’s remarks on Russia cut across a UK initiative at the summit to create a rapid response unit to combat state-sponsored aggression, such as cyber-attacks and the poisoning of dissidents which have been blamed on Russia. Freeland said Canadian officials had brought up the issue in bilateral meetings. “Canada’s position is absolutely clear, that there are no grounds whatsoever for bringing Russia with its current behaviour back into the G7,” she said. Trump appeared to win support from the newest invitee to the G7 attendee, the incoming Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, who tweeted: “I agree with president [Trump]. Russia should re-enter the G8. It is in the interests of all.” Other European leaders challenged Conte on his statement on Friday morning, and according to officials familiar with that meeting, he insisted that Italy’s policy had not changed, and that he thought Russia should only be readmitted when conditions were right. Earlier, a Russian government spokesman also appeared wary, with Dmitry Peskov, saying in a brief statement: “Russia is focused on other formats, apart from the G7.” The remarks, at a time when Trump’s election campaign is under investigation for possible links with Moscow – raised eyebrows in Washington. “This is weak,” Ben Sasse, a Republican senator from Nebraska, said in a swiftly issued statement. “Putin is not our friend and he is not the president’s buddy. He is a thug using Soviet-style aggression to wage a shadow war against America, and our leaders should act like it.” Tensions were already high before the two-day summit, after a public dispute about trade between Trump and his French and Canadian counterparts, Macron and Trudeau. At stake is the prospect of the current bout of tit-for-tat tariffs between the major western economies turning into an unrestrained international trade war. The tone in the immediate run-up to thesummit showed no sign of compromise between a US president determined to disrupt the status quo to force more favourable terms for his country, and six US allies resolved to stop him. Trump is due to leave La Malbaie early on Saturday, missing sessions on climate change and the health of the oceans, to meet Kim Jong-un in Singapore.Trump had sparred with other G7 leaders over trade well into the night before the summit, accusing the EU and Canada of unfair business practices, and then resumed his polemic around 6am US time, complaining about Canadian dairy tariffs. “Looking forward to straightening out unfair trade deals with the G7 countries,” Trump tweeted. “If it doesn’t happen, we come out even better!” Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said the summit would be “far from easy”. “What worries me most is the fact that the rules-based international order is being challenged, quite surprisingly not by the usual suspects, but by its main architect and guarantor, the US,” Tusk said at a press conference in La Malbaie. “We will not stop trying to convince president Trump that undermining this order makes no sense at all, because it will only play into the hands of those who seek a new post-west order, where liberal democracy and fundamental freedoms would cease to exist. This is in the interest of neither the US nor Europe.” May, who sat next to Trump at Friday’s afternoon session, was forthright in her criticism of his decision to introduce tariffs. She described his actions as “deeply regrettable”, and said that to seek to justify a move that would damage the economies of some of the US’s closest allies on the grounds of national security “makes it harder to understand and to explain to our businesses and our electorate”. May also warned that WTO-sanctioned tariffs would become unavoidable unless a way back was found quickly. The EU has submitted restrictions on US goods from denim to Harley Davidson motorbikes due to come in by next month. May made it clear that she did not want the situation to escalate. “If you tax trade through tariffs there is no guarantee that domestic sources will replace it, plus the loss of trade undermines competition it reduces productivity removes the incentive to innovate and makes everyone poorer.” On Thursday, Macron berated Trump for imposing unilateral tariffs rather than going through international arbitration, and for walking out of a multilateral nuclear deal with Iran. “The risk is to create a world of survival of the fittest. That is not good for us nor for any of our friends in the world,” Macron tweeted. “Tensions are mounting everywhere. This G7 is going to be demanding.” • This article was amended on 12 June 2018 to correct a word in a quote from Theresa May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/08/brexiteers-radical-rhetoric-tory-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T11:04:33Z","webTitle":"I’ll say this for the Brexiteers – they’ve made radical rhetoric respectable | Owen Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/08/brexiteers-radical-rhetoric-tory-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/08/brexiteers-radical-rhetoric-tory-brexit","fields":{"headline":"I’ll say this for the Brexiteers – they’ve made radical rhetoric respectable","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The revolution is being betrayed! That is the battle cry of the Tory Brexiteer ultras: that a dastardly counter-revolutionary assault on their sacred project is under way. Yesterday’s latest non-resignation by the Brexit secretary David Davis – having secured a time-limited backstop that the EU will never accept and that has no actual time limit – and his briefing against the prime minister for “Brexit backsliding” was the latest act in the Great Betrayal saga. That the Daily Mail will now be edited by a rightwing remainer rather than a rightwing Brexiteer has only added to the mounting panic. Then came the Boris Johnson leak: not only lauding Donald Trump and craving his approach to politics, but castigating the Treasury as “the heart of remain”. The Tory Brexiteers have dressed themselves in revolutionary garb, posing as insurgent Jacobins. “We have initiated revolution,” as Tory remainer Dominic Grieve bemoaned last year, “and the trouble with revolutions is you’re never quite sure what’s going to happen next.” Their opponents are “enemies of the people” and “saboteurs” and “traitors”. They claim the establishment is seeking to subvert the popular will. To be clear, I think it’s all nonsense – the Tory right are reactionaries, not revolutionaries, who wish to hand the economic elite more wealth and power through tax cuts, privatisation and deregulation. But by legitimising revolutionary rhetoric, they have helped the left more than they can ever know. How can the Tories pose as bastions of stability and order against the revolutionary menace of the left? That was, after all, their traditional posture. They wove a national myth about British exceptionalism, rooted in the 18th-century philosophy of Edmund Burke, that Britain repudiated radical change in favour of moderate gradualism, unlike the hotheads across the Channel. This myth airbrushed out the tumult and struggles of our history, but it served a purpose: to portray the left as somehow un-British, as alien to the national character. But on both sides of the Atlantic the right has adopted a revolutionary style, posing as insurgents against a corrupt, self-serving elite. Labour is run by genuine radicals, who want to end the 40-year-old neoliberal experiment and transform British society. Traditionally, the Tories would have presented this as a dangerous project that promised nothing but upheaval. They undoubtedly still will – but it can hardly pack the same punch, can it? That is no longer an option, is it? The Tory Brexiteers have not only made revolutionary rhetoric legitimate, they’ve made it almost compulsory in British politics. They have stopped the left looking dangerous, and so made a peaceful, democratic socialist revolution all the more likely. And for that, I suppose, we should be grateful. • Owen Jones is a regular contributor to the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/08/san-francisco-vape-flavoured-tobacco-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T14:51:30Z","webTitle":"So long, suckers: San Francisco upholds ban on flavoured vaping products","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/08/san-francisco-vape-flavoured-tobacco-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/08/san-francisco-vape-flavoured-tobacco-ban","fields":{"headline":"So long, suckers: San Francisco upholds ban on flavoured vaping products","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s a victory for anyone who has ever had to walk in the slipstream of a cherry-scented cloud: voters in San Francisco have overwhelmingly backed a measure to restrict the sale of flavoured tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes and vaping liquids packaged as juice boxes or candies. Many expected the vote to be close run, but the final tally came out with 68% in favour of proposition E, which has been described as one of the most restrictive policies on vaping in the US. The proposition passed despite its opponents far outspending groups that support the ban. Much of that funding came from the RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company, which pumped an estimated $12m into an ad campaign – although judging by the commercials themselves, it’s difficult to see exactly where the budget was spent. Opposition also came from Greg Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, who denounced the vote as a travesty, bemoaning that “anti-vaping extremists would mislead SF voters into making it harder for adult smokers to quit”. Health groups in the city, however, have praised the vote as a model for the future. Concerns about a “vaping epidemic” spreading through America’s schools have been on the rise for the past few years, with vaping – or Juuling, as it’s often called, after the most popular brand – reportedly increased by 900% between 2011 and 2015 among high-schoolers. Many see proposition E as an important step against products that entice teenagers into using tobacco products with sweet flavours. Dr Melissa Welch of the American Heart Association, has said she hopes the vote will be the first step in ending “the sale of candy-flavored tobacco before nicotine addiction claims a new generation of young people”. The results of the vote came on the same day that the FDA announced they were continuing to crack down on vaping among young people. The FDA commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, said in a statement: “We’re going to hold industry participants responsible for actions that promote youth addiction. There’s no acceptable number of children using tobacco products.” Vaping companies have been aggressively marketing to students, going as far as to offer scholarships so they can appear on top university websites, including Harvard and Berkeley. The scholarships normally involve completing an essay on the dangers of tobacco and whether vaping could be a healthier alternative. Retailers and review websites including SmokeTastic, Slick Vapes and DaVinci Vaporizer have previously offered grants. Researchers at Georgia State University found that Juul, in particular, had been adept at marketing to young people by reducing spending on traditional ads and focusing on viral social media campaigns that use “artsy, professional-grade photographs to display its products and evoke lifestyle feelings such as relaxation, freedom and sex appeal”. Since then, Juul has launched a new campaign advising teenagers not to use their products."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/09/high-street-crisis-darlington-stores-retailers","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"The high street fights back: 'I believe Darlington can thrive'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/09/high-street-crisis-darlington-stores-retailers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/09/high-street-crisis-darlington-stores-retailers","fields":{"headline":"The high street fights back: 'I believe Darlington can thrive'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Darlington used to be like Harrogate years ago,” says 65-year-old Jenny McGee, as she comes out of Binns, an art deco department store at one end of Darlington town centre. “People used to tell me about how all the women here wore these nice hats and coats with gloves. It was a smart place.” The Tees Valley market town found out this week that Binns, bought by House of Fraser in the 1950s, is to close, along with 31 other HoF department stores around the country. McGee, who used to run a hair salon, says she is devastated by the news. “I come here about twice a week. It’s a lovely place to meet people and go for a coffee,” she says. House of Fraser’s announcement on Thursday that it would shut more than half of its UK stores, came after Marks &amp; Spencer said last month that it was planning to close 100 stores, among them its shop in Darlington. The two stores sit at either end of the town’s main shopping thoroughfare, with its range of handsome historic buildings. Once a major shopping centre for people from surrounding villages, in recent years the town centre has lost a British Home Stores, a TK Maxx, a McDonald’s and a Starbucks, leaving it with more than its fair share of discount stores, charity shops and empty units. “They’ll probably just board Binns up like they did with British Home Stores and it’ll make the town look so poor, which it isn’t,” says McGee. Chris McEwan, cabinet member for economy and regeneration on Darlington borough council, says the closure of the two stores was, in some ways, inevitable, but that a “cruel twist of fate” brought the announcements in such quick succession. “I think these companies have made a strategic directional change and they’re saying, ‘We’re smelling the coffee and we want to get out of medium-sized towns’,” he says. For Rachel Anderson, head of policy and representation at North East Chamber of Commerce, shopping centres like Darlington’s should be thriving. “If you look at the figures for the Tees Valley, by far the most affluent boroughs are Stockton and Darlington,” she says. “Darlington has pockets of deprivation, but its proximity to the east coast mainline, the airport and the A1 means there is relatively low unemployment and some high-quality jobs. It is really quite affluent.” Like many towns of a similar size, says Anderson, it has suffered from “leakage” – shoppers being pulled away from town centres to places like shopping malls – Teeside Park, a retail and leisure development in Thornaby-on-Tees, is about a 25-minute drive away. Jonathan Liddle’s family have been running a fish stall in Darlington’s covered market – which stands opposite Binns – since 1970. He recognises that the closure of Binns will bring difficulties, but says he is trying to keep his “chin up and mind open” to the new trends in how people shop. “People like coming here,” he says, after greeting a customer by his first name. “But people’s lives have changed so much. The mums and dads both work and they’re very busy and they do need to do their shopping at Aldi at 8pm,” he says. “The traditional older shopper still comes to us, and the younger shopper loves to come to us – but only when they have time.” Robin Blair is vice-chair of Darlington retail market stalls association, as well as the proprietor of JJ Blair and Sons, a grocer and smallholder that has traded from the market hall for 140 years of its 150-year existence. He refuses to believe that the closure of Binns could signal the end for Darlington high street. “We’re going to have to work harder and to provide a different sort of service. But the market hall would be empty if people didn’t want it and it isn’t empty,” he says, gesturing to his busy stall.” New plans for the market hall involve creating more eating and drinking areas, and spaces for musical performances. “Markets and town centres are important to the social side to life. As you can see, we’re not dead,” says Blair. “We save the NHS a lot of money. People come here to shop and have a chat and, when they go away, they’re not depressed.” McEwan agrees that there needs to be what Anderson describes as “a reassessment of what the town centre is for”. He insists that the council has been trying to prepare for the flight of the big chains by deploying “operational tactical interventions” – like arranging Christmas markets and street theatre – designed to give people more reasons to travel into town. “But there’s only so much you can do when you’ve had £50m taken off you by central government,” he adds. “I’m not trying to make a political point. It’s just how it is.” He says the council is going to have to think radically about what to do with the Binns building – which underwent a £2m refurbishment as recently as 2016 – as it is not going to be easy to find a company to take on such a large space. “It is the biggest unit in the town, so we cannot stand by and allow it to be boarded up and look like crap. We just can’t – morally or economically,” says McEwan. “So we’ve got to think of ways of intervening. I just don’t know what it is at the moment.” Local Labour MP Jenny Chapman says that in the light of the departure of big high street brands, the town needs to focus on nurturing its independent businesses – of which there are a comparatively high number. She points to the area around Grange Road, just around the corner from Binns, which boasts smart delis, cafes, a gin bar and upmarket hairdressers. “This is going to be tough, it really, really is,” she says of the impending store closures. “But that doesn’t mean we can’t build something good from this. You’ve got to be optimistic or you will fail. I believe that Darlington can be a thriving town centre, but the offer is changing whether we like that or not. “It’s happening, so let’s try and make it change for the better.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/08/paul-dacre-gone-daily-mail-brexit-geordie-greig","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T13:43:03Z","webTitle":"With Paul Dacre gone, will the Daily Mail change its tune on Brexit? | Hugo Dixon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/08/paul-dacre-gone-daily-mail-brexit-geordie-greig","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/08/paul-dacre-gone-daily-mail-brexit-geordie-greig","fields":{"headline":"With Paul Dacre gone, will the Daily Mail change its tune on Brexit?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Will a lame-duck editor be able to bully people over Brexit as much as he could in his heyday? That’s one of the key questions raised by Paul Dacre’s upcoming retirement as editor of the Daily Mail. The other is whether an editor shapes readers’ views or merely reflects them. We’ll soon have a real-life experiment when the pro-European Geordie Greig takes over from the arch-Brexiter Dacre. It reminds one of the switcheroo between Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd in the movie Trading Places, which was designed to settle the old chestnut of whether nature or nurture shapes our personalities. In both cases, the answer is a bit of both. The extent to which a new Daily Mail editor matters could be vital to the future of our country. Dacre has ruled by fear in a reign lasting over a quarter of a century. His journalists don’t want to cross him. Nor do Tory politicians. They fear Dacre’s four-line whip more than Theresa May’s three-line one. But will he still have as much clout in the months leading up to his retirement in November? Will the Daily Mail’s journalists, who are astute readers of internal office politics, instead subtly shift their line in preparation for Greig’s arrival? And will Tory MPs thinking of rebelling against May’s shambolic Brexit be so scared of being branded traitors, enemies of the people, saboteurs or whatever new insult Dacre dreams up? They could endure a few rough months if they rebel. But by the time of the next election in 2022, the bully-boy and his attack dogs could be forgotten. This, of course, assumes that Greig will change the Daily Mail’s line on Brexit. Some think he won’t, because Dacre will still be breathing down his neck as editor-in-chief and chair of Associated Newspapers. But it won’t be easy for the old editor to be a puppet-master because Greig will report to Lord Rothermere, the pro-European proprietor. Others think the new editor won’t change because he won’t want to abandon Dacre’s supposedly winning formula. But Greig is currently the Mail on Sunday’s editor. Taking a markedly more pro-European line there than Dacre hasn’t damaged its fortunes. The changing of the guard will happen at a crucial moment in the Brexit debate, roughly when parliament gives its verdict on whatever miserable deal the prime minister manages to negotiate. Greig will have an opportunity to give the honest verdict that we are damaging both our prosperity and our power, rather than pretend that we are entering a land flowing with milk and honey. As a new editor, he will also be free to argue that the people should have the final say on the deal – and the chance to stay in the EU if they don’t like it. What’s more, if there is such a “people’s vote”, it is no longer a foregone conclusion that the Daily Mail will tell its readers to vote for self-mutilation. Either way, it is a fair bet that Greig won’t be dripping anti-European venom into readers’ veins or stoking xenophobia with as much enthusiasm as Dacre has. We may then find out whether the Mail really has the power to shape the national debate. • Hugo Dixon is co-founder of CommonGround"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/08/former-fbi-agent-ali-soufan-isis-is-not-over-it-will-take-a-different-shape","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T14:53:30Z","webTitle":"Former FBI agent Ali Soufan: ‘Isis is not over – it will take a different shape’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/08/former-fbi-agent-ali-soufan-isis-is-not-over-it-will-take-a-different-shape","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/08/former-fbi-agent-ali-soufan-isis-is-not-over-it-will-take-a-different-shape","fields":{"headline":"Former FBI agent Ali Soufan: ‘Isis is not over – it will take a different shape’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Some American teenagers dream of a glamorous career in the FBI, a chance to shoot guns and catch criminals, but the idea had not occurred to Ali Soufan. At least, not until The X Files. “Mulder and Scully were going round the world looking for aliens,” he says, laughing. It looked fun. Besides, he did not believe he would get in; he was just intrigued by the process. Why did he think they would not accept him? “Well, look at me; I don’t look like an FBI agent, at least I didn’t at the time.” He was an Arab-American and a bit of an intellectual. “I just felt that I wasn’t a law-enforcement guy, that wasn’t what I wanted to do in my life. But I went, I took all the tests.” They offered him a job. Soufan, who had just completed a master’s in foreign relations, thought he would return to academia if it did not work out. It was 1997 and Soufan was in his mid-20s. Because of his background – he was born in Lebanon and spoke Arabic – he was assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force, which was focused on Palestinian and Iraqi groups. But he had become interested in Osama bin Laden while reading Arabic newspapers as a student and in 1998 wrote a memo on Bin Laden for his superiors. It made it all the way up to the head of the national security division, John O’Neill, who would become a mentor and friend (O’Neill later became head of security at the World Trade Center and was killed on 9/11). The FBI and the CIA were already monitoring Bin Laden but Soufan claims “they only looked at him as a financier of terrorism, not as a terrorist operative”. Soufan, though, predicted that Bin Laden would be “a lot of trouble down the road ... We had to take him seriously. [He was] trying to present himself as a former mujahid who fought against the Soviets and now he’s trying to bring all these mujahideen to do a reconstruction in the Muslim world. He was trying to open highways and farms and all these things. When you see these guys who have a lot of [fighting] experience – many of them cannot go home because they were wanted [in their countries] – and he’s forming some kind of Islamic army, I think, if you know a little bit of history, you know that’s not going to go well.” In his book, Anatomy of Terror, Soufan traces the evolution of terror organisations, from Bin Laden and 9/11 through the ill-advised “war on terror” to the destabilisation of the Middle East and the emergence of Islamic State and other jihadi groups – and the foreign fighters attracted to fighting for them. The missing link in the west’s counter-terrorism strategies, he says, is “not looking into what these folks believe in. Ideology is the cornerstone of these organisations. That’s why we should not [be distracted] by different names, different groups – this is al-Qaida, this is Daesh – I think we have to go into the glue that pulls these things together. It is ideology and we have to deal with that. If we don’t, we will continue to suffer for years to come.” He sums up the ideology as “hijacked terminology from Islam”, a narrative that “successfully peddles the idea the entire world is engaged in war against Islam, that anyone who does not believe in the ‘us versus them’ narrative is not to be trusted. We can tackle that message by exposing the basic hypocrisy of this movement that claims monopoly to the purest Islamic piety even as it routinely bombs mosques and marketplaces and kills other Muslims – more than 90% of their victims are Muslim.” Terrorism thrives in chaos. Soufan points out that stage one of al-Qaida’s strategy, laid out in the jihadi handbook Management of Savagery, is to create, or take advantage of, regions of chaos or “savagery” and move in to fill the vacuum. Al-Qaida is playing the long game, he says; Isis was too quick to create its caliphate and it could not hang on to it. “Before we only had one vacuum, in Afghanistan,” says Soufan. “They were operating from there and spreading their message. Now we have so many vacuums – Syria, Yemen, Libya, northern Nigeria, Tunisia, the Philippines – and it’s expanding. That’s very dangerous. We have to pay attention to these kind of things.” We meet in a hotel suite in London. Soufan – warm, smiling, quick to laugh – seems far too cheerful for a person who has spent his career witnessing brutality. His dark suit is nondescript, but his boots are the most pristine I have ever seen. (Soufan is no stranger to a bit of glamour: he produced the TV series The Looming Tower, based on Lawrence Wright’s Pulitzer-winning book. It stars Jeff Daniels as O’Neill and Tahar Rahim as Soufan and follows their stories.) He was an FBI agent for only eight years, but it was a tumultuous time – he investigated the US embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and led the investigation into the suicide attack that tore a hole in the warship USS Cole, killing 17 sailors and injuring many more. At the time of 9/11, Soufan was one of only eight Arabic speakers in the FBI and the only one in New York. He interrogated suspects at Guantánamo Bay and foiled terror plots. Later, he left the FBI, disillusioned and considered a bit of a trouble-maker after speaking out against CIA interrogation methods. Soufan now runs an intelligence consultancy called The Soufan Group. He remains critical of much of the US’s foreign policy. The Iraq invasion, he says, “was a colossal mistake ... we should have focused on Afghanistan, on al-Qaida and the Taliban. We should have swiftly brought them to justice. By 2003, al-Qaida was a dead breed; it was the invasion of Iraq that gave them new oxygen. Imagine if all these trillions of dollars we wasted was focused on rebuilding Afghanistan, creating better education, better economic opportunities in areas where al-Qaida and Isis are recruiting. I think the world could have been a better place.” He says the west has failed in the Middle East because there is no strategy. “In Afghanistan, we had no idea what to do after the military victory. It’s the failure of imagination. We always say we could not imagine it would take fewer troops to take out Saddam [Hussein] than it would take to secure Iraq after Saddam; we could not imagine somebody flying a plane into a building; we could not imagine we’ll be in Afghanistan for 17 years. Our imagination is very limited, limited by our perceptions, knowledge, experience, partisan politics. That is why I suggest we have to have empathy – understanding the enemy, seeing the world through their eyes. This is extremely important, knowing them on a deeper level, so we can start predicting their moves.” He says Donald Trump’s wish to get out of Syria may be a good idea, but only if a regional agreement is made – “and that has nothing, I hate to say it, to do with the Syrians themselves. It is a mini Yalta [conference] between Turkey, the US, Iran, Russia, Israel, the Gulf states, because everybody is fighting for their own piece of the pie. I think it’s good to get out of meddling with other people’s problems, but we need to figure out what we’re leaving. Do we surrender Syria to Russia and Iran? What’s going to happen to our allies in the region?” Soufan says the threat from Isis “is not over. It will take a different shape and I won’t be surprised if we start to see an alliance between Isis and al-Qaida in different areas in the Middle East. Al-Qaida is thinking in long-term strategy. They’re building alliances.” He believes “al-Qaida is stronger today than they were before 9/11. They are focusing locally, but even if a small portion of these guys decides to go global again I think we’re going to have a big problem.” In the west, he says, “one of the things we really need to focus on is building bridges with communities that might feel isolated because of the counter-terrorism strategies. Our strongest asset in defeating [the Islamist terrorism] narrative is our western values.” Values of inclusiveness and tolerance. Values that have been rocked by the rise of rightwing extremism. How much of a problem is it? “Big. It’s huge. Look at antisemitism in the US, in the UK, in France. Hate crimes are on the rise. It’s part of an agenda that is going around the western world. They call themselves the ultra-right; I call them neo-Nazis.” He is critical, too, of the UK’s counter-terror strategy, Prevent, which has focused on Muslim communities. “The policy can be successful or not by the way it is perceived. That’s why it should be very clear from a branding perspective that we’re not only talking about Muslims, we’re talking about all sorts of radicalisation.” Soufan grew up in Lebanon, where his father was a journalist, in the grip of civil war. “When there was bombing, you hide,” he says. “If there is shelling, it depends how heavy, but you’ll go to the basement or the stairway. I thought it was very normal until we moved and you realised: ‘Wow, that wasn’t normal at all.’” He remembers two rival militias fighting outside, with the family’s building trapped in the middle. “They were fighting all day and we were stuck in the stairway and you could hear the RPGs, the guns. Then one of the militias brought a tank and they start hitting towards the others.” All the doors of the building were blown in by the echo of the tank fire. Did he lose family members and friends? “Friends,” he says. “People in school.” At 16, the family moved to the US. He says he loved it – and still does. “I know we’re going through a harsh period now, but it will continue to be the shining city on the hill. The lights might be a little bit dim now, but we’ll put them on again. We have no other option.” Soufan was in Yemen, investigating the USS Cole attack, when 9/11 happened. It became clear the two attacks were linked. It also soon became clear that the CIA had withheld information Soufan had asked for repeatedly, information that might have helped prevent the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. “Unfortunately, we still have no accountability for that,” says Soufan. “Not one single person was held accountable.” Could he have done anything differently? “Sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night and think about it. But you know …” There is a long pause. “I’ve been thinking about it for many years. I can ask for the information and I did, many times, on paper. But if people are telling you: ‘We don’t have anything,’ you have to take it on face value. I hope, as institutions, we learned from it. Information that is essential to stop bad people from killing innocent people is not something you or your institution owns, it’s for the American people.” In 2002, Soufan was brought in to interrogate Abu Zubaydah, the US’s first “high-value detainee” captured since 9/11, who allegedly had links to al-Qaida. Zubaydah gave them intelligence that stopped a terrorist attack. “He’s an interesting figure, because I was really surprised how fast he cooperated,” says Soufan. Several months later, a CIA team was brought in to perform what was euphemistically termed enhanced interrogation techniques (EIT) on Zubaydah, even though Soufan said they had already got out of him everything they could. It was lower-level techniques – enforced nudity and sleep deprivation – but Soufan complained. (Zubaydah was later waterboarded repeatedly.) “That was why I was pulled out of the black site and the FBI was pulled out of the interrogation. That actually put a big target on my back.” Soufan says he complained for several reasons. First, he believed EITs did not produce good information (he likes to point out that the lie that Iraq had WMDs, used to justify the invasion, was produced as a result of torture). Also, torture helps terrorist recruitment – images from Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay “still help radicalise young men around the world” – and is fundamentally “not who we are”. So, how does he feel about Gina Haspel, who ran a covert CIA detention site during the “war on terror”, becoming director of the CIA? “She has a lot of baggage and that is going to be used against her,” he says. “People who were involved in torture are coming back to run the show, to rewrite history, and I think that is a problem. That’s a page we thought we had turned over and now, with her nomination, they are insisting on turning back the page, trying to erase it and write something else.” Soufan lasted at the FBI for another two years following his experience with Zubaydah, eventually leaving in 2005. Did he worry about the effect of complaining on his career? “Absolutely – and that’s why I left eventually, because it became unbearable. You’re supervising a counter-terrorism team and every time you want to do something the CIA say no. For the sake of my team …” He pauses. He was the problem? “Yes, specifically me. That’s fine, that’s what I believed in. It was the right thing to do and I’m glad I did, because, as I predicted, this became public.” Soufan later testified at a Senate judiciary committee hearing on torture. “Imagine if I was part of it and the FBI was part of it,” he says, leaning forward in his chair. “I don’t think we would have a very good position in the US to talk about human rights and values and principles.” He seems optimistic that, one day, we can all be better.

Video spread on social media over the weekend showing the jogger rifling through a local homeless man’s possessions in a public park, dumping blankets into a lake and carrying property to a nearby trash can as a group of onlookers tried to stop him. “I’m picking up trash, what do you want me to do? Look at this,” the man said in the video, which was captured by JJ Harris, an Oakland film-maker and photographer. “It’s disgusting.” In an interview Monday, Harris said: “I was just completely taken aback ... This is a homeless man’s stuff – a guy who is always peaceful, never causing trouble, always giving you a smile. That he would do this to another human being, the lack of compassion is astonishing.” The episode happened at Lake Merritt, a popular Bay Area park and the site of another recent viral video of a white woman calling police on two black men barbecuing. That woman, who became known internationally as “BBQ Becky”, was the latest in a series of examples of white people calling law enforcement on African Americans going about their daily lives and harassing people of color with racist rants. The jogger, who is white and was wearing large headphones, mostly ignored other park-goers who said they knew the homeless man and that he had long stayed in that spot. Supporters, who have raised nearly $2,000 for the man since the Friday incident, identified him as Drew. Harris, who lives near the lake and frequently hangs out in this section of the park, said he had often seen the homeless man there and that he kept his possessions in order. “His stuff is in the corner, not blocking the walkway,” Harris said, adding that he had decided to start filming when he realized the jogger was trashing someone’s belongings. “I see somebody just throwing huge amounts of blankets into the lake. I was just shocked.” In the video, the jogger says “it smells” after one person tries to stop him. The footage also shows the man kicking the belongings and tossing then around, and when someone asks him why he threw stuff into the lake, he responds: “That was an accident.” The video, however, showed a large pile of stuff floating in the water. Onlookers said the man was spreading his belongings around, making more of a mess. The Oakland police department said it was investigating the incident. People have since been donating blankets, food, clothes and other items to Drew, according to Harris. Kenzie Smith, a lifelong Oaklander and one of the men barbecuing in last month’s viral incident, has been coordinating fundraising. Smith said he hopes the donations would help with basic necessities, along with healthcare and eventually housing. “This happened in the community and it was the community who responded to quickly,” Smith said in an email. “It shows Drew that people do care.” Oakland, located across the bay from San Francisco, is an historically black city suffering through a major housing and homelessness crisis amid rapid gentrification and displacement. The video emerged days after a man in a suit was caught on camera kicking a person lying on a sidewalk in San Francisco. “It just feels like this is the direction Oakland is going,” said Harris. “People are going to need to step up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/12/juan-carlos-osorio-mexico-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T09:00:45Z","webTitle":"How a stepladder, Liverpool and Man City helped educate Juan Carlos Osorio","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/12/juan-carlos-osorio-mexico-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/12/juan-carlos-osorio-mexico-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"How a stepladder, Liverpool and Man City helped educate Juan Carlos Osorio","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Earlier this month, as the final whistle blew at the Azteca, the boos rang out. Mexico had beaten Scotland 1-0 in their last home friendly before leaving for the World Cup, but that was not enough. “Fuera, Osorio,” fans chanted, calling for their manager to be sacked. Juan Carlos Osorio himself seemed unconcerned, claiming not to have heard the jeers. He is probably used to them. He may have won 31 of his 47 games in charge of the national side, losing only seven, but he has never been popular. He is different, his own man with his own ideas, and it probably doesn’t help that he is not Mexican. Osorio has always been something of an outsider – so much so that he is known as El Recreacionista for his unorthodox approach. He may be Colombian and he may be coach of Mexico, but the 57-year-old’s education was thoroughly English. Osorio was a midfielder for Internacional in Brazil and Once Caldas in Manizales before injury ended his playing career at the age of 26. He went to the US, where he played briefly for the University of New Haven and then completed a BA in Exercise Science at Southern Connecticut State University. He moved to New York and set up a gym, but Osorio wanted to get back into football, so he sold his business and used the proceeds to move to Liverpool to study for a diploma in Science and Football at John Moores University. The lectures weren’t enough, though, so Osorio would try to observe the training sessions of the two local Premier League sides. Walter Smith’s Everton were welcoming; Gerard Houllier and Roy Evans’ Liverpool were not, so Osorio rented a room in a house on Crown Road owned by an Everton-supporting family called McManus that overlooked Liverpool’s Melwood training ground. If the weather was good, he would stand on a step-ladder in the garden; if it was raining he would peer out of the bedroom window. Osorio would also regularly go to watch Blackburn and Bolton. “Because I came from a Latin country where everything was short passes and tiki-taka, then coming to England learning the complete opposite way of playing was very, very productive for me,” he said in an interview with Sky. “And in itself, it has strengthened me a great deal.” Osorio returned to the US and became a conditioning coach with New York/New Jersey Metrostars, but in the summer of 2000, the Manchester City assistant manager Willie Donachie brought in a conditioning consultant called Mark Bellamy to assess the players’ fitness programmes. Bellamy suggested a way of gaining an edge over wealthier opponents who could afford larger transfer fees would be to appoint a specialist, so City placed an advert in a trade magazine. They received a number of applications, but the one that stood out came from Osorio, whom Bellamy knew from their time at John Moores University. He insisted Osorio be included on a three-man shortlist, even though he had been unable to make it over for an interview. “Near the end of the [2000-01] season,” Dennis Tueart, the City director on the five-man panel making the appointment, remembers, “we got those last remaining candidates – Juan Carlos, one from Loughborough and one from Durham – in for a face-to-face interview, and an outdoor and an indoor practical with members of the Academy. By that stage everybody left was excellent, but what set Juan Carlos apart was his football background. “He managed to dress his sports science in a football language, and he would, for instance, arrange specific sessions to work on the tiny muscle at the top of the groin that’s key to sidefooting the ball; he recognised that soft tissue injuries are a real problem for footballers and had a range of ways of trying to prevent them. When the committee members sat down after that, and we went round the table, the other four were all in favour of Juan Carlos – as was I.” Joe Royle was manager when Osorio was approached, but he was soon replaced by Kevin Keegan. It was, though, Alex Ferguson who proved the bigger influence. Keen to continue his education, and with ambitions beyond conditioning, Osorio observed training sessions at Carrington and would hang around for five minutes’ conversation with Ferguson. It was from the Scot that he developed his theory of rotation, which seems to go far beyond guarding against fatigue. At the Copa America Centenario two years ago, Osorio used a different goalkeeper in each of the three group games. That tendency to chop and change has underlain much of the criticism he has received from Mexico fans but Osorio is adamant that it is vital for everybody to feel involved. Whether his methods work at international level remains to be seen, but Osorio’s method has been successful in the club game, bringing an MLS Western Conference title and four Colombian league titles as well as two Copas de Colombia in the past decade. And if Mexico can reach the World Cup quarter-final for the first time on foreign soil, a little part of that success would have been born in the English north-west."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/19/rachel-roddy-recipe-broccoli-ricotta-torta","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T11:00:10Z","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for broccoli and ricotta torta","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/19/rachel-roddy-recipe-broccoli-ricotta-torta","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/19/rachel-roddy-recipe-broccoli-ricotta-torta","fields":{"headline":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for broccoli and ricotta torta","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There were – and still are for the rest of my family – grey days during our annual camping holidays in Pembrokeshire in Wales when I was growing up: tents that floated away, and rainy-day visits to the butterfly museum. But the many good days – those perfect beach picnic days – shine like Lyle’s golden syrup in our collective memories. Sometimes the sun shone so hard, it burned our backs as we stared into rock pools, then we flung ourselves in the freezing sea to be swallowed up by waves twice our size, our legs turning mottled blue before charging back to the patchwork of towels and rugs. Lunch would have been made that morning. Sandwiches for 15 – ham, ham and cheese, cheese and pickle, all bundled in foil; eggs hard-boiled, and sausages fried, then cooled and packed along with pork pies, more cheese, and fruit in the icebox. A pitstop at the shop in Dale for bags of welsh cakes, Jamaica ginger or golden syrup cake and caramel wafers, before our convoy continued down lanes and across the disused airfield so we could all clamber down the path to the beach at Marloes. A foil-wrapped sandwich, a hard-boiled egg and a slice of cake is always tasty, I think – even more so when you are wrapped in a towel with sand between your toes. Picnics are a thrilling reversal of normal rules: air instead of walls, sand in place of tables, fingers where knives and forks would otherwise be called for; licence to reach and grab, to swirl eggshells into the sand; to lie down and close your eyes for a while, before eating again. Sand in both suncream and sandwich and reports from one child that another has fallen off a rock or found false teeth in the surf only made things more thrilling. On the other side of Europe, meanwhile, my partner Vincenzo and his Sicilian family had their own picnic habits, which basically meant bringing a cold Sunday lunch and lots of umbrellas to the beach in Gela: tomato- and breadcrumb-laden pizza (which still strikes me as the most unlikely beach picnic fare), a sturdy torte, baked pasta and breadcrumbed meat, and a whole watermelon to bury in the wet sand so it kept cool, which ran the risk of it floating away like an edible buoy. The word “picnic” comes from the french pique nique, meaning you pick your spot and everyone brings something. Our family affairs now are a collision of these two worlds, hard-boiled eggs or cold sausages meeting some sort of sturdy pastry torta with a cheese filling, and slices of shop-bought cake jostling for attention with cold halfmoons of watermelon, ready be dropped in the sand and rinsed in the sea, then eaten. I have several recipes for savoury torta dough, some with yeast, some without. For no reason other than habit, the one I use for a broccoli/ricotta filling is adapted from Marcella Hazan’s Sicilian sfincini di San Vito, which, unlike the classic deep Sfincini pizza, is a pie with a top and a bottom. It is a sturdy bake, although the yeast means the pastry plumps nicely. Broccoli and ricotta torta For the dough 1 tsp dried yeast 1 small pinch sugar 250g plain flour 200ml lukewarm water 1 pinch salt 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil 2 tbsp whole milk For the filling 500g broccoli or other greens 300g ricotta 1 egg 5 tbsp grated parmesan Salt and pepper Dry breadcrumbs Put the yeast in a large bowl, add a third of the water, stir and leave for 10 minutes. Add half the flour and another third of water, a pinch of salt and sugar, the oil and milk and stir until smooth. Finally, add the last third of water and the rest of the flour and bring everything together into a soft, compact dough. Turn on to an oiled board and knead and fold for five minutes, pat into a ball, return to an oiled bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave to rise for three hours. Meanwhile, make the filling: boil the broccoli until tender, drain and leave to cool. In a large bowl mash the broccoli with the ricotta, egg, parmesan, salt and black pepper. Taste to make sure you have a well flavoured filling. Set the oven to 200C/390F/gas 6 and put a flat baking tray in to heat. Divide the dough in half. Working on a piece of greaseproof paper (so you can slide the pie off later) roll one half into a circle of 25cm diameter, sprinkle with dry breadcrumbs – keeping an inch (2.5cm) short of the edges, and then spread the filling over the crumbs. Finish with a zig-zag of oil in a thin stream. Roll the second half of the dough into a disc large enough to cover the first, lay it over the filling, and press the edges of the dough together to seal. Slide the pie on to the hot tray, brush with a mixture of water and olive oil or beaten egg and bake for 25 minutes, or until golden. Leave it to rest for at least 20 minutes before cutting, then wrapping it in foil or a tea towel to take to the picnic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/20/the-list-europe-migrant-bodycount","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T05:00:36Z","webTitle":"It's 34,361 and rising: how the List tallies Europe's migrant bodycount","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/the-list-europe-migrant-bodycount","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/the-list-europe-migrant-bodycount","fields":{"headline":"It's 34,361 and rising: how the List tallies Europe's migrant bodycount","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The boat capsized in rough seas in March close to Italian territorial waters. A search and rescue operation fished bodies from the sea, dead and alive. Many of the ship’s passengers remained unaccounted for. No one knew quite how many. It’s a grimly familiar tale that sounds like one of the tragedies that occurred on Europe’s southern rim over the past couple of years. But in fact, the events described occurred in 1997. Some details of these depressing disasters have changed over the years – then, the victims were Albanians, and it was the Adriatic, not the Mediterranean, that was the death trap. But the similarities throw up a deeply uncomfortable truth: people have been dying while trying to get into Europe for more than 20 years. These stories, and thousands of others, have been collated by the Dutch NGO United for Intercultural Action (UNITED) over the years, in a document – the List – which the Guardian is publishing today, on World Refugee Day. Faced with a lack of official data, the activist group has gathered newspaper articles, NGO records and coastguard reports to collect details of the deaths of migrants travelling to Europe since the early 1990s. The List is revealing: deaths do not just occur at sea, but in detention blocks, asylum units and town centres. Some 400 have taken their own lives; more than 600 have died violently at the hands of others. Because the data is not comprehensive, as we don’t have records of every incident, the true death toll is certain to be much higher. “We have no way of knowing the actual number of deaths, but this does show there has been a gradual and very steady increase,” says Thomas Spijkerboer, professor of Migration Law at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. “The major significance of the List is in its signals. It shows that this has been ongoing for 25 years and the people who pretend to be shocked now should have been shocked a long time ago.” The vast majority of migrants who have died trying to reach Europe have drowned. Volunteers have logged more than 27,000 deaths by drowning since 1993, often hundreds at a time when large ships capsize. These account for nearly 80% of all the entries. The list points up the marked increase in drownings that occurred after 2014, when the conflict in Syria accelerated, adding to numbers from south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2013, it reports more than 900 deaths by drowning. By 2017 that number had increased to around 3,500. A wave of public sympathy for the plight of refugees in Europe was quickly displaced by a backlash against the rising number of arrivals in 2015 and 2016, when almost three million people claimed asylum in Europe. The EU responded by trying to export the problem back to Africa, with a €2bn (£1.75bn) EU-Africa trust fund designed to encourage African countries to stop people making the journey to Europe. The figures show the impact of this policy shift: in 2014, there were around 1,700 deaths recorded in and off the coast of Africa ascribed to migrants trying to get to Europe; by 2017 this had almost doubled, while deaths in Europe halved over the same period. “Some would say there are fewer deaths in Europe, and the EU’s policy is working”, says Ann Singleton, an academic specialising in migration data at the University of Bristol. “But there’s so much that’s unknown. Deaths are less likely to be reported if they occur in remote areas of Africa, and the number of people are dying inland, or in Libyan detention camps, isn’t recorded. “If you look at maps, it looks as though the Mediterranean is the most dangerous area of the world for migrant journeys. But we can never say if that’s true, because we simply don’t know what’s happening elsewhere,” says Singleton. For those who get to Europe, the danger is not over. The List records more than 500 deaths in the asylum process, detention centres, prisons and camps. Among this group, the most common cause of death is suicide. Some, such as Oumar Dansokho, killed themselves after failing to secure status in Europe. The 25-year-old from Guinea first began the process of claiming asylum in 2008, according to Belgian reports. He was finally denied in 2015, and set himself alight in the offices of the Belgian Asylum Agency. The UK is the only state in Europe that detains irregular migrants indefinitely, and there are more than 50 deaths recorded that occurred in British detention centres, prisons or privately run housing for asylum seekers. One is Manuel Bravo, who hanged himself in Yarl’s Wood detention centre, Bedfordshire, in 2005, the day before he and his son were due to be deported to Angola. He knew immigration officers could not deport his 13-year-old son, Antonio, without a parent. A note found in Mr Bravo’s room said: “I kill myself because I don’t have a life to live any more. I want my son Antonio to stay in the UK to continue his studies.” He died on his 35th birthday. Unlike other data sources tracking migrant deaths, the list also records those who died after they were deported from Europe. The three most recent entries are three Afghan men, Farhad, Aref Hassanzade, and an unnamed 16-year-old, all reportedly killed by the Taliban. Farhad and Aref are among the 700 people in the database who were violently killed. More than a hundred died after contact with European police, border guards or soldiers. Compilers acknowledge that their data is incomplete. Bodies lie undocumented at the bottom of the Mediterranean; no one knows how many migrants have disappeared in the Sahara, which may even be as deadly as the sea for those who cross it. Tracking returnees is almost impossible, particularly if there is no will to do so. Some trials suggest big data could improve monitoring of deaths. A team of researchers at the UN Global Pulse project suggest predictive models, using historical maritime data to predict where future disasters might take place, could make search and rescue teams more effective. But this solution assumes there is the will to stop ships sinking in the first place. Singleton is sceptical about the promise of big data, and says we could better improve information by investing resources in more traditional methods. “There are very good examples in Italy and Greece of projects using forensic data to identify bodies, collect data and trace the deceased’s family,” she said. “But forensic analysis is very expensive and time-consuming. It’s understandable that the priority among NGOs working with migrants is people who are alive, and identifying bodies may become a secondary consideration.” Singleton says the EU and its member states should do more to monitor deaths, rather than leaving the bulk of the work to NGOs and activists. “Where deaths are happening, we need the best possible coverage in order to hold authorities accountable.” Better reporting around migrant deaths is an important first step - but Singleton is clear that it’s not a solution. “Ultimately, we don’t want an industry collecting data, we want safe migration routes.” “In an ideal world, in a humane world, there’d be no data to collect at all.” Methodology Volunteers and staff at United for Intercultural Action update the data annually, spending six months at a time verifying reports, categorising deaths and entering them into the database. They began collecting data in 1992, and the entries stretch back to 1989, but the first year with a significant number of records and the published list begins in 1993. When the project began, they received physical clippings from a network of groups around Europe. Now, the data is collected from email submissions and Google Alerts in a number of languages. “We thought that if someone read a story about one person’s death in a newspaper article, it wouldn’t seem like a big deal,” says Geert Ates, a founding member of the organisation. “But maybe if we collected them all together, we could make people care.“It was initially very difficult. In that first stage of the project, we kept pulling together clippings until we had a thousand names. We tried to go to the media, but there was little interest. Until 2010, it felt like we were working on this alone.” Ates points out the way the data is collected means it is necessarily incomplete. It relies heavily on media reports, and journalistic interest will be skewed towards a certain type of tragedy. The artist Banu Cennetoğlu has been collaborating with UNITED since 2002, working with the update that the Guardian has published. The total number of deaths should be treated with caution. There are thousands of deaths we don’t know about, and in a small number of cases there may be some double-counting in the List, where one incident is reported by multiple sources. It’s a useful starting point to begin looking at major trends, but it’s nowhere near an authoritative account. The List is being given away as part of a supplement with the 20 June print edition of the Guardian."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/20/a-world-without-puffins-the-uncertain-fate-of-the-much-loved-seabirds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T12:00:40Z","webTitle":"A world without puffins?

The uncertain fate of the much-loved seabirds","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Bryony Baker lies spreadeagled at the edge of a cliff and reaches her hand deep into a hole in the ground that is almost entirely hidden beneath a clump of grass. She pushes further in and her arm disappears up to the shoulder. It is a little like watching a vet getting up close and personal with a labouring cow. “Ouch!” she exclaims suddenly, her face creasing in pain. She pulls her arm out and inspects her fingers, already covered in scars. “That one’s definitely a puffin. They look sweet, but they can be pretty aggressive.” She presses her lips together in anticipation of another nip and pushes her hand in again. A large, dirty white egg emerges from the burrow – “warm, good” – and she places it safely on a cushion of moss. She reaches into the ground again. When she withdraws it, a second later, she’s holding an irritated puffin by its orange beak. She rings it, notes its number – this is now Bird EZ88918 – then gently replaces it and its precious egg in the burrow. Baker, who is funded by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, is this year’s seabird researcher on Skomer island, a remote wildlife haven off the west coast of Wales, which is managed for seabird conservation by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW). By late May, the island is covered in a violet haze of bluebells mixed with red campion. Together with its neighbouring island Skokholm, Skomer is home to the highest concentration of Manx shearwaters in the world. But here on the narrow, high isthmus of land that still just connects Skomer’s main landmass to a smaller outcrop known as The Neck, it is puffins (a type of auk) that are in the ascendant. With this year’s count recording nearly 31,000 individuals, up from 14,000 in 2013, breeding adults are even starting to encroach into what were once “Manxie” burrows. “We need to be cautious. We might have had an optimal day for counting them this year,” observes Eddie Stubbings, one of Skomer’s two wardens. But whatever the exact number, there is now a housing problem on the slopes where puffins hang out in the brilliant late-afternoon sunshine. A puffin takeover has begun in earnest. This involves the portly little birds marching into shearwater burrows and determinedly dragging out the hapless inhabitants. Graceful in the air but helpless on land, the shearwater becomes easy prey for hungry gulls. Bird EZ88918 is one of three puffins Baker discovers today that have commandeered burrows known previously to have been home to a pair of breeding shearwaters. The apparently rude health of this Welsh puffin population is in marked contrast to the species’ catastrophic decline in what were once thriving colonies on Shetland. The RSPB’s seabird specialist Dr Ellie Owen confirms that on 20 monitored sites across Shetland, the 33,000 puffins counted in the last nationwide census in 2000 have plummeted to just 570 individuals. A Further afield, these auks are also in dire straits: Norway has seen vertiginous crashes, with hundreds of thousands of adult puffins in the once-teeming colony of Røst struggling to fledge any chicks in recent years. Working out the reasons behind the dramatic seesawing in the populations of this seabird – as well as why there have recently been devastating declines in some other seabird species, such as kittiwakes – is now exercising the brains of seabird scientists across the country. Seabird counts have, for example, revealed the magnitude of climate-change effects – “even though, when monitoring started, no one had heard of it,” says Prof Tim Birkhead of Sheffield university. He has been monitoring the population and breeding success of another British auk numerous on Skomer, the guillemot, for four decades. Climate change has warmed the oceans, and scientists suspect that this is forcing cold-water fish species further north, meaning, in turn, that seabirds struggle to find food close to their traditional breeding grounds. “It’s only if you have accurate knowledge of what is happening to bird populations that there is any chance of taking action,” says Birkhead. Seabird scientists regard puffins – which in the breeding season are the only species to return to land with fish very visibly held in their beaks, as long as there are fish to be found – very much as coalminers used canaries. “Puffins are seen as ocean sentinels – their survival and breeding success is indicative of the health of the ecosystem they depend on,” observes Dr Matt Wood, senior lecturer in biosciences at the University of Gloucestershire. Wood, who works with the WTSWW to coordinate the seabird counts on Skomer, notes that continued monitoring is essential, given that puffins are now on the British Trust for Ornithology’s red (endangered) list. “Seabird populations do not just change this rapidly unless something strange is happening,” he says. Puffins are long-lived birds, that raise just one chick a year; and the ongoing viability of a colony depends on a delicately balanced marine habitat. In short, this means sandeels, the small, oily fish that are a staple diet for many seabirds, need to be in the right place at the right time for puffins to be able to feed their chicks. Not enough sandeels, or sandeels that have moved too far away from puffins’ breeding grounds, and their pufflings will starve to death in their burrows. He is puzzled that there has been little action or policy response from the government to the plight of Scotland’s puffins. Just four key seabird sites in the UK – Skomer, the Isle of May, Fair Isle and Canna – receive government funding for seabird monitoring and, a lack of resources delayed the 10-yearly seabird count for several years. The trawling of millions of tonnes of small oily fish, such as sprats and sandeels, for farmed fish and animal feed is another human impact that has denuded once prey-rich seas of the sustenance on which all seabirds rely. Birkhead was so alarmed by the recent loss of funding for his uniquely long-lived Skomer study that he has resorted to crowdfunding to meet the cost of training and paying researchers so it can continue. Puffins have two distinct phases of their lives: four months on land to breed, with the rest of the year spent out at sea. So, the wider challenge of protecting puffins, says Wood, is that they need the north Atlantic ocean to be healthy enough to support the fish stocks on which they feed all year round. And while researchers stand a decent chance of counting seabirds when they are near their breeding colonies, working out where they are feeding while out at sea, what kind of fish they are catching and where in the water column those fish are shoaling, is far more difficult (for which, read expensive). Meanwhile, there is widespread concern that climate change could be affecting seabird survival in a variety of subtle and intermeshing ways. “A quarter of Pembrokeshire’s puffins died over the winter of 2013-14 – that’s about 5,000 birds,” says Wood. “They’re tough creatures that can cope with stormy weather, but a conveyor belt of extreme storms stopped them feeding out at sea. It must have been like living in a washing machine.” Tens of thousands of seabirds across Europe starved and were washed ashore. These seabird wrecks happen from time to time, but Wood says that if the predictions of more frequent and extreme storm events come true, and seabird wrecks become more common, “that might become more of a problem for puffins”. Add in shifting fish distributions, oil pollution and the peril of plastic buildup in the oceans and it is easy to see how seabirds are facing ever-greater threats. While the Skomer puffins may be sitting pretty, anxiety about their less fortunate cousins is now so urgent that researchers and environmental organisations are pulling out the stops to find out what interrelated factors could lie behind the fluctuating numbers. Puffin specialist Dr Annette Fayet from the University of Oxford is about to follow up her recent study tracking overwintering puffins out at sea by attaching tiny GPS locators weighing just four grams – and costing £700 apiece – on to the backs of Skomer puffins to work out exactly where they are fishing for food for their young. Funded by National Geographic and Sky, she will be doing the same at puffin colonies in Iceland and Norway, where populations have also nosedived. Her results, she hopes, will influence governments’ marine policies. While the ultimate goal would be to get governments to address the deeper causes of climate change – maybe in time to save the planet – it is perhaps more realistic to hope that politicians may one day be brave enough to set up extensive fishing bans in areas where seabirds go to feed. At the RSPB, Owen is bidding for funding to extend the scope of the charity’s Project Puffin initiative, which ran last summer. It combined tracking of puffins in the Shiant Isles and Shetland with crowdsourced “citizen science” information on the species; securing the new funding would allow teams of trained researchers to source data on where puffins are feeding all around the UK, and from Norway, Iceland and the Faroe Islands. Working at this sort of scale is exciting, Owen explains. “If you can standardise monitoring methods across a big area, the data becomes very powerful.” There is no doubting the dedication of the researchers on Skomer, or their determination to secure the best information about what is happening to the seabirds who return each spring and work hard to fledge their single chick. After a 17-hour day mostly spent crawling on her hands and knees, being bitten by shearwaters and pooed on by puffins, Baker will get up again at 5.30am to attempt to ring lesser black-backed gulls. After lunch on the hoof, she will go out again, among the puffins and the shearwaters, and she will spend the evening on painstaking data entry. It all helps to build a consistent record of seabird activity on this magical Welsh island, the sloping grassy cliffs of which are, this summer, stuffed with puffins. Everyone is hoping that it stays that way – and that Scotland’s puffin numbers revive. For now, though, if you want to be sure of seeing a puffin in all its breeding glory, you might want to head west."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/20/how-one-man-died-so-a-whale-might-live","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T10:00:39Z","webTitle":"How one man died so a whale might live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/20/how-one-man-died-so-a-whale-might-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/20/how-one-man-died-so-a-whale-might-live","fields":{"headline":"How one man died so a whale might live","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Sunrise on the St Lawrence “The whale was the future, the present and the past, all in one; the destiny of man as much as the destiny of another species.” Philip Hoare, The Whale The day Joe Howlett died dawned perfectly. The water in Shippagan Harbour was flat like glass, the winds calm, the sun rising into a dark blue sky as Joe maneuvered the Shelagh – the Canadian Whale Institute’s research vessel – into the Gulf of St Lawrence for a day of surveying north Atlantic right whales and sampling for zooplankton off the coast of northern New Brunswick. Out on open water, Joe, and any of the on-board scientists not still in their bunks at that early hour, marveled at the morning’s perfect golden light – and the three tall ships they encountered, arriving in full sail for a summer festival. Joe, 59 years old and a near-lifelong sailor and fisherman, was ecstatic over spotting the boats. The weather was a blessing in more ways than one: besides their regular scientific tasks, the crew knew that Joe and Philip Hamilton, the Shelagh’s chief scientist, might attempt a whale rescue on the open water. The previous night, they’d received a call from the federal Department of Oceans and Fisheries (DFO): a right whale was tangled up in crab trap lines near their location. When the fisherman who’d spotted the whale tried to get close, it went wild, thrashing in the water, its huge body criss-crossed with the characteristic deep white scars borne by whales who’ve been entangled in fishing gear. (80% of the world’s 450 right whales have been snared at least once in their lifetime, 50% twice or more. Instead of their smooth, natural jet-black skin, many right whales’ bodies are now covered in bright white scars.) When the call came in, Hamilton – also a biologist with the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium – had just plotted the team’s course for the next day. He plugged in the whale’s GPS coordinates and saw they’d be working less than two kilometres away. Sure, he told DFO, they’d try to find it. It wasn’t an unusual request: Joe was one of the founding members of the Campobello Whale Rescue team, a group of fishermen volunteers who’ve worked since 2002 to free whales caught in fishing line off the coast of the Maritime provinces. He was one of the world’s foremost disentanglers, a veteran of countless intimate encounters with trapped, distressed whales weighing up to 70 tonnes. Last year was unprecedented for the critically endangered animals. Fishermen and researchers were finding more dead right whales in the Gulf of St Lawrence than ever before, either killed by ship strikes, or tangled in fishing gear. Often unable to swim freely or feed, entangled whales die of starvation, or infection from the ropes cutting deep their flesh – day-after-day, month-after-month, sometimes slicing into the bone. By 9 July 2017, the day the Shelagh crew got that call, seven dead whales had been found in four weeks, and biologists had started hauling in the carcasses for necropsies. Joe’s last disentanglement had been only five days earlier, when DFO officers had joined the Shelagh in the gulf for a rescue. The Shelagh had been trying to get close to the whale for more than an hour before it suddenly, surprisingly, stopped resisting and floated limply in the water. That’s when the DFO officers arrived. After that, Joe was able to cut the lines in just 15 minutes – an incredibly efficient operation, since it typically takes hours to free a whale, especially right whales, notoriously agile and wild. As a fisherman, Joe knew that the way these creatures were snared, year after year, was a byproduct of his own livelihood. (A few years ago, gear from a boat he worked on actually turned up on a right whale off Daytona Beach.) Joe rescued whales first and foremost because he felt that he owed it to the ocean. He was driven by a desire to give back. But not unlike the whalers of old, he thrilled to the open water and the rush of adrenaline that comes with sidling up to a giant, some of the largest animals ever to have lived. For more than 1,000 years, humans have been climbing into tiny boats for the chance to slay a whale. Joe was a member of the first generation to do the same thing to save them. That’s why, on that perfect July morning last summer, he was so especially anxious to get out on the water. The man who loved the sea “Dissect him how I may, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will.” Herman Melville, Moby-Dick Joe Howlett, Joey to his family, grew in the Hubbards, Nova Scotia train station. His father was station agent, and every day Joe watched people come and go, as he stayed rooted to the same place. He spent his childhood fishing, sailing and playing sports, rarely straying far from his birthplace until age 17, in 1975. That summer, he and his friend Steve Croft joined the crew of a Shell research vessel heading north to conduct seismology surveys for oil exploration. They sailed to Sable Island, Newfoundland, Baffin Island, and then on to Greenland, working six hours on, six hours off on opposite shifts as galley cooks for the crew of 30 – before Joe got promoted to deck hand partway through the trip. They saw icebergs floating south on the Labrador Sea, and polar bears wandering the coast. They spent a week tied up in Greenland, and on Baffin Island they traded little rings they’d made out of polished nuts for carvings from local Inuit. When they got back to Halifax at the end of the summer, Steve, Joe and about six others sailed the boat down to Galveston, Texas, its home port. Day after day, they watched the American coast stretch out beside them as they sailed south. The hard work was done, and they spent their evenings talking and writing letters home. Croft says it was the first thing resembling a vacation Joe had ever been on. Joe never went back to Hubbards to finish high school; instead he joined the coast guard, and through his early 20s, he broke ice in the North-west Passage on the Louis St Laurent, circumnavigated North America, and got caught in a hurricane in the Bermuda Triangle. In 1986, at age 28, something changed in Joe again. He was working for the Bedford Institute of Oceanography, mapping the seafloor around Campobello, a tiny New Brunswick island of 900 people a few hundred metres off the coast of Maine. His ship was docked at a wharf within walking distance of the Canadian Legion, the only bar on the island at the time. At a community dance there one night, he met Darlene Brown, a born-and-raised Campobello islander, and daughter of a herring fishermen. She asked him to stay. Joe told her he couldn’t – until he got a job with her father. “There were three things in life Joe said he was never going to do,” says Joe’s brother, Tony Howlett. “He said: ‘I’m never going to move to New Brunswick. I’m never going to get married. And I’m never going to be a fisherman.” And he did ’em all in the same year.” He and Darlene married in 1987. They had a son, Tyler, and Joe became a second father to Darlene’s first son, Chad. And Chad’s father, Michael Brown, another islander, became one of Joe’s best friends. Joe was settled, but he brought a sailor’s sense of adventure to his little island life. He helped start the Frog Pond Warriors hockey team, made up of islanders and residents of Lubec, the tiny, faded Maine fishing village on the mainland, connected to Campobello by bridge. On the hours-long drives through Maine to play senior-league games in St Stephen, New Brunswick, they’d take the back roads home in the dark, just to make the trip last longer. He taught his friend David Anthony to sail, sneaking out with him on the water every chance they got. He brought his harmonica everywhere, in case there was any opportunity to break it out. “It wouldn’t matter if he was shovelling shit,” says his friend Mackie Greene. “He’d be having fun.” The last time Tony and Joe were together, Tony says Joe told him he was “some happy” with the way his life had turned out. “I’ve got my kids here. I’m going to stay here the rest of my life,” Joe said. “This is it.” Campobello was also the first place Joe ever got close to whales. Out alone one night not long after moving to the island, pulling a herring seine through the pitch-black water, Joe heard them following his little boat and the fish he was hauling in, calling out to another, and breaking the surface all around him. When he told his sister, Mary Ellen Lonergan, she worried for his safety. What if they got too close, tipped his boat? “Joey, aren’t you afraid?” she asked. “Mel,” he said. “They know I’m there.” The fifth day “And God created great whales, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the Earth.’ And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.” Genesis 1, 21-23 It seems quaint today, but in the early 1800s, naturalists poring over freshly unearthed fossils were still arguing over whether or not the complete extinction of a creature – its total elimination at human hands or by natural selection – was even possible. Thomas Jefferson, the third US president and wildlife hobbyist, wrote: “Such is the economy of nature, that no instance can be produced of her having permitted any one race of her animals to become extinct; of her having formed any link in her great work so weak as to be broken.” In other words, nothing can go extinct, lest it disprove the perfection of God’s creation. Tell that to the mastodon, the bison, to little unassuming creatures like the Wyoming toad. Tell it to the right whale. By the 11th century, at the latest, the Basques were climbing hills and towers above the Bay of Biscay, looking for North Atlantic right whales. These massive, slow-moving animals socialized at the ocean surface, and, thanks to an immense layer of blubber, floated on the water like fat black corks long after they were killed. “Whalers could literally sit on the shore, wait for a right whale to swim by, boat out there in a canoe or a ship, kill the animal, and then tow it back,” says Mark Baumgartner, biologist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts and chair of the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium, a collaborative, data-sharing group of conservation organizations. For centuries, with just row boats and harpoons, this was how humanity exerted its dominion over God’s abundant giant. By the 16th century, when stocks in the Bay of Biscay started dropping, the Basques sailed farther, to the coast of Newfoundland, where they hunted bowheads. By the 17th century, whale oil powered western civilization, and the North American whaling industry, centred in Massachusetts, was its epicentre. Right whales – as in the “right whale” to kill – were a favourite target, yet we understood almost nothing about them. It wasn’t until the creation of modern taxonomy in the 18th century that naturalists even started to grasp the differences between species; until then, right whales were known by different names: they were sardre (school) in Basque country, svarthval (black whales) in Denmark, Noordkapers (from North Cape) in the Netherlands and sletbags (smooth backs) in Iceland. The possibility that it could be the same creature migrating to all of these places – a global species – was unfathomable. In North America, right whales were called the true whale, the whalebone whale, the 7ft bone whale and the rock-nose whale. But to the landlocked across the globe, they were a frightening mystery – aquatic enigmas. In the 16th century, artists depicted them as giant devil-fish with long, pointed teeth and spikes, eyes speckling their bodies, and even snouts. “For the modern world, the whale is a symbol of innocence in an age of threat,” writes Philip Hoare in his book The Whale. “History, on the other hand, saw peril in the great fish that swallowed Jonah, or on which Sinbad found himself, a gigantic whale ‘on whose back the sands have settled and the trees have grown since the world was young’.” All the easier to kill them en masse. The cull let up briefly when we replaced whale oil with petroleum, but ramped up well beyond its previous capacity with the invention of harpoon launchers and factory ships. By 1930, 50,000 whales were being killed annually, and in the postwar years, whale oil was a cheap filler, used in everything from margarine to ice cream, fertilizer to soap. A study in 2015 estimated the total number of whales killed in the 20th century at nearly 3 million. Reporting on this in the British journal Nature, reporter Daniel Cressey wrote that “other famous examples of animal hunting may have killed greater numbers of creatures … but in terms of sheer biomass, 20th century whaling beat them all”. Commercial whaling was finally banned by the International Whaling Commission in 1986 (though a few nations, including Japan, Norway and Iceland, disregard the ban). Some species have rebounded since then – humpbacks and Antarctic minke whales, for instance, are expected to reach their pre-whaling population numbers by 2050. But for the right whale – the so-called urban whale, which shares its habitat with our industrialized coastlines, and whose population in 1986 was less than 300 – the decline was too steep, and the waters it shared with humans rife with far more danger. A cure for extinction “Admiral, if we were to assume these whales are ours to do as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.” Spock, Star Trek: The Voyage Home Charles “Stormy” Mayo has always made his living from the sea. Unlike the rest of his family, who first settled in Cape Cod in 1659, he’s done so not by hunting what lives within it, but by studying it. After earning a degree in biology at Dartmouth College and a few post-grad degrees from Miami’s School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, he decided at the time that he was too much of a radical for academia, and moved back to Provincetown, at the cape’s farthest tip, to build a schooner and live a quieter life. But within a few months, he’d teamed up with a friend to oppose a harbour-dredging project. That endeavour became the Centre for Coastal Studies – initially a two-man activist organization, and now a hub for scientific research and coastal stewardship. One day in April 1983, Mayo was working a whale-watching boat in Cape Cod Bay when he saw a few right whales swimming nearby. After explaining to the crowd how rare it was to see them there, an elderly woman approached him. Their brief exchange was so critical to Mayo’s research that 35 years later, he still vividly remembers her hair whipping in the wind as she explained that while working at the Nantucket Whaling Museum, she’d seen documents suggesting that in centuries past, Cape Cod Bay was an important whaling ground not in spring or summer, but in the dead of winter. “I’m not a biologist,” she told him, “but I would think that if you wanted to find right whales, you would look then.” The following January, Mayo checked it out. By the end of that month he’d spotted his first right whale just outside the harbour. After that, he’d regularly see two, three, four whales at once – at a time when right whales were a mystery to most biologists. “That year,” he says, “we blew everyone’s minds.” About a year later, researchers from Dalhousie University and the New England Aquarium, including Philip Hamilton and Moira Brown (who would eventually head up the Canadian Whale Institute), found a big group of right whales congregating in the Bay of Fundy during the summer months. They developed a method of identifying individual whales in part by the raised and roughened patches, called callosities, growing in unique patterns on their skin. After a few years of identifying, photographing and cataloguing the whales, they could finally say how many were out there: around 270. The population was small, but it was slowly, unexpectedly, growing. There were two big impediments: ship strikes and fishing gear. Death by ship strike is easy to explain. It is blunt-force trauma, leaving whales the roadkill of the sea. But entanglement is more complicated, and gruesome. Whales wrapped up in fishing line might drag that gear around with them for years, the force of the water against their bodies pulling the nylon ropes deeper into their flesh, and sometimes bone, by the day, week, month, exposing wounds to water-borne viruses and bacteria. The drag can make swimming to food sources taxing. And the rope sometimes gets tangled up in their baleen, making it difficult to feed. Entangled whales may die of infection or starvation, and the stress of it all might even be causing females to delay pregnancy, which means not only more dead whales, but fewer calves too. While Moira Brown and others were advocating to get shipping lanes moved in the Bay of Fundy, Mayo and his friend David Matilla were developing something much more immediate, and much more dangerous: disentanglement, a means of whale rescue that borrowed from centuries-old whaling techniques, and was pioneered in the 1970s by whale researcher Jon Lien at Memorial University in St John’s. Much like harpooning a whale, rescuing one is a mad frenzy for life, all cold spray, hot blood, and adrenaline. There’s an intimacy in this act not unlike that between predator and prey – appropriate, since disentangling is sort of like whaling in reverse. After talking with Mayo’s father, Charlie, a lifelong fisherman who had sometimes hunted for pilot whales off Cape Cod, Mayo and Matilla had an idea. If they could “keg” a tangled whale (something old-time whalers used to do with wooden floats) by attaching a plastic buoy to the lines wrapped around it, they might be able to tire it out and get close enough to cut the lines off. Instead of a harpoon, rescuers throw a grappling hook, tethered to a control line and buoy, into the tangle of rope on the whale. Once they’re close enough, they use a gaff, a modified jack knife fastened on to a long pole about the length of a harpoon to cut the rope off, line by line. In October 1984, they were ready to try it on an entangled female humpback named Ibis off the coast of Gloucester, Massachusetts. She escaped their first pursuit, but a month later, on Thanksgiving, Mayo, Mattila and a small crew went out with hydrophones and an inflatable Zodiac boat to record a group of humpbacks singing near Provincetown. When they got there, they found Ibis, still tangled, and far thinner than when they saw her last. The team didn’t have any tools, so a few of them sped back to pick up more line, a plastic buoy, and a second Zodiac. And then they got started. They used a small boat anchor as a grapple and hooked a control line and buoy into the fishing line wrapped around the whale. Just as the old whalers described, Ibis, too exhausted and depleted for a chase, simply stopped after a few minutes of swimming. Leaning over the side of the little boat, Mayo and Mattila used a filet knife to cut away the nylon rope threaded through her baleen. And then she was free. After this first disentanglement, Mayo and Mattila continued to work with Charlie to design tools especially for the task. And soon, staff at the Center for Coastal Studies started training people all over the world, including, in 2002, Campobello Whale Rescue co-founders Joe Howlett and Mackie Greene. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to do this work, and in different ways, Greene and Joe were perfect for it. In the early 2000s, they were each running their own whale watching boats, and were both used to working with rope and spending long hours on the water. There was enough friendly competition to keep things interesting, and they just clicked. “A lot of times Joe would just point,” says Greene, “and I could tell where he wanted me to drive the boat.” Joe was also the team’s driving force. “He pushed the envelope,” says Joe’s friend and fellow fisherman and disentangler, David Anthony. “He was one of the best, there’s no doubt.” As a trained coast guard officer, Joe was also adamant about safety and seamanship. If a disentanglement seemed too dangerous to attempt, the crew wouldn’t do it. DFO supplied them with a single fast-rescue craft when they started, and the New England Aquarium kicked in occasional gas money. Eighteen months later, Joe convinced Anthony to join too. One day, on the deck of the lobster boat they both fished on, Joe told Anthony he believed they owed something back to the ocean. There’s a video online of Joe disentangling a right whale in 2016, in which you can see the sheer physicality of the act, and its emotional weight. In his red and black Campobello Whale Rescue suit and his signature sunglasses, Joe throws himself down against the inflated gunwale of the orange Zodiac – his movements powerful, focused and determined – thrusting the gaff, or long pole, again and again into the water. At the end of the video, as he’s pulling in the gear after freeing the whale, you can see the sweat and exhaustion on his face. (The video shows the last two minutes of the rescue, but Joe, Greene, Brown and former DFO officer Jerry Conway had been at it for four hours.) Greene, outfitted in the same red-and-black jacket and a white helmet, gives a holler and lifts his arms into the air triumphantly. You can sense the lightness in that feeling. Today, Greene and David talk about disentangling like this transcendent thing. Have you ever looked a humpback in the eye? Can you imagine the adrenaline rush of rescuing a creature so big you can’t see it all at once? Or maybe it’s that you can’t look at it all at once, as Greene says, because “you’d almost get weak in the knees if you did”. The pair have chased a finback whale from Campobello to Brier Island in the middle of the night. They’ve been lifted out of the water by a humpback. The chase can feel like torture, they admit, but it’s necessary. “It’s an animal that’s suffering,” says Greene. “You’ve got to try to do something.” With the population poised to fall off a cliff, it has never been more important to save even a single right whale. But that reason, of just wanting to give back, doesn’t explain the excitement that rises up in their voices when they talk about the act. There is something indescribable about feeling the breath from a whale’s blowhole on their skin. Maybe the bond they share is built as much on that as on trust and shared experience. It takes a particular kind of person to take that risk – someone driven by the prospect of saving a whale, but also by the desire to feel wild too. On every beach, a dead whale “Right now, in the amazing moment that to us counts as the present, we are deciding, without quite meaning to, which evolutionary pathways will remain open and which will be forever closed.” Elizabeth Kolbert, The Sixth Extinction In 2003, the Canadian Whale Institute convinced Transport Canada and the International Maritime Organization to move shipping lanes in the Bay of Fundy and the Roseway Basin, off Nova Scotia’s South Shore. The risk of vessel strikes declined in some areas 90%, and the right whale population reached 483 by 2010. The species became an emblem of conservation success, of how humans could return to some modicum of health a species we had spent centuries annihilating. But something was happening under the water: ocean currents started moving masses of zooplankton, which the whales eat, away from the established right whale habitat, away from the new safe zones in the Bay of Fundy, away from areas scientists were watching. There had always been peaks and valleys in Fundy’s right whale population, but in 2010, researchers noticed fewer whales in their usual feeding grounds. The quantity and quality of zooplankton in the bay had also dropped. One theory is that since cold water carries more oxygen, as the Gulf of Maine warms up (which it is, faster than 99% of global oceans, thanks to the northward shift in the Gulf Stream and slowing ocean currents), the ocean is dragging zooplankton north to colder waters in the Gulf of St Lawrence. And the whales are following their food into new territory: stretches of ocean where ships don’t slow down, where each spring, exactly when whales arrive, near-unbreakable ropes attached to thousands of crab traps are dropped from the surface of the ocean to its floor, an underwater forest of nylon, waiting to ensnare whatever passes through. By the end of last June, Tonya Wimmer was getting tired of sending out emails about dead whales in the gulf. As director of the Marine Animal Response Society (Mars) in Halifax, it’s her job to connect with rescue teams and researchers when an entangled right whale is spotted. It’s also her job to notify the research community know when a dead one is found, like they were on 18, 19, 21, 22, and 23 June of 2017. “Everyone was just so baffled,” she says. “That was the worst thing: “Guys we have another one, and another one, and another one.” Researchers needed to find out why exactly each one of those whales had died. First, they tried to take samples (chunks of skin and blubber, essentially) from a dead whale out on the water. Pathologist Dr Pierre-Yves Daoust from the University of Prince Edward Island actually climbed on top of one bloated whale carcass to cut away pieces for testing in the lab. When it became obvious that wasn’t going to work, DFO gave Mars permission to haul subsequent dead whales to shore, using large government vessels, for necropsies. A whale necropsy involves a crew of 30 or more. An excavator peels off the outer layer of blubber in strips, and then muscle, and organs, until the skeleton is exposed. Some of the whales were wrapped in rope cutting deep into their skin – their cause of death seemed obvious, starvation or infection. (In previous years, whales have been found with rope so deep it penetrates their bones.) In others they found masses of black putty: internal bleeding from blunt-force trauma caused by ship strikes, that had cooked inside their floating bodies in the summer sun. “I spent almost every weekend going to some of the most beautiful beaches in the Maritime provinces,” says Wimmer, “and almost every one of them had a very large dead whale on it.” Of the 12 whales that were necropsied or examined at sea last year, two died from entanglement, four from blunt-force trauma, and the rest were too decomposed to tell for sure. Two whales were saved, both by Joe Howlett. Tragedy on the St Lawrence “… you see them for some unbelievable part of a moment against the sky – like nothing you’ve ever imagined – like the myth of the fifth morning galloping out of darkness, pouring heavenward, spinning; then they crash back under those black silks and we all fall back together into that wet fire …” Mary Oliver, from “Humpbacks Out on the St Lawrence on 10 July Joe and the Shelagh crew received the new coordinates for the entangled whale from a survey plane. They spent the next few hours boxing in the area, driving north, east, south, north, east. Still no luck. Around mid-morning they had a rendezvous with DFO officers, who’d come out on a fast-rescue craft to meet them. They were the same officers with whom Joe and Hamilton had so efficiently and quickly untangled another right whale earlier in the week. During their meet-up, they got word that another survey plane had located the whale 16 kilometres away. The Shelagh was too slow, so Joe and Hamilton jumped into the DFO boat and took off. They arrived just after 10am to find right whale 4123, a six-year-old male, in a serious mess. Fishing line was wrapped tight around and around its body and flippers, and in through the baleen in its mouth more than 10 times. Hamilton and Joe explained to the officers that this wasn’t going to be as easy as the first time. “Right whales don’t look like they should be able to bend in the way they can,” Hamilton warned them. “But they can practically touch their tail to their head.” Joe took his place at the bow, standing ready with his gaff. Hamilton stood at the back near the wheelhouse so he could direct the DFO captain where to move the boat. They motored cautiously toward 4123, and it fled their pursuit at a steady three or four knots. From their position, Joe could see that some of the lines at the back of the whale weren’t cinched tight, which would give him some space to make a cut. The Zodiac caught up to 4123, and the captain maneuvered parallel to its massive body. The whale didn’t veer away, and it didn’t dive either, so Joe shoved his gaff toward a line and cut it. 4123, probably stressed and in pain, flipped its tail and sprayed water into the boat. The captain eased up to let 4123 settle, and then they made another approach. Again, Joe thrust his knife into the tangle of lines, targeting a second taut one. He hooked it. Hamilton remembers seeing the whale sink into the water and turn toward the boat. Not unusual. Joe was still heaving on the line with his knife as 4123 disappeared under the bow. Joe was pulling and pulling – and then, Hamilton didn’t see it, but the DFO captain did. Joe turned around, flashed a smile, and gave the crew a thumbs-up. He’d cut the line. And then the captain saw 4123’s fluke rise out of the water behind Joe, before its whole tail came crashing down. Hamilton turned around in time only to catch the tail bounce off the side of the Zodiac. And then they all saw Joe sitting, limp, against the gunwale, facing the wheelhouse. Hamilton raced over. He was trying to figure out whether Joe was conscious or not when Joe took a series of quick inhalations. “I desperately wanted that to be him breathing, but some part of me knew that it wasn’t, because there was no exhalation,” Hamilton says. He tried to find a pulse, but couldn’t. He asked the crew if anyone had a mirror to hold up against his mouth to see if he was breathing. One of the DFO officers brought over a cellphone. “It was maybe a minute or two where I just didn’t want to acknowledge the severity of the situation. I just didn’t want it to be true.” The crew helped lay Joe down on the floor of the boat. Worried about a spinal injury, Hamilton placed a light jacket under his neck, and then he started compressions. A DFO officer radioed the Shelagh. And then they were speeding back. On the Shelagh, the crew pulled out some Band-Aids – they had no idea how bad it was. When the DFO boat arrived, Hansen Johnson, who had advanced first-aid training from a couple of seasons on ski patrol, jumped aboard with a defibrillator. He knelt down beside Joe, and very gingerly tilted Joe’s head back, which lifted his chin and kept his airway open while Hamilton continued compressions. The cadence of their repeated movements put them in a kind of trance, helping them ignore how exhausted they were. They did this, alone, for an hour and a half as the DFO officers organized an emergency response over the radio and drove as fast and as steadily as they could, the calm ocean having turned to chop. Eventually they rendezvoused with a coast guard cutter, which took another 90 minutes to get to the dock. When they finally arrived in Shippagan, emergency crews had a section of the wharf cordoned off. The medical team connected Joe to a portable EKG, and after running a few tests, pronounced him dead in the boat. “I knew from my training that if you’re doing CPR, the person does not have a heartbeat,” says Johnson. “You are maintaining this chance that they can be resurrected by continuing to keep their organs functioning. Because without that, there is no hope.” Acceptance “Suppose God came back from wherever it is he’s been and asked us smilingly if we’d figured it out yet. Suppose he wanted to know if it had finally occurred to us to ask the whale. And then he sort of looked around and he said: ‘By the way, where are the whales?’” Cormac McCarthy, Whales and Men On 15 July 2017, more than 400 people from Campobello and the whale conservation community descended on the island’s tiny Baptist church to celebrate Joe’s life. It was the largest funeral on Campobello that the community can remember. “Some people have lived here 20, 30 years, but they’re still not islanders. Joe was an islander,” says Mackie Greene. “He would go to anybody’s house. He wouldn’t knock or anything; he’d just walk into the house, go to the fridge and get a beer. If there was something to eat on the counter, he might have something. He just fit in. He was one of us.” After the accident, Greene struggled to give whale watching tours, afraid the whales would come too close when he had kids on the boat. “I just wanted to run right over the top of them,” he says. Transport Canada put a pause on disentanglements, while the department conducted an investigation. “He would be just beyond himself,” Tony Howlett says of his brother. “If that would have happened to someone else, Joe would have his own boat and he’d be out there himself. He wouldn’t care what they said.” By the end of the year, 12 whales had been found dead in Canadian waters, and three in American waters. On 5 October last year, the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative released its right whale necropsy report, confirming what everyone already knew: the dead whales had been killed by ship strikes and fishing line. At the Right Whale Consortium’s annual meeting the same month, Mark Baumgartner and the American Northeast Fisheries Science Center’s Peter Corkeron told attendees that they’d done the math. There are about 100 breeding females left, and at least four or five die per year. That means four or five calves need to be born each year just to keep the population stable. As far as we can tell, none were born in 2018. If this continues, says Baumgartner, “the population will be beyond the point of no return in two decades”. This March, the Canadian government announced serious, albeit controversial, steps toward real conservation. They lifted the pause on disentangling right whales. Greene and Anthony are now ready to rush out as soon as they get a call. There will be increased aerial and at-sea surveillance, and Transport Canada has put speed restrictions on large vessels travelling through the western part of the Gulf of St Lawrence. The coast guard attempted to break ice in April so that snow crab fishermen could set their traps early (unfortunately, the weather didn’t cooperate, and the season started late). This spring, DFO shut down the St Lawrence crab fishery in areas where right whales were sighted. The snow crab season will also close on 30 June, two weeks earlier than normal, and several harvesters have submitted proposals to DFO to test ropeless crab traps. All of this requires significant, controversial changes to the way harvesters fish, and it’s had a major effect on this year’s snow crab catch. Hope keeps us focused during a crisis. But it can also foster denial. What use is recycling a fraction of our waste when the world is choked in plastic? Why avoid idling our cars when fossil fuel emissions globally continue to climb? The work Joe did, and that Greene and Anthony continue to do, is not a small thing. It’s immediate and essential, but it’s ultimately just a stopgap. If the whales’ numbers become healthy enough to reproduce, we’ll have succeeded in buying them time. It’s unlikely that they’ll thrive in our lifetime without constant intervention from the same species that brought them nearly to their doom: watching them, moving rope, intentionally getting out of their way. Even the best-case scenario right now is simply non-extinction. “I need to emphasize to you,” says Mayo, “when a population is in a negative trend and numbers are very low, it’s very hard to do a decent job imagining they come back.” Our impact on the planet is too deep for a conservation story that complete, that happy. Flight of the monarchs “The best of us are cursed with caring, with a bungling and undying determination to protect whatever looks like beauty, even if our vision is blurry.” Jon Mooallem, Wild Ones Last spring, Joe’s brother Tony and his wife Cosette planted milkweed in their Chester, Nova Scotia, backyard in an attempt to lure monarch butterflies. “Joe was saving the whales, says Tony. “We get the milkweed to save the monarchs.” One afternoon last July, Cosette was outside examining the plants when she spotted them for the first time that year: two bright orange butterflies fluttering around and into each other above the garden. Right away, she started taking pictures, and she was so captivated that she ignored the phone when it rang inside. “The house phone hung up and my cellphone starting ringing, and I thought, I better go get it.” She had one hand holding her phone and the other holding her camera, taking pictures of the butterflies, when she learned about Joe. “In Mexico, monarchs are a sign of the dead,” Tony tells me at his kitchen island in Chester the following March. He explains how when the fall chill creeps into Canada, monarchs begin their long journey south to the mountains in central Mexico. An Aztec myth says the butterflies, which arrive in vast orange clouds each year around the Day of the Dead, are the spirits of dead loved ones. About a month after Joe died, Cosette and Tony noticed a bright caterpillar crawling on the wood below their deck. They checked on it day after day as the wriggling creature transformed into a bright green chrysalis. On the morning of 25 August, Cosette went to check on the chrysalis, and found the butterfly’s brilliant orange wings shining through the casing, which was now completely translucent, ready to hatch. She had to run errands, so Tony set himself up on the ground outside next to the butterfly, his phone ready to videotape. He waited there for seven hours until the monarch finally broke free.

In a championship hangover since lifting the World Cup at Lord’s in July last year, Heather Knight’s side have lost five of their next seven one‑day internationals. There is no panic inside the camp as yet, however, with players and staff mindful that this is the start of a meaty 2018 campaign culminating with the World T20 in November. “One loss doesn’t mean it’s all doom and gloom and suddenly you need to change the makeup of the team,” Anya Shrubsole said on Monday. “If you look back to the World Cup we had a very similar side and obviously that went pretty well.” That was a response to whether the side is overly reliant on the vice‑captain and her long-term new ball partner Katherine Brunt. “Our backup seamers have done exceptional jobs,” Shrubsole said in reference to the all‑rounders Nat Sciver and Jenny Gunn. It does not help that candidates for a third front-line quick – including the centrally contracted bowlers Kate Cross, Beth Langston and Tash Farrant – have not won spots in this squad, let alone the current team. The contrast was drawn into focus by South Africa’s three-pronged seam attack, all of whom contributed to England’s top-order collapse. Their coach, Hilton Moreeng, described it as a “near-to-perfect” bowling performance in the series opener. Needing more immediate redress than the calibration of England’s attack is the batting of those who dominated last year. The quartet who made World Cup tons – Knight, Tammy Beaumont, Sciver and Sarah Taylor – compiled only 26 runs between them at Worcester as they slumped to 65 for six on a pitch with no obvious demons. “We were thoroughly well beaten,” Shrubsole said of the opening rubber. “South Africa bowled well, they attacked the stumps, and you know you can always expect aggression from Shabnim Ismail and Marizanne Kapp up top and we saw that. Some of the batters will probably be disappointed with how they got out.” Not wrong. Of her old mate Brunt’s unbeaten 72, which saved the hosts from a sub-100 humiliation, Shrubsole was lavish in praise: “She’s fought for a long time to be seen as a genuine all‑rounder and within this team, we’ve always seen her like that. It was an amazing innings.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/12/before-mps-grilling-10-questions-banks-and-wigmore-must-answer","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T05:00:40Z","webTitle":"Before MPs' grilling, 10 questions Banks and Wigmore must answer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/12/before-mps-grilling-10-questions-banks-and-wigmore-must-answer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/12/before-mps-grilling-10-questions-banks-and-wigmore-must-answer","fields":{"headline":"Before MPs' grilling, 10 questions Banks and Wigmore must answer","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Arron Banks and his Leave.EU colleague Andy Wigmore are due to give evidence before the digital, culture, media and sport select committee on Tuesday morning as part of its inquiry into fake news. But, before the Brexit-backing duo’s appearance, here are 10 questions Banks and Wigmore should answer. 1. ‘One boozy lunch’ Why did you say, repeatedly, on record that your contact with “the Russians” consisted of “one boozy lunch”? You now accept there were multiple contacts, meetings, invitations – extended both ways – and emails. You lied. Why? 2. The Russian ambassador The Russian ambassador Alexander Yakovenko was named in the October 2017 indictment of George Papadopoulos in the Robert Mueller investigation as a channel between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign. He was your main contact when you met the Russians between November 2015 and November 2016. What information did he want? What information did you give him? 3. Six gold mines Yakovenko introduced you to Siman Povarenkin who laid out a deal worth billions of dollars: the opportunity to buy six gold mines and to merge them into one corporate entity, all funded by a Russian state bank. The deal went ahead 12 days after the European referendum. Did you invest? How much money did you make? 4. Russian influence and the EU referendum In the week that Leave.EU launched its official campaign in November 2015, you met the Russian ambassador twice, once before and once after. It was at the second meeting that the business deal for the gold mines was pitched. It’s known that Russia buys influence not directly, but indirectly, across Europe with this sort of approach. Was Russia seeking to influence the outcome of the referendum result? 5. ‘The KGB’s man in London’ You use a pseudonym, “the KGB’s man in London”, to describe the diplomat Alexander Udod in your book, The Bad Boys of Brexit. You invited him and the Russian ambassador to watch the referendum results at a party at your headquarters. He accepted. Why did you wish to have “the KGB’s man in London” there? Did he attend? 6. Donald Trump and Steve Bannon You met the Russian ambassador on the same day that Steve Bannon was made Donald Trump’s campaign manager and days before you travelled to Mississippi to meet them both. Did you pass on any information to Trump and Bannon? 7. Lord Ashcroft Does Lord Ashcroft have a role in all of this? That meeting you had with him and Nigel Farage in Belize, can you explain? You said on Twitter you were visiting Bermuda in 2015 seeking donations. From whom? 8. Social media Why do you re-tweet the Russian ambassador and Russian embassy? Have you ever communicated with them about coordinating your social media messaging? 9. Nigel Farage Nigel Farage is the man who appears to be at the centre of so many strands in this – a friend of Bannon, an ally of Trump and the recipient of Robert Mercer’s largesse. Was he aware of your meetings with the Russian ambassador? 10. My email Arron, did you lie last Friday? You said you hadn’t received my email when I sent you a list of questions to give you the chance to respond before publication. It turned out you did receive it and apparently gave the material to the Sunday Times."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/11/brexit-theresa-may-no-deal-amendments-eu-withdrawal-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T21:00:30Z","webTitle":"It’s Brexit crunch time.

Theresa May’s no-deal disaster is not an option","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May has just faced yet another torrid period of Tory revolts over her Brexit strategy. David Davis was on the verge of resignation. Government MPs were publicly rejecting her customs backstop fudge. And Boris Johnson became so exasperated that he was telling his supporters that he wanted Donald Trump to take over the negotiations. It is now clearer than ever that May will fail to deliver the Brexit deal that Britain needs. She cannot command the confidence of her cabinet, of her party, or of the country. Instead of negotiating for Britain, the prime minister is lurching from crisis to crisis, increasing the risk that the talks break down, and we crash out without an agreement. We cannot go on like this. There are just four months left before the UK needs to strike a deal on our future relationship with the EU. It will be the most important agreement this country has struck in a generation. People’s jobs, their mortgages and their children’s futures are all at stake. So, with the government in such turmoil, parliament must be prepared to step in and take a more central role. This week MPs will vote on a series of amendments to the EU withdrawal bill. These changes could help steer the government away from an extreme and damaging Brexit. They could protect fundamental human rights, guarantee no infrastructure on the Irish border, and break the deadlock within the government over our future customs arrangements with the EU. The most important of these amendments is to give parliament a truly meaningful vote on the final deal. I coined the phrase “a meaningful vote” – and I have been clear ever since that it must be just that: meaningful. I have been equally clear that if the deal the prime minister strikes with the EU does not meet our six tests, then we will vote the deal down. The amendment upon which MPs will vote tomorrow would deliver on the commitment for a meaningful vote. It would provide a safety valve in the Brexit process. It makes clear that – should the prime minister’s proposed article 50 deal be defeated later this year – it would then be for parliament to say what happens next, not the cabinet. It would, in effect, take no deal off the table once and for all. Last Friday the government revealed its plan to water down the Lords’ amendment: to turn the meaningful vote into a meaningless vote. Not good enough. We must stand up for the principle of parliamentary democracy and not allow the government’s failure in the Brexit process to be a licence for the UK to crash out of the EU without an agreement. So, even at the eleventh hour, I would urge Conservative MPs to reject the government’s proposition and accept the Lords’ amendment. This is the most important week of the Brexit process since the triggering of article 50. After months of dithering, delay and government splits, there is a chance for parliament decisively to shape the course of the negotiations. A chance for parliament to have its voice heard.

For two days, MPs will examine many of the most difficult questions raised by Brexit as they look in detail at the Lords’ amendments to the EU withdrawal bill. Issues that have dominated politics for the past two years – such as the Irish border, the customs union, the single market, ministerial powers, EU law, fundamental rights, devolved powers and the final “meaningful” vote when the terms are known – will all come under the microscope. Yet as Britain moves closer to leaving the EU at the end of March next year, there is no sense of an approaching closure or of a settled national will on any of these issues, let alone on the fundamental future relationship itself. In fact, Britain is as divided, conflicted and uncertain about its future as ever. None of the salient Brexit questions has been satisfactorily resolved, partly because the potential damage from them is so stark and interconnected, but also because the Conservative party – and to some extent Labour – have proved incapable of national leadership. Yet instead of reasoning about Brexit problems, the actions of hardline leavers have grown increasingly shocking. David Davis threatens to resign over a date. Boris Johnson suggests Donald Trump would have been a better negotiator. Liam Fox looks on as the White House upends his trade deal dreams. Meanwhile Jacob Rees-Mogg announces that customs checks are suddenly unnecessary. But it is not just the main parties that are failing. So is the insurgent movement that caught the anti-political tide in the referendum two years ago. As Paul Dacre steps down, leaving the politicians to clean up the damage after the relentless reactionary campaigning of his Daily Mail years, the Cambridge Analytica and Leave.EU implosions illuminate the leave campaign’s dirty secrets. As MPs debate the bill, Leave.EU’s millionaire founder and bankroller, Arron Banks, will be telling a select committee about extensive contacts with Russian diplomats and trips to Moscow, where discussion included lucrative business deals, all during the Brexit campaign. The Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, was right to warn on Monday that the worst possible Brexit, a potentially catastrophic no-deal, now looks increasingly possible – just at the very moment when the G7 debacle shows the vital importance of international cooperation. The Brexit project is like a clapped-out car wobbling and wheezing towards the finishing line next year with wheels and bits of bodywork falling off as the line approaches. At just such a dismal moment, MPs face vital decisions about the country’s European links. The worry is that party interest means the debates and votes will not be worthy of the issues. Instead they could be all too glumly representative of the miserable domestic political shambles of the past two years. But there is still time to dump the car."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2018/jun/13/bumblebees-use-perfume-patterns-to-tell-flowers-apart","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T05:30:10Z","webTitle":"Bumblebees use perfume patterns to tell flowers apart","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/13/bumblebees-use-perfume-patterns-to-tell-flowers-apart","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jun/13/bumblebees-use-perfume-patterns-to-tell-flowers-apart","fields":{"headline":"Bumblebees use perfume patterns to tell flowers apart","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Pollinators don’t just wing it when it comes to finding a sweet treat: the shape, colour, perfume and even electrical charge of flowers are all known to offer clues. But now researchers say bumblebees also use another floral feature to guide them: how the concentration of a scent varies across the flower’s surface. “[This study shows that] bees can tell the difference between flowers where the only difference is their spatial arrangement of scent – and that suggests they could use that information to make their foraging more efficient,” said Dr David Lawson, co-author of the research from the University of Bristol. What’s more, scientists found that bees appear able to apply what they have learnt from patterns of scent to patterns of colour, suggesting the fuzzy critters might be even smarter than suspected. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Lawson and colleagues from the University of Bristol and Queen Mary University of London reveal how they exposed 31 bumblebees, one at a time, to plastic discs in which an array of tiny wells were filled with peppermint oil to create either a cross or a square pattern . One group of bees encountered a sugar solution placed in the centre of the discs with a circular pattern of peppermint oil, the other group found the sweet reward on discs with a cross-shaped pattern. Meanwhile water was placed on the “flowers” with the alternative pattern to those bearing the treat. Once the bees drank from the sugar-bearing “flowers” on more than eight out of 10 consecutive occasions the team deemed them trained and let them lose, one at a time, on another set of 10 flowers. Half of these had a peppermint cross pattern, and half had a circular pattern, with water placed in the centre of all of them. The team found that bees trained to head for flowers with a circular scent pattern preferentially spent time drinking on such flowers, even though there was no sugary treat, while those trained to go to the cross pattern, preferred to drink from flowers with a peppermint cross. That, said Lawson, reveals bumblebees can tell blooms apart simply by the way a scent is distributed across a flower. The team then presented a group of trained bees with two sorts of unscented paper discs bearing a sugary drink, one with red dots arrange in a cross, the other with the dots arranged in a circle, and watched where the bees went on their first 10 landings. The results show that bees trained to bumble off to a peppermint-scented cross were more likely to choose to visit the cross-shaped array of red dots. “There could be some kind of sensory overlap between vision and olfaction, ” said Lawson. “It is kind of like a human looking in a handbag and making a visual interpretation of what they are feeling with their hands.” The team went on to present untrained bees with “flowers” boasting both a scent pattern and coloured visual pattern, finding that bees learned which blooms hosted a sweet treat faster when the patterns matched than when they were at odds. However the effect was only pronounced for circular scent patterns. Dr Paul Graham, an expert in insect navigation from the University of Sussex, said the discovery that bees trained on a cross scent are able to recognise the same pattern visually was fascinating, although he said it wasn’t necessarily the case that bees are demonstrating an abstract sense of shape. “That is something we think of as being an ability of clever animals,” he said. “Of course the thing now is we have to work out how a bee does that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/11/pro-brexit-labour-mps-expose-partys-divisions-over-eea-membership","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T18:28:30Z","webTitle":"Pro-Brexit Labour MPs expose rift over EEA membership","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/11/pro-brexit-labour-mps-expose-partys-divisions-over-eea-membership","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/11/pro-brexit-labour-mps-expose-partys-divisions-over-eea-membership","fields":{"headline":"Pro-Brexit Labour MPs expose rift over EEA membership","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Labour’s divisions over Brexit have been exposed afresh, as MPs from leave constituencies hit back against the idea that membership of the European economic area (EEA) is the best outcome for Britain. Keir Starmer addressed a backbenchers’ meeting on Monday night, followed by what MPs described as a forceful display of unity from backbenchers and shadow ministers in support of the party’s official position. Jeremy Corbyn is expected to whip his MPs to abstain when a House of Lords amendment to the EU withdrawal bill, aimed at keeping open the option of EEA membership, is voted on in the House of Commons on Wednesday. Members of the EEA, which include Norway and Liechtenstein, accept the constraints of the single market – including EU regulations and free movement – without having a seat at the table in Brussels or Strasbourg. A vocal group of rebel backbenchers, including Chuka Umunna and Stephen Kinnock, have been urging colleagues to support the amendment, believing it is the best off-the-shelf alternative to full EU membership. But some colleagues from pro-Brexit constituencies reject EEA membership, because they fear it could signal to voters that Labour hopes to overturn the referendum result. Gloria De Piero, the MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, said: “We just want to make sure our voices are heard. In seats like mine, because colleagues who have sincerely held views are very vocal, about their desire not to leave the single market, my constituents often think that we are a remain party. “My constituents aren’t against all immigration, which is how they are sometimes portrayed – they want control of immigration.” Gareth Snell, who defeated then Ukip leader Paul Nuttall in Stoke-on-Trent Central, used a post for the blog Labour List, to send a similar message. “Most Labour MPs are in seats that voted leave. My constituents could rightly ask whether we have really left the EU if we are still subject to all the rules, regulations and obligations that come from membership,” he wrote. “What message are we, as a Labour party, sending to voters in these seats if we simply turn away from the spirit of the referendum result? What hope can we have to win back those traditional seats we need to win in order to form the next government if we tell the voters in those communities that we know better than they do?” The MP for Warley, John Spellar, said he was still considering how to vote on the EEA amendment. “It involves free movement – that’s the crucial issue,” he said. “The views of the public were very clear: even among many of those who voted remain, they had major concerns about it.” A Labour frontbencher, Laura Smith, is said to have told friends that she is considering resigning her role as shadow cabinet office minister in order to vote against the EEA amendment, rather than follow the party whip to abstain. Smith, who was elected in 2017, has a majority of just 46 in her Crewe and Nantwich seat, a pro-leave area. Starmer addressed a group of pro-EEA rebels on Monday, in a last-ditch attempt to convince them not to back the amendment. But one MP who attended Monday’s meeting said Starmer was “left in no doubt about the strength of feeling”; another said the two sides were “talking past each other”. Some who once chided Corbyn as a hard-left ideologue now complain that the party’s current position is determined by “triangulation”. At the parliamentary Labour party meeting on Monday night, MPs spoke forcefully in favour of a display of unity. Starmer told MPs it appeared some Conservative rebels were wavering on crucial votes and Labour had to deploy all its efforts into trying to keep them on board on two crucial amendments – on the customs union and a vote on the exit deal. Many MPs who stood up to speak backed the shadow Brexit secretary, including Caroline Flint and Lloyd Russell-Moyle. “We’re undergoing an episode of almost painful tribal loyalty,” one quipped on the way out of the room. Others were less than convinced. “It was an utterly banal argument from Keir tonight that somehow we should carry on not saying what we want so that everyone can find a home in Labour – to the point of not standing for anything at all,” one pro-EEA backbencher said. The EEA amendment was the only one of the 15 made by peers as the government’s flagship Brexit bill passed through the House of Lords, that is not supported by the Labour frontbench. Last week Starmer tabled his own, alternative version of the amendment, which would strike out the phrase EEA, and replace it with a pledge to retain “full access” to the “internal market” of the EU, based on “shared institutions”. But he made clear Labour would not be able to sign up to unfettered freedom of movement. The new wording was regarded as another step towards a softening of Labour’s Brexit position, but the EEA rebels believe it was what one called a “unicorn”, which the EU27 would never sign up to. “There’s nothing wrong with it in theory – it just doesn’t exist,” one rebel said. Starmer rejected the idea he was turning down the opportunity to defeat the government over the issue last week, saying Labour was too divided to back the EEA amendment even if the leadership whipped in favour of it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/12/housing-true-cost-privatisation-right-to-buy-landlords","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T05:00:40Z","webTitle":"Just look at housing to see the true cost of privatisation | Dawn Foster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/12/housing-true-cost-privatisation-right-to-buy-landlords","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/12/housing-true-cost-privatisation-right-to-buy-landlords","fields":{"headline":"Just look at housing to see the true cost of privatisation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Council homes are being sold off far more quickly than new social homes are being built, a new report has warned. The research into the government’s right-to-buy scheme, by the Local Government Association, finds that this has been the case since 2012: at no point has the social housebuilding rate matched, or come close to matching, the rate at which homes are being sold. Right to buy was given a boost by the Conservatives after the 2010 election in an attempt to sell even more homes, since traditionally homeowners tend to vote Tory. In 2013, the then chancellor, George Osborne, announced the maximum discount available for those renting a council home in London would rise to £100,000. In effect he’d approved the asset-stripping of some of our most-needed council stock. But right to buy needs to be viewed for its long-term effects, and not just with regard to how it helped those families who bought their council homes in the 1980s and 90s. Today, 40% of the homes sold under the scheme are rented privately at far higher rents than local authorities would ever charge. Right to buy has become right to buy to let. Across the country, home ownership is in crisis, with renting exorbitantly expensive and young people especially – even those in professional jobs – being priced out of the market. Their earnings disappear into the pockets of private landlords, while the finances of local government are given a kicking. Council housing works because it pays for itself relatively quickly: the rent paid by tenants covers the building costs in the long term, and eventually makes a profit for the local authority, which continues to invest in the local area. The money continues to circulate within the community rather than simply boosting the profits of landlords. But with councils forced to sell to tenants through right to buy, then being obliged to give a chunk of the receipts straight to Whitehall, building becomes ever more difficult. And the property shortfall is expensive, as authorities struggle to house their homeless residents. Last year £8.4m was spent by 23 councils to rent 725 flats as temporary accommodation, the magazine Inside Housing found. A vast transfer of wealth has taken place from the public to the private sector, under the guise of helping the aspirational working class. Instead, we’ve just made it harder to provide housing for those most in need. The folly of right to buy echoes the mess that is Britain’s rail system. In the mid-90s, John Major – echoing Margaret Thatcher’s disdain for the state a decade earlier – believed that breaking up British Rail would create competition, and that competition would ensure greater services and be far more efficient than control by the bloated state. Instead, the cost of train travel has become exorbitant, the service appalling almost everywhere you attempt to travel, and the state is constantly required to intervene – either because a franchise has collapsed, in the case of the east coast mainline, or because the rail service has become chaotic, witness recent weeks in the north and the south-east. The long-term effects of privatising both rail and housing, aside from ensuring we live in a country of crumbling infrastructure (in contrast to mainland Europe), is one of diminished social and personal opportunities. Many people are unable to see friends and family as often as they’d like due to the cost of rail travel. Others are delaying having children, or wondering if they can afford them at all, since they cannot afford to buy a home and landlords can be hostile to children. Those with children are in no better position: well over 100,000 children are living in temporary accommodation, usually due to eviction. Right to buy was popular, but with 1.8m council homes having been sold off, there are now about 750,000 households paying far more than a local authority rent. Housing, not buying, should be a right – and available and affordable for all. Right to buy is devastating our housing system, just as rail privatisation has devastated our transport infrastructure. Privatisation rarely works: we need new ideas, and far more public ownership of housing, infrastructure and utilities, if we wish to provide for our citizens. • Dawn Foster is a regular contributor to the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"}]}}
