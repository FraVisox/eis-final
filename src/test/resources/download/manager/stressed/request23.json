First, write down which fruit, veg and herbs you love to eat, then cross off those less likely to crop in the UK (bananas and avocados, say). If space is at a premium, don’t grow inexpensive staples such as jacket spuds, peas or onions. Instead, go for favourites that don’t store well, are hard to come by or are best eaten minutes after harvesting: new potatoes, baby carrots, sweetcorn, pak choi, yellow courgettes, garlic chives and edible flowers. When do I start? My annual spring ritual is to surround myself with seed packets of all the veg I want to eat that year. On the back is a sowing guide to the months you can start your crops off (kale in March-May, say, bulb fennel in May-July). Most need just one sowing. Quick-to-mature crops, such as radish, rocket, spinach, salad leaves and baby roots, can be sown in short 1m rows every four to six weeks from March until late August to avoid a glut or dearth. Which crops do I sow indoors and which outdoors? Time to maturity is the key factor. Indoor starters include tender veg that take a while to bear a crop (chillies, tomatoes, cape gooseberries, aubergines) and slow-to-bulk-up hardier veg such as celeriac and brussels sprouts. Heated propagators or growlights and mats are great for these early indoor sowings. Quick-to-mature crops such as sweetcorn, squashes, coriander and rocket can be sown outside once the soil warms up in April (start tender ones under tunnel cloches). What can I do now? Order your seeds, then get your growing areas ready. Buy compost (a 50:50 mix of multipurpose and John Innes No 3 if your budget allows) for container growing, or dig over veg beds to remove weeds. Early potato varieties (such as ‘Lady Christl’) can be planted now, along with onions, shallots, garlic and broad beans, and – if you lay cloches over beds or pots to warm them – hardy veg such as carrots, beetroot and spinach. Indoors, herbs will set up your kitchen nicely, and microleaves will be ready to cut within two weeks. Can I buy young plants instead of seeds? Definitely. In fact, I’d recommend it to newcomers, because it bypasses those potentially tricky early stages. Buy plants of fussy germinators such as habanero chillies and flat-leaf parsley. Trays of salad leaves, mangetout peas and broad beans can all be planted directly outside, but these are easy to grow from seed, so do have a go. Grafted veg plants (where crops are grown on super-charged root systems) claim up to 75% higher yields, but cost more. Root congestion can cause premature and reduced cropping, so be fussy when buying cauliflower, broccoli and cabbage plants. How much of each veg do I sow? Some (such as cherry tomatoes, salad leaves, climbing beans, courgettes) can produce a huge harvest; others (sweet peppers, asparagus, globe artichokes) give more miserly yields. When sowing outside, make 1-2m rows of lots of different crops (a 1m row of salad leaves, radishes and coriander, say, and a 2m row of dwarf beans, swiss chard and carrots). That way, you avoid gluts and always have a range of crops to harvest. Indoor sowings into pots and trays are more forgiving because gardeners love bartering with surplus plants. Ultimately, aim to end up with small numbers (a dozen runner beans, four tomatoes, two courgettes, three chillies), so you’re not overwhelmed. Any more exciting crops worth a try? To hold our interest, seed companies continually introduce “new” crops (purple podded peas and purple carrots are, for example, heritage varieties). Don’t pass them off as novelties – some are prolific croppers. The oca (a South American potato-equivalent) I grew last year yielded a huge amount of tubers. Cucamelon (a quail’s egg-sized cucumber relative) will yield generously in a greenhouse. Doughnut-shaped Saturn peaches will reward you, given a sunny wall. Soya beans are worthwhile, as are borlotti beans. The lime green spirals of romanesco cauliflowers and multicoloured ‘Midnight Sun’ kale are worth growing for appearance alone. Others need a long, hot summer to crop well – I’ve not been so lucky with sweet potatoes and pomegranates. What can I grow with a tiny patio and window box? There are now plenty of fruit and veg varieties bred for life in pots, and pint-sized plots help focus your ideas: every plant must deliver the goods. Don’t just look at floor space – think vertically, too. Climbing crops can be trained up a circle of canes (climbing courgettes are prolific); hanging baskets are excellent filled with a dwarf bush tomato (try ‘Losetto’); vertical growing systems fix securely to walls, allowing bagfuls of salad leaves to be grown; and free-standing pot towers maximise space. Should I buy a propagator? These are invaluable for raising your game, but can be bulky, so consider storage. Windowsill propagators are space-savers, and heat mats roll up when not in use. Integrated grow-lights can be pricey but deter leggy seedlings, which can, without a greenhouse, be the bane of an indoor propagator’s life. • Lucy Chamberlain is head gardener at East Donyland Hall, Fingringhoe, Essex.

But why?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In recent months Nikolai Glushkov had been in good spirits. True, he had to go into hospital in December from an operation on his foot but remained characteristically cheerful, returning to his home in Kingston, south-west London, and hobbling round on crutches. Charming, with impeccable English, and debonair, Glushkov was well liked. He gave large parties attended by his friends and their children and chatted to his neighbours. His death last weekend was entirely unexpected. But his daughter Natalaya, in London, and son Dmitry in Moscow had suspected foul play immediately. On Monday Glushkov didn’t show up to a court hearing at the commercial Rolls Building in London. He had spent months preparing for the case. He was due to defend himself against long-running claims of fraud from Russia’s state airline Aeroflot. When he didn’t appear Natalya went to investigate. She found her father at home, dead and with strangulation marks on his neck. The scene was disordered. On Friday police confirmed he was murdered. Why? Glushkov was a close friend of the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky. They worked together in Russia in the 1980s and 1990s, with Glushkov becoming Aeroflot’s chief financial officer. When Berezovsky fell out with Putin and escaped to London, Glushkov was arrested in Moscow. He finally got out in 2004 and joined his friend in exile. The two were close. Berezovsky would telephone fellow oligarchs when Glushkov was behind bars, begging them to help. Glushkov believed he had been taken hostage so that Berezovsky would sell his ORT TV station to state interests. When Berezovsky was found hanged after losing a court battle against Roman Abramovich, Glushkov was convinced this was murder. “The deaths of too many Russian exiles are happening,” he said. Another victim was Alexander Litvinenko, whom Glushkov knew well. Glushkov investigated the case, talked to journalists and visited the Guardian office in London – a well-groomed man in late middle age, with silver hair, and carrying an unshakable grievance. He believed the British authorities were failing to take these deaths seriously and to punish the perpetrator in the Kremlin. His murder seems to prove his point. Newspaper photos of Glushkov with Berezovsky are poignant. The pair – together with Litvinenko and the Georgian tycoon Badri Patarkatsishvili – all sought refuge in London. All died in the UK under opaque circumstances. Alex Goldfarb, who knew Glushkov well, described him as a talented manager, with a good sense of humour and “cynical irony”. Glushkov enjoyed wine, dressed dandyishly and was unfailingly generous, buying tickets for the opera at Covent Garden once a year for all the staff who worked in Berezovsky’s office. He has a large ridgeback dog at home. “The dog was huge and fiercely loyal. I don’t know how his attacker got past the dog,” Goldfarb said. “They must have neutralised it”. Glushkov wasn’t an oligarch or fabulously rich and never had a share in Berezovsky’s business. He “had a couple of million dollars”, Goldfarb said. Glushkov was convinced from early on that Andrei Lugovoi had killed Litvinenko. “He was radical. I loved the man,” Goldfarb said of Glushkov. “Of the whole Berezovsky crowd he was the most pleasant to have around.” Glushkov’s ex-wife is in Moscow. They remained on good terms. His family are devastated. “I’m practically the last one left,” Glushkov told the Guardian in 2013, in words that now seem grimly prophetic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/17/gareth-southgate-england-squad-world-cup-2018-jake-livermore","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T22:30:34Z","webTitle":"Gareth Southgate says loyalty and spirit will play part in World Cup selection","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/17/gareth-southgate-england-squad-world-cup-2018-jake-livermore","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/17/gareth-southgate-england-squad-world-cup-2018-jake-livermore","fields":{"headline":"Gareth Southgate says loyalty and spirit will play part in World Cup selection","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"When Gareth Southgate named his first England squad of this World Cup year for the forthcoming friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy there were a few surprise omissions – Gary Cahill, Chris Smalling and Danny Drinkwater among them – but the inclusion that stood out was that of Jake Livermore. The midfielder has not been enjoying the best of seasons at West Bromwich Albion, where he has not always been a regular starter, and thanks to Twitter we know Alan Shearer for one thought Jonjo Shelvey has made a more pressing case for selection. Yet Southgate is the loyal type, perfectly willing to defend his decision in a way that reveals a lot about his thought processes for Russia this summer. “Jake has been having a tough time at his club but it is very straightforward for me,” the England manager said. “We’ve played Jake in several matches and he’s done a job for the team. In November we left him out and he was just about to board a plane for a holiday when we called him back at the last moment, because we had had a few withdrawals. He left his family at the airport, came to join us and did really well against Brazil and Germany. I think that has to carry some weight when you are building the spirit and culture around your team. “That doesn’t mean he is guaranteed to go to Russia in the summer, but I think it justifies him staying in our squad. We are looking to build a spirit, a togetherness, and I think that sort of example of sacrifice is important. I understand why there might be a bit of reaction to picking Jake but there is a specific reason why we have done it this time.” National team managers always have trouble with injuries and withdrawals, it goes with the territory, though Southgate believes the fringe players who are often the ones messed around need to show the mental toughness to stay positive. “There is an important message to send to the group that if you are disappointed at being left out there might be an opportunity to come back in,” he explained. “If you respond in the right way, who knows what might happen? “When I went to the World Cup in 2002 Trevor Sinclair was a standby player. He wasn’t even first choice, he was the second standby. Danny Murphy was initially called in ahead of him but then Danny got injured. Trevor had returned to England but he flew back to Japan and he ended up playing in the match against Argentina. So it’s a message to everyone in the group as much as to Jake. Stay positive.” Southgate himself is trying to stay positive about a tournament currently in danger of being overshadowed by strained diplomatic relations and political posturing, though he still intends to have his family come to visit when England are in Russia. “That is the plan at the moment, but we are like everyone else, we will have to see what the advice is and if things change,” he said. “Russia is culturally an incredible country to visit, so I would like them to have that experience, and to go to a World Cup as well. I don’t think my children will be there for too long, they have to fit their visit around school and university, but their intention is to go.” England’s schedule Gareth Southgate’s side face four friendlies before they head to their World Cup base – the 107-room ForRestMix club in the village of Repino, 19 miles outside St Petersburg.

There was not much going on in the Premier League but it was still a huge day for all involved, even though it just sent a couple of teams closer to the drop. Anyway...do not worry as you can join me again at 6.45pm for Manchester United versus Brighton, which should be fun. In the meantime, why not enjoy Liverpool against Watford with Scott Murray? Everton make the most of facing 10 men for the majority of the game at Stoke, as Paul MacInnes reports. Roy Hodgson says Wilfried Zaha was just a bit tired and had been bashed around a bit when he suffered numerous fouls at Huddersfield. Good news for Palace fans. A big three points for Crystal Palace on a cold day in Yorkshire where our fearless reporter Paul Doyle was watching on. Bournemouth piled more misery onto West Brom and their fans as they came back to win 2-1 thanks to two cracking goals. Here is Ben Fisher’s report: It is lively down at the bottom of League Two. Who will survive there? And everyone love Tuncay. Big day at the bottom as West Brom confirm to the world they have no chance of staying up while Stoke have left themselves with it all to do in the final weeks of the season, while Palace were boosted by a much-needed win. Pat asks... “Riddle me this - Adam sent off for an uncontrolled challenge on Rooney - fair enough. However Rooney plays on. “Pickford’s uncontrolled challenge on Max - and Max is off injured - where is the red? “Why does Max’ goal negate Pickford’s - two feet off the ground - uncontrolled challenge?” Goalkeepers get away with a lot, generally. Down at the bottom of the Premier League... Eight losses in a row for West Brom, no wonder Mike emailed this in. “Let’s hope Pardew remains unemployed forever. I’m tired of re-tread, hasbeen (or never were) types wasting space (and money). They are legends only in their own minds.” Ibe and Stanislas both scored cracking goals as Bournemouth recovered from going behind to Rodriguez’s close range finish. Charlie Daniels cleared one off the line in injury-time to ensure the Cherries earned the points. Roy Hodgson’s side move out of the relegation zone thanks to goals from Tomkins and Milivojevic. Admittedly, Huddersfield were pretty poor throughout are barely threatened. Two goals from Cenk Tosun in the snow were enough for the Toffees in the second half, even though Choupo-Moting pulled one back. The game changed when Charlie Adam was dismissed for a poor challenge on Wayne Rooney. Stoke are in serious trouble now as they sit three points adrift. Alan Pardew will be unemployed this week. Stanislas has struck a delightful goal from distance with some wonderful dip at the end leaving Foster with no chance. No great escape, not even a point for West Brom. Wilfried Zaha is heading off injured, which is unfortunate for Palace. Hopefully it is not too serious. Daniel here likes ‘banter’. He says: “As a newly decided West Brom fan, I like the exotic sound of this substitute Saido’s name. Do you think I should start up a crowd-fund project to raise funds to buy him, and do you think he would come?” You always need a good penalty taker. Don’t worry Stoke fans, Saido Berahino is on the pitch so there is always hope... Butland should have done better with Tosun’s header, so there is another chalked off for the England No1 spot. He got his hand to it but could only steer it towards the corner rather than wide. Walcott got a cross into the box on the break and it was a classic diving header from Tosun to put them into the lead. Stoke were really going for it as they really need three points but it now looks like they will end up with none. Choupo-Moting’s equaliser was his final action of the day as he was injured by Pickford who left one in on the striker when challenging him. The Great Escape is off for West Brom after Ibe makes the most of some alterations to the Baggies defence, which freed up some space, to smash in a thunderous strike to level things up. Substitute Choupo-Moting gets the vital touch onto a free-kick into the box, which was the only way Stoke looked like scoring, but for his troubles he has taken one in a very private area. Now that Everton have the lead against 10-man Stoke it should be a nice breeze to the final whistle for them, which is bad news for the hosts who would be left three points from safety with seven games left. Poor Lynden and poor Luke. He emails: “I was thinking about reprising ‘Goochwatch’, my Lynden Gooch-spotting series of emails from last season. Alas, he’s not even been named in the squad today. Surely it’s time, for both the club and the young American, to move on?” PLAY STOPPED AT BOUNDARY PARK! Get some red paint, lads! Palace are heading out of the relegation zone thanks to a calmly taken penalty from Milivojevic, which has doubled the lead. A cross from the left for Everton allows Tosun to shoot, however Butland keeps the visitors out a couple of times before Tosun finally sends it it. Ben Hinchcliffe update. Goal! Now it is 2-0 to Preston at Sunderland after Callum Robinson’s goal, leaving more players on the pitch than fans in the stands. They really are going down to League One. Meanwhile, at Oldham. I do not really miss playing in Glossop. I think I have played cricket there in similar conditions, though. Red! Jake Clarke-Salter has been sent off in his second successive game for Sunderland. It really is not a time to be a Sunderland player or fan. They are losing 1-0 at home to Preston currently. Off the line! Tomkins almost had his second at Huddersfield but his strike on goal but Mounie is waiting on the line and clears it to keep his team in the game. Daniel has asked for a team to follow. I would advise not backing West Brom in the short nor long term. “Having just tuned into your clockwatch, after turning off the shower that is the England rugby team, I am on the lookout for a football team to follow. Not an expert in the game but I see that West Brom seem to be doing well today: would you recommend them as my new favourite “winners”?” Sunderland are losing at home to Preston, that will not get the fans back. It looks like the Black Cats are heading down. Third placed Shrewsbury have equalised at Scunthorpe through Jon Nolan. They could take advantage of neither of League One’s top two Blackburn nor Wigan playing today due to postponements and the FA Cup, respectively. A win today for West Brom would leave them just seven points adrift of safety, which is something to hold onto. They have only won once in their last 28 league games, so it would be a nice boost and would make the season slightly less embarrassing even when they almost certainly go down. Some more line chat here from Andrew. “Apropos lines on the pitches. When the FA introduced the 9v9 format on smaller pitches for youth football as a bridge between seven a side football and the ‘mans game’ of eleven a side, there was a general absence of pitches so a common solution was to mark out a 9v9 pitch inside the bigger 11v11 pitch. The extra lines quite often caused chaos for the players as they lost track of where they were on the pitch during a match despite the use of blue paint with 9v9 players often suddenly playing to the white lines and vice versa for the 11v11 players.” Maybe the Great Escape is on the for the Baggies! Defender Gibbs gets down the left and then sends the cross to the far post where Rondon heads it back to Rodriguez who is lurking and he eventually gets the ball over the line. Kevin certainly thinks Mr Adam is a touch naughty. He says: “Is one of the dirtiest players in the game, and has been for a long time. FWIW, I think Scholes was also a dirty player. Excusing any of these guys because they are talented is a mistake.” Here we go again across the country! I once played in a win at Glossop when I scored a couple of cracking goals as a kid, so I have fond memories of playing in the snow. You would think those from Glossop would revel in the arctic conditions but they literally froze as I dribbled through their pitiful defence. Peter asks about Charlie Adam being “that sort of player”. In an email, he says: “When there’s an awful challenge and the Redknapp brigade rush to use the “not that sort of player” defense, I wonder if there’s someone who everyone agrees *is* that sort of player. Is Charlie Adam one? Every time I see him pick up a booking it’s not a Scholesian “he tries his best but he’s never been able to tackle”, it’s nasty and deliberate and violent and reckless.” There is no doubting that his tackle today was utterly atrocious, that is for sure. Three points for Palace could move them up to the lofty position of 16th and just one point behind opponents Huddersfield so Roy Hodgson will be doing all he can in the dressing room to make sure his players do not lose their focus. If you had bet on who would be the only player to score in the opening 45 minutes today not many would have put James Tomkins down. Huddersfield had 30 shots in their 0-0 draw last week against Swansea whereas today they have not produced a single effort in the opening half, which will underwhelm their fans. Wayne Rooney has been the victim of a foul for a sending off, while his brother has the boot on the other foot and has been dismissed for Guiseley. The break brings with it more snowy pictures from Stoke. Premier League half-time scores: Bournemouth 0-0 West Brom Huddersfield 0-1 Crystal Palace Stoke 0-0 Everton No words... Will we get an abandoned game today? No one wants that but there are plenty of games being conducted during a blizzard and some great photos of snowflakes obscuring the view. Over in Birmingham there is supposedly a match going on. James Maddison has just scored his 14th of the season for Norwich, his latest coming from the spot to make it 3-1 at home to Reading. He will be off to the Premier League over the summer. Off you go, Charlie. Rooney did recover from the challenge and is still on the pitch, although he is still being booed by the home fans for the being Adam’s victim. Now we just need some action at Bournemouth against West Brom and then all over our reporters will have something to write about. Sadly, it does not sound too exciting down at Dean Court or whatever it is called nowadays. The Scot has overrun the ball and produces and over the top challenge on Rooney, leaving the former England captain on the floor in a lot of pain. It does not look good for Rooney especially as it is far too cold to stay on the floor for too long in that Stoke blizzard. Gideon ensures we all re-think our Saturday plans. He says: “I wonder if there has ever been worse selection of matches to watch on MOTD tonight. Pro plus and Red Bull all round. “Reminds me of a gooner friend who nodded off watching Arsenal on MOTD just as they had a corner. He woke as the corner came in watched the rest of the game and then thought ‘sod it I’m going to bed’. Walking upstairs to retire he was met by his girlfriend who handed him their newborn daughter and turned to go back to bed. He started to complain that he’d had her the previous night and they were supposed to be taking turns and so was rightfully put out until he saw the sunshine outside and realised he’d slept all night and woke up at the exact same incident on the morning repeat that he’d fallen asleep the night before.” Other energy drinks are available. It does not look like it is getting any warmer at Stoke. A corner was swung into the box which Huddersfield failed to clear allowing Tomkins to take a shot from close range which was saved by Lossl but the big defender does not make any mistake with the rebound to give his team a vital lead. Get down to Altrincham versus Stalybridge early and you can still make it in time for Manchester United against Brighton later, as long as the Metrolink is working. A lovely day out in Greater Manchester for Danny Last. Goal! Coady lifts the ball over the top for Costa to chest down and fire one in for Wolves as they aim to get things back on track against lowly Burton, who signed a local student this week. Noel has emailed in to clear up my ludicrous question. He says: “It appears there are no rules for the colour of lines. However, if there’s an artificial surface (which must be green), then non-football lines are allowed as long as they are not the same colour as the football lines. A rule that must be useful in the US.” An assist for the wind at Scunthorpe! All quiet in the Premier League in the opening 10 minutes as everyone likes to get used to the snow and cold. Rondon has flashed a header straight at Begovic which is about as exciting as it gets. Accrington are winning against Forest Green! Callum Johnson has given the League Two leaders the lead as they look to extend their advantage over Luton Town who are currently losing at Newport. But Sheffield United are using red lines. Are there not some sort of Football Association rules for what colour lines need to be painted? Blue markings at Stoke instead of the traditional white due to the snow, which is novel. At least not many games have been taken by the weather this week as the snow is poor man’s Beast from the East, although my walk in was very nippy earlier. Goal! Kane Hemmings stepped up to equalise from the spot in 100th minute of Notts County versus Mansfield. His goal for the Stags made it 1-1, which is a decent result at Meadow Lane. Here we go! Yannick Bolasie up against Glen Johnson might be the real battle of the day, considering the latter has only made five appearances this season. Bolasie will fancy his chances in the cold and the snow, one suspects. There was a west London derby earlier and it did not go as Fulham would have hoped or expected. Here is the report. We are not far away from kick-off which is a relief as there are only three Premier League games to build up to. Let us all hope they are the best games of our lifetime. On the upside, none of us are currently at Stoke, which is a relief as it is freezing there. It is a big day for Dulwich Hamlet, they held a rally this morning. Here is more information on their current plight, courtesy of Hugo Greenhalgh. West Brom have not won in their last 14 away games and they have lost the last three without scoring, so things cannot get much worse, which is something to hold onto. Well, maybe they could get a little worse. Someone has angered Ossie Ardiles, which is not something you want to do. That looks cold... Alan has emailed in support of JR. Alan says: “I agree and sympathise with JR. In particular I’m mazed that Livermore merits inclusion in West Brom’s shambolic team, let alone England’s.” Just before we get into the 3pms, here is Daniel Taylor’s latest column on Uefa and their action against Besiktas and lack of with Welbeck. First Glen Johnson wins at golf this week and now he gets to start a Premier League match, what a time he is having. We already have an FA Cup semi-finalist after Spurs were untroubled by Swansea. Here is the report form Stuart James: In the big game of the day between Gainsborough Trinity and Stockport, both teams are fielding a Ben Hinchcliffe. Gainsborough’s is a striker on on loan from Hull, while the Hatters own version is a goalkeeper. Will Ben Hinchcliffe score against Ben Hinchcliffe? I will bring you the latest. I am legally obliged to bring up St Patrick’s Day. JR has emailed to point out how bad the West Brom team is on many levels. He says; “What the hell kind of lineup is Pardew throwing out there? No, seriously, what is that? It’s a shame he wasn’t able to wedge a second goalkeeper into the starting eleven. At least he is starting every defender and not leaving any on the bench. “Also benching his best midfielder is a wonderful move. Break curfew and steal a taxi? No trouble, you keep your place. Be unhappy when being removed from a game where you are one of the teams’ best players? That’s a benching, son. Oh man what a season. I don’t feel well.” Crystal Palace and Stoke City have the chance to move out of the relegation zone with wins today. Crystal Palace have Townsend, Benteke, Zaha leading the line so they will be confident of at least scoring one. Stoke have made a number of changes today as Paul Lambert seeks a formula which might hopefully keep them in the league. Glen Johnson and Peter Crouch start as Stoke back experience in their battle to stay up. Alan Pardew has done very little of note since joining West Brom but he was a little concerned about losing his job at the Premier League’s bottom club so he held some “clear the air talks” with the board. Pards said this week: “I told them what I think perhaps needs to happen going forward. They listened and I’m still in a job. “I said it was probably time I spoke to upstairs and said, ‘I don’t know where all this speculation is coming from, so let’s clear the air’”. There is plenty of stuff happening the Football League as the likes of Accrington Stanley look to take another stride in the direction of promotion.

Alas, there are no FA Cup games at 3pm, so we will need to make do with the glitz and glamour of the Premier League relegation battle. It’s a great collection of six teams who were knocked out of the Cup after playing weakened teams fighting for survival in the league. Bournemouth become the latest club who can add to the misery of West Brom as they look to all but ensure their Premier League safety with a win today. The good news for the Baggies and their followers is that they are in a seaside town, which could mean the players believing they are on holiday and a taxi being repossessed prior to Alan Pardew getting into it a full-time. Huddersfield host Crystal Palace which could is the most intriguing clash of the day. The Terriers drew with 10-man Swansea last week as they failed to break down the Welsh team and Palace will not be particularly liberal in their attacking neither. An on-song Zaha is what Palace need against a team four points ahead of them and if he is the mood it could lead them out of the relegation zone. Obviously Everton are safe from the misery of a relegation battle but losing away at Stoke on a cold, snowy Saturday afternoon will not make Big Sam look good. Stoke were, naturally, defeated by Manchester City on Monday but, seeing as they are second from bottom, this I one they really need to get three points from as Everton are inconsistent and the Potters need a huge boost ahead of the run-in. We will also have the best of the Football League, which must be more interesting than the Premier League."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2018/mar/17/liverpool-v-watford-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T19:21:22Z","webTitle":"Liverpool 5-0 Watford: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/mar/17/liverpool-v-watford-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/mar/17/liverpool-v-watford-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool 5-0 Watford: Premier League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The thing is, Watford didn’t play that badly. Liverpool were simply too good. Mo Salah was simply too good. He scored his 33rd, 34th, 35th and 36th goals of the season, helping his team into third place in the Premier League. They’re two points ahead of Tottenham and seven clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, though both of those teams have a game in hand. Anfield celebrates accordingly. Watford stay in 11th, eight points clear of the drop zone. Mo Salah, though. 90 min: Robertson nearly gets in down the left, but can’t get a shot away. There will be two added minutes. 89 min: Some crisp, quick passing between Salah and Milner down the right, and suddenly Ings is free. But the flag goes up for offside, correctly. What Ings would give for just one of Salah’s goals tonight. 88 min: Henderson rakes one towards Salah from deep. Salah is this close to reaching the ball and rounding Karnezis on the edge of the box, but the keeper bravely smothers at his feet. 87 min: Milner hoops a pass down the middle. Mane breaks into the box. A soft cushion and he’s shooting for goal, but he can’t take the ball down. A broad smile from Mane; it doesn’t really matter. Milner strides down the middle and lays off to Salah on his right. Salah plays a first-time diagonal chip to Ings, who is in the area and has a smash at goal. Karnezis parries, but the ball falls to Salah, who blasts hard into the net. Four goals today, plus one assist. 84 min: Mane scoops a lovely pass down the inside-right channel to Ings, who is free. He takes a touch and looks to send a power swerve into the top left. A very decent effort, but he’s denied by the strong arm of Karnezis. That’s a fine save. 83 min: Salah picks a poor Doucoure pass and races into space. He’s got Oxlade-Chamberlain to his right, and Ings screaming for it on the left. He opts for Oxlade-Chamberlain, who runs down a blind alley. You could sense the crowd willing the pass to Ings. 81 min: Janmaat replaces Britos, who won’t be sorry to be saying goodbye to Salah. 80 min: Okaka glides into the Liverpool box from the left. He’s got an opportunity to shoot, and takes it, but Matip arrives from nowhere to block. 79 min: Firmino is replaced by Ings, who hasn’t scored a goal since 2015. The roof will come off if he breaks that injury-hit run this evening. Mane dribbles into the Watford box from the right and lays off to Salah. He thinks about shooting, but drops a shoulder to see off Prodl and Doucoure, before poking a cute effort into the bottom left. Salah has now scored 27 Premier League goals this season, though this is his first hat-trick for the club! 76 min: Mane romps into a lot of space down the centre. He’s got the chance to release Firmino down the inside-left channel, but can’t get the pass right. Liverpool come again, Salah threatening to break down the right. The ball ends up with Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has a lash from the position he scored from against Manchester City. It’s straight at Karnezis. 74 min: Watford enjoy another spell of pinging it around nicely ... but once again they don’t really threaten Liverpool at the back. They’ll be ruing their slow start, because they’ve looked neat and ambitious since the restart. 72 min: Pereyra threatens to make good ground down the left, but he’s robbed by the non-stop Firmino, who is some player in both attack and defence. 70 min: Both teams make their second change of the evening. Okaka comes on for Deeney, then Oxlade-Chamberlain replaces Wijnaldum. 69 min: The snow is beginning to pelt down again. Salah tries to release Firmino into space down the left, but overhits the pass. There’s not much going on. 67 min: Watford are bossing possession at the moment. Crosses are flung into the Liverpool box from either wing; Gomez and Wijnaldum have to win some big headers with Deeney knocking around. Anfield has fallen a bit flat again as a result. 65 min: Richarlison is replaced by Will Hughes, who was once heavily linked with Liverpool while at Derby County. A chance for Hughes to show Liverpool what they’re missing. 64 min: Pereyra makes space down the left and curls into the centre. Deeney is lurking, but Robertson calmly intercepts and takes the sting out of the Watford attack. 63 min: Watford knock it around the middle of the park for a while, but don’t really go anywhere. They’ve looked much more confident since the restart, mind. 61 min: Gomez curls a cross into the Watford box from the right. Firmino, rushing in at pace, tries to guide a header into the left-hand portion of the net. But he doesn’t get enough on the effort, and it flashes left of the target. 59 min: Firmino jigs his way down the left and reaches the byline. He slips over on the slushy turf, but still manages to whip a leg at the ball, which clanks onto Mariappa’s thigh, and then the defender’s hand. Firmino wants a penalty, and claims loudly, but he’s not getting it. Mariappa surely had no chance of getting his hand out of the way, and it didn’t look deliberate. 58 min: Prodl strokes a gorgeous crossfield ball down the left for Holebas, who has a lot of time and space to size up his cross. It floats into the arms of Karius. Liverpool are offering up opportunities for Watford to get a little foothold back in this game, though. 56 min: Deeney lays off to Pereyra down the left, the latter very nearly busting clear into the Liverpool box. It’s not likely to end 3-0, this game, with both sides are looking like they fancy themselves in attack now. 54 min: Gomez gets the better of Holebas under a high ball down the right. He strides into the box and looks for Firmino in the middle. Prodl steps in and clears. 52 min: Pereyra curls fiercely towards the top right. He’s got Karius beaten all ends up, but his effort clips the top of the bar and out for a goal kick. So close to getting Watford on the scoreboard. That was a wonderful free kick. He’s been highly impressive, Pereyra, the standout for Watford today. 51 min: Holebas is given too much time and space as he wanders in from the left. He decides to lash a low shot towards the bottom left. It’s inches wide, though Karius had it covered. Liverpool then play themselves into trouble at the restart, Gomez getting stripped by Richarlison on the Watford left. Richarlison is about to break into the box, so Gomez hauls him back. The defender is booked, and this is a free kick in a dangerous position to the left of the Liverpool box. What a goal this is! Salah once again has Britos on toast down the right. He reaches the byline, takes a touch inside, and whips low to the near post, where Firmino, his back to goal, backflicks into the bottom left. Karnezis was taken out of the game in an instant. 48 min: Robertson, deep on the left, nearly releases Salah down the right with a Gerrardesque crossfield rake. Mariappa does very well to intercept. 46 min: Henderson crosses deep from the right. Firmino tries to guide a header into the top left, but it’s straight at Karnezis. And he’s offside anyway. And we’re off again! Liverpool get the party restarted, kicking towards the Kop in this second half. Which is usually how they like it. Salah’s two first-half goals, incidentally, mean he’s now broken the record for most goals in a debut season for Liverpool: 34 in all competitions, beating the mark of 33 set by Fernando Torres. Half-time reading: It’s 20 years since one Arsenal fan erupted in innocent glee and became an instant Premier League icon. Rob Smyth tells his story like only Rob Smyth can. Mo Salah, eh? 45 min: That goal is an untimely blow to Watford, who were beginning to ask some questions of Liverpool. There will be one minute of added time. 44 min: The Kop serenade their goalscoring hero, but then make sure to give their left-back his due as well. Robertson has made some impression at Liverpool this season. They’re not grumbling now! Mane threads a lovely pass down the inside-left channel for Robertson, who hares down the wing and curls a superb cross through the six-yard box towards Salah, who comes in from the right to sidefoot powerfully home. 42 min: Mane zips down the left. He’s got Firmino free in the centre, but blasts an awful cross harmlessly over his teammate. A few more moans from the Anfield faithful. 40 min: The corner leads to another corner; the second corner comes to nothing. Watford will be happy enough with the way this is going right now, given the start they made to the match. 39 min: Watford press Liverpool back, but the hosts break at speed. Milner rakes a lovely pass down the left for Salah, who races down the wing, glides inside, and tees up Firmino on the edge of the box. Firmino takes a touch to make some room, and lashes a shot towards the top left. Karnezis palms brilliantly over the bar! 37 min: Watford sting the hands of Karius for the first time! Pereyra crosses deep from the right. Richarlison rises and whistles a header towards the top left. Karius plucks it from the sky easily enough. Both teams have now had one effort on target; so much for all that early Liverpool domination, though of course they did score with theirs. But it’s beginning to look like a tough test for the hosts. 36 min: Salah skates past Britos down the right with ease. His cross is cleared. Henderson tries again, crossing high from the right. Mane brings the ball down and cuts inside looking to shoot, but he was miles offside. 35 min: Milner and Firmino combine crisply down the left to earn Liverpool’s fourth corner of the match. Salah whips it high to the far post, but Firmino can’t rise high enough to meet it. Goal kick. 33 min: Matip goes route one, and sends Firmino free down the middle. Mariappa gets back and hooks the ball over the bar, as the flag goes up incorrectly for offside. Anfield is beginning to bubble with a little concern and a lot of frustration. 32 min: Pereyra nutmegs Mane outrageously near the right-hand corner flag, and tears into the Liverpool box. His low cross is spanked clear by Matip. But Watford are very much in this match now. 31 min: Henderson clanks into Richarlison, and that’s a chance for Watford to load the box. The free kick’s sent to Prodl, on the right-hand corner of the Liverpool area. Prodl heads across. Deeney is lurking ... and offside, though Matip clears anyway. 29 min: A poor pass upfield by Matip is intercepted, and Pereyra makes his way into the Liverpool half. He’s got an opportunity to release Richarlison down the left, but overhits the pass, which sails into the stand. Liverpool have got a bit sloppy, and got away with one there. 27 min: Can is down, feeling his left leg. Or is it the small of his back? Either way, he looks as though he won’t be able to continue. He limps off, to warm applause. Klopp gives an unhappy player a warm hug and a kind word, before he disappears down the tunnel. Milner comes on in his place. 25 min: A loose pass from Wijnaldum allows Femenia an opportunity to scoot down the right. For a second Liverpool look in a bit of bother, but Robertson is across quickly to intercept and blooter clear. 24 min: Gomez throws long into the Watford area from the right; the visitors deal with it easily. Anfield has fallen a little quiet. The local heroes made a fast start, and they’re hogging the ball, but Karnezis hasn’t had a whole lot more to do since conceding. 23 min: Henderson clips a pass down the inside-left channel for Mane. A better touch from Mane and he’d have been away, but Mariappa knocks it out for a corner anyway. The set piece ends up at the feet of Wijnaldum, 20 yards out. He has a whack, but it’s blocked the second it leaves his boot. 21 min: The set piece isn’t all that. Wijnaldum tries to keep the pressure on Watford with a determined dribble into the box from the left, but there’s no space opening up for him, and eventually the ball clanks away from him. 20 min: Mariappa takes Mane down with a fairly basic challenge, 25 yards from goal on the left. Salah floats the free kick to the far post, where Firmino is lurking. Holebas is forced to head behind for a corner. 18 min: Salah spins away from Holebas on the right with a slick turn, but runs into trouble in the final third. It’s been all Liverpool, but Watford haven’t given up any more chances since the early goal. Now they just need to get a little something going in attack. 16 min: Henderson sends Salah scampering down the right again. He’s got the run of Britos. He slips a pass inside for Firmino, who is free in the box but offside, and correctly flagged. 15 min: Liverpool continue to dominate possession. Can tries to release Firmino down the inside right, but there’s nothing doing. They quickly get the ball back. Gomez whips a cross into the mixer from the right, but it’s too far ahead of Mane and Firmino and Karnezis is out quickly to snaffle. 13 min: Can spreads the play down the left. Salah is working this flank now, and earns a corner off Holebas. From the set piece, Salah and Firmino try to one-two their way free down the left, but Doucoure reads the play well and the move breaks down. 11 min: Henderson chips diagonally towards Salah on the right. Salah has no right to keep the pass, overhit, in play, but he does. He then very nearly tricks his way past Britos, who does very well to intercept given his early troubles in this particular duel. 9 min: A bit of space for Kiko Femenia down the right. He loops into the Liverpool area. Pereyra tries to get a header on target, but his effort sails harmlessly wide left and high. Liverpool have had 58% possession in these early exchanges. 7 min: The snow’s stopped falling. I doubt we’ve seen the last of it. There’s still some on the ground. Liverpool make some more pretty trails at the back. Watford haven’t really had a sniff yet. Henderson rolls a pass down the inside right but it’s a tad overhit, allowing Karnezis to smother just before Salah can get on the end of it. 5 min: Salah had been on a two-game goal drought. Two games! Mane chips the ball down the inside-right channel for Salah, who briefly threatens to break into the area for a shot. But Britos heads him off. No worries, though, because Salah is soon coming back at the same player again. Set free down the right by Mane, he enters the box, sits Britos on his behind with a left-to-right drag, then slots the ball under Karnezis for the opener. 2 min: Liverpool stroke the ball around the back for a bit. As it rolls around, it makes light trails on the whitening turf. A fairly sedate start. And we’re off! The snow comes down heavy at a blustery Anfield, as Watford get the ball rolling. The visitors will be kicking towards the Kop in the first half. Ian Copestake writes: “Not a lot seemed to be made of how miffed Oxlade-Chamberlain was at being removed from the Old Trafford game. Imagine his face must be a picture now he is benched.” I hope he’s wrapped up warm. Before the kick-off, a minute’s applause for John Molyneux, Liverpool’s loyal right-back during the club’s Second Division wilderness years in the late 50s and early 60s. A warm moment in the bitter cold. RIP. The teams are out! Liverpool are in red, Watford hornet yellow. Everyone’s happy, draped as they are in their first-choice livery. It’s a very cold day on Merseyside, perhaps most charitably described as changeable: when BT Sport started broadcasting, icy snow was whipping across Anfield. Then it fell relatively calm. But now there are more snow showers, so it’ll be an interesting evening all right. Anyway, we’ll be off in a minute, but before we start, some promising news for those Liverpool fans desirous of finishing in this season’s top four, as Burn Lamche would very much like to take issue with the preamble of this MBM: “Chelsea fan here. We aren’t resurgent.” Javi Gracia speaks! “We try to improve our away form. The last game against Arsenal, we created many chances. We didn’t score but we created chances. If we continue in the same way, we will be able to score goals and get points.” Jurgen Klopp speaks! “The changes are nothing to with last week. Dejan is not available, so that’s the first reason. And that’s about it: the rest, we looked at what we might need against Watford, and that’s the outcome. Maybe they will play with five at the back. It will be another challenge. They are good on the counter, they have quality and we respect that. but we are difficult to play on a good day.” Liverpool mix it up a bit in the wake of last weekend’s defeat at Manchester United, making four changes to their starting XI. Joe Gomez, Jordan Henderson, Georginio Wijnaldum and Joel Matip replace Trent Alexander-Arnold, James Milner and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who all drop to the bench, and Dejan Lovren, who misses out altogether. Watford make just the one change to the team named for their 3-0 defeat at Arsenal. Miguel Britos comes in for Darryl Janmaat, who is on the bench. Liverpool: Karius, Gomez, Matip, van Dijk, Robertson, Can, Henderson, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Milner, Klavan, Moreno, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Mignolet, Ings, Alexander-Arnold. Watford: Karnezis, Britos, Prodl, Mariappa, Holebas, Doucoure, Capoue, Femenia, Richarlison, Pereyra, Deeney. Subs: Gomes, Janmaat, Cathcart, Gray, Hughes, Carrillo, Okaka. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). It’s Liverpool versus Manchester City! But before the big showdown in the Champions League, Jurgen Klopp’s side have to concentrate hard on getting into the competition again next season. A top-four place in the Premier League is by no means a shoo-in, with Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur relentless, and Chelsea resurgent. So they desperately need three points tonight, in order to open up a seven-point gap over Chelsea in fifth. On the face of it, Watford shouldn’t provide too much of a problem, given they lost at Anfield 6-1 last season, and tasted defeat in their three visits previous to that. They haven’t won at Anfield since Tommy Mooney shocked Gerard Houllier’s side back in 1999 on Sami Hyppia’s debut. But Watford gave Liverpool some serious concerns on the opening day of the season at Vicarage Road, Miguel Britos snatching a late equaliser in a thoroughly deserved 3-3 draw. They’ve also given the Reds a proper spanking in recent memory: 3-0 just before Christmas 2015. And their recent Premier League form is very impressive: three wins in their last five games, a run which included a 4-1 evisceration of Chelsea, plus victories over Everton and West Brom. All of those triumphs were at home, though; the only two away games during that sequence ended as losses at West Ham and Arsenal. Couple that dismal form on the road with Watford’s poor record at Anfield, and there’s why Liverpool are strong favourites tonight. Klopp’s team might betray some nerves, though, given their recent loss at Manchester United and their desperate need for points. So this represents something of a free hit for Watford, who are under no pressure whatsoever and on their day are nobody’s fools. It could be a very interesting evening. It’s on! Kick off: 5.30pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/17/chalrles-dickens-letter-nicholas-nickleby-wackford-squeers","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T00:04:19Z","webTitle":"Will the real Wackford Squeers step forward?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/17/chalrles-dickens-letter-nicholas-nickleby-wackford-squeers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/17/chalrles-dickens-letter-nicholas-nickleby-wackford-squeers","fields":{"headline":"Will the real Wackford Squeers step forward?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It is not a claim to fame anyone would relish: the honour of being named as the inspiration for one of Charles Dickens’ most unappealing fictional characters, Wackford Squeers, sadistic headmaster of Dotheboys Hall in Nicholas Nickleby. Even now, 180 years since the book came out, the identity of the real school teacher behind the cruel persecutor of Dicken’s young hero is disputed. Scholars remain unsure which of a clutch of venal proprietors of barbaric Victorian boarding schools was the true original. But this Thursday a key piece of literary evidence is up for auction in New York. A handwritten letter written from Dickens details research he had carried out before inventing Squeers and clearly suggests that a Mr Twycross of Winton Hall in Westmoreland (now part of Cumbria) provided the prototype, and not William Shaw of Bowes Academy in Yorkshire, as academics have usually maintained. In the letter, sent to campaigning politician Lord Robert Grosvenor in July 1838, Dickens thanks his friend for sending him the cutting of an incriminating newspaper advertisement for Winton Hallwhich promised the parents and guardians of young children “no vacations”, hinting that unwanted stepchildren or illegitimate offspring might be left with no questions asked, as long as payments were received. “Mr Squeers and Dotheboys Hall were originally suggested to [Dickens] by such advertisements as Lord Robert Grosvenor has had the kindness to enclose,” the formal letter reads, adding that he had been in the immediate neighborhood of Mr Twycross “in the course of a little tour among the Yorkshire schools” he had made the previous winter. Yet it is Shaw who has often been deemed the best candidate for Wackford, not simply because he shared the initials of the fictional character, but because Dickens actually met him during a trip to Yorkshire before writing the novel. Travelling incognito, the author had visited Bowes Academy near Barnard Castle, County Durham, and encountered Shaw, who had already been convicted of negligence in 1823 after eight boys in his care went blind. A later published letter from Dickens, this time to the Irish novelist Anna Maria Hall – who published under the name Mrs S C Hall – also supports the idea that Shaw was the model for one-eyed Wackford. In it Dickens explains he has deliberately diluted the horror of the story of the school in his new novel “and thrown as much comicality on it as I could, rather than disgust and weary the reader with its fouler aspects”. He then goes on to shed light on the poignant germination of another of the central characters of the book, Smike, when he describes coming across the snowy grave of an eighteen-year-old former pupil of “that wretched place” whose “ghost put Smike into my head upon the spot”. Yet 17 years ago the great-great-grandson of Shaw, an engineer called Ted Shaw, attempted to clear the family’s reputation. He argued his ancester was never the fiend depicted in Dickens’ novel, even though he also wore a patch over one eye, and thatthe assumption that his school was as bad as Dotheboys had ruined Shaw’s life. “Dickens took a lot of evidence from the trial and adapted it to suit his own interests,” Shaw’s champion claimed. “Medicine has moved on – at the trial the cause of blindness was put down to poor diet when in fact it was probably trachoma brought back from the Napoleonic wars.” The real path of the creative process inside the famous novelist’s head will never be known. But fans of Nicholas Nickelby do still have the words of the author’s own preface as a guide. “Mr Squeers is the representative of a class, and not of an individual,” Dickens wrote, to indicate that he saw the unpleasant schoolmaster as a composite figure and, perhaps, to put readers off the scent. The letter to Lord Grosvenor will go on sale at Swann Auction Galleries together with the original envelope with an estimate of $3,500-$5,000. It is additionally signed and addressed in Dickens’ own hand and is complete with a red wax seal bearing the lion of the Dickens family crest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/19/the-alt-right-is-in-decline-has-antifa-activism-worked","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T21:02:30Z","webTitle":"The alt-right is in decline.

Has antifascist activism worked?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The alt-right appears to be falling apart. The Traditionalist Workers party disintegrated this week after a lurid interpersonal drama among its leadership. Richard Spencer says his alt-right rallies aren’t “fun” any more, and is rethinking his college tour in the aftermath of his fizzer of an event in East Lansing, Michigan, two weeks ago. It’s a good time to offer an observation: on the terms it set itself, antifascist organizing in the United States has worked. Consider the failure of Spencer’s long-planned address at Michigan State University. Though it was spring break, students and organized antifascist groups showed up to protest, and Spencer gave his pitch for a white ethnostate to an almost empty auditorium. He issued 150 tickets, but only managed to get 20 people along. Spencer himself blamed the protesters for the event’s failure, just as he is blaming them for his movement’s declining ability to muster any numbers in public. And that non-event was not an outlier. The same weekend, a planned alt-right conference in Detroit fell apart after venues pulled out under public pressure and one of the organizers, lawyer Kyle Bristow, announced he was leaving the movement. Various “March 4 Trump” events around the country, featuring alt-right contingents, were also small, and met with significant counterprotests. Other events in the latter half of last year were also poorly executed and sparsely attended. On a recent podcast, Spencer said the movement was “in a dark place”. And it has been put there by those determined to oppose it. Throughout 2017 and into 2018, antifascists have consistently showed up to, and disrupted, public far-right gatherings. After I saw its numbers peak at Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer, the openly white supremacist and fascist segment of the far right has been consistently opposed and usually outnumbered by counterprotesters at events around the country. From my perch in Portland, Oregon, I have seen antifascists show up month in, month out to publicly oppose far-right organizing. In some instances, such as in Boston last 19 August, rightwing rallies have faced opposition numbering in the tens of thousands. The far right’s online organizing has also been targeted. Websites like Unicorn Riot have obtained logs from servers used to organize events like Charlottesville. As well as using them in their own reporting, they have made them available to mainstream news organizations. (ProPublica’s recent reporting on secretive neo-nazi group AtomWaffen was based on similar leaked chat logs.) These materials, as well as media reporting, have been used to identify and expose far-right activists to their families, teachers and employers, in the communities they live in. For many on the alt-right, this has led to serious legal consequences. Rightwing Charlottesville participants are awaiting trial on charges ranging from murder to felony perjury. Cases like that of Oregon’s Andrew Oswalt, who was in student government until exposed as a far-right activist, and was charged with a felony hate crime, show that this kind of work is going on away from highly publicized events. And major tech platforms and their advertisers have been pressured to exclude far-right voices, and they have been responding. From late last year, Twitter began excluding alt-right accounts en masse, and recently YouTube has appointed more moderators to police beefed-up policies on hate speech. Far-right users have increasingly retreated to smaller, more accommodating platforms. Antifascist groups have been the target of criticism from across the political spectrum during the first year of the Trump presidency. The right has made them the basis both of moral panics about violence, and conspiracy theories of subversion. And other leftists have questioned the wisdom of antifascist tactics and strategy. The morality of political violence is a weighty, and always important topic, which we need to constantly scrutinize and revisit. That said, most of the antifascist tactics described above are nonviolent. And a lot of antifascist violence has been defensive, notably in Charlottesville. As to tactics, the proof is in the pudding. All of the measures described have led not only to failed events and dwindling cadres, but to infighting and blame games in an increasingly fractious far-right movement. Seriously divided, the alt-right looks like it is crumbling. The broader hard right is still active, and energized. The growth of groups like the Proud Boys shows that you don’t need to tote swastikas to engage in political violence, and Turning Point USA shows how attacking the left can be given a veneer of respectability. There’s also the fact that during the Trump era, a lot of far-right political beliefs have been partially mainstreamed – the resurgence of public antisemitism is just one indicator of that. But it seems that the white supremacist alt-right will not survive the Trump era as a coherent movement. If so, antifascist activists can take a large measure of credit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/17/finland-happiness-worlds-happiest-country-equality","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T16:34:00Z","webTitle":"Finland’s story shows equality is the best route to happiness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/17/finland-happiness-worlds-happiest-country-equality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/17/finland-happiness-worlds-happiest-country-equality","fields":{"headline":"Finland’s story shows equality is the best route to happiness","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"If you can’t buy happiness, perhaps you should move to Helsinki. Finland has emerged from a 10-year economic depression to be ranked by the UN last week as the happiest place to live on the planet. The most important factor in Finland topping the UN’s happiness ranking is the country’s history of equality. It has managed to strike an amicable balance between the sexes, between workers and bosses, and within the education and welfare systems. An equal society can bond together to survive the bad times when so many countries pull themselves apart. At the turn of the century Finland was riding high. It boasted one of the world’s most successful tech companies – Nokia – and a had a well-deserved reputation for embracing the internet revolution. It had escaped from the shadow of the Soviet Union to become a robust neighbour to Russia. Then Nokia found itself on the wrong side of the smartphone revolution, following the launch of Apple’s iPhone. Slow to react, it went into terminal decline. After the financial crisis hit, Finland was unable to recover. By 2016, and after five years of declining national income, the economy had stabilised. Last year the bounce-back finally took hold and the economy is estimated to have grown by 3.2%. This year the country’s largest bank, OP Financial Group, says gross domestic product is expected to keep up the pace of expansion at 3.3%. Yet this recovery takes Finland back only to where it was before the financial crisis. The UK, by contrast, bounced back to its 2008 peak in 2014. The US recovery was even quicker. So why, when the UK, the US and many other European countries have contended with huge populist waves that have culminated in a vote of no confidence in their ruling political elites, has Finland remained happy? A state education system that shepherds all children through to 18 without the need for selective or private schooling has for many years kept the country at or near the top of the rankings of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. During the 1990s, research and development in Finland was around the highest in the developed world, at 4% of GDP; while it has slipped back to just below 3%, it remains among the best in Europe. The health service and welfare programmes remain universal, even if not quite as generous as they once were. Its state broadcaster is ranked alongside the BBC as among the most innovative in Europe. Tech companies such as the games studio Supercell, creator of Clash of Clans, has taken over where Nokia left off, paying more than €800m in tax and producing seven of Finland’s top-10 income tax payers in 2016. Not that Nokia has disappeared. It is still a major manufacturer and the largest employer, with 102,000 staff, followed by escalator maker Kone. The salaries of the best-paid 10,000 or so workers are published for all to see. All these areas of Finnish life exemplify a cooperative spirit that commentators say is born of the harsh climate. The cold forces people to be independent and overcome inhospitable conditions. It also forces them to come together to achieve things, nurturing a degree of neighbourliness that extends into public life and state policies. Nevertheless, the period of economic depression has been scarring. The rise of the far-right True Finns party, which elected an anti-immigration hardliner as its leader last year, is evidence of that. The conservatives who control the coalition government were the most vocal critics of a bailout for Greece, and are currently pushing through parliament steep cuts in healthcare that will force more Finns to go private. This move, which may dent the happiness figures, is in response to one of the most rapidly ageing populations in Europe. Airbus could shoot down hopes GKN sale will be blocked Turnaround specialist Melrose is a seasoned deal-making warrior with a string of takeover scalps under its belt, but its £8.1bn hostile tilt at engineer GKN is proving to be its most bruising battle yet. The proposal is already facing fierce opposition from trade unions and a cohort of MPs, including party leaders Jeremy Corbyn and Vince Cable. Opponents of the deal have branded Melrose an asset-stripper that can’t be trusted not to rip the guts out of a key player in Britain’s industrial landscape. The government has also indicated that it is mindful of concerns about national security: GKN makes parts for military aircraft including the Typhoon fighter jet and A400M transport plane. But noises from Whitehall have suggested that GKN might not be pivotal enough to Britain’s military power to warrant interference in private enterprise. Enter aviation titan Airbus, diving out of the sun to launch a volley at Melrose’s plans. Airbus is GKN’s biggest customer, accounting for nearly £700m of sales, or nearly 7% of the company’s revenues last year. It warned last week it could not support the sale of a major supplier to Melrose, which it feared had short-termist intentions. Like pilots, aircraft manufacturers prefer to see a long way ahead of them. There may yet be hope for Melrose. Airbus had been miffed at a perceived “lack of engagement” from the company and could be using public scepticism to strengthen its hand in private talks. A sit-down scheduled for the end of the month will give Melrose the chance to flesh out pledges such as continued spending on research. Airbus could also seek to strong-arm Melrose into future price reductions in return for support. Engineering champion Rolls-Royce, which accounts for 3% of GKN’s £3.4bn aerospace sales, has made it clear that it won’t stand in Melrose’s way. So if Airbus can be brought around, MPs and unions could yet be drowned out by the roar of jet engines. Honesty not the best policy when you’re moving HQ Why blame Brexit for a decision to leave the country and trigger the resentment of 17 million referendum voters? Unilever must have calculated that a planned move to the Netherlands could spark protests from Brexit voters if it blamed their electoral preference for its decision. The Anglo-Dutch maker of Dove soap and Hellman’s mayonnaise will instead move its headquarters to Rotterdam as part of a restructuring to simplify management decision-making. The previous London/Rotterdam split HQ may have worked for decades, during which time the company has become one of the world’s largest consumer products firms with a £50bn turnover, but not any more. The uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit negotiations was of no consequence, it said. Maybe Brexit wasn’t the main reason. Maybe Unilever, having sold the margarine and spreads business developed by the Dutch half of the firm, needed to offer a sop to the Amsterdam government. Or it could be that its board of directors, top-heavy with Dutch executives, wanted a move to favour their homeland. They certainly denied that the Dutch were better at protecting firms from unwanted takeovers and that that was the reason for the move. Unilever, let it not be forgotten, recently fought off an aggressive £115bn takeover bid by Kraft, the voracious US cheese- and cereal-maker that earlier swallowed Cadbury. So we can’t know the real reason. And that will probably be the case whenever a British company with large foreign holdings or a foreign owner says it is moving a factory, a division or the HQ, and then claims Brexit played no part in its thinking. It would be foolish for a large firm, especially one that deals directly with the public, to say that the loss of the single market and customs union lay behind a decision to quit: it might leave a bad taste in British mouths."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/16/annmarie-wolpe-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T17:12:35Z","webTitle":"AnnMarie Wolpe obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/16/annmarie-wolpe-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/16/annmarie-wolpe-obituary","fields":{"headline":"AnnMarie Wolpe obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My friend AnnMarie Wolpe, who has died aged 87, was an anti-apartheid activist and feminist. Throughout her life, she displayed enormous resilience, sustained by an ironic sense of humour and wonderful elan. In 1963, her husband, Harold Wolpe, a civil rights lawyer and member of the ANC and the South African Communist party, was arrested and imprisoned in Johannesburg under the 90-day detention act. He was listed as a co-conspirator of those who would become the defendants in the Rivonia trial, among them Nelson Mandela. AnnMarie smuggled tungsten files and metal cutters into the prison inside loaves of bread and a chicken carcass. She helped bribe a guard, as well as passing messages to and from other prisoners and their families. With another detainee, Arthur Goldreich, Harold made his escape; they spent 18 hours in the boot of a car as they were driven out of South Africa across the border into Swaziland. Harold fled into exile in the UK. AnnMarie was arrested but her lawyer, Joel Joffe, negotiated with the police to allow her to leave South Africa. She was forced to leave behind her three children, including a baby recovering from pneumonia, though they were subsequently able to join their parents in the UK. The Wolpes forged successful academic careers, Harold as a sociologist at Essex University, and AnnMarie researching educational policy and publishing three books on the subject. She set up the women’s studies programme at Middlesex University and in 1980 was a founder member of the journal Feminist Review. Daughter of Polly and Abraham Kantor, AnnMarie grew up in Johannesburg, where her father was a successful entrepreneur, and met Harold while they were both students at Witwatersrand University. Members of his political circle did not approve of the marriage, perceiving AnnMarie as a bourgeois princess who was incapable of understanding their radicalism, but her actions after his arrest earned their respect. In later years, she was an exotic figure in feminist circles, a slightly camp grande dame, vivacious and beautiful, although sometimes at odds with the often puritanical attitudes of some feminists towards self presentation. She was devoted to her husband and children at a time when women were questioning traditional attitudes towards family life, but she was fully aware, through her own experience, of the contradictions that confronted women and the compromises they could feel forced to make. With the ending of apartheid the Wolpes returned to South Africa, to Cape Town. AnnMarie felt quite ambivalent about this but, once there, she and Harold played an educational role in the ANC. Harold died in 1996. AnnMarie is survived by their son, Nicholas, two daughters, Peta and Tessa, and six grandchildren, Jonathan and Alicia, Jade, James, Liam and Olivier."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/16/skripals-may-have-received-nerve-agent-in-liquid-form-says-expert","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T17:27:26Z","webTitle":"Skripals may have received nerve agent in liquid form, says expert","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/16/skripals-may-have-received-nerve-agent-in-liquid-form-says-expert","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/16/skripals-may-have-received-nerve-agent-in-liquid-form-says-expert","fields":{"headline":"Skripals may have received nerve agent in liquid form, says expert","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The nerve agent used in the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia may have been a liquid that was applied to their clothes, the former commander of the British regiment that specialised in detecting chemical weapons has told the Guardian. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, who was a commander of the now disbanded Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment, said such a means of delivery could explain why the Skripals were apparently not affected immediately. The hunt for clues and the clean-up operation has spread to about 20 sites in Salisbury, across Wiltshire and into the neighbouring county of Dorset. It involves almost 1,000 police officers, military personnel and other emergency services staff. Public Health England officials will be at the open-air Charter Market in Salisbury on Saturday to speak to people worried about their health or the long-term implications of the attack on the city. Police have said some cordons could remain for months. De Bretton-Gordon suggested earlier in the week that the nerve agent, a novichok, may have been delivered in a powder form. Having observed how counter-terror police and military were dealing with it and examined the timeline of the day the pair collapsed, de Bretton-Gordon said he believed it was more likely to have been a liquid. He said: “I think it’s a liquid because of dissemination means. Had [the Skripals] breathed it in, they would have died instantaneously. Therefore it would appear most likely that someone put it on clothing. If they had put it directly on the skin, they would have died in under half an hour.” The Skripals arrived in Salisbury at 1.45pm. They went to the Mill pub and on to the Zizzi restaurant, arriving there at about 2.20pm and staying until 3.35pm. The emergency services were called at 4.15pm when the Skripals collapsed on a bench next to the river Avon. De Bretton-Gordon said putting the nerve agent on clothing would mean it would take time to work – perhaps an hour. This would give the perpetrators 60 minutes to get away. According to de Bretton-Gordon, the military do not have easy access to devices that can detect novichok. He suggested that laboratory equipment was being brought in to try to trace the agent, which might explain why the process is so taking so long. In Salisbury, investigators in protective clothing examined railings close to the bench where the Skripals collapsed on Friday. Attention was also focused again on a car recovery business believed to have removed Skripal’s BMW. Part of the industrial estate where Ashley Road Recovery is based was sealed off and two army trucks arrived, apparently ready to take a vehicle – possibly the BMW – away. Shopkeepers in Salisbury will wait anxiously to see if business picks up over the weekend. Residents and politicians are concerned that the attack could dent the city’s reputation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/16/the-guardian-view-on-schools-and-austerity-more-than-a-funding-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T17:17:21Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on schools and austerity: more than just a funding crisis | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/16/the-guardian-view-on-schools-and-austerity-more-than-a-funding-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/16/the-guardian-view-on-schools-and-austerity-more-than-a-funding-crisis","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on schools and austerity: more than a funding crisis","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When the Conservatives first took Britain down the path of budget austerity in 2010, schools were meant to be protected. George Osborne, chancellor at the time, was confident in the public’s readiness to tolerate most cuts, but even he realised that taking money away from education was toxic. As with similar promises on NHS spending, the “ring-fence” around the schools budget turns out to be woefully inadequate. Research published on Friday by the Education Policy Institute (EPI), an independent thinktank, finds that a quarter of English secondary schools are running a deficit. No one with knowledge of the education sector imagines those budget overruns describe managerial largesse. The problem is not enough incoming cash to cover the cost of running a school. The EPI analysis was restricted by publicly available data to local-authority run schools in England, but there is evidence that academy trusts, responsible for hundreds of schools, are similarly strapped. Even the secretary of state concedes that funding is now “tight”. In 2017, £1.3bn of “additional” budget was allocated to schools – to be paid over two years. But that was a fiscal sticking plaster that effectively kept funding per pupil frozen. The money came from elsewhere in the education department budget. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that, in real terms, the schools budget will have declined by 4.6% in the period 2015-20. Most people would call that a cut. That is how it is experienced by teachers, pupils and parents. As with the NHS, ministers are fighting a losing battle to sustain a pretence of adequate financing, when evidence on the ground contradicts their story. Also, as with the NHS, the government has been protected from more severe political consequences of the budget squeeze by the goodwill of frontline staff. That isn’t to say that teachers (or doctors and nurses) are favourably disposed towards the Tories. The opposite seems likelier. But it is in the nature of the work they do that a voluntaristic spirit kicks in to fill gaps in care. The duty to pupils that most teachers feel isn’t pegged to the money they have to work with, and so many endure an unsustainable workload, subsidising the government with investments of their own time to keep the system functioning. That takes its toll on retention and recruitment. Earlier this year, a parliamentary committee reported that hiring levels have undershot government targets every year for the past five years. Around 10,000 fewer secondary school teachers have been hired than had been the intention. It has not helped that, alongside financial constraints, teachers have felt systematically undervalued. Michael Gove’s time as education secretary was especially problematic, since he appeared to see the profession as a reactionary “blob” determined to thwart progress. His successors have struck more emollient tones, but the damage has not been undone. Perhaps the greatest problem for the Tories where education is concerned is that even if direct funding is bolstered, schools still end up on the frontline of austerity. Children suffer when other local authority services disappear. Benefit cuts and the imposition of capricious sanctions on parents hit many of the most vulnerable, which in turn has an impact on the whole classroom. Teachers find themselves working overtime to compensate for a wide spectrum of damage to the social fabric. In his spring statement earlier this week, Philip Hammond tried to strike a note of cautious optimism over the public finances. The chancellor hinted that the squeeze on services might be eased in his autumn budget. No doubt schools are near the front of the queue for help, just after hospitals. What the Conservatives fail to understand is that the social and cultural impact of austerity is not expressed simply in balance sheets and budget deficits. It is manifest in the degrading of the public realm more widely, the demoralisation of public servants and the destitution of people who rely on public services. That legacy will not quickly be reversed, nor will its political authors be quickly forgiven."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/17/weightlifting-protest-raises-bar-iran-sportswomen-two-young-girls","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T20:30:59Z","webTitle":"Child’s tears spark weightlifting protest that raises bar for Iran’s sportswomen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/17/weightlifting-protest-raises-bar-iran-sportswomen-two-young-girls","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/17/weightlifting-protest-raises-bar-iran-sportswomen-two-young-girls","fields":{"headline":"Child’s tears spark weightlifting protest that raises bar for Iran’s sportswomen","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"If you are good at weightlifting in Iran, you can become as rich as a Premier League footballer. The country boasts 300 professional weightlifters, dedicated arenas in every sizable town, and full-time officials in all 31 provinces. When an Olympic champion got married in 2006, his wedding made national television news. “Weightlifting is more popular in Iran than in any other country,” said Mohammad Barkhah, the national team’s head coach. Only football is more popular and, as with football, the sport has historically been an overwhelmingly male domain – until now. Next month four teenagers are set to become the first female weightlifters to represent Iran – in a competition in Uzbekistan. The young women have the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo in their sights, and weightlifting has become an unlikely vehicle of female empowerment. The change has come about thanks in part to a remarkable alliance between Iran and the US, and the efforts of an eight-year-old girl who won nationwide support for the women’s cause last weekend. Aysan Adib was in tears when security men enforced a ban on females entering the arena for a men’s international competition, the Fajr Cup, in Ahvaz, south-west Iran. Religious leaders in Khuzestan province had given permission for the ban to be relaxed, but because the signed paperwork was not presented the security guards refused them entry. Aysan, and six-year-old Yeganeh Bandeh Khodo, thus missed a unique chance to show off their skills in a demonstration scheduled for the penultimate day of the event. The result was a passionate protest that rapidly went viral. Ursula Garza Papandrea, one of the most senior women in the sport, who headed a US delegation of three to the competition, joined the exiled girls outside in protest. The Americans were in Ahvaz to help launch Iran’s female weightlifting programme, making sporting history along the way. Garza Papandrea, a highly qualified coach who is president of USA Weightlifting and vice-president of the sport’s global governing body, the International Weightlifting Federation, became the first woman to coach a man in an Iranian competition when she helped Derrick Johnson to victory in the Fajr Cup 62kg class on the first day. US technical official Sally Van de Water, who is also state folklorist for Pennsylvania, was the first woman to referee in a men’s competition. The Americans have forged a strong relationship with Iran – “this is above politics,” said Garza Papandrea. They were feted by dignitaries everywhere they went, photographed, interviewed and plied with gifts. The exclusion of the two girls was therefore embarrassing for Iran – and big news. That news spread fast after pictures of a tearful Aysan appeared on social media. Khuzestan’s provincial governor, Gholamreza Shariati, stepped in, and a day later led Aysan, Yeganeh and the vice-president of Iran’s women’s weightlifting programme, Reyhaneh Tarighat, into the arena. There were also women among the spectators, on the results and media desks and, to the visible disgust of one of the security men, even in the VIP seats. Aysan and Yeganeh gave their performance a day late, when the men had finished. As the crowd cheered they became the first female weightlifters to appear on Iranian television, live on state-owned Channel 3, after which they were surrounded by media men and – another first – women. The story made the front page of national daily newspaper Hamshahri, which has nearly a million readers. A call to “let them in” went up as the issue of women in sport became a hot topic in the Iranian media. Shahrokh Shahnazi, secretary general of Iran’s Olympic committee, said the body would be supporting the women and could one day bid to host the weightlifting world championships, which have not been held in Iran in more than half a century. The brains behind the women’s programme is Ali Moradi, influential president of the Iranian weightlifting federation. He became convinced of the need for change at the 2016 Rio Olympics as he watched a teenager in a hijab, Sara Ahmed, become the first Egyptian woman to win an Olympic weightlifting medal. “We cannot make any progress without the support of men,” said Tarighat, who has “a vision that in the future we will become even better than the men’s team”. Big challenges remain. Women’s sport is barely ever shown on television in Iran, and women are still forbidden to watch men compete, may not perform without a hijab, and their kit must conform to Islamic dress code. A newly designed weightlifting costume was sent to the authorities last Monday: a verdict is due soon. Iran’s top female footballer, Niloufar Ardalan, was unable to play international matches in 2015 when her husband would not give the approval she needed, under Islamic law, to travel to games outside Iran. She contacted Garza Papandrea to thank her for her support in weightlifting, and said she wished somebody would do the same in football. “There are issues in sport and gender that are experienced only in Iran,” said Bahman Baktiari, an American-Iranian academic who is executive director of the International Foundation for Civil Society. He added: “Islamic restrictions take away the competitiveness of sport in Iran.” Garza Papandrea, who is also a lecturer in political science in Austin, Texas, said she had been blown away by the reaction: “Of all the many women’s projects I have supported over the years, this one is the most significant.” She and Van de Water wore headscarves for their week in Ahvaz. “I’ll wear whatever we have to wear, anywhere, if it will help to further women’s weightlifting – and I don’t think that is true of all the feminists in our sport,” she said. “We’re talking about developing a long-term relationship with Iran. If we can help Iranian women to compete internationally, of course we want to help. I’m so proud to see what is happening here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/25/sunflower-bean-twentytwo-in-blue-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T07:00:46Z","webTitle":"Sunflower Bean: Twentytwo in Blue review – glittering confidence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/25/sunflower-bean-twentytwo-in-blue-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/25/sunflower-bean-twentytwo-in-blue-review","fields":{"headline":"Sunflower Bean: Twentytwo in Blue review – glittering confidence","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"There are so many great lost venues that bands like Sunflower Bean will never get to play.

This glittering confidence pays off on the majestic, mid-paced I Was a Fool, and the luscious, wistful Twentytwo.

Sometimes when I get home at 7.30pm, I’m not able to eat again; I sit with my wife and daughters, Martha, 12, and Mabel, 11, while they’re having supper, and drink tea. Work I pop into our Soho office twice a week and get a report from each restaurant every morning. I think it’s very important not to micro-manage staff; timekeeping is also a bugbear.

We’re happy to be building with three wins from our last three and, while we might not be all-singing and all-dancing yet, it’s a case of just knocking up wins at this time of the year.” Gale earned plaudits aplenty last year, being named the man of steel, and while he says handling the change in perception of Castleford as a club is a challenge, he is unmoved by any extra spotlight which may be on his own game. “What’s difficult is the belief now that everyone expects you to win by 60 points – if you win by 20, Castleford are assumed to have played poorly,” he says. “Nobody is ever completely happy; I guess that’s just sport. But we know these next few weeks we’ve a great opportunity to show what we’re about.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/18/brexit-comic-mocks-leaver-views-with-trumpton-town","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T00:05:36Z","webTitle":"May, May, Johnson and Gove … new Brexit comic apes Trumpton roll call","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/18/brexit-comic-mocks-leaver-views-with-trumpton-town","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/18/brexit-comic-mocks-leaver-views-with-trumpton-town","fields":{"headline":"May, May, Johnson and Gove … new Brexit comic apes Trumpton roll call","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The first Brexit comic, with characters including the Reverend May and her Brexit Gang, David Dealin’ Davis and Boris “Captain Brexit” Johnson, will go into circulation next month, loosely based on the classic 1960s children’s TV programme Trumpton. The project is the idea of illustrator and author Mike Dicks, who raised £4,400 via crowdfunding to pay for the first edition, which will be posted to donors and supporters by 1 April. “The Brexit comic is about giving everyone a laugh. Better than crying about it,” says Dicks, who admits he is a Remainer. “I suppose it’s countercultural to go from online to print, but I was a huge fan of the Beano and like the idea of a physical comic every month.” Dicks, a former independent TV producer, began with caricatures of Ukip leader Nigel Farage in the run-up to the 2016 referendum. “I’d been worrying about him and Ukip,” Dicks told the Observer. “I kept thinking about how Farage was looking back to a golden age, but he’s about the same age as me, so what era is he referencing? My recollection of the 1960s and 70s was that in many ways it was a rather shit time. “He made me think of Trumpton, which was about an old-fashioned town with no foreigners – except Mr Antonio the ice-cream man, who was almost run out of town – and an autocratic mayor. “It seemed the sort of place and sort of Britain Farage was nostalgic about, so I started a Trumpton_Ukip Twitter account to gently mock him, his supporters and their backward-looking views. It had a couple of hundred followers at most, enjoying my silly jokes.” Dicks hit the headlines when Ukip MEP David Coburn, apparently unaware it was a spoof, urged his 9,000 Twitter followers to complain about the “fake” Ukip account and attempted to have it shut down – threatening to sue Dicks under European copyright laws. “It suddenly went from a couple of hundred followers to 20,000,” Dicks said. “Then dozens of other Twitter accounts sprang up mocking Ukip and we were in the newspapers, so it all blew up in his face.” Only 13 episodes of Trumpton were made, but many still remember Captain Flack’s fire brigade roll call: “Pugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble, Grubb.” Dicks’s Trumpton has a different crew: “May, May, Johnson and Gove, Macron, Merkel, Mogg” – the two May characters reflecting the prime minister’s shifting position on Brexit. Dicks, who is having what he calls a “skirmish with cancer”, says finding humour in his comic keeps him busy and cheerful. “The interest in the comic has been heartening. I’ve been working from home and publishing on the web but, like a standup comedian, I need an audience. I’m constantly amazed by the generosity of people, complete strangers, who are supporting me.” The first Brexit comic, available to order online for £4, has eight pages, but Dicks hopes to add four more pages next month. “It will come out monthly until Brexit happens, and beyond that we’ll have to see.” The comic is available at descience.shop/collections/trumpton-brexit"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/shortcuts/2018/mar/18/how-goldie-is-leading-the-tech-revolution-sweeping-british-courts","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T15:00:06Z","webTitle":"How Goldie is leading the tech revolution sweeping British courts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/shortcuts/2018/mar/18/how-goldie-is-leading-the-tech-revolution-sweeping-british-courts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/shortcuts/2018/mar/18/how-goldie-is-leading-the-tech-revolution-sweeping-british-courts","fields":{"headline":"How Goldie is leading the tech revolution sweeping British courts","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Drum’n’bass icon and grills pioneer Goldie has shot back to the top of the news agenda after making legal history last week. Asked to plead over a fight he’d had at Glastonbury in 2017, Goldie, real name Clifford Price, was absent. His defence explained that he regularly flitted off to Thailand for the winter, so he wouldn’t be back in the UK till May. But when district judge Lynne Matthews ordered the trial proceed without him, he was rustled up on FaceTime. Matthews asked if he was pleading guilty. He said: “Correct, my dear,” to which the judge replied: “No, I am not your dear.” As far as it is known, this is the first time FaceTime has been used in a British court. But behind this charming tale of technology securing justice in the alleged kicking of a bouncer, a far broader e-revolution has been gathering pace in British courtrooms. Paperless trial In the summer of 2013, HM Courts and Tribunals Service spent several weeks piloting paperless hearings at a mock-trial in Croydon crown court, testing the feasibility of evidence arranged in “eBundles”. The Jarndyce and Jarndyce stacks of ring binders that still drown our courtrooms amount to 160m pages a year, which is why the Ministry of Justice has begun investing in the Digital Case System, although a full rollout remains a way off. Ebay justice Last year, the justice secretary, Liz Truss, unveiled a Prisons and Courts bill that would enable a British version of a system used abroad, often dubbed “eBay justice”. Competing parties would log on to a website, where algorithms and a modest AI would work out the flow chart of their dilemma, just as in eBay’s dispute resolution centre. If they were unhappy with the outcome, either could still have it tried in court. But the system appears to have worked well in the Netherlands – where it is used for divorces, landlord claims and employment tribunals. Video testimony During Damian Green’s time as justice minister, an austerity-conscious government pledged to “make video evidence the norm not the exception”. Video Enabled Justice was rolled out in south-east England towards the end of 2017, directly linking police stations with the courts, so that officers no longer have to give evidence in person. Live judging (sometimes) The ban on the use of cameras in court – a prohibition that has stood for 90 years – is showing its first signs of cracking. The court of appeal, the nation’s second-highest court, has admitted discreet and limited broadcast cameras since 2013. And, in 2016, cameras were allowed into crown courts – but only to film judges’ verdicts, and then only for private use. Fair enough – frankly, most sentencing remarks are straight-to-video anyway."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/16/turkey-claims-to-have-encircled-afrin-besieging-up-to-200000","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T18:05:12Z","webTitle":"Turkey claims to have encircled Afrin, besieging up to 200,000","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/16/turkey-claims-to-have-encircled-afrin-besieging-up-to-200000","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/16/turkey-claims-to-have-encircled-afrin-besieging-up-to-200000","fields":{"headline":"Turkey claims to have encircled Afrin, besieging up to 200,000","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Turkey claims to have encircled Afrin in northern Syria, besieging up to 200,000 civilians, many of whom were attempting to flee what they fear will be an imminent blockade and bombardment of the majority Kurdish city. Queues of anxious families stretching for several hundred metres streamed towards the last remaining exit in the city’s south on Friday, as the Turkish military and members of an Arab proxy force, which it mobilised seven weeks ago, consolidated positions they had gradually taken since Monday. The advances marked a significant moment in more than two months of clashes between Kurdish groups and Turkish-led forces and raised fresh questions about Ankara’s plans for the ethnically mixed area, which has rapidly become a focal point of Syria’s civil war and an exemplar of tensions between Arabs, Turks and Kurds more generally. Turkey’s gains also continue to showcase friction between Ankara and Washington, which has used Kurdish groups as proxies to fight Islamic State in north-east Syria must to the chagrin of Turkish leaders. The US has not intervened since the campaign began on 20 January, claiming it was committed to the defence of its allies only in areas in which it had a presence. Many of those fleeing on Friday were Kurdish families who feared they would not be allowed to return and that Arab families would be moved into their neighbourhoods in a campaign orchestrated by Ankara to permanently drive Kurdish militant groups from Turkey’s south-west border. At the outset of the military operation, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said: “Turkey’s aim is to give Afrin back to its rightful owners” – a statement that has since been used by Kurdish groups to claim he intends to engineer a demographic shift. However, Turkish military jets dropped fliers over Afrin on Friday that claimed the incursion was aimed only at forcing militants allied to the YPG militia to flee the area. “We are here for your peace and security; trust in Turkey’s justice. Please don’t believe terrorists’ empty promises. YPG/PKK terrorist leaders are fleeing Afrin and living good lives elsewhere. Please stay away from the bloody terror organisation. Take our hands, please surrender. A good future with peace awaits you in Afrin,” said one flyer also referring to Kurdish Worker’s party, or PKK, which is listed as terrorist group by Nato, the US and the EU among others. Among members of the YPG and an affiliated group, the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), there appeared to be no takers. “The Turks are taking over a land that isn’t theirs,” said a SDF spokesman. “They are attempting a demographic change – they are trying to blackmail the EU with the refugee problem.” He said Afrin had been a refuge to those fleeing from elsewhere in Syria throughout the war. “There are Arabs, Yazidis, Alawites and Christians. People must be careful about not making this seem like an Arab v Kurdish conflict. Most people are fleeing towards regime-held territories like Aleppo.” The United Nations said on Friday the influx of exiles into regime-controlled areas was overwhelming the already stretched capacity of local communities. “Thousands of people are running, basically running, going up mountainous slopes away from the Turkish incursion,” said the UN’s humanitarian coordinator, Ali al-Zaatari. “People are living in forests and going to different villages. They are leaving with their minimal stuff that they can take out, so we have a crisis breeding a crisis, and all people need help, both those hosting the IDPs [internally displaced people] and the IDPs themselves.” Families fleeing, and residents who have remained in Afrin, claimed that militants were attempting to slow the flow of people leaving. “Kurds and Arabs are trying to leave Afrin but it’s been difficult,” said Khaled al-Harbi, an Arab student. “The Kurdish militias are not allowing them to leave. The regime has facilitated ways for fleeing but everybody I have been speaking to wish they never left with them. They’ve been mistreated by the regime militias. The Kurds naturally hate the Turks, even before the Afrin operation. They cannot live with them, or tolerate them.” Hareth Rabbah, 24, from Afrin, said: “The Arabs aren’t happy to see the Kurds go, on the contrary, we know that not all Kurds are affiliated with militias. Just as they understood not all Arabs are affiliated with armed jihadist groups like Isis. “The regime has been opening corridors for people to flee but Kurdish militias have been disrupting the evacuation and using the civilians as human shields.” Rabbah, who said he supported the Turkish incursion, added: “Afrin is an Arab Syrian land and always will be.” Turkish officials said this week that Afrin would not be returned to the control of the Assad government, suggesting it intended to use the area as a new cornerstone of its influence in northern Syria. Ankara last year established a zone of control further to the east of Afrin in the towns of Jarabulus, Manbij and al-Bab, which are loosely demarcated by the Euphrates river. The 60-mile (95km) gap between Afrin and Jarabulus is the only part of the 511-mile border in which Kurdish populations do not have a presence. Turkey has remained adamant through the Syrian war, in its eighth year, that Kurds would not use the chaos to close the gap. Syrian Kurdish militants are closely linked to the PKK, which has fought a four-decade insurgency against the Turkish state. Some senior members of the ruling party in Ankara have repeatedly urged Erdoğan to try to seize Afrin and move Kurds in north-west Syria further away from the border and diminish what they see as a PKK consolidation amid the ruins of the conflict.

Vil Mirzayanov, 83, said the chemical was too dangerous for anyone but a “high-level senior scientist” to handle and that even he – who worked for 30 years inside the secret military installation where novichok was developed and gained extensive personal experience in handling the agent – would not know how to weaponize it. He said he did not see how a criminal organization or other non-state group could pull off such an attack. “It’s very, very tough stuff,” Mirzayanov told the Guardian at his home in New Jersey, where he has lived in exile since 1996. “I don’t believe it. “You need a very high-qualified professional scientist,” he continued. “Because it is dangerous stuff. Extremely dangerous. You can kill yourself. First of all you have to have a very good shield, a very particular container. And after that to weaponize it – weaponize it is impossible without high technical equipment. It’s impossible to imagine.” The British government has announced sanctions against Moscow over the poisoning of Skripal, and the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said on Friday it was “overwhelmingly likely” that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, personally took the decision to use the nerve agent against the ex-spy. But the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said on Wednesday that the chemical agent identified in the Salisbury attack could have been used by someone else other than the Russian state, and a Corbyn spokesperson suggested a “mafia-like group” or “oligarchic interests in London” might have been responsible. Mirzayanov said those theories did not make sense owing to the facilities and multiple layers of expertise that would be required to prepare such an attack. Chemists synthesizing the agent would have to be working somewhere with an antidote close at hand, he said, and they would have to be working with someone who knew how to weaponize it, which, he emphasized, he himself did not. “We had no idea how to weaponize it,” he said. “We don’t know because it’s not our business.” Weaponization would also need to take place at a different facility from the one where the agent was made, he said. Mirzayanov said the perpetrator of the attack must have been the Russian state. “No one country has these capabilities like Russia, because Russia invented, tested and weaponized novichok,” he said. The theory that the agent was stolen for use in a crime was weak for similar reasons, Mirzayanov said. “If you steal it, and after that, what to do with that?” he said. “You cannot weaponize, no exceptions, you cannot weaponize that.” Mirzayanov further said that there was probably no current stockpile of novichok to steal, because it has a limited shelf life and the preferred form would be a binary version in which two relatively benign, non-banned substances were mixed to produce novichok. “The final product, in storage, after one year is already losing 2%, 3%. The next year more, and the next year more. In 10-15 years, it’s no longer effective.” Mirzayanov worked inside the secret military installation where novichok was developed; his job was testing the surrounding air and soil for traces of novichok. When he realized that Moscow’s military was lying about the possible applications of novichok and that the program risked undermining global chemical weapons bans, he said, he decided to expose it, publishing his first account in the Russian press in 1991. He was arrested in 1994 and charged with divulging state secrets. Intervention by the US government, the Soros foundation and activists including his wife Gale, an American, secured his asylum in the United States. Mirzayanov thinks the Salisbury attack was performed with a binary version of the agent brought through customs and automatically mixed at the time of the attack. “I believe they brought binary version,” Mirzayanov said. “It’s two ampules, small containers, like a big bullet, put them together in a spray or something, and after that, some mechanism which is mixing them, a couple seconds and after that you’re shooting.” Mirzayanov said the danger for people in the area of the attack before or afterward would depend on the dosage used. “It’s extremely poisonous, about 10 times more potent than VX gas,” he said. “It could touch any skin and in a couple minutes would take effect.” The first sign of exposure is a shrinkage of pupils and darkening of vision, he said. “After that vomiting, [difficulty] breathing and convulsions.” An antidote can delay or partially reverse the effects of the poison but would not necessarily save the life of the victim, he said. Mirzayanov said he did not feel fear for himself or his family in speaking about novichok and Russia. “It may be a little bit crazy, but when I decide something, I’m going exactly to do it, without any distraction, to some goal,” he said. “I’m a very determined person. Because of that, if I’ve decided, all of it is gone, any fear – I don’t feel any fear.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/16/england-six-nations-ireland-dylan-hartley-spoil","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T22:00:16Z","webTitle":"England must finish on a high to spoil Irish finale, says Dylan Hartley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/16/england-six-nations-ireland-dylan-hartley-spoil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/16/england-six-nations-ireland-dylan-hartley-spoil","fields":{"headline":"England must finish on a high to spoil Irish finale, says Dylan Hartley","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Dylan Hartley has admitted stopping Ireland clinching the grand slam is acting as part of his side’s motivation on Saturday but the returning captain has claimed he is more concerned with proving England still belong at the top table. Back-to-back defeats by Scotland and France have led to England relinquishing their Six Nations title and slipping to No 3 in the world rankings, and a loss to Ireland would mean three defeats in a rowin the competition for the first time since 2006. It would also be a first defeat at Twickenham under Eddie Jones and could mean England finish the tournament in fifth place. Victory, however, would move England back up to No 2 in the world behind New Zealand. “I’m motivated by finishing the tournament on a high after two disappointments,” Hartley said. “I’m motivated by showing the rugby world that we’re still a good team. We do that by beating the current Six Nations champions.” England’s 18-match winning run was brought to a halt by Ireland 12 months ago, Joe Schmidt’s side denying Hartley and co a second successive grand slam in the process. That was a first defeat for Hartley as the England captain and while revenge has not come into the hooker’s thinking, he admits there is a desire to stop Ireland clinching what would be only their third clean sweep. “We want to finish the tournament strongly, we don’t want Ireland to win a grand slam,” Hartley added. “It would be a reward for this team to finish the tournament on a high because there’s not a game the following week to come in and train [for] and improve and review, and to then go out and try and execute. This is our last game for a while together so we want to finish on a high.” Hartley returns to the side after missing the 22-16 defeat by France because of a calf injury. That allowed Jamie George a first Six Nations start but once Hartley had proved his fitness, Jones wasted no time in calling on the captain in his most radical team selection to date. Hartley’s captaincy has been questioned of late, particularly because he is habitually withdrawn around the hour mark, but he insisted he has no doubts over his international future. “I didn’t think like that. I just controlled what I could and looked after myself and here I am,” he said. “I have got to come in and execute my role. I have got to make sure that 85-90% of my game is all about me and then the other 10% is the captaincy. If I focus on myself in delivering first and foremost then that’s the best form of leadership.” Jones has made 10 changes in total – three positional – including at least one in each row of the scrum. Kyle Sinckler makes his first England start, George Kruis has replaced Joe Launchbury, and James Haskell and Sam Simmonds come in for the injured Nathan Hughes and Courtney Lawes. “I’d say they are angry and I’d say they’re competitive as well,” said England’s scrum coach, Neal Hatley. “Our training is competitive every day because people are scrapping for places. There’s obviously a certain bit of anger over what’s happened across the last two weeks, which is what you’d expect.” Hatley acknowledged Mako Vunipola takes on a greater ball-carrying responsibility in the absence of Hughes and Lawes but does not believe he is showing signs of fatigue in a gruelling season that has followed the British &amp; Irish Lions tour of New Zealand. “We ask Mako to carry the ball a lot,” said Hatley. “I think we were talking about it with Eddie the other day – he finishes games making 15, 16 carries, 18 tackles and however many scrums, lineouts, clean-outs. A lot is asked in international rugby of our props, particularly a ball-carrying prop like Mako. It’s an intense game and the way that Mako likes to play is high-speed. I think he’s coped unbelievably well with the workload.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/24/wren-hunt-mary-watson-magic-review-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-24T09:30:19Z","webTitle":"The Wren Hunt by Mary Watson review – a magical YA debut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/24/wren-hunt-mary-watson-magic-review-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/24/wren-hunt-mary-watson-magic-review-ireland","fields":{"headline":"The Wren Hunt by Mary Watson review – a magical YA debut","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Wren Hunt occupies an eerie, in-between place, where fantasy and reality meet in a contemporary Ireland infused with ancient magic. Two rival magical factions, the judges and the augurs, are locked in a fierce battle for nemeta – magic – and so for survival. For the past few years, the judges have been winning and coming close to destroying their sworn enemies for good, but Wren Silke, an augur with a powerful and dangerous gift, is determined to change that. Intent on saving her family, Wren undertakes a secret assignment that leads her into the heart of their enemies’ world. Cassa Harkness is a powerful judge who has spent her life researching a transformative spell that will seal the fate of the factions. Wren infiltrates her house as an intern, and must navigate its treacherous corridors, as well as her own desires for knowledge, and for a handsome judge guard. Variously described as folklore, fantasy and mystery, The Wren Hunt wears its labels lightly, shedding one genre for another with a sort of slippery grace that initially confuses. But the story takes flight once Wren is ensconced in the judges’ territory, and the book settles into a deft equilibrium between thriller and myth. Watson’s writing has the sort of poise rarely found in a debut, moving the plot at a steady pace, shot through with moments of true beauty. Wren is a flawed and likable protagonist. Her talent is unusual even among the augurs, and serves to incapacitate as well as to illuminate her. Her motivations are complicated, and while she is level-headed for the most part, her anxieties will be recognisable to any teen who has felt as if they might be getting everything wrong – though, hopefully, not with quite so much at stake. The progress of a love interest is believable and well paced, if a little secondary to the story. The Wren Hunt is engaging contemporary storytelling that rings with ancient resonances. While fans of Maggie Stiefvater, Peadar Ó Guilín and Melinda Salisbury will find plenty to savour here, the book is its own thing entirely. • Kiran Millwood Hargrave’s The Girl of Ink &amp; Stars is published by Chicken House.

Similar promises of digital alchemy – heavy cash investment transforming into an ever-burgeoning bottom line – followed the stock-market launch of Snap last year. So far, investors in the owner of Snapchat have been underwhelmed, but last week 35-year-old Daniel Ek, Spotify’s co-founder and chief executive, was adamant that his music streaming service would deliver the kind of returns that have proved elusive for tech upstarts since the blockbuster float of Facebook. The test for Stockholm-based Spotify will come when it floats in New York on 3 April, while Dropbox, the online file storage company, is preparing to launch its initial public offering this week. Those companies must answer two simple questions: will Spotify ever go into the black and justify the near-$20bn (£14.4bn) valuation that private trades in its shares put on it; and is Dropbox really worth between $7bn and $8bn? With both companies preparing to join US stock markets, they could determine whether investors regain their enthusiasm for new technology stocks after a disappointing year in 2017, during which Snap, meal-kit company Blue Apron and big-data business Cloudera all went for public listings – and disappointed. Shares in Snap are down a quarter since it floated – a poor performance for investors hoping it would emulate Facebook, which has risen nearly 400% since it floated in 2012. (Twitter, meanwhile, finally recorded its first quarterly profit last month, five years after going public.) One analyst thinks the latest flotations will restore faith. “Spotify and Dropbox have a very good chance of success because the technology world is about one company dominating one sector,” says Mark Mulligan, a tech analyst at Midia Research. “Spotify and Dropbox are each dominant forces in their respective sectors. Snapchat wasn’t, because of the might of Facebook and its Instagram service. Snapchat is a second-tier player: Spotify and Dropbox are top-tier players. It is a completely different ballgame.” Some big names are counting on Ek and his counterpart at Dropbox, Drew Houston. Lining up behind Dropbox and Spotify are ride-hailing service Uber – given a notional value of $50bn in 2015 – and the short-term letting agency Airbnb. The former isn’t profitable; the latter is. With markets jittery, both Spotify and Dropbox are working hard to push a story of future profits and growth. On Wednesday, Spotify used a web presentation to reassure would-be investors that it has a clear path to profit, pointing out that revenues grew 39% to €4.1bn (£3.6bn) in 2017, though financing costs from a €1bn loan helped push operating losses up 8% to €378m. “The trend towards profitability is clear when you look at operating losses as a percentage of revenue,” it said soothingly. Spotify is also taking an unusual approach to its listing – going direct, so that its shares aren’t handled by an investment bank or underwriters, but simply offered from the company on the exchange to would-be buyers. Analysing that approach last year, the business magazine Fortune said: “If an IPO is like a wedding, a direct listing is running off to elope. A faster, easier, cheaper route to the same result.” Of course, like an elopement, you might not get the big benefits: an IPO guarantees money from institutional buyers snapping up millions of shares. A direct listing could flop. Others aren’t so sure about Spotify’s potential, based on its finances and its business model. Spotify users have the option of a free service, in exchange for listening to adverts intermittently, or paying a monthly subscription fee of £9.99, $9.99 or €9.99 for no-advert streaming. It is a compelling service with 71 million paying users, but the cost in payments to artists and record companies is huge: it has forked out $9bn in royalties since it launched. According to one investor, Spotify’s gross margin – a measure of profitability once certain costs are stripped out – is not high enough and indicates that royalty rates have to come down. “A 20% gross margin business is not a good business,” says venture capitalist David B Pakman. “One of two things has to happen: they have to enter new business lines with higher gross margins, or somehow magically transform the rate structure with labels.” The latter rate is how much Spotify has to pay per track streamed. Dropbox, meanwhile, was valued at $10bn when it last raised capital in 2014, but that has been slashed to between $7bn and $8bn for its forthcoming IPO, which is intended to raise about $610m. Steve Jobs was famously dismissive of the company: in a 2009 meeting, the late Apple chief told Houston that he had “a feature, not a product”. In other words: Apple or Microsoft or Google could add Dropbox’s functionality – you drop a file in the folder on your PC, and it’s available on your phone or tablet – to their existing software for free. Houston shrugged off Jobs’s disdain to build a company that in 2017 had 500 million users and $1.11bn in revenues. Not bad for a “feature”. So why has its notional value gone down? Partly it’s the company’s revenues: in the absence of profits (it made a net loss of $112m in 2017, almost halved from $210m in 2016), a typical measure of capitalisation is a five- or six-fold revenue multiple. With the company’s filings showing revenues up 31% in 2017, the $7bn figure looks reasonable compared to rivals such as Box, which does the same file synchronisation but with a focus on commercial clients. “The pricing [for Dropbox] had to come down to lure in the investors,” says Phil Davis of the investment advice service Phil’s Stock World. Eric Schiffer, of private equity company the Patriarch Organization, calls the pricing “a slap in the face to investors of the 2014 round”. It’s therefore starting to look as though the sky-high valuations of a few years ago were mistakes born of over-optimistic expectations. In 2012, the venture capitalist Bill Gurley called Dropbox “a major disruption”, saying that Houston and his team had “taken a hard problem – file synchronisation – and made it brain-dead simple”. But now such synchronisation is a feature offered by almost everyone. Microsoft has OneDrive, Apple has iCloud, Google has Drive. Dropbox’s broader problem is also its biggest opportunity. Of its 500 million users (of which 100 million signed up in 2017), only about 11 million pay for its extra features, such as more storage, administrative tracking, and integration with Microsoft Office. With only 2% of users paying, there’s plenty of headroom for revenue growth: Spotify’s figure of 71 million paying users from a total of 159 million is an impressive 44%. Dropbox’s challenge is persuading people to flip over to paying for something they can largely get for free: Apple and Google both offer unlimited photo storage and as much free file storage as Dropbox. So, for both companies, plenty of ancillary questions remain over these valuations. Is Dropbox really a product? Or has the march of technology turned it into just another feature? And will Spotify ever make a profit when its margins seem to be determined by its suppliers – the record labels? Investors’ feelings about the answers to those questions could have a knock-on effect on many other businesses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/mar/19/hylas-nymphs-manchester-art-gallery-sonia-boyce-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T13:36:23Z","webTitle":"‘The vitriol was really unhealthy’: artist Sonia Boyce on the row over taking down Hylas and the Nymphs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/19/hylas-nymphs-manchester-art-gallery-sonia-boyce-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/19/hylas-nymphs-manchester-art-gallery-sonia-boyce-interview","fields":{"headline":"‘The vitriol was really unhealthy’: artist Sonia Boyce on the row over taking down Hylas and the Nymphs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When John William Waterhouse’s painting Hylas and the Nymphs was removed from the walls of the Manchester Art Gallery at the end of January, all hell broke loose. Social media was electric with outraged cries of “censorship”. The critic Jonathan Jones asked whether this was the thin end of the wedge: would Picasso be off the walls next? An Oxford professor of German wrote to the Guardian warning that this had happened before: Nazi curators had taken down works because they had “conflicted with their political aims and puritanical taste”. Messages poured into the museum’s website: some in support but more of them against. There were worries that the removal was an act of politically correct virtue signalling; wasn’t so far down the line from book-burning; was feminist extremism “at its worst”. There was also plain old irritation that a much-loved painting was not on view when visitors had travelled to see it. Sonia Boyce, the artist at the centre of the row, was completely taken by surprise by the ferocity of the response to the temporary removal, as was the museum. Perhaps naively, given the timing: the culture wars were raging, a fourth wave of feminism was surging, the revelations of the conduct of Harvey Weinstein and others were reverberating around north America and Europe, and there was, and is, an upsurge of anxiety about how to deal with art made under different ethical conditions from our own. Boyce’s first instinct, she tells me, was to “go and hide – and not because I felt remorseful”. There was, she says, “a level of anger and vitriol that was really unhealthy”, and “the desire to bash women in the public space was strongly felt”. She also felt that the response fell into a pattern of outrage directed at contemporary art that runs deep in British culture: she was reminded of the “Tate bricks” scandal – a furore that broke out in 1976 over Carl Andre’s minimalist sculpture, Equivalent VIII, consisting of an arrangement of fire bricks. “There is an assumption that contemporary art has got to be nonsense, got to be a fraud,” she says. The removal of Hylas and the Nymphs was described as a “publicity stunt” in some quarters, but that is a misinterpretation, she insists. Taking the picture down had been about starting a discussion, not provoking a media storm. And, as she argued in a Guardian article, it was by no means censorship. It was certainly not about removing an image deemed to be offensive. Rather, it was drawing attention to – and questioning – the ways in which museums make decisions all the time about what visitors see, in what context, with what labelling. The way Boyce explains it, the action was not so much about removing Hylas and the Nymphs, making it invisible (although, of course, it did do that, if only for a week). Rather, it was about making the hidden workings of museums and their curators baldly visible, and inviting members of the public to take a view. Which, you might observe, they did. Though not, perhaps, in the way that Boyce or the gallery had expected or intended. Boyce and I meet at her studio in east London, a converted shipping container tucked into a loop of the Thames at Trinity Buoy Wharf, a peaceful clearing among the city’s seemingly endless forest of new-build high-rises. She has just moved in; everything is in boxes. Just now, she is also rushing to finish editing her new work, Six Acts – a film intimately connected to the Hylas scandal, which will be the culminating point of her retrospective at the Manchester Art Gallery when it opens on Friday. In a way, with this studio, she has come home: born in 1962, she grew up nearby in Canning Town, and it was at school that an observant art teacher, Mrs Franklin, noticed Boyce’s almost obsessive habit of drawing – in the margins of exercise books, anywhere. The teacher encouraged Boyce, at 15, to start going to life-drawing classes. Boyce’s family was one of avid day-to-day creativity. Her mother, a nurse, was always dressmaking, and there was always music, and making of one kind or another, around her and her siblings as she grew up. But she hadn’t thought of “being an artist” as a possible career until her teachers encouraged her to try an art foundation course, where her feminism was sparked. Afterwards, she attended college in Stourbridge in the West Midlands. “It was very clear when I was at art college that I was somehow out of place; the system hadn’t anticipated me, or anyone like me,” she says. “Even though there were a lot of female students, they were thought about as though they were being trained to become the wives of artists, not artists themselves. As a black person, there wasn’t a narrative at all. Maybe to be a model.” She herself has always taught: the conversation, the to-and-fro about ideas has been necessary to her. “The art school,” she says, “is like a laboratory.” As a young artist in the 1980s she was part of the black British arts movement, and her early work was quite often about literally drawing herself into a national history from which people of colour had been excluded. When she was 25, in 1987, the Tate bought a drawing she had made a couple of years earlier called Missionary Position II. She was the first black female artist to enter the collection. In 2016, she became the first black woman to be elected a Royal Academician. It is a history of barrier-breaking that she puts down to sheer “stubbornness about keeping going”. To understand what was really going on with Hylas and the Nymphs, it is necessary to spool back in time. Boyce was last spring having meetings with curators about plans for her exhibition. One of them, Clare Gannaway, asked Boyce if she would also be willing to take part in the museum’s public events programme. The institution regularly runs what it calls “takeovers”, where an artist is invited to intervene in the permanent collection in some way. Boyce was fascinated by Manchester’s particularly rich 19th-century collections, not least an 1826 portrait by James Northcote of Ira Aldridge, the first black actor to play Othello in Britain. She began to have conversations with staff about how the work in the galleries is selected, displayed and interpreted. Lots of colleagues wanted to join in – curators, cleaners, gallery attendants, volunteers. Quite a lot of those involved were women “uneasy about the way gender was represented in the galleries”, says Boyce. “There seemed to be two roles played by women: femmes fatales, driving men to their deaths, or figures of beauty in quiet contemplation, but without being active agents.” The gallery in which Hylas and the Nymphs hangs is titled, without irony, “the Pursuit of Beauty”. Conversation kept coming back to this work, Waterhouse’s 1896 vision, inspired by a poem by Theocritus, of semi-naked girls luring Heracles’s beautiful young lover into a lily-bedecked pond. They are complicated creatures, those nymphs: sexually voracious and destructive; beautiful and powerful; objects of titillation for the implied heterosexual male viewer; presumably modelled by some rather young girl, or girls. The work hangs opposite Charles-August Mengin’s painting of a young, tragic Sappho, bare-breasted, about to hurl herself from a cliff in grief at her unrequited love for a man. (This story about her death circulated in antiquity, and gained a certain popularity in the 19th century, though the internal evidence of her poems suggests she lived into old age.) The conversations in the museum registered that both paintings featured classical characters famous for homosexuality – a homosexuality completely invisible in these works. Gallery attendants noted that young girls often took selfies with Hylas and the Nymphs as backdrop, and that middle-aged men also liked to linger over it. “There were rich conversations over a number of months,” says Boyce. “What has got lost from the subsequent discussion is that what I do involves a process.” There is another part of the way that Boyce works that provides some of the backstory to the removal of Waterhouse’s painting. Her art, over the past decade or so, has often involved bringing apparently disparate ingredients together and, without interfering or directing too much, watching them react – and then using footage of these encounters as material for a film work of her own. For example, for Exquisite Cacophony (2015), a work that will be on show in her retrospective, she asked the (white, American, southern) rapper Astronautalis and the (black British) experimental vocalist Elaine Mitchener to make an improvisatory performance together at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. The event began with Astronautalis chuntering away with a mic on a stage, performing something like a stream-of-consciousness standup routine. Mitchener began to disrupt his monologue with whoops, whistles and cackles, so that the event became a sometimes irritable confrontation between two artists from apparently completely different traditions. In the end, though, the confrontation eased. The two reached an accommodation, and even, in a gently symbolic moment, swapped shoes. The two artistic worldviews, it became clear, are not so oppositional after all. They are contaminated by each other, and they were entangled all along. Boyce did something similar in Manchester. The conversations with staff and volunteers were to culminate in an evening “takeover” event in the 19th-century galleries on 26 January. It had been decided by participants in the debates that the evening would include the unscrewing of Hylas and the Nymphs from the gallery walls, to be replaced by a blank space on which a series of questions would instead be displayed, inviting responses from the public. But that was only one element of the evening. Prompted by the questions of sexuality and gender raised by works in the galleries, and of race, and of performing and cross-dressing – the portrait of Ira Aldridge having set in motion thoughts about Shakespearean transvestism – Boyce invited a group of drag artists, and the queer actor and writer Lasana Shabazz, to perform in the galleries during the evening. Venus Vienna, standing in front of Hylas and the Nymphs, handed Polaroid selfies – some of them uncomfortably intimate – to passersby. Liquorice Black was costumed as the dark, hooded Sappho of Mengin’s painting, and scribbled away furiously, never speaking. Cheddar Gorgeous created an ingeniously scanty costume to reference another Victorian vision of naked female flesh, Charles Roddam Spencer Stanhope’s Eve Tempted (1877). The evening was one of “masquerade, dressing up, acting up, humour and anxiety”, says Boyce. It was not just about taking Hylas off the walls; it was also about making gender mischief in the galleries. She has constructed her video work Six Acts from footage filmed that evening. Not everyone will like it, she thinks. “Some people might be offended – it might be seen to have been disrupting the calm of the galleries.” At the very least, one participant at the “takeover” evening was unhappy: it was a painter called Michael Browne who, worried about implications for artistic freedom, posted on Twitter and the gallery’s website, and was quoted by the press after Hylas and the Nymphs was taken down. Boyce is clear that she is not about to start recommending that the entire history of western art – with its thousands of acres of titillatingly displayed female flesh – be removed from our museums and galleries. On the other hand, she does insist that the past is not, as she puts it, “sealed off” from the present. We have a live relationship with it, one that changes and develops, and sometimes becomes fraught. Feminist critiques of artists’ portrayal of female flesh are nothing new: in 1972, John Berger devoted a programme to just that in his watershed BBC series Ways of Seeing, and artists, curators and historians have been tackling the question of the male gaze since film critic Laura Mulvey coined the term in 1975. (This continues: in the BBC’s Civilisations, Mary Beard considers the curious history of what might have been the first female nude sculpture of antiquity, Praxiteles’ Aphrodite – over which, or so the story goes, an early fan became so obsessed that he ejaculated on it.) Nor do paintings arrive on museum walls by magic. Someone decides to put them up – and, later, to take them down or move them around, which is the job of a curator. This might happen for all kinds of reasons, including the changing of taste or, indeed, a shift in the limits of acceptability. One thinks of the fig leaves that sprung up over the genitals of classical statues in the 19th century, or the “secret cabinets” where phalluses and other formerly unacceptable objects were once placed in museums. Consensus rarely remains stable: in December, a petition was got up to try to persuade the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to remove a 1938 Balthus painting of a prepubescent girl posing in a provocative position (the museum left it up). Hylas and the Nymphs was removed through an impulse to reveal normally hidden institutional machinery to the public, and to invite them to take a stake in it. It is an open question whether removing Hylas and the Nymphs was a good idea. Many still believe it was ill-judged at best, and that its removal amounted to censorship even if it was not intended as such. Some would say, if you want to have a conversation about Hylas and the Nymphs, keep it in view, not locked in the store. Others would argue that the picture has been looked at and thought about more productively since its brief disappearance than it has for years. Like it or not, the act provoked questions about how we relate to the past, and to its art, that are not going away. The Sonia Boyce retrospective is at the Manchester Art Gallery from 23 March-22 July, free, manchesterartgallery.org • This article was amended on 19 and 23 March 2018. Sonia Boyce became the first black female Royal Academician in 2016, not 2008 as we had it. In addition, an earlier version said that with the Tate’s purchase of Missionary Position II in 1987, Boyce was the fifth woman to enter the collection. In fact by the end of 1986, Tate had 212 women artists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/23/dead-mens-trousers-by-irvine-welsh","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T09:00:29Z","webTitle":"Dead Men’s Trousers by Irvine Welsh review – the Trainspotting gang party on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/23/dead-mens-trousers-by-irvine-welsh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/23/dead-mens-trousers-by-irvine-welsh","fields":{"headline":"Dead Men’s Trousers by Irvine Welsh review – the Trainspotting gang party on","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At a newspaper I used to work for, the story was told of a foreign correspondent dictating his report down the line to the copytakers. He rolled on, through paragraph after paragraph of purplish prose about the horrors of war, until he was, eventually, interrupted by the woman at the other end of the phone. She asked in a matter-of-fact voice: “Is there much more of this stuff, dear?” Irvine Welsh is that kind of author. There is a lot of this stuff, and the quality-control lever is wobbly. He has never been a careful writer. At his best, he manages a sort of ragged glory, a life-affirming comic energy combined with a sense of horror or desperation and the ability to place his lowlife shenanigans in a wider thematic or social context. In a different gear, though, he is just a black-hearted farceur. Dead Men’s Trousers falls into the second category: a whooping last hurrah (possibly) for the Trainspotting gang after Porno, Skagboys and The Blade Artist. The central quartet of characters – Renton, Begbie, Sick Boy and Spud – are back, and there are cameos from the priapic cabbie Terry Lawson (Glue and A Decent Ride) and, off stage, from the Miami fitness trainer Lucy Brennan (The Sex Lives of Siamese Twins). The story begins in 2015 when Mark Renton, now a successful DJ manager hopping between Amsterdam and LA, bumps into Franco Begbie on a transatlantic flight. In their last encounter Begbie disappeared under the wheels of a car while en route to take bloody revenge on Mark for ripping him off at the end of Trainspotting. But Begbie – now teetotal, and a successful artist living in California with a wife and two young children – comes over all Zen. Is he a changed character? Via a series of plausibility-stretching coincidences, the pair end up back in the orbits of Sick Boy (still in the pimping-and-mental-cruelty game) and poor old wild-eyed Spud, now self-employed as a full-time “jakey”, or street beggar. One of the gang is going to end up dead, the pre-publicity tells us, spoilerishly. Which one? At least to start with, it’s anybody’s guess. There’s a lot of travel, a lot of violence, a lot of cartoony sex. (“To paraphrase James McAvoy as Charles Xavier in ,X-Men: First Class, ‘Shagging hoors will not bring you peace, my friend,’” Sick Boy declares solemnly at one point.) There’s also a lot of stuff about the DJing and contemporary art businesses, kilos of coke and gallons of booze, a consciousness-altering experiment with DMT and an ongoing plot concerning the trafficking of stolen kidneys. Spud, as courier for one of said kidneys, takes his wee dog Toto along with him and things go wrong in exactly the way you’d expect. The characters stitch one another up, take revenge, bond again in a burst of drunken sentimentality – and rinse and repeat. It’s all wildly over the top and frequently very funny. Sensitive and inclusive, mind, it’s not. Sick Boy’s warm words of understanding when his son comes out to him as gay aren’t so much because of his open-mindedness as because the boy now won’t be competing with him for “fanny”. And women are, for the most part, either whining and needy or gagging for it, or both – though you could just about attribute the misogyny to the deplorable worldviews of the various narrators. Just about. The plot, though entertaining, is even more rickety than usual. It’s bookended by a detached and oddly cursory subplot in which Begbie is being stalked by a rogue policeman who is convinced he’s a serial killer. Another subplot, in which Renton gets a dose of the clap, relies on both a thinly motivated sexual encounter and two consecutive accidents with condoms. Coincidences and reversals pile up like falling dominoes. Read it as farce. Anyway, in a world where Welsh’s underdog club Hibs can win the 2016 Scottish Cup, why should any of his inventions seem implausible? If Dead Men’s Trousers has a philosophical centre, you might say it’s Franco Begbie. Here he is talking about Sick Boy and Mark and implicitly reflecting on most of Welsh’s canon: “Him and Sick Boy thegither: it eywis annoyed the fuck oot ay ays when they went on aboot drugs … Ah mean, take the cunts or dinnae; but dinnae fuckin talk aboot them twenty-four/seven!” At another point, he offers a mixture of the Kantian and utilitarian accounts of the moral order: “You cannae go around battering the fuck oot ay cunts. It isnae very nice, and ye can git yersel intae bother.” Mind you, battering the fuck oot ay a pair of cunts is exactly what he’s been doing over the course of the previous few pages. If you go for Welsh’s stuff, as I do, you’ll go for Dead Men’s Trousers with great enthusiasm. If you don’t … well, you were warned. Dead Men’s Trousers by Irvine Welsh (Cape, £16.99).

These microbes, whose genes taken together are known as the gut microbiome, play an important role in our health, including for our immune system and our digestion, and have been linked to a host of diseases such as autoimmune conditions, obesity and mood disorders. While, perhaps unsurprisingly, antibiotics are already known to affect the biodiversity of our gut microbes, in recent years scientists have found that a number of drugs designed to act on human cells – rather than bacteria – also appear to interfere with them. For instance, scientists found that one of the ways the diabetes drug metformin works might be by encouraging the growth of certain bacteria. But the latest research goes further, to explore whether many other drugs could be affecting our inner microbes. “We wanted to see the [extent] of this effect ... and whether the effect was direct,” said Athanasios Typas, a coauthor of the research from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Germany. Published in the journal Nature, the latest study looked at the impact on human gut flora of almost 1,200 common drugs including antipsychotics, proton-pump inhibitors, hormones and anti-cancer drugs. In total, 38 bacterial species found in healthy humans were exposed to the chemicals in the lab, and for some species multiple strains were tested. The collection of microbes included C. difficile, infections with which can cause life-threatening diarrhoea. The team were surprised to find that of the 835 drugs they tested that were designed to interact with human cells rather than bacteria, almost a quarter hindered the growth of at least one bacterial species, a phenomenon found among all the different types of drugs tested. “This 25% estimate is likely to be valid even if we include more drugs in the screen,” said Kiran Patil, another author of the study, noting the wide range of drugs tested. Typas said both pathogens and good bacteria were affected by the drugs, with a larger effect for the latter. “Most non-antibiotics target one or a handful of species from the species [of bacteria] we tested. But there are 40 non-antibiotics that target 10 or more species,” said Typas. Of these, the team note, 14 of the drugs were not previously known to have an antibacterial effect. The team say the findings are not necessarily bad news, noting that similar bacterial species are affected by different antipsychotics, suggesting it could be that the drugs work, at least in part, by affecting gut microbes – a possibility the team say is backed up by the fact that it can take weeks for antipsychotics to start working. The researchers add that previous studies probing the gut microbes of patients taking some of the drugs explored largely reflected the effects they found. They also say their findings chimed with side effects linked to a number of the drugs tested. “We can actually separate non-antibiotics that [affect] gut microbiomes in our screen from those that don’t, based on their side effects in humans,” said Typas, noting the former had more antibiotic-like side effects, such as gastrointestinal problems. In addition, the team found a link between bacterial species resistant to antibiotics and those that were not affected by the drugs tested, revealing that the same mechanism might be behind both and raising the possibility that non-antibiotic drugs could help drive antibiotic resistance. “Antibiotic resistance emergence is a quite a big health risk at the moment worldwide and I think aspects that could contribute to this emergence should be looked at very seriously,” said Patil. However, the study had a number of limitations, including that the bacterial species were considered separately, and that generally only one strain was probed per species. In addition, while the team say the concentration of drugs used in the experiments was generally in line with what is expected in the gut, some drugs might be present in the gut in higher or lower concentrations. The team say the research could help in the development of new drugs to tackle C. difficile or for changing the composition of the community of gut microbes, and could even help drug companies to anticipate possible side effects. Prof John Cryan, a neuropharmacologist and microbiome expert from University College Cork, said the paper highlighted the extent to which medications can affect the microbiome and, as a result, potentially work on the human body indirectly. “We have shown that this is the case for antipsychotic drugs some years ago but this is a major step-up, confirming that almost one-quarter of drugs investigated impact the microbiome,” he said, adding that work is now needed to unpick how effects on the microbiome might be linked to the efficacy and side effects of drugs. “Moving forward,” he said, “we cannot ignore the microbiome when we talk about drug action in the body.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/19/women-arent-finished-at-40-how-i-got-life-is-challenging-stereotypes-about-ageing","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T17:33:32Z","webTitle":"‘Women aren’t finished at 40’: how I Got Life! is challenging stereotypes about ageing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/19/women-arent-finished-at-40-how-i-got-life-is-challenging-stereotypes-about-ageing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/19/women-arent-finished-at-40-how-i-got-life-is-challenging-stereotypes-about-ageing","fields":{"headline":"‘Women aren’t finished at 40’: how I Got Life! is challenging stereotypes about ageing","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If men went through the menopause, there would be countless important movies by male directors on the subject of “the change”. Picture Woody Allen casting Colin Firth as an author struggling with night sweats and hormonal mood swings, a gorgeous 21-year-old waitress mopping his clammy brow. In reality, cinema is almost entirely menopause-free. When the French director Blandine Lenoir started shooting her life-affirming comedy-drama I Got Life!, a female producer asked if it was possible edit out the M-word. “It’s funny, because my producer is a young woman, a feminist. But she wanted me to tread carefully, to be discreet.” Lenoir pulls a face as if to say: this is the crap I have to deal with. “Menopause is a big taboo in France,” she adds. “It’s hard for women because we think we are old at 40. That’s the message from every movie, that you’re finished at 40. But you’re not finished at 40.” You can see her point. In the youth-obsessed film industry, the life expectancy of female characters is lower than in the Middle Ages. The women over 45 we do see tend to be “gorgons and dragons”, as Meryl Streep once put it. Which is what makes I Got Life! such a hallelujah moment. Here, finally, is a film that portrays a recognisable woman in her 50s – Aurore, a divorced waitress living in a small French town. She is funny, has brilliant friends and is mostly happy with her life and body. But she increasingly feels invisible – especially after her idiot sexist boss hides her away behind the bar pouring drinks. “I wanted to do an everyday heroine, just like a woman you know in your day-to-day life, like the women I know,” says Lenoir. Sitting next to her on a sofa at the offices of the Ciné Lumière in Kensington is the actor who plays Aurore, Agnès Jaoui – herself a respected director, who roars with laughter at the idea of being “discreet” about the menopause. The pair look every inch the stereotype of French women, dressed head-to-toe in black – chic rather than failsafe boring. Before the interview starts, they peer out on to the balcony, considering whether to ignore the “no smoking” sign. Like a lot of female actors, Joaoui is in no mood to downplay her anger at misogyny in the industry. Last year, she sat alongside Jessica Chastain on the jury that called out the “disturbing” portrayal of women in films showing at the Cannes film festival. “There were no women of more than 50, more than 40, more than 30 in the films,” she says. Lenoir started writing the script for I Got Life! when she turned 40, collecting stories from female friends who shared their experiences of age discrimination at work, the menopause and relationship breakdowns. “I was scared of getting older,” she confesses. “I’m still scared, but making the film helped. Getting old is terrible in some ways. But you just have to get on with it.” One of the best things about I Got Life! is that men find Aurore hot. Why don’t we see 50-year-old women presented as attractive in more films? Jaoui shrugs: “As soon as a woman stops being fertile, she stops being sexy in films,” she says. “In France there has been research. Women completely disappear from the screens at 45 and they reappear to play grandmothers. You are not a mother any more and not a woman any more. Of course there are some actors, like [Isabelle] Huppert and [Catherine] Deneuve, but they are really a minority.” When it comes to older women on screen, the industry tends to pass the buck, saying that audiences simply are not interested – to which Jaoui lets out a glorious Gallic “pah”. “That is stupid. It’s a complete lie,” she says. “Women go to the cinema, we buy tickets. What is true is that the people who make the decisions are mainly men.” To prove her point, she explains the “ah-ha” recognition factor she has noticed among female audiences in France. “At the Q&amp;As, a woman will stand up and say: ‘Hello, I’m 64 and I loved the movie.’ Then a woman will stand up and say: ‘I am 57, and I loved the movie.’ It’s like Alcoholics Anonymous. But Menopause Anonymous.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/20/wellcome-book-prize-shortlist-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T00:01:25Z","webTitle":"Female-dominated Wellcome book prize shortlist spans Victorian surgery and modern Nigeria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/20/wellcome-book-prize-shortlist-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/20/wellcome-book-prize-shortlist-2018","fields":{"headline":"Female-dominated Wellcome book prize shortlist spans Victorian surgery and modern Nigeria","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A reflection on death from a palliative care consultant sits alongside a Nigerian novel tackling the heartbreak of infertility on the female-dominated Wellcome book prize shortlist. Chair of judges Edmund de Waal praised the six contenders for the £30,000 award for adding to public discussion about what it means to be human. The panel of judges, he said, were looking for “books that start debates or deepen them, that move us profoundly, surprise and delight and perplex us, that bring the worlds of medicine and health into urgent public conversation”. In Kathryn Mannix’s shortlisted With the End in Mind, the consultant combines patients’ stories about the ends of their lives with her own argument for approaching death. In Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀’s Stay With Me, the only novel on the shortlist, the protagonist Yejide struggles with infertility and then sickle cell disease, a blood condition of which Nigeria has the highest rate in the world. De Waal pointed to an “extraordinary” shift over the last five years in public engagement with books about medicine and medical issues. “The public appetite for books which have a grounding in science, or have some kind of conversation with mortality or vitality, seems to be just beginning. There’s an extraordinary velocity about how this kind of publishing is working. And it’s building,” he said. “It’s encouraged publishers to take risks on writers who they wouldn’t necessarily have previously thought would have the capacity to be mainstream. On our shortlist, there are a lot of new writers who are writing books that wouldn’t necessarily have reached this kind of public before.” Mannix and Adébáyọ̀ are two of four debut authors on the shortlist. First-time writer Lindsey Fitzharris was picked for The Butchering Art, her history of the Victorian surgeon Joseph Lister, while Mark O’Connell, the only male writer in the lineup, was chosen for To Be a Machine, an exploration of the transhumanism movement and the use of technology to extend life. Also on the list are Sigrid Rausing’s memoir Mayhem, about the impact of drug addiction on her family, and Meredith Wadman’s history of the rubella vaccine breakthrough, The Vaccine Race. De Waal said: “You never want things of such importance to be owned entirely by experts. Books to do with genetics, with end of life, with addiction, with infertility – all these are things which all of us at some point deal with, so to bring them, with vigour and insight and passion, into conversation with us through literature, is extraordinary. Not only do we become informed, but we become passionate about it. We take things on. And if we take things on with that kind of knowledge and vigour, then that can only be good for public understanding of science, which is the mission of this incredible prize.” Previous winners include Marion Coutts for The Iceberg, her memoir of her husband’s death; Andrea Gillies for Keeper, an exploration of Alzheimer’s; and Alice La Plante’s novel, Turn of Mind. This year’s winner will be revealed on 30 April.

Historically we’ve always been active, from our hunter gatherer past to manual labour in the industrial age - until cars, computers and labour-saving devices took much of the physicality out of work. Now, according to analysis of national health statistics by the British Heart Foundation, 39% of adults in the UK fail to achieve recommended levels of physical activity or exercise. But recent research shows how crucial activity is to our health. To spread the word about the health benefits of exercise, a new master’s course is due to start this year at Loughborough University – to complement an existing range of sports and exercise medicine master’s degrees around the country. “We’re targeting the full allied health professional range,” says Dr Dale Esliger, programme leader of the MSc in exercise as medicine, which launches this October. Based in the National Centre for Sport and Exercise Medicine – an Olympic legacy facility – this course differs slightly from current sports medicine master’s. Students won’t be attending elite athletes beside the pitch, but rather looking at “prescribing” exercise to the wider population, investigating the value of techniques such as mindfulness, and researching how to deploy digital tools to motivate people to exercise more. As a nation, we’re behind the likes of Australia in formalising exercise advice within the health service, says Esliger. “In the future we hope to see more exercise professionals within the NHS,” he says. “If we want clinicians to write exercise rather than drug prescriptions, we need to give them the knowledge to do that.” Elsewhere, the University of Nottingham’s sports and exercise medicine MSc does involve working with elite athletes – rugby players from Leicester Tigers or dancers from the Birmingham Royal Ballet among others. A large chunk of the course is given over to understanding the relationship between physical activity and health, says course director Dr Kim Edwards. An ultra marathon runner herself, she’s well aware of the dangers of a sedentary lifestyle. “I try to use the stairs, I make myself walk around the building. I come from a public health background and that element of the course – how exercise can prevent disease – is very important, though it can feel the poor relation to the glamour of treating soccer players by the pitch.” Nottingham’s course is divided into two streams: one targets clinicians – GPs, physiotherapists and medics – while the other applied master’s is suitable for students with a broader background, such as sports scientists and non-clinicians who might want to gain experience with patients. “We’ve had sports experts, human biology graduates, even people from business backgrounds who want to make the career move.” Some will go on to train as physiotherapists, says Edwards, while students on the non-applied course may go on to further research or specialist roles in the health service. With 50 students across both courses, Nottingham has seen applications rise for the past six years. “There’s room in the NHS for new roles, such as exercise instructors, that don’t currently exist,” says Edwards. Other acclaimed sports medicine master’s courses are offered by the University of Bath and at University College London, where postgraduate Kosta Ikonomou is relishing the opportunity to work with rugby players – he’s a concussion expert and a physiotherapist, and he’s volunteered to assist at this year’s London marathon. His fellow students include GPs, medics, fellow physios and even an osteopath. “The programme is very research-based and very strong on the benefits of exercise – it’s the best medicine. All athletes train to prevent injury and improve performance. But we’re not just looking at the elite. We’re also looking how to prevent injuries in the general public and help ageing and adolescent populations.” Doctor’s orders: why we should exercise Easing chronic pain Virtually everyone benefits from becoming more physically active, research shows. But 39% of adults in the UK fail to get enough exercise. In the past, people with chronic pain were advised to rest. Now, a number of recent studies have indicated that exercise can ease chronic pain and improve physical function in individuals, leading to a corresponding improvement in quality of life in some cases. While more research needs to be conducted, the signs that exercise and physical activity could help in the management of chronic pain appear to be positive. Fighting cardiovascular disease A sedentary lifestyle more than doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease. Regular physical activity can cut the risk of many long-term illnesses and conditions, including coronary heart disease, strokes, type two diabetes, cancer, obesity and mental health problems. Regular participation in sport can save between £1,750 and £6,900 in healthcare costs per person, according to Sport England. Mental health benefits Being active enables personal wellbeing and encourages positive thoughts and feelings about the future, according to a survey of more than 5,000 students by Scottish Student Sport (sponsored by Precor). Almost three quarters (73%) of active students said thoughts about their future had changed for the better since taking part in sport and physical activity. Overall, 47% of students thought taking part in sport would increase their employability “quite a lot”. Engagement in intensive sport at school can increase pupils’ attendance and attainment, according to one study. In one school participating in a coaching and mentoring programme offered by charity Greenhouse Sports, students outperformed their peers by up to a third of a grade in English and 40% of a grade in maths. The 150 minutes-a-week rule To stay healthy, the NHS says adults (16-94) should try to be active daily and have at least 150 minutes every week of moderate aerobic activity such as cycling, brisk walking or even household chores – or 75 minutes of vigorous activity – and strength exercises two or more days a week. Double that, says the World Health Organisation, if you want further benefits."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/19/electoral-commission-conservatives-spent-lost-majority-2017-election","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T13:30:58Z","webTitle":"Tories spent £18.5m on  election that cost them majority","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/19/electoral-commission-conservatives-spent-lost-majority-2017-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/19/electoral-commission-conservatives-spent-lost-majority-2017-election","fields":{"headline":"Tories spent £18.5m on  election that cost them majority","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Conservatives spent more than £18.5m while losing their majority at last year’s general election, against £11m of spending by Labour and £6.8m by the Liberal Democrats, newly released figures have shown. The Electoral Commission data, which covers the 12 months prior to the election on 8 June, showed the increasing role of social media in campaigning, with the Conservatives spending about £2.1m on Facebook advertising alone. In contrast, Labour – whose message is seen as being shared more widely and favourably on social media – spent slightly over £500,000 on Facebook advertising. The biggest single element of the Conservative spend was £4m, which went to Crosby Textor, the market research firm run by the Tories’ regular election guru Sir Lynton Crosby, whose reputation took something of a battering after Theresa May lost her majority. The Conservatives spent more than £500,000 with the political consulting group set up by Jim Messina, Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign manager, who also worked for the party under David Cameron at the 2015 election. In addition to consultants, the Tories spent £262,799 of party funds on helicopters and private jets during campaigning, including £31,688 for a flight from Southampton to Norwich for Theresa May, her husband, Conservative party staff and journalists. The party spent almost £13,000 at one sandwich shop in Westminster. The biggest single Labour spend was £624,000 on direct mail leaflets, dwarfing the £2,290 the party spent on balloons. For the Lib Dems, the biggest one-off expense was £244,000 on Facebook advertising. Due to a Lib Dem policy of refunding staff who had to postpone holidays, the party paid out £2,795 to Disney to cancel a Caribbean cruise. Among other parties, the SNP spent £1.6m on the election, the Green party £299,000 and the Women’s Equality party (WEP) £285,000. The financial decline of Ukip was shown by the fact that it was outspent by the WEP, with a total 2017 election outlay of £273,000 – down from £2.8m in 2015. The Electoral Commission figures include total spending by political parties and non-party campaigners who spent more than £250,000 at the election, with data for those spending less than this released late last year. Taken together, there was a total spend at the 2017 election of £41.6m by a combination of 75 parties and 18 non-party campaigners. For the 2015 election, the spend was £39m by 57 parties and 23 non-party campaigners. The Electoral Commission said it had opened a series of investigations into some of the spending records provided by parties. The Conservatives, Labour and the Greens are being investigated for submitting spending returns that were missing invoices and over potentially inaccurate statements of payments. The Conservatives and Lib Dems face investigation for claims for payments or payments made after post-election deadlines, while the WEP is being investigated for submitting a spending return inconsistent with its reported donations. Bob Posner, the head of political finance at the Electoral Commission, said: “It is vital that voters are given an opportunity to see accurate and full reportable data on what parties and campaigners spent money on in order to influence them at last year’s general election. “We are investigating possible breaches of the rules. However, our ongoing discussions with the major parties indicate to us that they may wish to consider the robustness of their internal governance and level of resourcing to ensure they can deliver what the law requires.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"teacher-network/2018/mar/23/how-teachers-can-take-their-careers-to-the-next-level","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T07:30:48Z","webTitle":"Learning on the job: how to take your teaching career to the next level","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2018/mar/23/how-teachers-can-take-their-careers-to-the-next-level","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/teacher-network/2018/mar/23/how-teachers-can-take-their-careers-to-the-next-level","fields":{"headline":"Learning on the job: how to take your teaching career to the next level","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Teachers, like their students, are always learning. But how can you use this to boost your professional development? Where might you find opportunities to develop leadership skills or take on more responsibility? And how do you get the support you need? In our recent online Q&amp;A, we brought together a panel of experts to share their advice. Here’s a roundup of the discussion.Show that you want to grow My first thought is to ensure that teachers develop themselves to be the best teachers they can be, acquiring skills, knowledge and experiences before they think about moving into management and leadership. Rachel Lofthouse, professor of teacher education at the Carnegie School of Education, Leeds Beckett University One of the critical attributes I look for is a willingness to learn and an interest in the school beyond your own job. Being able to take feedback well – not being defensive but equally not being too self-effacing – is really important. Demonstrate you want to learn and make sure your behaviour shows that too. Liz Robinson, co-head of Surrey Square Primary School and chair of governors at the International Academy of Greenwich If you have your eye on a specific role or job, research it, find out what the gaps are in your experience, then be proactive about filling them. Naomi Ward, education consultant and coach and former teacher and middle leader at a south London school Get experience outside the classroom There are a number of benefits to taking on out-of-school roles, including the perspective they can give you on young people, communities and society. They also give you time to be yourself, rather than [just] a teacher, so you clear your head of some of the hassles of the job. Rachel Lofthouse It’s good to take on projects like organising a trip or running a club. It shows that you’re developing and demonstrates organisation and leadership skills. However, don’t be tempted to take on so much that you can’t comfortably keep on top of your other work. Extra-curricular involvement is important, but it’s wise to focus on the classroom in your first few years. David Weston, founder and chief executive of the Teacher Development Trust and chair of the Department for Education’s Teacher Development Expert Group Look for opportunities to develop and demonstrate your line management, leadership, budgeting and planning skills. Choose something that’s of value to the school, and obviously one that you’re passionate about. Great continuing professional development is a combination of theory and practice. This is where I think The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award can help teachers ... as they prove their management and leadership credentials. Peter Singleton, director of the south-east region for The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Learn from others There is so much to be learned from watching how other people do things and reflecting on that – the good and the bad. Intentional observation, alongside some relevant reading, can be really powerful in leadership development. Liz Robinson Align yourself with effective leaders in your school, find out what they do and then create opportunities to work alongside them. Meet and talk about leadership with a leader. Ask if you could be involved with a small-scale leadership project, to gain some experience. Ask if a leader is willing to offer some advice/guidance on implementing a new idea that you are interested in. Shaun Allison, author of Perfect Teacher-Led CPD, co-author of Making Every Lesson Count and deputy headteacher at Durrington High School There needs to be time allocated for teachers to get clear on who they are, what they want from their careers and what they need to strategically engage in for their development. Coaching is central to this. Having time to think through what you need and reminding yourself of the expertise you already have is gold. Naomi Ward Find and create supportive networks Many schools are organising regular weekly time, in-house, for teachers to meet, plan lessons, review previous lessons and look at student work together. Alongside this, teachers [can] go out to courses, bring expert consultants and experienced teachers in to work with them, and read books, blogs and research. There are some fantastic and inexpensive conferences run by teachers for teachers at weekends. Check out ResearchED, for example. David Weston Lots of people like TeachMeets, so why not do something similar in your school during inset time? It doesn’t need to take long but can provide some nice “sparks” for teachers to think about developing in their subject. This page explains how we do it at our school. Shaun Allison Don’t forget about all the other grassroots movements – WomenEd and BAMEed for example. Amjad Ali, teacher, trainer, TEDx speaker and senior leader, providing continuing professional development sessions to schools Other networks suggested by the panel included Women Leading in Education, the MTPT Project, CollectivED and the European Mentoring and Coaching Council, alongside resources such as ResearchED, the Teacher Development Trust and Lesson Study UK.

On Monday, officers launched fresh house-to-house inquiries in the neighbourhood. The 68-year-old was found dead at the property on Clarence Avenue on 12 March and a postmortem showed he had died from compression to the neck, suggesting he was strangled. Police ruled out suicide and launched a murder investigation on Friday. Detectives are focusing on what happened in the immediate area on Sunday 11 March and Monday 12 March, and are appealing for anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious at or near Glushkov’s home to come forward. “I would urge anybody who may have information to get in touch if they have not already done so,” said Commander Clarke Jarrett, the head of the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command, which is running the investigation because of the associations Glushkov is believed to have had. “We will have officers in Mr Glushkov’s local neighbourhood today, so please come and speak to us if you think you may have seen or heard anything suspicious last Sunday or Monday.” At the time of his death, Glushkov was about to defend a claim against him by the Russian airline Aeroflot at the commercial court in London, where he was accused of fraud. In 2017, during a trial in absentia in Russia, he was sentenced to eight years in prison for stealing $123m (£87m) from the airline, which then pursued the case in London. Glushkov failed to arrive at court in central London on 12 March and his body was discovered that evening. He was a friend of the oligarch Boris Berezovsky, a critic of the Russian president Vladimir Putin who had clashed in court with Roman Abramovich. Berezovsky was found hanged at his ex-wife’s home in Berkshire in 2013. Police said they believed he had killed himself but a coroner recorded an open verdict. The killing of Glushkov came a week after the attempted murders of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian intelligence officer living in Salisbury, Wiltshire, and his daughter Yulia Skripal, using the nerve agent novichok. The pair remain in a critical condition. “The investigation is progressing,” said Jarrett. “We have taken a number of statements and have over 400 exhibits which are being processed. We have found no sign of forced entry thus far, but the forensic examination at Mr Glushkov’s home continues and we expect to be there for some time. “I must stress that there is nothing we have found in our investigation so far to suggest any link to the attempted murders in Salisbury, and I would like to reassure the public in New Malden that there are no wider public health concerns in relation to this investigation.” There have been no arrests so far."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2018/apr/10/doctors-knew-son-suicidal-confidentiality-life","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T08:46:45Z","webTitle":"Doctors knew my son was suicidal.

I should have been told before he died","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Three years back I joined a club no one wants to be a member of. I became a parent who lost their child to suicide. He was 20. I didn’t think it was possible. I trusted his doctors to take good care of him. I trusted they would tell me if there was a real risk of him dying, given I was his mother and prime carer. I thought they had the expertise to identify and address a crisis when they saw it. Suicide was not in the script. I turn the events around his sudden death over and over in my head, and it makes no sense. He had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder 10 weeks before he died. Initially his response to medication was good but then he plunged into a deep dark depression, which I thought was being managed by his GP. All this time, he lived at home with me. None of the medical staff mentioned the word “suicide” at any stage. When the coroner’s inquest was a couple of months away, a big brown envelope of medical and other documents arrived in the post. I was afraid to open it for fear of the poison that might spill out. After a few days of preparing myself, I sat down with the envelope on a groundsheet in the sun. One of the many white A4 sheets was a photocopy of a health questionnaire, filled out and signed by my son two weeks before his death. It was designed to evaluate his state of mind over the two preceding weeks. It showed that his depression was the worst it could be, his score was the highest it could be. My brain froze. He had been feeling severely depressed and suicidal for at least a month before he could take it no more. He wrote it down, but couldn’t talk about it. My son had been on antidepressants for two weeks at that point. We were told they would start working after three to four weeks. He was given a slip of paper advising him to go to A&amp;E or call the Samaritans in case of crisis. It was like sending someone with crushing chest pain home with paracetamol. The shock of this revelation paralysed me. I took a deep breath before collapsing into a puddle on the floor, mourning the unnecessary loss of my son who asked for help but didn’t get it; who suffered silently while waiting for someone to understand him; who died alone on a cold day feeling worthless and hopeless. He didn’t deserve this. There are hundreds of distraught and bewildered families like mine in this club whose stories have a common thread. A father told by the family doctor, “Now that your son is dead, I can tell you this was not his first attempt at ending his life.” Another parent said: “The GP knew our child wanted to end his life but they didn’t discuss that with us even though he was a minor.” Before ending his life, one young man had asked a mental health nurse to let his mother know that he was suicidal. She didn’t. The first step in reducing risk is to ask about suicidal thoughts. Responses, however minor, require a compassionate, competent and timely response from clinicians. Safety planning comes next and is a collaborative process where patient and medical professional devise strategies for what to do when the ideas of suicide take hold. Then it is a matter of establishing a network of support with friends, family and the community as an essential part of keeping people safe for now and the future. I was denied the chance to be there for my son when he needed me the most. My son’s answers to medical experts were largely ignored. I have found that suicide is a taboo subject not only in our society but also within the medical profession. The doctor declared “suicides are not predictable or preventable” at the coroner’s inquest. His other argument was professional obligation of patient confidentiality. Is confidentiality more important than helping someone at risk to stay alive? “First do no harm” is a basic principle of medical practice. The Department of Health published a statement entitled Information sharing and suicide prevention in 2014. It states that practitioners should disclose relevant confidential information to an appropriate person – including family or friends – or authority to protect a vulnerable person from risk of death or serious harm. Four years on, information is still not being shared with those best placed to help a suicidal person. Now, when there is a huge emphasis on care in the community, this is more important than ever before. The inadequacy of mental health services to cope with increased demand is worsened by a huge shortage of funds, psychiatrists and inpatient beds. A report published in 2015 said that unpaid carers save the government £132bn a year. They are a valuable resource if acknowledged as such. The world of medicine is conservative and defensive. The GMC, Royal Colleges and NHS trusts should reassure practitioners that their decision to share information appropriately will be supported by them. As a consultant anaesthetist working at a leading teaching hospital in central London, every day I am part of the extreme measures taken to save lives of patients with physical illnesses. Yet, healthy young people are allowed to die in the community from preventable causes in dire circumstances. Confidentiality versus life. It’s a no-brainer.

I figured she would eventually realise it was the last thing she wanted to do. If I had to, I was certain I could talk her out of it. I was wrong. “What time are we leaving tomorrow?” she says, the night before. “We’re meeting the van at 9.30,” I say. “9.30? That’s ridiculous,” she says. “We have to be in Morecambe by three,” I say. At 3.30 we convene with the band and the other wives in the hotel. I buy my wife a beer and install her in a seat by the window. She looks out at the seafront, and then at me. “I’ve changed my mind,” she says. “I knew you would,” I say. “Too late, though.” After the gig we reconvene at the same bar some time after midnight. “I thought the sound was excellent tonight,” one wife says. “And a very good crowd,” says another. “I want to go home,” my wife says. “You’re going to Bury,” I say. “Wheels turning, 10 o’clock.” The next day, my wife somehow manages to divert the wives’ van to Manchester to visit a museum, a detour that meets with a mixed reception on board. The only time I see her that day is during the gig, four songs after the interval, when the lead singer thanks our wives and the lighting man shines a spot on to their row. My wife is caught frozen, crouching, halfway to her seat from the bar. The next day a group lunch is cancelled because the motorway is shut in both directions, with us on it. “Animals in the road,” I say, scrolling through traffic reports. “It doesn’t say what kind.” The wives’ van goes to the hotel, while we head straight to the venue: the Sage Gateshead. I send my wife a text that says: “We have three dressing rooms, and they all have pianos in them.” I receive no reply. That evening the wives colonise one of our spare dressing rooms. None of them, I notice, is my wife. “Where is she?” I say. I’m told she’s still in the hotel. Then I’m handed a phone featuring a recent exchange from the WAGS ON TOUR WhatsApp group. “What time are you coming to the venue?” the first text says. “I’m never coming,” is my wife’s reply. But she does eventually turn up, and is much merrier by bedtime. “The wives think I’m fun,” she says. “Are you sure?” I say. “By teatime they all seem pretty pissed off with you.” “Touring is boring,” she says. “You don’t do anything.” “You don’t do anything,” I say. “We unload, set up, play, break down and reload. And we finished three crosswords in that traffic jam.” “The driver likes me,” she says. “I’m a lot of fun in the van.” By the time we get to York it is snowing hard and there is nowhere to hang about but the venue – the next motel is outside Pontefract, 40 minutes down the road. My wife continues to complain, but everyone has adopted my strategy – treating her as if she is having the time of her life, but is able to say only the opposite due to a brain injury. The drive to the hotel that night is scary; snow has settled on the motorway and visibility is poor. As is our custom on the last night, everyone assembles in my room to drain half-bottles of dressing room wine, eat vending machine food and debrief. My wife is not expecting this. “What is he doing?” my wife says, pointing at the accordion player, who is sitting on the floor eating a sandwich and drinking a beer. “It’s a tradition,” I say. “We’ll be gone by four at the latest,” the bass player says. “Oh my God,” my wife says. “Welcome to showbiz,” I say. “I’m never coming on tour again,” she says. “I think we’re all agreed on that,” I say."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/19/wanted-trainee-teachers-to-plug-the-schools-gap","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T17:58:07Z","webTitle":"Wanted: trainee teachers to plug the shortfall in schools","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/19/wanted-trainee-teachers-to-plug-the-schools-gap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/19/wanted-trainee-teachers-to-plug-the-schools-gap","fields":{"headline":"Wanted: trainee teachers to plug the shortfall in schools","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Schools are in crisis. With plummeting teacher training applications and difficulties in recruiting enough staff to fill vacancies, tuition fees, unacceptable workloads and budget cuts have all been blamed for the current shortage. “The number of trainees is falling and it raises serious questions for the government,” says teaching recruitment expert Prof John Howson of Oxford Brookes University. “Teachers may well be asking themselves why they’re doing the job for the money they get, when it costs an extra year in training and possibly an extra loan.” The Department for Education (DfE) has been trying to stem the problem by offering tax-free bursaries and scholarships of up to £28,000 for training towards a PGCE (postgraduate certificate in education) in many of the core subjects. All teachers in England and Wales must have QTS (qualified teacher status), which can be acquired while training for the one-year PGCE – long established as the classic and favoured route into teaching. While the PGCE is typically considered university based, in reality trainees spend up to 24 weeks in at least two schools. Participants then have to complete a further year’s teaching as a newly qualified teacher. “From an academic perspective, the PGCE provides students with the opportunity to think beyond day to day classroom practice and find connections between their own practice and the work of experts,” says Alison Griffiths, head of initial teacher education at Goldsmiths. “The PGCE, along with the QTS means that the student is also able to teach outside of England and Wales.” The PGCE is not restricted to universities – school-centred initial teacher training courses also lead to a PGCE. Normally completed in one year it can include lectures and tutorials, but is centred around on-the-job training provided by teachers in a participating school. Another popular route is pioneered by the education charity, Teach First. High achieving graduates are paid a wage from the outset and after initial intensive training go directly into the classroom. From last year it replaced the PGCE training with an upgraded postgraduate diploma in education) which also provided trainees with two thirds of a master’s degree. Teach First recruit Grace Wickings, now teaching in a south London school, turned her back on investment banking to pursue teaching. “I’d just set up a charity in Kenya and realised money wasn’t everything, being happy in your job meant so much more,” she says. “I’d just seen the series Tough Young Teachers and the challenge really excited me. “I wanted to teach kids in schools similar to the one I’d been to. I’m not interested in teaching in private or grammar schools.” Even with these training options running concurrently, teacher recruitment and retention remains a problem and the DfE is under intense scrutiny to explain how it intends to support, retain and develop teachers, especially in light of rising pupil numbers. It has been asked to report back to the government’s Public Accounts Committee before the summer. However, Victoria Pang, a PGCE student with Yorkshire Teaching School Alliance remains optimistic and can’t wait to get started. “I feel this route has been supportive and nurturing during the very early stages of my career change. Although it is very hard work trying to balance the needs of a PGCE with life outside of school, I am confident I made the right decision, and am very much looking forward to my teaching career.” Facts in focus ... Teacher training The PGCE course takes one academic year and is widely recognised throughout the UK and some countries abroad. Teachers still require qualified teacher status (QTS) to teach in state schools in England and Wales. The PGCE provides points towards a master’s degree for teachers wishing to attain further qualifications. Fees can be as high as £9,250, although in many cases, trainees with at least a 2:2 can apply for tax-free bursaries worth up to £26,000, or a scholarship up to £28,000 if training to teach Stem subjects. Face-to-face advice is available on the different options and eligibility from the Train to Teach roadshows, which take place nationwide."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/19/windows-10-microsoft-force-people-edge-browser-windows-mail-chrome-firefox","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T12:46:36Z","webTitle":"Windows 10: Microsoft is looking to force people to use its Edge browser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/19/windows-10-microsoft-force-people-edge-browser-windows-mail-chrome-firefox","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/19/windows-10-microsoft-force-people-edge-browser-windows-mail-chrome-firefox","fields":{"headline":"Windows 10: Microsoft is looking to force people to use its Edge browser","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Microsoft is looking to force users into using its Edge browser, by making it default for opening links from email. Having struggled to entice users to ditch market-leader Chrome, or even its older, now decommissioned Internet Explorer, Microsoft is going to try and force it on people. In the release notes for Microsoft’s latest early version of Windows 10, sent out to its so called Insiders, the Redmond-based company said: “We will begin testing a change where links clicked on within the Windows Mail app will open in Microsoft Edge, which provides the best, most secure and consistent experience on Windows 10 and across your devices.” The change will ignore the wishes of the user, opening links in Edge regardless of which app is their designated default browser. Windows Mail is the default email client that comes pre-installed on Windows 10 supporting various different email providers including Google’s Gmail. The reason for the change is because “Microsoft Edge enables you to be more productive, organised and creative without sacrificing your battery life or security”, the company says. This isn’t the first time Microsoft has tried to force users to at least try its new browser, which replaced Internet Explorer with the release of Windows 10 in July 2015. When you attempt to change the default browser to Google’s Chrome in the Settings app, Windows 10 asks users to make sure they really want to switch and whether they wouldn’t rather try Edge. But Microsoft does allow users to force the change making Chrome, or any other browser, the default choice, opening links from other apps in their choice rather than Edge. Despite Windows 10 being installed on 36% of desktop computers globally, according to data from StatCounter, Edge is only used by 4% of desktop computer users, behind Internet Explorer with 6.9%, Firefox with 11.5% and Google’s Chrome with a market-leading 67.5% share of users. It is clear Microsoft needs to do something to stimulate use of Edge, but the change is likely to be extremely unpopular with both testers and regular users, if it is not altered before becoming default for all versions of Windows 10 going forwards. Microsoft said: “As always, we look forward to feedback from our Windows Insider Program community.” Windows 10 Spring Creators Update: everything you need to know"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/19/debussy-festival-cbso-salute-a-genius-with-sweeping-celebration","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T11:24:04Z","webTitle":"Debussy festival – CBSO salute a genius with sweeping celebration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/19/debussy-festival-cbso-salute-a-genius-with-sweeping-celebration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/19/debussy-festival-cbso-salute-a-genius-with-sweeping-celebration","fields":{"headline":"Debussy festival – CBSO salute a genius with sweeping celebration","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Alongside Stravinsky, Claude Debussy probably had more influence on the course of 20th-century music than any other composer. The centenary of his death is on 25 March, and although a number of orchestras across the UK are acknowledging the occasion, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO) is marking it in the comprehensive way his genius deserves. Over two weekends, the CBSO and Birmingham Contemporary Music Group (BCMG), with students from the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire, are performing almost all of Debussy’s orchestral and chamber music. They are including a generous selection of his songs and piano pieces, and exploring some of the ways in which his influence percolated through subsequent generations. The big omission is Debussy’s only completed opera, Pelléas et Mélisande, but that will follow in June, with a performance conducted by Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla. This has clearly been a project close to Gražinytė-Tyla’s heart, and she opened the orchestral concerts with the work that first announced Debussy’s originality, Prélude à l’Après-Midi d’un Faune. It was also the piece with which she opened the CBSO programme in January 2016 that confirmed she should be the orchestra’s new music director. It was thrilling to hear again the buoyancy and vividness she brings to this music; despite the fluidity of her gestures, it presents Debussy much more as a symbolist than an impressionist. The rarely heard a cappella work Trois Chansons de Charles d’Orléans followed, sung with great panache by the Birmingham University Singers, before the CBSO Youth Chorus supplied the female voices for another rarity, the early cantata La Damoiselle Élue, in which, as Gražinytė-Tyla demonstrated, Debussy’s magical ear for texture and colour was already fully formed. The youth choir also contributed wordlessly to the Nocturnes, primary colours as much as suggestive pastels once again. Before that, the velvety mezzo Aga Mikolaj had sung three of Szymanowski’s Love Songs of Hafiz, in which Debussy’s textural imagination is fused with elements of Schoenbergian expressionism. In a short concert the following day, Gražinytė-Tyla included the chamber-ensemble arrangement of the Prélude – a second chance to savour principal flute Marie-Christine Zupancic’s supple solo playing – and another orchestral principal, Oliver Janes, was the soloist in the Première Rhapsodie for clarinet and orchestra. But the main works were a spiky performance of Symphonies of Wind Instruments (Stravinsky’s memorial to Debussy) and the bewitching Jeux (Debussy’s final orchestral masterpiece), conducted by Michael Seal, which remained a little earthbound until its final moments. BCMG’s responsibility in the festival is the exploration of Debussy’s legacy. Its contribution to the first weekend was a programme conducted by Julien Leroy featuring music by Pierre Boulez and Tristan Murail. Boulez repaid his debt in his superlative performances as a conductor, setting new standards for the interpretation of Debussy’s music, but the colours and textures of his own music also reveal that heritage, even in the fits and flurries of a relatively minor piece such as Dérive I. Murail was represented by three scores from different decades, all of which showed that, as well as an acute ear for instrumental colour, he and Debussy share a fondness for titles inspired by the natural world, though only the earliest of the pieces, Couleur de Mer, seemed to go much urther than harmless evocation. • The Debussy festival continues from 23 to 25 March. Gražinytė-Tyla conducts a concert performance of Pelléas et Mélisande in Symphony Hall, Birmingham, on 23 June.

In 2011, he started his own sports technology company, Pace Insights, which helps sports professionals improve athlete and team performance through better use of data. “I’ve always wanted to start my own business. I could have done it without an MBA, but I wouldn’t have. I thought long and hard before applying – I’m quite geeky and technical. After a promotion in my previous role, I felt out of my depth managing 15 people, so I looked for a qualification that would help with management. The economic crisis of 2007-2008 gave me the final push to get it done rather than talk about it. Interestingly, I benefited in ways that were different from what I expected when I applied. I’d moved to Warwickshire to work in automotive and motorsports and lived just 20 minutes away from the business school. On day one, there were 100 people sitting in the room and just five of us were from the UK. That was fascinating. There have been two or three marriages among our year group. We were in our late 20s but we went straight back into a university mindset – working hard and having fun. I can’t say I study my files every day, but so much has stayed with me. Coming from a techy world, I didn’t have such a broad perspective on business. Organisational behaviour was an eye-opener. I read case studies about what some managers do and thought: ‘That’s stupid.’ Then I took a step back and thought: ‘Oh, that’s exactly what I did when I was a manager.’ All the entrepreneurial modules were really useful, although I’d have liked more practical support. They helped me know how to analyse a business opportunity and how to pitch Dragons’ Den-style in front of investors. I came out the other end confident I could speak the right language in a way that gets things done. Without an MBA I wouldn’t have had the confidence to set up a business and I might have forever remained a contractor, or a poor manager. It was a learning and a maturing experience.

The initiative sees children and their elderly pen pals exchange updates about their lives, helping to build relationships between generations while also giving the children an understanding of the value of writing letters by hand – an activity that’s becoming less and less common. The project was started by Springbank Care Home as a way to create links between the two. Now, the school stresses the importance of taking time to write letters with pen and paper, making good handwriting “meaningful and real for the children”. Laura Johnson, the teacher who coordinates the scheme at Jenner Park, says she’s seen her pupils develop a real sense of empathy and understanding of elderly people. “The pen pal scheme has given them a more meaningful focus, which has made writing an enjoyable and exciting task,” explains Johnson. “They love being able to write to the residents and share their news.” The process is also useful for learning to write for different purposes and audiences, she adds. A similar letter writing project is taking place at Franche Primary School in Kidderminster, in partnership with two local care homes. “There’s something about reading a handwritten letter that gives you a positive buzz, rather than something that’s printed,” says Katie Sinclair, creative curriculum leader. “There’s a slight excitement about deciphering the cursive script and knowing that person has actually sat down and written it just for you and only you – it’s very personal. That’s why our letter writing is a big part of what we do at school.” The children have also been writing letters to their heroes such as the former rugby player Jonny Wilkinson and the naturalist and TV presenter David Attenborough, asking what their motivations are for the work they do. Attenborough responded with his own handwritten letter, explaining how he has always had an interest in animals. Pupils in year 2, meanwhile, wrote a letter to the Queen last year inviting her to their summer party – an offer she politely declined. “All of our writing is for a purpose. That’s the key in getting children to value handwriting,” says Sinclair. “As soon as you put an audience there, [knowing] that someone out there is going to be reading it – whether that’s parents or another group of children – there’s always the real sense of pride to go along with it: I’m writing so it needs to be read, I’m proud of what I’ve done.” The sense of pride in writing created by hand can be instilled in children from a young age. In Hydesville Tower School in Walsall, nursery children are given a letter of the week to form in creative ways, using finger painting, sand or marker pens on paper. “There’s a genuine sense of allowing children to explore and appreciate writing letters,” says headteacher Warren Honey. The school maintains a focus on handwriting throughout the years, from dedicated handwriting classes in the prep school to a calligraphy club offered to the older groups. Honey says that illegible handwriting “has an impact in terms of ability to proof read, self-regulate and understand their own thinking and ideas”. It also makes it difficult to self-assess, he adds, if they are struggling to identify what’s been written.The school has created something called the pen licence. It allows younger children to move from using a pencil to pen once they’ve reached a certain standard. “There’s a lot of excitement about reaching that pen licence stage,” says Honey. “There’s an idea of wanting to create something that’s beautiful in its own form.” He believes having a goal to work towards helps pupils appreciate the importance of the skill. “A lot of the work that’s done will be based around good quality pen or pencil and paper work, because we need children to explore and make mistakes and start again – any emphasis on handwriting allows that to be a natural part of what’s going on in the classroom.” Sinclair adds that developing students’ writing in this way matters for their life after school: “For us, it’s important that we create citizens of the future who have a set of life skills that can make them successful.” The dominance of technology is a challenge, she admits, but she also believes both tools have their place. “Obviously we’re competing with technology continuously,” she says. “And I know there are people there saying you don’t need to bother about handwriting because tech is out there. But we don’t see it as competing. We’re trying to get pupils to realise that there’s a place for handwriting, and to know when it’s important to use each.” Follow us on Twitter via @GuardianTeach, like us on Facebook, and join the Guardian Teacher Network the latest articles direct to your inbox Looking for a teaching job?

The Financial Reporting Council said it is investigating the conduct of Richard Adam and Zafar Khan, in relation to their reporting of financial statements of the failed government contractor and other financial information for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016 and the six months to 30 June 2017. The FRC also started an investigation into KPMG’s audit of Carillion’s financial statements on 29 January. The watchdog is liaising closely with the official receiver, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Insolvency Service and the Pensions Regulator. The FRC can prevent a finance director who is a member of a professional association from practising. It can also impose significant fines on those found to have “fallen significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected” or brought discredit to the accountancy profession. The Insolvency Service is already investigating the conduct of directors employed at the point at which the outsourcing giant collapsed, but “also of any individuals who were previously directors”, following a request from the business secretary, Greg Clark. Frank Field, the chair of the parliamentary work and pensions committee, has welcomed the FRC’s decision to widen its investigation to include directors but said regulators should have acted much sooner. “What Britain desperately needs is a regulatory system that is on the front foot.” Carillion, which was involved in the HS2 rail link and the Battersea power station revamp, went into liquidation with a host of unfinished public sector contracts, pension liabilities and debts, each exceeding £1bn.

Students at Pennridge high school took part in a national school walkout on 14 March against the wishes of the school board. The board warned pupils in advance that anybody taking part in the protest would receive the standard punishment for skipping class – a Saturday morning in detention. Anna Sophie Tinneny, one of the students who helped to organise the protests and get the message out on social media, told the Guardian: “Two hundred and twenty-five students walked out of the front doors for 17 minutes of silence and a few speeches afterwards. As we walked into the school, we were put in single-file lines and had to sign up for detention before returning to class.” The students then turned the detention into another opportunity to protest. They attended the session on Saturday wearing signs bearing the names of those killed at the Parkland school shooting in Florida, and turned the detention into a sit-in. The students’ fate caught the eye of social media users and the local community rallied round. Some went to the school before the detention started, bringing doughnuts, coffee, snacks and signs in support of the protest. California-based Minette Nelson, who helps run the youth politics outreach campaign EighteenX18, arranged to have 20 pizzas brought to the school when the two-hour detention finished at 10am. People have also been using the #Pizza4Protesters hashtag to support a crowdfunding appeal to have pizza delivered to the school for the next round of detentions. The students had tried to secure permission for the protest before walking out. Tinneny said: “We were crushed when we learned that our school board felt like the walkout was inappropriate for us to take part in. Several students went to a school board meeting and tried to negotiate for a way to do the walkout, but they were very inflexible.” The school had organised its own event to commemorate the victims of the shooting to coincide with the national protests. In a statement the school’s superintendent, Dr Jacqueline A Rattigan, said: “We are proud of the way our students conducted themselves during today’s silent remembrance assembly. Approximately 800 students attended and sat in silence for 17 minutes while viewing a slideshow in honour of the victims. “It was a moving experience for those who participated. About 225 students, including a few who were accompanied by their parents, chose to walk out of school to hold their own activity. Those who did so unaccompanied by a parent will face consequences.” Because so many pupils are being punished, the detentions are scheduled to continue over the next two weekends. Another student, Sean Jenkins, interviewed by Dazed, said: “By this point, they’re a badge of honour for us; they represent how passionate we are about the issue. We’ll stand up for what is right, regardless of consequences. Seeing fellow students around the country be killed by gun violence is heartbreaking.” Their actions have not met with universal approval, however. Tinneny said: “There’s been a lot of online backlash from classmates who chose not to walk out and other community members. Some think we walked because we want to repeal the second amendment, which isn’t true. “We want to make sure that individuals who have indicated that they might be the next mass shooter do not have access to a firearm. We want to make sure that no one but military and police personnel can have a military-style assault rifle. We want to make sure that the tragedies of mass shootings are not forgotten. We want to make sure that nothing like them ever happens again.” The fundraising and public support for the protesters does not seem to have had any impact yet on the school’s decision to penalise the students. “The school has shown no signs of backing down about the detentions,” said Tinneny. “The board members seem just as determined as ever that we be punished, which is fine.

The Muslim Students Survey was launched in 2017 to try to gain a better understanding of the experiences of Muslim students in further and higher education and received 578 responses among UK-based students. One in three respondents said they had experienced some type of abuse or crime at their place of study, with 79% of those believing it was motivated by prejudice relating to their Muslim identity, the NUS said. Prejudiced statements or gestures before, during or after the incidents were cited. A third of the respondents said they were “fairly or very worried” about experiencing verbal abuse, physical attacks, vandalism, property damage or theft at their place of study, relating to their religion or belief. Female respondents who wore a religious Islamic garment – such as a hijab, niqab or jilbab – were more likely to be very worried. Hareem Ghani, the NUS women’s officer, said: “We are deeply concerned about Islamophobia and anti-Muslim sentiment within the education sector and society as a whole. Action must be taken immediately by institutions and students’ unions to safeguard Muslim students – especially women – against racism in or around campus.” Racism and prejudice in universities was highlighted earlier this month when it emerged two men were arrested after a black university student complained that a group of people had subjected racially abused her in her hall of residence. Officers began an investigation after Rufaro Chisango, a student at Nottingham Trent University, posted a video in which a group of men can be heard chanting “we hate the blacks” and “sign the Brexit papers”. The survey found that Prevent, which forms part of the government’s counter-terrorism strategy and requires educational institutions to identify and report students suspected of being vulnerable to radicalisation, significantly affected Muslim students. One-third of respondents felt negatively affected by Prevent. Some had been referred to authorities under the scheme, had organised events that were cancelled or significantly changed because of it, or had disengaged from political debate specifically due to concerns around being reported under its terms. As a result, 43% of those who reported being affected by Prevent said they felt unable to express their views or be themselves. The survey found only 38% of respondents agreed that their students’ union understood their needs as a Muslim student, while 39% rarely or never felt able to participate in their union’s sports activities. The drinking culture, a general lack of inclusiveness and mixed-sex sports were stated as barriers to sporting involvement. Ninety per cent of respondents said they had a prayer space or mosque on or near campus, while 68% had access to halal food on or near campus. Just over a quarter (28%) were clear they had a Muslim chaplain or cleric at their institution, while 24% were sure that theirs had an imam. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said universities had a duty of care to students, none of whom should feel unsafe because of their religion, ethnicity or gender. “Our universities are places of learning and debate, and should also act as a safe space for all students from fear of persecution, harm and bigotry,” she said. A Department for Education spokesperson said the Prevent programme was “not about shutting down free speech or spying on students and should not be used to discriminate against any particular group”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/22/mind-is-flat-nick-chater-review-hidden-depths","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T07:30:01Z","webTitle":"The Mind is Flat by Nick Chater review – we have no hidden depths","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/22/mind-is-flat-nick-chater-review-hidden-depths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/22/mind-is-flat-nick-chater-review-hidden-depths","fields":{"headline":"The Mind is Flat by Nick Chater review – we have no hidden depths","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"You probably think you have beliefs, desires, fears, a personality, an “inner life”, maybe even a subconscious. Poppycock, says Nick Chater, a behavioural psychologist. All that stuff is folk nonsense. The brain essentially just makes everything up as it goes along – including what we fondly think of as our direct perceptions of the world, which are a patchwork of guesses and reconstructions. There is nothing going on “underneath”; there are no depths. The book could equally have been called “The Mind Is Shallow”, though potential readers might have found that more off-puttingly rude. This is one of those books that is a superb exposition of scientific findings, from which the author proceeds to draw highly polemical and speculative inferences. There are beautiful discussions of how little we actually see around us: eye-tracking software can show us a page filled with Xs with one word positioned exactly where we are looking , and we have the experience of seeing a full page of text. We can’t even see two or more colours at once but switch between one at a time. In general, our richness of experience seems to be a construct. Feelings are not much cop, either. Emotions are probably generated when we notice changes in our bodily state (this was William James’s insight in the 19th century), rather than bubbling up from some subconscious to teach us a lesson. Memory is a highly fallible re-creation rather than a retrieval of information, and political affiliations can be influenced by cognitive biases. People commonly report, meanwhile, that a solution to some puzzle pops into their head after they have stopped working on it and taken a walk or a shower. But Chater insists that there is never any “unconscious processing” working on some problem while we do something else. In his view, the brain can attend to only one thing at a time. From all this he concludes that our feeling of having settled desires, beliefs, opinions and so forth is just a “hoax” the brain plays on us. But such language is contradictory: who exactly can be the victim of such a hoax, if there is no persistent person in there? Much of his book is quite compatible with the “no-self” views found in traditions such as Buddhism and philosophers such as David Hume, who famously looked inside his mind and found no “there” there, just “a bundle or collection of different perceptions”. But Chater’s version of this view can often seem like a mere redescription of our ordinary ideas rather than a revolution in understanding. One way to understand the idea of a “belief”, for example, is not as some unchanging structure you can point to within the brain, but as a disposition to act in certain ways. So, for example, the fact that I generally cross the road when the pedestrian light is green can be explained by my having a “belief” that cars will stop when their light is red. Chater doesn’t actually argue that we don’t have such dispositions, and it would be silly to try. Quite late on, he admits that the brain does not just invent everything on the spur of the moment but operates as a “tradition”, taking into account its own past perceptions and decisions. In this view, the mind is analogous to the accretive evolution of the common law. The “tradition” does constitute, he admits, some kind of “inner mental landscape”. But if the mind makes a decision today based on its past perceptions and decisions, it’s difficult to understand why it is simultaneously so wrong to say that the mind makes a decision on the basis of a “belief” about the past. It must, after all, be making inferences from those past perceptions and decisions in order to allow them to inform its present deliberation, and what is a settled inference if not a belief? A large missing ingredient in this book’s picture of the mind as a kind of free-jazzing blank slate, meanwhile, is the fact that evidence suggests there is substantial genetic influence on an individual’s personality traits (such as extraversion and agreeableness) and predisposition to develop mental illness. This would imply at the very least that Chater’s “improvising mind” is never starting from scratch, but is always operating within certain constraints. Chater argues that the self-fashioning brain can become whatever it wants to be – so in his view, the “tradition” is not binding. Up to a point, this is probably right, being also the basis of cognitive behavioural therapy and its ancient inspiration, stoic philosophy. But the idea that you can change yourself does seem to imply, inevitably, that there was a self to change in the first place. The mind might not be as deep as we fancy, but it can’t be two‑dimensional either. • The Mind Is Flat is published by Allen Lane.

Barclays announced on Monday that Ed Bramson’s Sherborne Investors had “acquired voting rights over 5.16% of Barclays’ issued share capital”. The stakebuilding by Sherborne, which describes itself as a “turnaround investment firm”, makes it Barclays’ fourth-biggest investor after US asset managers Capital Group and BlackRock, and Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund. Bramson, who was born in the UK but moved to New York in 1975, did not comment on his intentions at Barclays but he has often been described as a “corporate raider” who forces change at companies he invests in. Barclays, whose investment banking division is lagging US rivals, said some of its board members have already met with Bramson and the bank “will continue to engage with Sherborne, and welcomes them as a shareholder”. Shares in Barclays rose 3.6% to 217p. Barclays, which last month reported a £1.9bn full-year loss, was one of the worst performing banks in the world last year, with shares falling 12%. Sherborne, a two-man firm run by Bramson and his protégé Stephen Welker, owns 1.94% of Barclays voting rights directly via shares and another 3.2% controlled indirectly via derivative contracts. The fund raised £700m last summer to fund its next target. The prospectus for the fundraising said Sherborne planned to invest in a “company which it considers to be undervalued as a result of operational deficiencies and which it believes can be rectified by the Investment Manager’s active involvement”. Unlike high-profile activist investors such as Bill Ackman or Carl Ichan, Bramson prefers to avoid publicity. He has previously targeted well-known British companies including fund manager F&amp;C Asset Management and private equity groups Electra and 3i. Bramson is due to step down as interim chief executive of Electra, which owns TGI Fridays, later this month after fighting his way on to the firm’s board in 2015. He slashed costs at Electra and encouraged the company to start paying big dividends to shareholders. Sherborne is the private equity firm’s biggest shareholder, with a 30% stake. In a newspaper interview in 2015, Bramson said the rest of Electra’s board “think we’re scum”. He also went head-to-head against Edward Bonham-Carter, the vice-chairman of investment house Jupiter and older brother of Hollywood star Helena Bonham-Carter. Jupiter was a big investor in Electra and rejected Bramson’s bid for control. Bramson has said he quit the UK for the US in 1975 after getting trapped in a lift during the power cuts that crippled Britain in the early 1970s. He now operates out of offices on the top floor of a 32-storey tower block in midtown Manhattan with views of the Chrysler building and the East River. He has rarely spoken about his private life, but divulged in a Bloomberg interview in 2015 that he did go through “a toy phase”. “I did like the houses, all that crap,” he said. Bramson also collects classic cars, and owns several horses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/mar/19/dior-homme-appoints-kim-jones-as-its-new-artistic-director","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T13:25:01Z","webTitle":"Dior Homme appoints Kim Jones as its new artistic director","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/19/dior-homme-appoints-kim-jones-as-its-new-artistic-director","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/mar/19/dior-homme-appoints-kim-jones-as-its-new-artistic-director","fields":{"headline":"Dior Homme appoints Kim Jones as its new artistic director","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Kim Jones, the British menswear designer who left Louis Vuitton in January, will become the artistic director at Dior Homme in April. He replaces Kris Van Assche, who had helmed the menswear arm of Dior since 2007. Jones is a widely liked figure in fashion, with 345k Instagram followers and famous friends on speed dial including Kanye West and David Beckham, both regular guests at his show. His finale at Louis Vuitton took things to another level. He walked to applause, flanked by two of his best friends, Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss, wearing Louis Vuitton-monogrammed trench coats. Before the Dior Homme announcement, he was linked to top jobs at Versace and Burberry. In a statement, Jones said: “I am deeply honoured to join the house of Dior, a symbol of the ultimate elegance.” He also thanked Dior CEO Pietro Beccari for the opportunity, the man widely thought to be the mastermind behind the move. He worked with Jones at Louis Vuitton, and moved to Dior in February. Both brands are part of the LVMH luxury group. The CEO paid tribute to Jones in his own statement. “I admire his creative vision, which combines both his own inspirations of contemporary culture and his own reinterpretation of specific codes and heritage of a house,” said Beccari. Jones’s tenure at Louis Vuitton was characterised by just that combination. The designer managed to mix the wealthy traveller feel of the house that began as a luggage brand in 1854 with the cool streetwear references of his own history. As a young designer, he started his career in London in the 90s, working with sportswear brands including Umbro, peaking with a collaboration between Louis Vuitton and Supreme at the beginning of 2017. Something unthinkable the previous decade – in 2000 the streetwear label received a cease-and-desist letter from Vuitton for using their famous monogram on a skateboard – was made tangible by Jones. It was a big hit. Consumers queued up outside pop-up stores in July, with many of the pieces resold for 1.5 times their original price. Dior Homme will be hoping that Jones can bring his cool factor to the brand. Van Assche’s reign has been successful but without fireworks. His aesthetic was sharp suiting with graphic details, and he worked with celebrities including Robert Pattinson, A$AP Rocky, Mr Robot’s Rami Malek and Depeche Mode’s Dave Gahan. Van Assche was promoted from the design studio to lead Dior Homme in 2007, with the departure of Hedi Slimane. It was Slimane – due to present his first collection for LVMH brand Celine this autumn – who first gave Dior Homme a jolt of stardust in the noughties, during his seven-year stint. His ultra-skinny rock’n’roll tailoring was favoured by rock stars of the era including Pete Doherty and Johnny Borrell. Van Assche built on this work with similar silhouettes and references. It is understood that the Belgian designer will stay within the LVMH group with an announcement imminent. Jones’s first collection for Dior Homme will be in Paris in June. A-list stars in the front row and cool references on the catwalk can be expected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/19/donald-trump-death-penalty-drug-dealers-opioids-new-hampshire","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T21:03:06Z","webTitle":"Trump calls for death penalties for drug dealers as focus of opioids plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/19/donald-trump-death-penalty-drug-dealers-opioids-new-hampshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/19/donald-trump-death-penalty-drug-dealers-opioids-new-hampshire","fields":{"headline":"Trump calls for death penalties for drug dealers as focus of opioids plan","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Donald Trump called on Monday for some drug dealers to receive the death penalty in a new opioids policy rollout in New Hampshire, a state hard hit by the national crisis. “We’re wasting our time if we don’t get tough with drug dealers, and that toughness includes the death penalty,” said Trump in typically combative style. He later added: “The ultimate penalty has to be the death penalty. Maybe our country is not ready for that, it’s possible, it’s possible.” Trump said “personally I can’t understand that” about those opposed to such drastic measures. Some states already charge drug dealers with murder if customers overdose. In Florida, people who provide cocaine, heroin or the powerful opioid fentanyl to a person who dies from using the drug in question can be charged with first-degree murder and sentenced to either life in prison or death. Drug-induced homicide laws, which emerged in the 1980s, are being used more frequently because of the opioids crisis, according to a November 2017 report by the Drug Policy Alliance. However, there is no evidence that such laws reduce drug use. On Monday Trump was effectively sending a message to prosecutors to be harsher on drug dealers, who traffic in street drugs like heroin as well as black market prescription painkillers, such as OxyContin, and various versions of the potent narcotic fentanyl. But he did not call specifically for legislation to expand use of the death penalty for federal drug crimes. The justice department said the federal death penalty is already available for limited drug-related offenses, including violations of the “drug kingpin” provisions of federal law. The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, attended the event on Monday and sat next to Melania Trump. The DoJ later issued a statement, saying: “At the Department of Justice, we have made ending the drug epidemic a priority. We will continue to aggressively prosecute drug traffickers and we will use federal law to seek the death penalty wherever appropriate.” Doug Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University, said it was not clear federal death sentences for drug dealers, even for those whose product causes multiple deaths, would be constitutional. Berman said the issue would be litigated extensively and would have to be definitively decided by the supreme court. New Hampshire has been hit hard by the opioid crisis, a fact Trump acknowledged last August when he said: “We have the drug lords in Mexico that are knocking the hell out of our country. They are sending drugs to Chicago, Los Angeles, and to New York. Up in New Hampshire – I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den – [it] is coming from the southern border.” The comment caused offence in the state, with the Democratic senator Maggie Hassan responding: “Instead of insulting people in the throes of addiction, [Trump] needs to work across party lines to actually stem the tide of this crisis.” Though Trump is visiting to lobby for harsher sentencing for opioid-related crimes, New Hampshire is one of many states now pushing criminal justice reform. On Monday, the state judiciary announced it would review bail policies, after nationwide criticism of courts that serve as de facto debtor’s prisons for people too poor to pay bail. In 2012, substance use disorders such as opioid dependence cost New Hampshire $284m in criminal justice costs. More than half of jail and prison costs in the state are attributed to drug abuse, according to a report by the advocacy group New Futures. Nationally, 76% of inmates are believed to have substance use disorders, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Trump, who aims to be seen as tough on crime, has repeatedly highlighted his preference for the “ultimate penalty” for drug dealers. At a Pennsylvania rally this month, Trump told supporters countries like Singapore have fewer issues with drug addiction because they harshly punish dealers. He argued that a person in the US can get the death penalty or life in prison for shooting one person, but a drug dealer who potentially kills thousands can spend little or no time in jail. “The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness,” Trump said in remarks he echoed on Monday. Trump also wants Congress to pass legislation reducing the amount of drugs needed to trigger mandatory minimum sentences for traffickers who knowingly distribute certain opioids, said Andrew Bremberg, Trump’s domestic policy director, who briefed reporters on the White House plan. The president was joined in New Hampshire by the first lady, Melania Trump, who has shown an interest in the issue, particularly as it pertains to her focus on child welfare. Trump’s plan concerns law enforcement and interdiction to break the international and domestic flow of drugs into and across the US. It also includes broadening education and awareness, expanding access to treatment and recovery efforts and government funding for efforts to develop non-addictive painkillers. He also said that the Department of Justice was “looking very seriously into bringing major litigation against some of these drug companies.” Leading opioids makers in the US are already engulfed in a flurry of civil litigation brought by cities, counties and states. Opioids, including prescription opioids, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, killed more than 42,000 people in the US in 2016, more than any year on record, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We call it the crisis next door because everyone knows someone,” said Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser. “This is no longer somebody else’s community, somebody else’s kid, somebody else’s co-worker.” The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/mar/19/talking-horses-campaign-to-cut-fixed-odds-betting-terminals-stakes-to-2-pounds-far-from-lost-horse-racing-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T11:18:08Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: the campaign to cut FOBT stakes to £2 is far from lost","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/19/talking-horses-campaign-to-cut-fixed-odds-betting-terminals-stakes-to-2-pounds-far-from-lost-horse-racing-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/19/talking-horses-campaign-to-cut-fixed-odds-betting-terminals-stakes-to-2-pounds-far-from-lost-horse-racing-tips","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: the campaign to cut FOBT stakes to £2 is far from lost","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Gambling Commission finally released its long-awaited review of “gaming machines and social responsibility measures” on Monday morning, and already it is being reported as confirmation that the maximum stake on fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs) in bookmakers will be cut to £30, rather than the £2 that had been widely floated in recent weeks. “Relief for bookmakers as ministers set to reject drastic FOBT reform” was the headline on an online report in the Racing Post, which is very much signed up to the bookmakers’ argument that a £2 minimum would lead to widespread betting shop closures and a sharp drop in racing’s income. The full picture, however, is not so clearcut. One point that needs to be borne in mind is that the scope of the Commission’s review is limited. Its mission statement lists the GC’s objectives as follows: preventing gambling from being a source of crime or disorder, being associated with crime or being used to support crime; ensuring that gambling is conducted in a fair and open way; and protecting children and other vulnerable people from being harmed or exploited by gambling. As a result, the review’s main focus is the potential effect of the maximum FOBT stake on problem gamblers (though a recommendation for “mandatory tracked play” on FOBTs is intended to address money-laundering concerns). It takes no account of the social and economic blight in communities across the country that has resulted from the clustering of shops on high streets, solely to allow four FOBTs per shop to extract risk-free money from their surroundings. It is also worth noting that while the review recommends a cut to a £2 maximum stake for “slot”-style games on FOBTs, it does not come down firmly for £30 for roulette, which is by far the most popular game on FOBTs. It suggests that it should be “£30 or lower”, and thereby puts the ball very much in the court of Matthew Hancock MP, the culture secretary, who is the politician charged with making the final decision. Hancock is a smart operator who will consider the full range of issues – and political implications before he makes his choice. These include the likelihood – indeed, near-certainty – that the next Labour manifesto will echo the pledge in the last one to impose a £2 limit. If Hancock goes with £30 and is seen to cave in to pressure from the retail gambling, it will be a stick that his opponents will beat him with at every opportunity. A £2 limit on all FOBT games is coming, it is just a matter of when. Hancock has a chance to shoot a Labour fox and earn approval from all sides as he does so, since there is opposition to high-street roulette from across the political spectrum. The question is: will he have the nous and courage to seize the opportunity? The Post may think that it is a done deal (though a later comment article did suggest that the “issue is far from settled”). I’m still making it 10-11 each of two. Just one card, on the all-weather at Lingfield, has survived the freezing weather in Britain on Monday, though the temperatures are expected to improve in time for the Lincoln Handicap to usher in the new Flat season on the turf at Doncaster on Saturday. Cliffs Of Dover (3.25) is odds-on for the stayers’ handicap but justifiably so as he was an easy winner off a mark of 64 earlier this month and still looks well handicapped on his useful jumping form even after a 7lb rise. Ormskirk (5.25) has also been switching codes this winter and has edged down the weights to an attractive mark, just 1lb higher than for his solid run into second place at Wolverhampton last time.

The Cambridge Analytica exposé shows the UK needs better data protection Shadow digital minister Liam Byrne argues for changes to the data protection bill in the wake of revelations about Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. Readers have been adding their thoughts after following Guardian and Observer coverage. ‘We’ve been too slow to regulate social media companies’ This is a delicate area that requires careful and nuanced thought (and yeah, how likely are we to get that in this day and age?) but we desperately need transparency online with regard to advertisements at the very least. After that, the next step is to force social media companies like Facebook to pursue dishonest or politically motivated accounts or fine them into bankruptcy. These companies are harmful to us in many ways and they do not have a “right” to exist as they do. We’ve been too slow to regulate them. However it is a fine line to walk. The freedom of expression on the Internet could easily be destroyed by unscrupulous governments in this push. We have to walk a careful line. JohnnyCK ‘Successive British governments have treated the population as a whole as gullible idiots’ The best defence against propaganda is a population that is not susceptible to it. One that is told the truth by a news media they trust and will therefore dismiss “news” from our enemies as the lies that it is. However, successive British governments have treated the population as a whole as a bunch of gullible idiots. They have lied to us, made false promises and weaseled out of commitments with “I didn’t actually say that!” type statements. And the media is no better: it deceives by feeding us false “news”, unchecked “facts”, spin, narrative and bias. And it is that distrust which foreign “news” sources – and some domestic ones, too – exploit. They know that the history of lying to the public means that nobody trusts what they read, see or hear in the British media any more. And that just makes their job so much easier. When you expect to be lied to, one sources lies are much the same as any others. graun War shaped my childhood – don’t let Brexit risk our peace Actor Patrick Stewart writes in the Guardian on Monday that UK citizens should have another meaningful vote on Brexit as its impact becomes clearer. ‘The loss of that wartime solidarity explains the greed and narcissism of the right’ This is what is forgotten in the current climate. As a teenager in 1975 that referendum was all about peace and unity across Europe and was fought with a strong emphasis on solidarity with others after the disasters of the war. Cameron’s referendum was fought on a climate of self interest and suspicion. Many of the oldest generation in their 80s and 90s voted against Brexit for those reasons connected to the memory of war, although much younger pensioners did not. The loss of that wartime solidarity explains the greed and narcissism of the right that has done so much damage over forty years. herero ‘The EU is not a mercantile endeavour – it is a peace project’ This ignorance by a large part of Britons about the true purpose of the European Union is perhaps the most dispiriting aspect of the referendum fiasco. The EU is not a mercantile endeavour – it is a peace project that has brought together most of the continent on the foundation of common economic interests, democratic values and human interchange. No “deep and special relationship” will replace committed participation in building common European future. nonanon1 ‘Brexit must be abandoned’ How anyone can continue to pretend Brexit will be anything other than an unmitigated disaster defies belief.

Ireland have been the best team in the NH for 2-3 years now, despite England’s recent win record. They are well coached and shouldn’t be scared of anyone, so have a good chance of winning the World Cup next year. England need some time out and settle on a proper game plan, some of the old stagers look shot and they were embarrassingly poor with their tactics and abilities at the breakdown. Telff The next 18 months will be make or break for England I don’t say this lightly, but England really are staring down the barrel, and the next 18 months will make or break them. Why? A quick glance at the fixture lists reveals New Zealand in November, a trip to Dublin in 2019 on the opening weekend of the 6 Nations, a trip to Cardiff, a French team that will be a lot better in the pool stages in 2019, and possibly an Argentina side that will recall overseas players for the World Cup. Some hard rugby to be played in that pool, and the injuries could literally cripple England’s trophy hopes. By my estimation, England have 12 games to turn this sinking ship around, and Jones will have to earn his bread like never before, and these English players will have to take a long hard look at themselves. Will they be ash or diamond? GordonsAlive Comments have been edited for length.

Others, that is, on the road - as the Tweet below shows, the England Schools XC event had a nice spin on that ‘Snowflake’ insult ... Of course, in a way it’s easier for an XC event. Most of those kids would be running on spikes, on ground that’s uneven anyway and unlikely to be slippery in the same way that a non-gritted road or icy pavement can get. Not to say they aren’t hardcore and brilliant, obviously, but many of them will actually be more experienced at such conditions than, for example, someone attempting their very first half marathon. I actually felt sorry for race organisers - they were damned if they did cancel and (potentially) damned if they didn’t. Fulham 10k got grief for cancelling on Friday (“too early!”) and Reading for doing so on the day (“too late!”). When you sign up to the race, it’s there in the T&amp;Cs that the organisers may have to cancel if conditions are potentially dangerous - or words to that effect. And what disgruntled runners must bear in mind is that those conditions aren’t just for the runners - who can at least warm up - but also for the volunteers who turn out for hour after hour and stand around in freezing weather to marshal or help out. The cut off time for Reading half is four hours. Would you want to be standing still at a road junction in yesterday’s arctic winds for - adding on getting into place and other duties - upwards of six hours? At any rate, my cancelled race allowed me to meet up with friends and do some miles in an utterly beautiful Richmond Park. So cold that I tried my friend Sarah’s excellent double-bluff strategy, and despite wonderful scenes of deer grazing in snow, only managed to get my frozen hands to take one picture (see above). So, over to you - how was your weekend running? I really felt for all those spring marathoners yesterday - those a few weeks away from London or Brighton or Madrid having to do 20+ miles in those conditions. Hats (or buffs) off to all of you - if you can cope with that weather, race day will be a breeze ..."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"law/2018/mar/18/barrister-blows-whistle-on-broken-law-brought-to-its-knees-by-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T18:09:46Z","webTitle":"Barrister blows whistle on 'broken legal system brought to its knees by cuts'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/mar/18/barrister-blows-whistle-on-broken-law-brought-to-its-knees-by-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/mar/18/barrister-blows-whistle-on-broken-law-brought-to-its-knees-by-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Barrister blows whistle on 'broken legal system brought to its knees by cuts'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Courts that are like an A&amp;E unit on a Saturday night, violent abusers walking free because evidence has gone missing, and lawyers doing hours of unpaid work to keep the system from collapse, are all part of a damning picture painted in a new book on the legal system by a barrister. According to the anonymous author of The Secret Barrister: Stories Of The Law And How It’s Broken, the courts in England and Wales have been brought to their knees by government cuts and left so plagued by daily errors they are no longer fit for purpose. The identity of the writer of this fly-on-the-wall account of what goes on in courtrooms across the country is a well-guarded secret – and the subject of online curiosity among a Twitter following of 87,000. The eponymous “secret barrister” uses the accounts of real people and cases to reveal the legal system as being so broken that the innocent can find themselves behind bars while “every single day the provably guilty walk free”. In a newspaper interview the author, a criminal barrister who works as a defence lawyer and prosecutor, warns that our legal system is approaching a tipping point and in urgent need of funding and reform. From the “wild west” of the magistrates’ court, likened to “an inner city A&amp;E department on a Saturday night” to the upper echelons of the crown court, where the stakes are higher but the catalogue of errors equally long, the author describes a system creaking under the strain of a decade’s worth of cuts. Amid speculation and intrigue over the identity and gender of the author, some rumours have suggested that the hugely popular blog is an algorithm run by a small section of the legal community. “Secret barrister” has said that just close family members are privy to this moonlighting. “I don’t have a profile outside my online existence. I’m a junior criminal barrister, I’m extremely ordinary. I hope the focus of the book will be on the issues raised rather than me.” The book says: “Walk into any court in the land, speak to any lawyer, ask any judge, and you will be treated to uniform complaints of court deadlines being repeatedly missed, cases arriving under-prepared, evidence being lost, disclosures not being made, victims made to feel marginalised, and millions of pounds of public money wasted.“I wanted to bring the things I saw that upset me to a wider audience. They will not come as a shock to lawyers in the system. But whenever I [spoke] to a non lawyer about them they would look at me with horror and I realised there was a disconnect between the criminal justice system and the people it is meant to serve.” The book tells the story of a man held wrongly on remand for months on end, a violent abuser allowed to walk free because basic evidence was missing and a vulnerable witness who gave up after a trial was adjourned for a third instance due to lack of court time. Defendants, victims and ultimately society are failed on a daily basis with life-changing consequences, the author claims, by a system brought to its knees by years of public service cuts. The barrister cites the problem of repeated court adjournments and issues around disclosures as two of the toughest challenges for the system. But, overwhelmingly, the biggest problem is lack of funding across the board, the writer says. “The system is at breaking point and now running exclusively on the goodwill of the barristers and solicitors that work unpaid, after hours, through lunch, through nights, through weekends, to plug the problems in the system. Perhaps we need to say if we, the court staff and the CPS staff weren’t going the extra mile, if judges weren’t above and beyond, then everything will collapse.” There is also a warning that, with changes on the horizon concerning the way criminal barristers are paid, there may come a tipping point soon. “There is a lot of disquiet because reforms the government insist are cost neutral, upon inspection don’t appear to be. They will continue to push people out of the profession.” However, for the moment, the secret barrister will not be among those departing. “People do not go into criminal justice for an easy life or because they want to earn a fortune but because they want to provide a public service and see justice done.” But there is one vital half of the job that remains undervalued and misunderstood. “It’s curious, the question that comes up without fail, when I’m asked what I do for a day job – how can you defend somebody you know is guilty? But I’ve never once been asked by anyone – how can you prosecute someone you think is innocent?” People in Britain tended to lean towards the presumption of guilt rather than innocence, the barrister suggested. “The same cognitive bias that a lot of us share and is not helped by the way the tabloids treat criminal justice, which is – there is no smoke without fire.” There was a tendency, too, to overlook the word “accused” despite many first-time entrants to the justice system being innocent. “It doesn’t really stick with people until they’ve been through it personally or until they watch Making a Murderer on Netflix. A charge is not proof of guilt. People think it won’t happen to them, but anyone can find themselves in the criminal courts. You never know when you might need a good lawyer and if you do you’d better hope they are operating within a system that works.” The Ministry of Justice and the Crown Prosecution Service were approached for a response but declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/18/more-snow-and-ice-forecast-as-travel-disrupted-across-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T06:56:00Z","webTitle":"UK weather: snow and ice warnings cause travel disruption","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/18/more-snow-and-ice-forecast-as-travel-disrupted-across-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/18/more-snow-and-ice-forecast-as-travel-disrupted-across-uk","fields":{"headline":"UK weather: snow and ice warnings cause travel disruption","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Britain faced further travel disruption on Monday as the “mini beast from the east” brought snow and ice to large areas of the UK overnight. Parts of Devon and south-west England were expected to bear the brunt of the freeze on Monday, with up to 30cm of snow in some parts of the region compared with up to 10cm for the rest of Britain. Highways England closed the A30 in both directions between junction 31 of the M5 and the A38 in Bodmin due to what police described as conditions “changing rapidly from passable to impossible”. Eight-two people were forced to take shelter in a school after becoming stuck on a 64-mile stretch of the A30. They were moved to a rest centre at Okehampton College at the north side of Dartmoor. Meanwhile Devon County Council confirmed the closure of dozens of schools on Monday, while train services were also said to be affected. It comes after hundreds of flights were cancelled and sports events called off as plummeting temperatures cast a blanket of snow across the UK on Sunday, with further “disruptive snowfall” overnight. Mark Wilson, a Met Office meteorologist, said: “It’s going to be a very, very cold start, with a widespread frost and ice around as well.” The Highways Agency urged motorists everywhere to drive with caution on Monday and pack snow kits of blankets, food, water and a shovel in areas of heavy snowfall. Met Office forecasters said temperatures were expected to return to more typical March conditions by Tuesday, bringing an end to the unseasonably cold spring. While large parts of Britain had snow on Sunday, there was disruption for many commuters needing to catch flights or trains. Hundreds of flights were cancelled at airports across Britain, including 146 at Heathrow alone, as runways were covered in snow. Gatwick airport apologised for the disruption and urged travellers to check the situation with their airline. In Cornwall, an Asda manager said some stores were running low on bread and milk as customers were panic-buying after the original “beast from the east” saw shelves being cleared of groceries earlier this month. In Cumbria, mountain rescue teams were called to help 15 people stuck in a cafe near Kirkby Stephen while an ambulance crew struggled to reach patients in Langdale, a valley in the heart of the Lake District national park. The weather brought traffic to a standstill on some of the country’s busiest roads on Sunday, including the M62 in Yorkshire. Three snowploughs were dispatched to the motorway as Greater Manchester police’s traffic unit described conditions as a “little bit wild” at Saddleworth Moor in Oldham, the highest point of any motorway in Britain. Officers from Lincolnshire police spent seven hours digging out 35 stranded vehicles after they became stuck in snowdrifts on the A158 near Edlington overnight on Saturday. Snowfall also caused disruption across parts of Ireland, with an orange snow-ice warning extended to 6pm for seven counties, including Dublin. Some bus routes in the Irish capital were curtailed due to the weather and Bus Éireann said there was disruption to services in the eastern region. The snowfall has led to the cancellation of a number of events to mark the St Patrick’s bank holiday weekend, including the Big Day Out event in Merrion Square in Dublin. In Wicklow, there were reports of snowdrifts of up to 90cm, the local council said. The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government said all relevant agencies had severe weather emergency plans in place. Residents of coastal homes in Hemsby, Norfolk, were evacuated over fears the properties were at risk of coastal erosion as the area braced for snow and ice overnight. The county is covered by a yellow weather warning issued by the Met Office and it is thought that five buildings were at risk. One resident, Stephen Chadwick, described how a cliff gave way. Speaking to BBC News, he said: “I woke up this morning, had a cup of coffee at 7.30 ... it was like an earthquake and the cliff just went.” Hemsby has been vulnerable to coastal erosion before. During a tidal surge in 2013 five bungalows fell into the water as the high tide eroded the cliff below. The Met Office has issued a less severe yellow warning for Monday, noting that ice was likely on roads, pavements and cycle paths. “This increases the risk of accidents, as well as injuries due to falls. This warning has been updated to remove much of Scotland (apart from the south-east) and parts of Northern Ireland, whilst it has been extended to cover remaining parts of eastern England and the extreme south-west,” a statement on the Met Office website read. Richard Leonard, Highways England’s head of road safety, said: “Our gritter drivers will be out treating our roads around the clock but it is still important to drive to the conditions when snow is forecast. “Make sure you keep your distance and reduce your speed if you need to travel because, even in conditions that seem normal and when the snow is not settling, it can be slippery if ice patches have formed, or where fresh salt has not been worked into the carriageway.” • This article was amended on 20 March 2018 to correct the location of Saddleworth Moor from Yorkshire to Oldham."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14944","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T23:00:12Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,944","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14944","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14944","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,944","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/19/a-league-adelaides-lack-of-goals-all-about-the-type-of-shots-they-are-generating","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T17:00:13Z","webTitle":"A-League: Adelaide's lack of goals all about the type of shots they are generating","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/19/a-league-adelaides-lack-of-goals-all-about-the-type-of-shots-they-are-generating","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/19/a-league-adelaides-lack-of-goals-all-about-the-type-of-shots-they-are-generating","fields":{"headline":"A-League: Adelaide's lack of goals all about the type of shots they are generating","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“Balance, clearly, is part of it, but there must also be intelligence: endlessly repeating the same trick may have attacking intent, but the effect is tedium,” Jonathan Wilson wrote in 2016, on Louis van Gaal’s struggles with Manchester United. “Attacking is, like so much in football, nebulous and is largely dependent on context.” Though football has always been a fluid game, the line between what constitutes attacking and defensive football has become increasingly blurred. Conceptually, the modern game is more a matter of the active and reactive. With more compressed lines further facilitating the ability to counter, attacking intent without the ball has largely muddled ideas on collective functionality in possession. If not all, the majority of teams in the A-League live in this vast mass of grey. With their energy and little else in a 1-1 draw at home to Melbourne City on Friday, Adelaide United underlined their status as the Most A-League Team in the A-League. This season under Marco Kurz has consisted of highly fluctuating but not particularly confusing results – salvaging a draw with 10 men at home to Central Coast Mariners followed by losses to Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory in the past month – with this in context. Though much has been said of the fact the Reds rank first in total shots in the A-League this season (328) but only eighth in total goals (25), it has less to do with profligacy than the type of shots they are generating. Their strongest attribute is their pace. With explosive speed out wide via the likes of Nikola Mileusnić, Ryans Kitto and Strain, along with Ben Garuccio, they have enough to effectively counter and exploit the opposition in space. While it can be deemed logical to use the speed they have from overlapping full-backs in Strain, Garuccio and to a lesser extent Michael Marrone, Adelaide’s possession with the opposition defence embedded borders on the one-dimensional and tedious. When the onus is on Adelaide to be active over the course of a match, as opposed to reactive, they struggle to penetrate and apply pressure. At the heart of it lies their movement in central midfield. Either due to their own spatial awareness or direction from coaches, central midfielders in the A-League aren’t generally inclined to receive the ball in positions that make defenders face their own goal. Isaías is the standard bearer, if one can call it that. Before this round, the Spaniard led the team in passes per 90 minutes at 57.1. While assists don’t tell the whole story in weighing up a midfielder’s performance, for someone who has that big an influence on a team’s phases of possession to have a solitary assist in a season – a long ball in transition to Mileusnić at home to Perth – is concerning. Added to that, Isaías holds roughly the same figure in key passes per 90 (1.72) as left-back Garuccio (1.65). Daniel Adlung and the Adelaide captain rarely take possession between the defensive and midfield lines, contributing to their first and second rank in the team for possessions per 90 at 62.1 and 59.9 respectively. As a result, the team has little option but to shift the ball out wide, mostly leading to low-percentage outcomes that come from crosses. Adelaide lead the league in crosses per 90 at 17.87, with a total of 411 for the season – a mammoth 136 more than the next highest total within the current top six. The pattern continued on Friday night despite Johan Absalonsen’s return to the starting line-up, with the Reds putting in 17 crosses at an accuracy of 17.6%, at only 44.6% possession. Outside of transitional phases, this is how the bulk of Adelaide’s shot attempts are generated and unless the cross is in early, defences should be able to put enough pressure on the primary attempt or spill to minimise exposure to the goalkeeper. Though Nathan Konstandopoulos’ clever run opened up play for Absalonsen’s opener, Mileusnić’s ability to pick that pass when isolated out wide has been sporadic to this point. It is why, as Wilson noted, balance is key. The capability to act as well as react, and in this instance playing through the defence, as well as around it, needs advanced movement without the ball from midfield to create a sustainable threat. Otherwise, if they make the post-season, Adelaide’s potential for success will ultimately depend on the opposition."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/19/competition-for-the-ball-is-back-and-the-nrl-is-the-better-for-it","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T01:00:06Z","webTitle":"Competition for the ball is back and the NRL is the better for it | Matt Cleary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/19/competition-for-the-ball-is-back-and-the-nrl-is-the-better-for-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/19/competition-for-the-ball-is-back-and-the-nrl-is-the-better-for-it","fields":{"headline":"Competition for the ball is back and the NRL is the better for it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As it has been every season since Rex “The Moose” Mossop argued the toss on Channel 7’s Controversy Corner, rugby league people will rail on Sunday mornings about consistency in the game – or more to the point, the lack of it. Rugby league has always lusted after it: the holy – and completely unachievable – grail of consistency. And in the game’s understandable if deluded efforts to control something so random as rugby league, the game has looked to eradicate the “grey”, the “messy” and the unscripted by eradicating competition for the ball. There was a time, long before even Moose, that a marker could “ruck” the ball back at the play-the-ball. There was a time that scrums involved six forwards binding tightly and pushing, with hooker, tight-head and loose-head forwards worthy of the name. There was a time when Allan Langer, a tiny dancer, a genius, could inveigle himself into the rib-cages of the game’s biggest players, wrench the ball free and steal away like a snowy-haired reaver in the night. No more, of course. Scrums are dead and raking for the ball is long dead. Langer’s party trick was outlawed because Langer was so good at it. And maybe someone can convince you that the game is better for it. But it’s making a comeback, in some way, at least.. Like cricket’s constant battle between bat and ball, rugby league has tweaked the stripping rule and the result is that there is an opportunity for the defending team to get the ball. Stripping has been perhaps the most vexed, annoying and “grey” rule for the last few years. What constitutes a strip? What’s been dropped? What’s been dropped to make it look like a strip? What’s been dropped because it’s been roughly jolted free? And is that a strip? Why? And so on. It’s a super-tough gig adjudicating all this on the fly and nigh on every ball dislodged in a tackle is subject to the vagaries of the referee’s call. And in many cases they’ll just up and guess. Sometimes they’ll make a call based on the state of the game so they don’t affect the result and thus be dropped from first grade. But the new rule – in which a player can steal the ball one-on-one even if a tackle began with more than just one – looks like it could open the game up for more unscripted action. Competition for the ball is back. Ball security is the new black. The message to the ball-carrier is: you are responsible for carrying the ball. And ball-carriers, it seems, aren’t ready for it. On Thursday night in the derby game in the Shire, Dragons star Gareth Widdop dropped the ball and appealed that it was raked out. Andrew Fifita did too. Jason Nightingale twice dropped the ball and both times appealed to the referee with a league player’s patented “wide eyes of a child” defence: palms upwards, mouth open, making a reefing gesture to allege the ball had been wrenched from his grasp. And looking at both incidents, Nightingale was right. Where his defence falls flat is that the Dragons did nothing illegal. They were entitled to wrench the ball from Nightingale’s grasp as they were, at the time, in one-on-one tackle situations. Last year when defenders dropped off in a tackle, that was it. Play the ball. This year, the last defender can have a crack at the ball. And you’d suggest it’ll be a legitimate and percentage play given that when someone drops the ball it’s automatically knock-on. League defenders work over attackers in the tackle. Every tackle is a dance, almost like rugby union’s mauls. The attacker isn’t only stopped but he’s roughed up, wrestled, manoeuvred. Defenders are expert at it and with training they could become very good at ball-stealing, too. On Friday night at Allianz Stadium, the Bulldogs’ Danny Fualalo made a hard charge into the meat of the Roosters’ forward division. Dylan Napa was around his ankles and prop forward Sio Siua Taukeiaho worked his upper body. Fualalo kicked free from Napa’s tackle but Taukeiaho was still up top, working the man and ball. As Fualalo feell, Taukeiaho stripped it away like Langer used to, and burned away 40 metres upfield, as Langer used to, the crowd baying and laughing in equal measure. That was not possible in 2017. This year, it’s a featured highlight. The old Moose would approve."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/18/coalition-reveals-nsw-infrastructure-plan-as-labor-attacks-obscene-stadium-spending","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T03:16:10Z","webTitle":"Coalition reveals NSW infrastructure plan as Labor attacks 'obscene' stadium spending","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/18/coalition-reveals-nsw-infrastructure-plan-as-labor-attacks-obscene-stadium-spending","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/18/coalition-reveals-nsw-infrastructure-plan-as-labor-attacks-obscene-stadium-spending","fields":{"headline":"Coalition reveals NSW infrastructure plan as Labor attacks 'obscene' stadium spending","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has unveiled the state’s 20-year infrastructure plan as Labor ramps up the campaign against her unpopular plan to spend $2.7bn rebuilding Sydney’s two major stadiums. Most of the plan for transport links has already been released but the plan is the government’s formal response to the Greater Sydney Commission’s recommendations. More than 100 recommendations have now been formally adopted. “This landmark vision integrates social infrastructure, transport and planning, so we can make the most of this government’s unprecedented investment in communities across our state,” Berejiklian said on Sunday. “Over the last seven years, our strong economic management has meant we’ve been able to deliver a massive pipeline of infrastructure investment worth $111bn, with over $80bn in the next four years alone. “NSW by far boasts more major infrastructure projects under way than any other state. When we came to government social infrastructure in schools and hospitals were not part of the planning process. We have changed that.” But Berejiklian is struggling to promote the government’s infrastructure agenda in the face of a concerted campaign over its decision to spend $2.7bn rebuilding both Allianz stadium at Moore Park and ANZ stadium at Homebush in Sydney. The NSW opposition leader, Luke Foley, set out on Sunday on a statewide tour in a red bus emblazoned with the slogan “Schools and hospitals before stadiums”. He is planning a week-long visit to key electorates around the state, including Tweed on the far North Coast, Myall Lakes, several towns in the Hunter Valley, then west to Barwon, Dubbo, Bega, Queanbeyan. Beginning his tour outside Chatswood high school, Foley said: “Outside metropolitan Sydney there is real anger and a clear sense of being ignored because of the obscene amount of money the Liberals and Nationals want to spend on Sydney sport stadiums.” “Families struggling to pay the bills are seething over this – as their children go to barely maintained schools and demountables and with hospitals starved of funding,” he said. Under Berejiklian, the NSW government has attempted to introduce greater co-ordination between expansion of Sydney’s suburbs to meet housing needs and associated infrastrucutres such as hospitals schools and transport. The Greater Sydney Commission was set up to review each region and devise detailed plans for each. Among the new transport initiatives are doubling single rail line from Richmond, a plan to explore expanding the freight line near Wilton for passenger services and a long-term plan for ferries on demand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2018/mar/18/youth-enterprise-cracked-it-centre-social-justice-award-new-radicals","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T00:04:36Z","webTitle":"Top social justice award for Cracked It smartphone project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2018/mar/18/youth-enterprise-cracked-it-centre-social-justice-award-new-radicals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2018/mar/18/youth-enterprise-cracked-it-centre-social-justice-award-new-radicals","fields":{"headline":"Top social justice award for Cracked It smartphone project","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Cracked It, a social enterprise staffed by young ex-offenders, and whose founder is a judge of the Observer New Radicals initiative, has been named social enterprise of the year.

Cracked It was tipped as a rising star of 2017 by the Observer last year. The social enterprise began as a small initiative in an east London youth centre, where founder Josh Babarinde piloted a phone-repair programme. The project aimed to provide young people with new skills, boost their confidence, and provide them with a way to make money, other than through joining gangs. Support from the Year Here social enterprise incubator allowed it to expand across the capital.

Most are Kurds, fleeing Afrin for the regime-held city of Aleppo, just over a grey horizon. Behind them, Turkish troops and Arab forces they sponsor have encircled their home city except for the squeeze point they used to flee. Ahead, Shia militants allied to the Syrian army man checkpoints deciding who can pass. With Syria’s war ticking over into its eighth gruelling year, the north of the country is once more on the move. The Kurds are bearing the brunt of the latest upheaval, fleeing their enclave near the Turkish border as a promised storming of Afrin draws near. At least 250 civilians have been killed in the bombardment of Afrin as the Turks and their proxies have advanced. Many abandoning the majority-Kurdish enclave fear they may not be allowed to return when – and if – the dust finally settles on this war without restraint. On Sunday morning, the Turkish backed Free Syrian Army rebels said they had entered the town after Kurdish forces pulled out. Everything appears up for grabs now: their homes, futures and even the Kurdish cause. “We sat this out for the past seven years,” said Hero, a Kurdish resident of Afrin who had made it to Aleppo. “We bothered no one and watched the storm pass all around us. Then the Turks came for us.” A safe haven in the tempest of Syria, Afrin had avoided the war in the rest of the north until a Turkish-led incursion into its surrounding hills seven weeks ago. Idlib and Aleppo, not far away, had been ravaged by jets and insurgency. Afrin, meanwhile, had been a haven for refugees from elsewhere. Arabs, Kurds, Turkmen, Christians, Muslims, even Yazidis from Iraq, had hunkered down as war raged all around. Even as Afrin’s civilian leaders showcased the city as a model of coexistence amid the chaos, it became a microcosm of the potent geopolitics that subsumed local allegiances. Arab-Kurdish tensions simmered in the north. But more importantly a once workable relationship between Washington and Ankara broke down – with the postwar future of Syria’s Kurds central to the schism. Afrin’s transformation into a focal point of the Syrian conflict began on 20 January, shortly after the Pentagon announced it would raise a border militia from a Kurdish-led force it had formed in north-eastern Syria to fight the Islamic State (Isis) terror group. Washington’s alliance with the Kurds had never sat well with Ankara, which regarded their leaders as being ideological allies of the militant Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), whose insurgency in south-eastern Turkey it continues to fight. Faced with American assurances that the alliance would be temporary, Turkey had stood by as Isis was swept from the towns and cities of north-eastern Syria, culminating in the extremists’ ousting from Raqqa late last year. But the mooted border force was a step too far for wary officials, a sign that the Kurds – aided by their backers – would make strategic gains which could weaken Turkey’s hold on its 500-mile frontier with Syria. And so, on 20 January, Turkey’s leaders, angered by Washington but not willing to confront the Kurds where they fought alongside the Americans, instead turned their guns on Afrin, a small pocket of north-western Syria, far from the fight with Isis and with no presence of US troops. A gap of around 60 miles separates Afrin from the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces’ presence to the east, roughly demarcated by the Euphrates river. Turkey has carved out a sphere of influence between the Kurdish populations, building its stocks with local Arab communities, intervening in the Syrian war when it wants to – but most importantly, keeping the Kurds apart. “They say that the fighting groups in Afrin and Rojava (north-eastern Syria) are the same, and that is basically true,” said a western diplomat based in the region. “Equally true is that the militants in Afrin had not pointed a gun their way until the Turks sent their air force after them.” The Kurds fleeing Afrin and those who have stayed behind – up to 200,000 people are thought to remain in the city – say they fear that Turkey aims to change the demography of the town, and by extension the border. The Arab force it is using comprises members of the Free Syria Army and allied militias and was raised to fight the Assad regime. Now, though, the spectre of Arabs being sent to fight Kurds in a majority-Kurdish city adds a troubling dimension to a conflict that continues to lurch far from the original battlelines of a nationalistic push to oust the Syrian leadership. Inside Afrin, a group of Arab students praised the Turkish incursion last week, insisting that civilians were not indiscriminately targeted as they repeatedly have been in Ghouta, near Damascus, over the past month of airstrikes by Syrian and Russian jets. “They have not been perfect,” said Dawood Mahmoud, who fled to Afrin from a nearby town more than a year ago. “But their mistakes are just that – mistakes.” A Kurdish resident of the city, who has not been given permission to leave by Kurdish militant groups, said the opposite. “Last night they bombed the hospital, and last week they blew up the waterworks. There have been up to 500 civilians killed. This is barbaric. “They have been dropping leaflets telling us to trust them and surrender. They think we’re fools. Neither they nor their Arabs can take Afrin. They wouldn’t dare. This will be a blockade like Aleppo.” As the siege closes in, and as Syrians of all sects and ethnicities crisscross the battered north, the war is drifting further from resolution than ever before. The plaintive cries of the global aid community remain mostly ignored, as do the demands of United Nations leaders. “Basically, anything goes,” said the western official. “There is no right or wrong any more. The international order is dying in the ruins of Syria.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/mar/18/ballet-black-review-shakespeare-in-tutus-for-enchanting-double-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T12:46:51Z","webTitle":"Ballet Black review – Shakespeare in tutus for enchanting double bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/18/ballet-black-review-shakespeare-in-tutus-for-enchanting-double-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/mar/18/ballet-black-review-shakespeare-in-tutus-for-enchanting-double-bill","fields":{"headline":"Ballet Black review – Shakespeare in tutus for enchanting double bill","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Watch any Ballet Black performance and you notice how racially and socially mixed the audience is compared with most ballet shows. But if the company, founded in 2001, still has a mission to change the face of ballet, artistically it has always been refreshingly unfettered – as its terrifically engaging current programme attests. Cathy Marston’s The Suit masterfully transposes its source (a short story by Can Themba) from words into dance. The plot is deceptively simple: a man discovers his wife has a lover, whom he drives away but whose presence – symbolised by an empty suit – still haunts the marriage. Marston dramatises the story without judging her characters. Cira Robinson and José Alves are superb as the central couple, caught between burning emotions and exacting steps. A five-strong chorus serve variously as private witnesses, public judges, personal projections and – most choreographically – as turbulent repercussions given physical form. The taut score is a remarkably seamless collage of music by no fewer than nine composers, and the scenes switch fluently between domestic and social worlds. Though the ending tips towards melodrama, the work is consummately crafted, and achieves its effects with an astonishing economy of means. A Dream Within a Midsummer Night’s Dream is Arthur Pita’s impishly perverse take on both Shakespeare and ballet. A grandiloquent balletic fanfare for three couples in tights and tutus is rudely interrupted by a puckish, outrageously cross-dressed boy scout, whose fairy dust liberates the classical partners into a magic realm of improprietous couplings and unbound eroticism. Helena, snorting a line of glitter, gets gleefully off with Hermia; Oberon falls for the swooningly romantic vision of Lysander, trailing veils; Pita plays his favourite cabaret songs. We are enchanted – and seduced. • On tour until 26 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/13/american-economy-wage-suppression-how-it-works","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T10:00:34Z","webTitle":"How the American economy conspires to keep wages down | Gabriel Winant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/13/american-economy-wage-suppression-how-it-works","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/13/american-economy-wage-suppression-how-it-works","fields":{"headline":"How the American economy conspires to keep wages down","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When unemployment goes down, wages are supposed to go up. That’s just supply and demand. Quite puzzlingly, though, this mechanism seems not to be working today. Unemployment stands at a modest 4%, but paychecks aren’t growing. Although today’s is the best-educated workforce in history, employers just insist that workers need more training. In other words, they’re gaslighting us. Meanwhile, over decades, employers have built and maintained a massive collective political apparatus to hold down wages. To call it a conspiracy would be only slight embellishment. The symptoms of the problem are not hard to miss. In February, for example, the American economy posted its biggest one-month jobs gain in a couple years, but wage growth stayed stalled out. For months, economists and financial journalists have been puzzling over the question, as Bloomberg put it, of “why the economy grows but your paycheck doesn’t”. Economists will tell you that wages generally increase with productivity – that you’re paid in line with the value of what you do. This was credible from the end of the second world war to the 1970s, when productivity and hourly wages rose almost perfectly in sync. But according to research by the Economic Policy Institute, from the early 1970s to 2016 productivity went up 73.7%, and wages only 12.3%. Similarly, there used to be a positive relationship between stock prices and wage increases. But some initial signs of wage growth in February sent the market spiraling over inflation fears – until it became clear that the reported wage gains were all concentrated among top earners. Then everyone calmed down and stopped selling. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve just announced that it’s taking the next step in its plan to raise interest rates. This will suppress wages to prevent inflation, although inflation is minuscule and wages aren’t showing signs of life. Another apparent culprit is what’s called “monopsony”. Monopoly occurs when sellers are so concentrated that they don’t really have to compete. Monopsony is when the buyers – in this case, employers – are concentrated. A recent paper from the Roosevelt Institute found that the average level of concentration in labor markets is 45% higher than the threshold for “highly concentrated” markets used by antitrust regulators. If the government went after employer monopsony the way it does other kinds of markets, regulators might have their hands quite full. What’s worse, as Alan Krueger and Eric Posner pointed out in the New York Times recently, one in five workers with a high school degree or less is subject to a non-compete clause – a tool for employers to push wages down by forbidding workers from getting jobs with their competitors. Many major franchises also forbid their franchisees from hiring workers away from each other. So a McDonald’s on this corner isn’t allowed to hire away workers from the McDonald’s on the other corner by offering 25 cents more. (Such rules were a classic tool of white landlords in the Jim Crow South to keep down the pay of black sharecroppers.) And even employers that don’t have such a commanding position can still hire workers through contractors who do. Temp agencies, for example, can function like bottlenecks, forcing workers into monopsonistic labor market conditions on behalf of smaller, less powerful employers. We tend to think of employment as a market interaction: supply and demand meet to set a price, and that’s the wage you get paid. But work is much more than this. When you buy bread, there’s no other connection between you and the baker. You take your loaf and go home. But when you sell labor in the labor market, you’re entering into an ongoing power relationship. In return for your wages, you’re supposed to submit – not once but every day. It’s not just economic. Work is intrinsically political. Typically, we enter into economic relationships by ourselves. But political relationships quickly become collective. As we’ve seen, employers have a vast collective apparatus at their disposal: the stock market, the Fed, antitrust and employment law, just to name a few. But, defiance can travel and become collective too. For some years, for example, unions have had success winning raises for low-wage workers politically, rather than at the bargaining table – through direct ballot initiatives, by putting pressure on Democratic politicians, and by getting new laws passed. (If the federal minimum wage had kept pace with overall income growth, it would be three times higher.) Workers have taken heroic risks to make a point – in the fast-food industry in particular, where employer retaliation is a given. And cities and states across the country have responded by passing minimum wage hikes. Today, the supreme court is weighing the question of the collective political power of workers. In the Janus v AFSCME case, an anti-union corporate group is seeking to take away the power of public sector unions to collect money from all workers whom they represent. The anti-union side argues that such fees violate workers’ free speech rights by compelling them to pay for representation that’s of an essentially political nature. As Justice Anthony Kennedy argued, public sector unions will always advocate “for massive government, for increasing bonded indebtedness, for increasing taxes”. Kennedy’s point is that these aren’t just economic goals; such workplace bargaining affects public policy. Somewhat wanly, the state of Illinois (defending the fees) argued that if unions don’t have the right to collect this money, the workplace will become unstable and conflictual. It didn’t seem like a credible threat. Then along came the West Virginia teachers’ strike and the chain reaction it ignited. The improbable outbreak, endurance, and triumph of the teachers’ strike in that state has inspired underpaid educators in Kentucky, Arizona and Oklahoma to take action for themselves. All these are states where teachers and underpaid and fed up, and where the formal power of their unions is quite limited. But in West Virginia, the teachers figured out how to win a long-delayed raise anyway: realizing they were irreplaceable, they shut down the schools for almost two weeks, and secured a 5% pay bump – not just for themselves, but for the state’s whole public sector. In West Virginia, the legislature had to pass a law, and the governor had to sign it, to give the teachers their raise. Oklahoma has now done the same, and passed its first tax increase in decades to fund the raise. These workers, in other words, are not just engaging in bargaining: their strikes are political in nature, and they are shaping public policy. The political power typically enjoyed by employers is generally experienced by workers as fear: fear of harassment, favoritism and wage theft, fear of joining a union or speaking out, fear of the consequences of injury or sickness, fear of the risks of asking for a raise, and beneath these, the fundamental workplace fear – of losing your job. The current of fear running through the workplace is one of the best ways to tell there’s something more than a market transaction happening there. But fear can go both ways. In West Virginia and Oklahoma, the irreplaceable teachers terrified Republican officials. With unemployment down, more of us are becoming irreplaceable every day. There’s leverage for workers there, but you have to be willing to scare your boss to use it. Gabriel Winant is a historian and writer completing a PhD at Yale University.

The first goal came when Emmanuel Adebayor, meeting a cross from his erstwhile Arsenal team-mate Gaël Clichy, powered in a header and there were other familiar faces on hand to celebrate. Emre Belozoglu, now 37, was patrolling the midfield that day; Gökhan Inler watched from the bench; and the home side’s former Premier League sextet was completed by Kerim Frei and Eljero Elia. Between them they could recount a passable history of the English top flight post-2005 but their present engagement involves shaping Turkey’s football future. Should Istanbul Basaksehir conclude a potentially decisive derby weekend by defeating Besiktas at home on Sunday afternoon, they will reinvigorate their bid to win the title just four years after assuming their present identity. They are little-known outside Turkey and hardly popular within it but their aim is to become a global force and succeed where the country’s more established powers have largely failed. “It’s happened a bit more quickly than we expected,” the board member Mustafa Erogut tells the Observer. “But when we have this momentum, we just want to keep it up. If we had won the league last season it would have been very surprising. This year it would not be; expectations have changed and, from being underdogs, we’re now one of the four title favourites.” The other three are, of course, Besiktas, Galatasaray and Fenerbahce. Last season only the first of these could outdo Istanbul Basaksehir, who were runners-up after twice coming fourth. The figures are impressive, although the club has not quite arrived from thin air. Their previous incarnation was Istanbul Buyuksehir Belediyespor, who were municipally owned and achieved moderate success after being formed in 1990. They had a tiny fanbase who, for some years, rattled around the 76,000 Ataturk Stadium; by 2014 they were viewed as a waste of taxpayers’ money and, after flirting with extinction, were re‑formed in the modern suburb of Basaksehir. A new eight-strong board took control and looked to sidestep the issues experienced by their rivals. “The biggest difference is that we are a joint-stock company, an ownership model like that of Premier League clubs,” Erogut says. “Other big clubs here are foundation models, supporter-owned. But our management makes it easier to take fast decisions and make long-term plans, because you don’t deal with elections. We are a new club; the others have 100 years of history, massive fanbases, big media power. It is good to be competing with them.” They trail second-placed Besiktas only on goal difference and, after Fenerbahce in fourth drew 0-0 on Saturday at home to the leaders, Galatasaray, can cut the gap at the top to one point. Before a tail‑off over the last month, they were leading. The battle for fans is less of a contest; numbers inside their Fatih Terim Stadium have swelled but still average around 6,000. That is nothing compared to the backing their peers command but they are counting on a new generation to catch the bug. “It isn’t easy as they get their football heritage from their fathers, uncles and grandfathers,” Erogut says. “But we are investing in them. We go to high schools, invite them here for stadium tours, and we are in a good way. But we need to wait six or seven years for these young kids to be diehard supporters.” The idea is for players such as Adebayor, Clichy and the January loan signing Arda Turan to work alongside academy-raised products who will arise under the tuition of the long-serving manager Abdullah Avci. The club has no debts and stresses its financial model – bolstered by European appearances, which eventually brought Europa League group stage football this season – is sustainable. It is an attractive package, perhaps more so given the corruption scandals that have engulfed other Turkish clubs over the years, but suspicion still prevails in some quarters. A common charge is that Istanbul Basaksehir are favoured by the national government, a perception reinforced when Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the current Turkish president and a former mayor of Istanbul, played in the first match at the Fatih Terim Stadium. “He’s only been to one of our games this season, in the Champions League qualifiers,” Erogut says. “He goes to other games as well – Fenerbahce games, Besiktas games. I know he likes us but he’s a Fenerbahce fan from childhood.” The club’s stance is that they would rather help themselves and Erogut says that, to continue their rise, foreign investment will be necessary. “There is some interest from the far east but it’s not been completed yet,” he says. “But maybe we will be the first club in the country to have this kind of investment. It would be a good benchmark for Turkey as well, and it could come from us. We started like a local team, then we became a nationally known team, now we’re becoming an international team and for the last level we need to become a global team.” In November, an Adebayor hat‑trick helped Istanbul Basaksehir beat Galatasaray 5-1. Anything close to a repeat could edge their ambitions closer to reality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/mar/17/conor-murray-gives-ireland-reason-to-dream-of-making-it-big-in-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T19:59:07Z","webTitle":"Conor Murray gives Ireland reason to dream of making it big in Japan | Gerard Meagher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/17/conor-murray-gives-ireland-reason-to-dream-of-making-it-big-in-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/17/conor-murray-gives-ireland-reason-to-dream-of-making-it-big-in-japan","fields":{"headline":"Conor Murray gives Ireland reason to dream of making it big in Japan","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"With the clock turned red, even the heavens were smiling on Ireland, a flurry of snow serving as the ticker tape to their coronation. Victory was theirs, and fully warranted, after emphatic confirmation that it is Joe Schmidt’s side who are best equipped to challenge New Zealand at next year’s World Cup. For a while they were handing out whiskey to travellers at London’s Waterloo station but this was never an occasion for which Irish nerves needed settling. They came in their droves – the IRFU was officially given 5,000 tickets but that was tripled at least – and, while Twickenham was pockmarked green all over, the South stand in particular was rattled to the rafters by the St Patrick’s Day celebrations. England’s fortress was not so much ransacked as razed to the ground and it owed much to Conor Murray’s peerless authority. Murray has a habit of rising to occasions, and here he was magnificent. Aaron Smith may be able to fire a quicker pass but there is no better all-round scrum-half in the world than Murray. Ben Youngs has been missed a great deal more than expected by England but Danny Care and Richard Wigglesworth are No 9s of repute and neither could hold a candle to Ireland’s scrum-half. Throw in Jonathan Sexton’s surgical precision, CJ Stander’s power and the hard-edged second-rows Iain Henderson and James Ryan and it becomes clearer why this is the third Ireland team in history to clinch the grand slam. The last time they achieved it – in 2009 – Ryan was in the crowd, a 12-year-old supporter at the Millennium Stadium. Nine years on and he, along with the excellent Dan Leavy, is the embodiment of these bright young things at Ireland’s disposal. He has played only one fewer game for Ireland than he has for Leinster and he is yet to experience defeat for either. Rory Best had spoken eloquently before the match, acknowledging the size of the occasion and urging his side to embrace it. He also told of the importance of quietening the crowd and after the first quarter the sound of silence echoed round Twickenham. England were no better than they had been in Paris and their errors allowed Ireland to take command while Schmidt has this green machine particularly well oiled. This is a side extremely comfortable in its own skin. After one slightly fortuitous try – and another excellent one – the period that followed was perhaps Ireland’s most impressive. With Peter O’Mahony in the sin-bin England got themselves on the board through Elliot Daly but the visitors were unerring in their response. Sexton was off the field for a head injury assessment yet Murray marshalled his forwards round the park superbly. Twice they went through endless phases – the kind of continuity England can at present only dream about. Indeed, Murray was purring and it was his sumptuous pass that allowed Jacob Stockdale to kick ahead and dive on the ball for his seventh try of the competition. It came laced with irony, too. The in-goal area had been extended, as well as the lines painted blue, in anticipation of the snow, at Jones’s request and Stockdale would have run out of room ordinarily. Jones spoke last week of how “the game does not love us at the moment” and this was precisely what he meant. With more than 20 minutes remaining Jordan Larmour came on and, while England salvaged a modest amount of pride late on, The Fields of Athenry was by that stage in full cry around the stadium, Ireland comfortably keeping their hosts at arm’s length. Before the game the New Zealand Herald had paid tribute to Schmidt’s influence in charge of Ireland, complete with a cartoon in which he was mocked up as a leprechaun. It can now be said without question that his Ireland side are contenders for next year’s pot of gold in Japan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/17/winter-migratory-birds-wildlife-cold","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T21:09:54Z","webTitle":"Fears for wildlife as migratory birds fly in to UK snowstorm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/17/winter-migratory-birds-wildlife-cold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/17/winter-migratory-birds-wildlife-cold","fields":{"headline":"Fears for wildlife as migratory birds fly in to UK snowstorm","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The arrival of bitterly cold weather – only a few days before the vernal equinox, the official start of spring in Britain – could have serious consequences for wildlife, experts have warned. The snow and biting winds, which led to the cancellation of flights and disrupted road travel, will reduce the insect population, creating food shortages for birds and other creatures. Migratory birds, such as the wheatear and the sand martin, are now arriving in Britain in numbers, the experts have pointed out, and will need food after long flights from the south. Insects are their principal source of nourishment. In addition, there had been sightings of butterflies and bees making the most of last week’s warm weather, and these could be badly affected by the sudden arrival of cold and snow. Frozen lakes and ponds could also affect frogs and other amphibians, say wildlife experts. “There are also fears for ravens, tawny owls and blackbirds who have already begun nesting,” said Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge. Forecasters said snow, feeding in from the North Sea, started to spread westwards across to the Midlands and parts of Wales on Saturday. By the end of the day, most places had seen some snow, with gusty winds bringing bitterly cold temperatures. More snow is expected on Sunday, especially in south-west England, where as much as 25cm could fall on higher ground. Travel disruption is likely, rural communities could become cut off, vehicles may be stranded and power cuts could occur, forecasters have warned. “It will be bitterly cold with some snow for many places over the weekend,” said Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill. “There are some very strong winds, meaning it could feel as low as -7C or -8C for some people.” The arrival of the cold weather has brought a repeat of the disruption caused by the “beast from the east” storm that hit Britain two weeks ago. However, Met Office officials said they expected this weekend’s chaos would be over by Tuesday. An amber weather warning for snow and ice was put in place across north-west England, Yorkshire and the Midlands, as well as London, the south-east, and the east of England, while a less severe yellow warning for snow and ice was issued for most of the rest of the country. The lowest temperature on Saturday morning was recorded near Carter Bar on the Scotland-England border, at -2.6C. Network Rail said it was going to run empty trains overnight to help keep the network clear of snow. However, it warned that disruption was possible. Motorists have been urged to be prepared before setting out on journeys this weekend, with Highways England advising them to avoid trans-Pennine roads if possible. Highways England’s head of road safety, Richard Leonard, said gritter lorry drivers would be working “around the clock”, though he also stressed it was important for drivers to take care. “Make sure you keep your distance and reduce your speed if you need to travel, because, even in conditions that seem normal and when the snow is not settling, it can be slippery if ice patches have formed or where fresh salt has not been worked into the carriageway.” Most cancellations at Heathrow on Saturday were on short-haul flights, but British Airways said some transatlantic flights had been affected. Lufthansa, Aer Lingus, TAP Air Portugal and KLM also made cancellations. “While this weekend’s weather may result in minor delays and some airlines consolidating flights, significant disruption at Heathrow is not currently expected,” said a spokesman. “We are working closely with our on-site Met Office to monitor the further snowfall expected throughout the weekend. As always, we advise passengers to check their flight status with their airline before coming to the airport.” In the north of England, strong winds led to the cancellation of the annual Boat Race of the North, which sees rowing teams from Durham and Newcastle universities compete against each other on the River Tyne, the BBC reported. Conditions on the A1 left the Durham team unable to transport its boats on their long trailers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/17/florida-bridge-collapse-safety-meeting-crack-no-concerns","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T04:24:17Z","webTitle":"Crack in Florida bridge deemed no concern just hours before collapse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/17/florida-bridge-collapse-safety-meeting-crack-no-concerns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/17/florida-bridge-collapse-safety-meeting-crack-no-concerns","fields":{"headline":"Crack in Florida bridge deemed no concern just hours before collapse","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hours before a pedestrian bridge at Florida International University collapsed on Thursday, killing six people, engineers met the construction manager, state transportation officials and university representatives to discuss a crack on the structure. The Miami-based university detailed the two-hour meeting in a statement released early on Saturday. It said the session included a technical presentation by Figg Bridge Engineers that “concluded there were no safety concerns and the crack did not compromise the structural integrity of the bridge”. The meeting ended at 11am. Three hours later, the bridge fell. The Florida department of transportation (FDot) announced late on Friday that an engineer hired by the university left a voicemail message with the state agency two days before the collapse, seeking to draw attention to the crack. In the call, which was not picked up until after collapse and has been released to the public, engineer W Denney Pate mentioned “some cracking that’s been observed on the north end” of the bridge but said he did not think it was a safety issue. The state transportation department also said one of its consultants attended a meeting with the FIU bridge team hours before the collapse. It did not say the crack in the bridge had been discussed. The National Transportation Safety Board chief investigator, Robert Accetta, said on Friday it was too soon to tell if cracks played a role in the bridge collapse. “I would have to say that a crack in the bridge does not necessarily mean it’s unsafe,” he said. University officials have said engineers had performed stress tests to determine the “resiliency of the concrete” in the bridge. Late on Saturday police said that they believed they had recovered all the bodies of the victims of the collapse. Juan Perez, Miami-Dade police chief, told news media that they had recovered all five bodies of people in vehicles crushed under the bridge. A sixth person died at the hospital. While police believed all victims had been accounted for, they nevertheless said the search and rescue was continuing. One victim’s uncle raged against what he called the “complete incompetence” and “colossal failure” that allowed people to drive on the six-lane highway beneath the unfinished concrete span. “Why they had to build this monstrosity in the first place to get children across the street?” said Joe Smitha, whose niece, Alexa Duran, was crushed. “Then they decided to stress test this bridge while traffic was running underneath it?” Authorities have not released Duran’s name, but her family has said she died. The FIU freshman was studying political science. In an emailed statement on Saturday night, the Florida International University president, Mark Rosenberg, said it would hold a moment’s silence for the victims at 1:47pm on Monday – the same time that the bridge went down."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/17/hollywood-condemns-terry-gilliam-for-metoo-comments-mob-rule-weinstein","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T17:18:29Z","webTitle":"Hollywood condemns Terry Gilliam for #MeToo comments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/17/hollywood-condemns-terry-gilliam-for-metoo-comments-mob-rule-weinstein","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/17/hollywood-condemns-terry-gilliam-for-metoo-comments-mob-rule-weinstein","fields":{"headline":"Hollywood condemns Terry Gilliam for #MeToo comments","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The film director Terry Gilliam has come under fire from Hollywood actors and directors for comparing the #MeToo movement to “mob rule”. The former Monty Python member suggested the anti-sexual harassment campaign had led to a “world of victims” in an interview with Agence France-Presse. While describing Harvey Weinstein as a “monster”, he added that the disgraced producer was only exposed because he was such an “asshole”. Gilliam said: “Harvey opened the door for a few people, a night with Harvey - that’s the price you pay. “I think some people did very well out of meeting with Harvey and others didn’t. The ones who did, knew what they were doing. These are adults; we are talking about adults with a lot of ambition.” He continued: “It’s like when mob rule takes over, the mob is out there, they are carrying their torches and they are going to burn down Frankenstein’s castle. It’s crazy how simplified things are becoming.” Judd Apatow, who has directed films including The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Trainwreck, described Gilliam’s comments as “idiotic and dangerous”. “He wasn’t in those rooms. He doesn’t know how aggressive and violent and terrifying he [Weinstein] was. Who is he to say it was some sort of offered deal? He should be ashamed of himself,” Apatow tweeted. “I think Terry Gilliam is spewing nonsense. These were not transactions. His comments about that aspect of this are shameful.” His comments were retweeted by the actor Rosanna Arquette, while the comedian Sarah Silverman called on the 77-year-old Gilliam to understand empathy: The actor Ellen Barkin tweeted: “Terry Gilliam, you talk too much”, adding: Gilliam also told AFP that power had always been abused in the film world. “I don’t think Hollywood will change. Power takes advantage, it always does.” He added that the great irony was that despite the \u001d#MeToo movement being in full flow, “a self-confessed pussy-grabber is the president of the US and is just walking around” unchallenged."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/17/sergei-skripal-yulia-expelling-russian-diplomats-vladimir-putin-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T21:00:44Z","webTitle":"Theresa May’s response to Vladimir Putin’s campaign against Russian dissidents living in Britain | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/17/sergei-skripal-yulia-expelling-russian-diplomats-vladimir-putin-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/17/sergei-skripal-yulia-expelling-russian-diplomats-vladimir-putin-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on Theresa May’s response to Russia’s campaign against dissidents in Britain","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Is Vladimir Putin engaged in a long-running, murderous and ongoing campaign to silence Russian defectors, emigres and dissidents living in the UK? That is perhaps the most pressing of many questions facing the government after Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with a nerve agent in Salisbury. Russia’s retaliatory expulsion of 23 diplomats, announced on Saturday, was as unjustified as it was expected. Its vindictive and unwarranted decision to go further and shut down the British Council highlighted the Putin regime’s fear of open societies and disregard for its citizens’ best interests. It has been suggested that the attempt to murder the Skripals was timed to whip up nationalistic fervour and boost Putin’s presidential re-election bid. Another theory is that the use of an illegal, highly toxic nerve agent, whose detection was certain, was intended to humiliate Britain and send a message about the risks of confronting a Russia supposedly restored to great power status. It is also argued that Russia has been prematurely blamed and that the intelligence services may be surreptitiously pushing Britain into a new cold war, just as they ostensibly pushed us into Iraq. All these hypotheses fall wide of the mark. Putin’s re-election is not in doubt; he effectively fixed the result in advance. The west is well aware of Moscow’s revived ambitions; it needs no reminding. And in terms of might, reach and influence, Putin’s Russia is a sickly shadow of the former Soviet Union. He is the capo of a corrupt rogue regime, not the leader of a once proud superpower. And Putin has form. What now seems most likely is that the Salisbury atrocity was part of a wider campaign against Russian nationals in Britain who Putin personally regards as traitors or enemies. One aim is to silence them, by whatever means. Another aim is to send an intimidatory message to Russians in Russia that challenging the regime is a potentially life-threatening activity. The suspected murder in London last week of Nikolai Glushkov, a long-time Putin critic, must now be added to a list of 14 suspicious deaths of Russians in Britain, first compiled in a BuzzFeed investigation last year. Belatedly, the government has acceded to calls from Labour’s Yvette Cooper, among others, to investigate possible involvement of the Russian state or state-sponsored assassins. The exceptional significance of the Skripal attack cannot be overstated. It involved the use of a chemical weapon on European soil for the first time since 1945. It potentially endangered thousands of British citizens. It showed blatant disregard for international law and the UN charter. And because the only really plausible, credible explanation is that it was ordered or approved by Putin and his cronies, it represents a direct challenge by the Russian state not only to Britain but to all law-abiding countries. Yet the growing suspicion that the Skripal affair is but one incident in a continuing succession of lethal outrages dating back to the 2006 murder by Russian agents of Alexander Litvinenko raises the problem to an even higher level of seriousness. An obvious, urgent question is: who’s next? It is right that counter-terrorism officers are now reportedly talking to Russian exiles about their safety. Theresa May’s government bears an enormous responsibility. The expulsion of Russian diplomats was the easy bit. May and her ministers must ensure that no further killings take place on British soil; that everything is done to demonstrate, incontrovertibly, whether Russia attacked the Skripals, and that the correct technical procedures are followed through the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the UN; that effective measures are finally taken to stop the flow of dirty Russian money through London; and that key allies, notably France and the US, which initially questioned Britain’s case, do not go wobbly again. Britain cannot manage this crisis alone. It needs the help of its friends and allies if it is to force Putin to back off."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/17/swansea-city-tottenham-hotspur-fa-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T14:23:53Z","webTitle":"Christian Eriksen fires Tottenham past Swansea and into FA Cup semi-finals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/17/swansea-city-tottenham-hotspur-fa-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/17/swansea-city-tottenham-hotspur-fa-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Christian Eriksen fires Tottenham past Swansea and into FA Cup semi-finals","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"On days like this there is no need for Tottenham Hotspur to worry about how they will cope without Harry Kane on the pitch. Christian Eriksen demonstrated why he is so much more than a member of the supporting cast as he scored another two splendid goals, taking his tally for the season to 11, to ease Spurs into the FA Cup semi-finals at the expense of a Swansea City side that never turned up. It was that sort of afternoon for Spurs, who were as comfortable as it gets as they strolled into the last four of the FA Cup for the second year in succession. Eriksen accepted the freedom of the Liberty Stadium given to him by Swansea to score his seventh and eighth goals against the Welsh club in 10 matches – one would have thought they would have learned their lesson by now – and Érik Lamela effortlessly stroked home Tottenham’s second. In truth the margin of victory could easily have been wider, such was the chasm in quality between the two teams. At times it was embarrassingly one-sided, with Swansea so passive and Spurs utterly dominant as they kept the ball for long periods and attacked with menace. Mauricio Pochettino’s side registered 24 attempts on goal compared with Swansea’s three, enjoyed 75% of possession and had the game wrapped up with the best part of half an hour remaining when Eriksen scored his second. The Dane was a joy to watch – he had another superb effort tipped on to the crossbar – and Swansea found themselves overwhelmed in midfield, unable to stem the tide of blue shirts that poured forward again and again. Lamela, playing behind Son Heung-min, who was given the nod up front ahead of Fernando Llorente, also enjoyed himself as Spurs made the most of the space afforded to them by a severely depleted Swansea side. “I think we fully deserved the victory,” said Pochettino. “Christian and Lamela shined, of course. But I think the whole team was very good.” The only source of frustration for Pochettino was the use of VAR, which came into play when Son was flagged offside after scoring in the first half. Even after watching the incident again and again it was hard to call but the original decision was eventually allowed to stand. “It’s a nightmare,” Pochettino said. “I feel so sorry for the people trying to use that system. I think I prefer it when the ref and assistant make mistakes, rather than to wait three or four minutes for things.” While Spurs can now look forward to a semi-final at Wembley, their temporary home, next month, Swansea’s focus must return to the grind of the relegation battle and trying to preserve their Premier League status. This was only their third defeat in 17 games since Carlos Carvalhal was appointed manager but it was a chastening experience and with the exception of Alfie Mawson, who has just been called up to the England squad, it was hard to think of anyone who emerged with credit. Tammy Abraham, who started up front in place of the suspended Jordan Ayew, squandered a gilt-edged chance to pull a goal back within 60 seconds of the restart, when he headed straight at Michel Vorm from six yards out, and that moment felt symptomatic of his and Swansea’s afternoon. Spurs were already two goals to the good at that point, with Eriksen having opened the scoring in the 11th minute. Swansea’s defending left much to be desired as they allowed Eriksen, after swapping passes with Lamela, to stride forward towards the edge of the penalty area without coming under any pressure. Yet there was still much to admire about the way the midfielder curled a lovelyleft-foot shot beyond Kristoffer Nordfeldt. Tottenham’s second goal was not dissimilar and this time it was Lamela who did the damage. Running on to a pass from Moussa Sissoko, the Argentinian skipped away from a half-hearted Tom Carroll challenge and, with Kyle Bartley backing off, coolly placed a low shot past the stranded Nordfeldt and into the bottom corner. Eric Dier’s long-range effort was expertly clawed behind by Nordfeldt after Abraham had missed that chance but the goalkeeper was powerless to prevent Eriksen from drilling home his second to turn Swansea’s first FA Cup quarter-final since 1964 into a damp squib. “There came a storm today,” Carvalhal said. “But after a storm there will be good weather.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/18/adrien-silva-leicester-chelsea-fa-cup-fifa-sporting-lisbon","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T08:00:02Z","webTitle":"Adrien Silva: ‘I will never understand Fifa’s decision.

We’re talking seconds’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Adrien Silva is recalling when he was banned from playing after a Premier League club tried to sign him, only this episode has nothing to do with Leicester City and the deadline-day saga that ended with an international footballer running round a field to keep fit between talking to lawyers. Silva is rowing back to 2005 instead, when he was 15 and José Mourinho tried to talk him into joining Chelsea along with two other young Sporting Lisbon players. “It was a very strange moment and I was so young,” Silva says. “To have this club approach me, especially when Mourinho comes to talk to you … at this time, we didn’t know why he came. But when the club wants something, they do everything. He came to see me in Portugal and we went there, to Chelsea, to see the training ground. Then we came back and it was a big, big situation with Sporting.” Sporting were furious and, as well as making a complaint to Fifa about Chelsea, refused to allow Silva to train and play for them for two months. The other teenagers, Fábio Ferreira and Ricardo Fernandes, joined Chelsea and were both released four years later without playing a game. Silva, however, spoke to his parents and chose a different path, harbouring concerns that Chelsea “wanted to win now and not wait for young players”. That he went on to make 241 appearances for Sporting and become a Portugal international suggests he made the right call. “Thanks to God,” says Silva, smiling. It is a timely story on the eve of Sunday’s FA Cup quarter-final against Chelsea but all the more so in the context of what happened last year, when Silva faced another enforced absence, after Fifa rejected Leicester’s application to register the midfielder because his £22m move from Sporting had missed the transfer deadline by 14 seconds. Barred from playing until January and initially prevented from training with the Premier League club, Silva spent six weeks living with his agent at the Marriott hotel in Leicester, where they exhausted every avenue, including taking his case to the court of arbitration for sport, to try to overturn a ruling that left him angry and upset. “I had some injuries in my career but then you know why you don’t play and that’s part of football, so you can accept it,” Silva says. “But this situation wasn’t correct. It wasn’t correct because I was able to play physically and I didn’t do anything wrong to make this situation. I will never understand the decision of Fifa – even after Leicester had tried everything to change it. There is no protection for the players in this situation. The players are the most important, so why don’t [Fifa] think about that and make some exception? OK, if it is so many hours [after the deadline], but we’re talking about seconds here. So I think it was a very poor decision.” This is Silva’s first national newspaper interview since joining Leicester and one of the things that comes across during an enjoyable hour in his company is that he was just as confused as everyone else when the window closed. Told that the media did not know for a while whether he was a Leicester or a Sporting player, Silva shakes his head, grins and replies: “Me neither.” Sporting, however, appeared keen to provide some clarity. Within days Bruno de Carvalho, Sporting’s president, said: “The transfer of Adrien is already completed. Hopefully Leicester find a solution for him.” Those comments gave the impression that Sporting were washing their hands of any potential problems and, with that in mind, it is interesting to know whether Silva felt any frustration with how his former club acted. “Not with Sporting. With the president. And that’s different,” Silva says. “He tried, I think, to protect his club. But in football it’s more important when you represent a club to protect the human or the player.” For all his annoyance with Fifa Silva admits to fearing the worst as soon as the window closed. “But after Leicester and my lawyers told me that we could make an appeal, I got my hopes up and I tried to keep my head right,” he explains. “I trained alone at the gym and on a field to try to keep my physical condition because I wasn’t allowed to train with the team.” Establishing exactly why he found himself in this position is not easy, other than to say that negotiations were extremely complicated, with Silva making many concessions to Sporting in order to get the deal done. Leicester were committed to completing the transfer come what may and always maintained that the paperwork was uploaded on time, yet Fifa argued otherwise and refused to allow Silva to fast-track his appeal through Cas. So who, ultimately, is responsible? “We still don’t know,” Silva replies. “For me, I think Fifa the most. But I’m not worried about it now.” There was one thought that troubled him more than any other as the fiasco rumbled on. Silva loves representing his country and was part of the Portugal team that defeated France to win Euro 2016. Suddenly he could see a World Cup on the horizon and his place in the squad in jeopardy. “Every day that was on my mind,” he says. “And that makes it worse. When I think about it, it was the worst moment for this to happen.” In the end Silva decided he needed to have a joke at his own expense, to keep his spirits up if nothing else. When Leicester asked what shirt number he wanted, it was the perfect opportunity. “I was talking with my agent, Pedro, who was here with me for a month and a half at the hotel, supporting me every day – my wife and children couldn’t come because I didn’t have a home – and I said: ‘We have to play with this situation. Why not No 14?’” The long-awaited debut, wearing that number, arrived on 1 January – Craig Shakespeare, the manager who signed him, had departed two months earlier – and Silva was given a rapturous reception as he came off the bench. “So many things were going through my mind,” he says. “But the main thought was: just play football. It’s my passion and it’s such a simple thing to do. But that day I felt like I wanted to eat the field!” Silva breaks into laughter after making that last remark and it feels good to see him in a much happier place. On the pitch, he admits, he is still striving to get to his best but life is coming together in other respects. Margarida, his wife, gave birth to a baby girl last Sunday and four days later Silva celebrated his 29th birthday with a recall to the Portugal squad. Margarida, Silva says, was a huge support to him throughout her pregnancy – he smiles as he checks that the word “hormonal” is correct in English – and he wants to express his gratitude to the rest of his family as well as a couple of players. “Matty James and Andy King – they helped me in every way. They kept pushing me when some days I was down. So they have been very good friends during those months.” Sporting thanked Silva for his services by inviting him back to the stadium in October for a special tribute to a player who joined them at the age of 12, when he moved 400km away from his family in a country where he was still learning the language after growing up in France. “All those years came into my mind so it was very emotional,” says Silva, who was in tears on the pitch. “Sporting made me into a player but they also made me into a man, and they will always have a special place in my heart.” It has obviously been a tough time for Silva and it is hardly surprising to hear him say that the deadline-day mix-up was the worst moment of his career. Yet he also sounds full of positivity as he looks to the future and pictures a perfect finale to the season. “I hope we can get past Chelsea and reach the FA Cup final,” Silva says, smiling. “And to go to the World Cup after, that would be the best way for it to end for me.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/17/donald-trump-tillerson-pompeo-mcmaster-bolton-iran-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T14:34:38Z","webTitle":"Trump's firings signal hawkish turn on North Korea and Iran","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/17/donald-trump-tillerson-pompeo-mcmaster-bolton-iran-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/17/donald-trump-tillerson-pompeo-mcmaster-bolton-iran-north-korea","fields":{"headline":"Trump's firings signal hawkish turn on North Korea and Iran","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The end, when it comes to a job in the Trump administration, can be messy and brutal. The secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, was fired while returning from a gruelling Africa tour not long after the death of his father. When he complained through an aide about the summary manner of his dismissal, the White House stuck the boot in, telling journalists the 66 year-old former Texan oil executive had been fired by telephone while sitting on the toilet, suffering from a stomach bug, according to the Daily Beast. On Friday, the deputy FBI director, Andrew McCabe, was fired two days before he would have qualified for a full pension. The official reason was that he had talked to the press and then not been forthcoming about it. McCabe said he was targeted because he is a potential witness in the special counsel investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump election campaign and the Kremlin. Donald Trump celebrated McCabe’s firing on Twitter, calling it a “great day for the hardworking men and women of the FBI”. Tillerson and McCabe had to endure months of public speculation about their job security, fuelled by unattributable White House briefings. The same is happening now to the national security adviser, HR McMaster, widely reported to be the next on the chopping block. The constant speculation and uncertainty is all part of the Trump circus, a reminder that although his property business resulted in repeated bankruptcies, he was successful as a reality show host. There are, however, distinctions between Trump as ringmaster on The Apprentice and President Trump. One of them is that in real life, he never fires his subordinates in person but has the news delivered by an aide, preferably when the recipient is a long way from Washington. More importantly, the carnival is no longer contained within a showbusiness bubble. It ripples across the world, with very real and far-reaching consequences. Trump has claimed the constant churn has a purpose, to create an administration in his own image. He told reporters this past week he was finally “close to having the cabinet and other things that I want”. Trump is replacing top officials who were hired because of their private sector reputations with people who have less stature but are more loyal and more attuned to the president’s gut instincts. Thus Gary Cohn, a former president of Goldman Sachs who left after Trump announced steel tariffs, is being supplanted by a television commentator, Larry Kudlow, who is more enthusiastic about America First protectionism. In foreign policy, the new era looks to be more confrontational. At the state department, Tillerson’s job is being taken by the CIA director, Mike Pompeo, who is considerably more hawkish that his predecessor on Iran and North Korea. Pompeo, a former hyper-partisan Republican congressman, is adept at echoing the president’s thinking and delivering morning Oval Office intelligence briefings in a lively enough manner, and with sufficiently clear graphics, to keep the president’s attention. One of the candidates to replace McMaster is John Bolton, a Bush-era hawk who has insistently advocated bombing North Korea and wielding military might elsewhere in the world to further US interests rather than get bogged down in multilateral agreements. The chill of the new era was immediately felt in Europe. On Thursday, two days after Tillerson’s dismissal, senior diplomats from the US, Europe, Russia, China and Iran gathered in Vienna for a discussion on the future of the nuclear deal they signed in 2015. Three years ago, the deal was a cause for celebration, heralded by all of its signatories as a major diplomatic achievement that had tightly circumscribed Iran’s nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions. In the group picture on Thursday, all the participants looked grim. Trump has made no secret that he wants to kill the deal, in part because Obama saw it as his signature achievement. Tillerson had been a critic of the agreement but had argued for its retention, mostly because its collapse would trigger a slide back to nuclear confrontation in the Middle East. Trump cited differences over the Iran nuclear as one of the motives for getting rid of Tillerson. “I wanted to either break it or do something and he felt a little bit differently,” the president said. “So we were not really thinking the same. With Mike, Mike Pompeo, we have a very similar thought process.” James Carafano, vice-president of the Heritage Foundation, said: “Tillerson wanted to preserve the deal but the instructions were ‘Fix it in the way I want or we walk away from the deal’, and Pompeo will do that.” Carafano said Tillerson’s firing demonstrated Trump’s increased confidence in his own instincts in foreign policy. Tillerson and other top aides told Trump his decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem would spark an eruption of unrest across the Middle East in December. The actual response was muted. “The one thing that Trump may have figured, he does a lot of this stuff, and there are bad outcomes and they are not necessarily apocalyptic outcomes,” said Daniel Drezner, an international politics professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Similarly, the president was warned that his bellicose rhetoric on North Korea risked triggering a violent backlash from the Pyongyang regime. Instead Kim Jong-un has invited him to talks. “I think we are entering a phase where [Trump] is becoming more confident about his foreign policy views,” said Julianne Smith, a former senior national security council official now at the Centre for a New American Security. “It’s clear he is proud of what he views as a victory of securing a meeting with the North Koreans. He thinks that is because of his own aggressive posture.” A Trump-Kim summit offers the potential of a dramatic breakthrough but carries a high risk of failure, if it turns out the North Korean leader is not cowed by threats and sanctions but emboldened by the development of a nuclear arsenal. A failure to reach agreement could lead both leaders to feel slighted and goaded into raising the stakes. And where Tillerson was a voice of restraint, Pompeo, an advocate of regime change in Pyongyang, is more likely to encourage brinkmanship. Ultimately Trump will have to decide whether he is ready to use the weapons he has been brandishing, with all the implications that would have for his America First aspirations at home. Some Washington conservatives believe Trump would ultimately balk at starting a new conflict, and for the same reason may ultimately not choose Bolton as national security adviser. “He likes Bolton but Trump doesn’t want to bomb North Korea,” said a friend of Bolton familiar with some of the negotiations inside the White House. “John’s an offensive realist … and that’s not Trump. Trump is a defensive realist,” the friend said, adding: “John likes to get his way and will argue to the death to get his way. The president is not going to stand for that.” Trump’s honeymoon with Pompeo may also not last long. It is hard to find hawks in Washington who make an exception for Russia, and the incoming secretary of state has a long record of taking a firm stance towards Moscow. Whatever the reasons for Trump’s soft spot for Vladimir Putin, it is something which he can only trust his family to put into practice. Relatives are the only real constant in the Trump entourage, with an increasing grip on foreign policy. His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has sway over decisions in the Middle East and beyond. And when the South Korean foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, discovered this week she would not be meeting Tillerson as planned in an upcoming Washington visit, she was told she would be sitting down instead with a key adviser: Ivanka Trump."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/17/living-with-motor-neurone-disease-mnd-helen-carmichael","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T14:09:30Z","webTitle":"'My body was rapidly unravelling': living with motor neurone disease","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/17/living-with-motor-neurone-disease-mnd-helen-carmichael","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/17/living-with-motor-neurone-disease-mnd-helen-carmichael","fields":{"headline":"'My body was rapidly unravelling': living with motor neurone disease","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I was sitting on the commode getting washed on Wednesday morning when I heard the news about the death of Stephen Hawking. Although, like him, I have an impressive case of motor neurone disease (MND) and can no longer walk nor talk, I never really felt we had the same illness: his long life, not to mention his genius and academic career, seemed to put him in a different category to me. It was still a shock, though, so maybe I had identified with him more closely than I thought. I was diagnosed with MND in May last year, 16 months after the fingers on my left hand started getting mysteriously stiff and a year from my first visit to the GP. This is entirely normal with MND, which is tricky to diagnose, but the months of inconclusive tests are horribly stressful. My body was rapidly unravelling, yet I still had to try to negotiate my life and maintain some semblance of authority as a secondary school classics teacher. To the anxious newcomer, MND presents an extremely unappetising vision of the future. Media coverage tends to be quite sensationalised, especially when dealing with people arguing for euthanasia. Journalists often focus voyeuristically on the horrors of the physical symptoms, which can make researching the illness quite a traumatic business. This, in addition to the unpleasant fact that for my generation “spastic” was the playground insult of choice, made the months leading up to my diagnosis by far the most difficult and stressful part of the experience so far. I have been attempting to reclaim the word spastic, as spasticity is one of my chief symptoms, but it still provokes shock and denial. Trying to keep pace with my rapidly deteriorating limbs was a challenge: I felt that MND kept moving the goalposts unfairly. I discovered the brilliant invention of a device called a key turner, which spared me the impossible task of putting the key in the lock, but soon I was unable to raise my arm enough to use it. Social services installed grab-rails around my house, but it wasn’t long before I couldn’t open my fingers enough to grab them. Lastly, a raised toilet seat preserved my independence for a while, but eventually my weakened thigh muscles banished me to a commode and a hoist. It was my friends, colleagues and family who supported me during this time. We developed a kind of dance to get me out of cars, everyone developed their spoon feeding and nose-wiping skills and I learned that the friends and family members who you want in your life are the ones who will unflinchingly help you get up off the loo and pull your pants up. My lovely pupils also played an important part as they willingly got into the habit of carrying my books, logging on to my laptop and occasionally teaching their own lessons if I was having a meltdown. Thanks, boys – you are a kind and classy bunch. Finally, my employers were unbelievably sympathetic and made all kinds of thoughtful adjustments to my working life until the terrible day when I was declared unfit for work and embarked on my new career as a professional invalid. As my speech slurred into a spastic sludge and I collapsed into a wheelchair I found that in the eyes of the world, my IQ halved and I ceased to be an adult. People started speaking to me loudly and clearly and became prone to murmuring “bless” as I rolled past. My shoulder gets patted and my cheek and hand are stroked; on occasion, people ask “how is she?” right in front of me, and once someone patted my arm and told me I’d done really well after I had performed the astonishing feat of drinking a cup of tea. I’m no Stephen Hawking but I’m far from stupid and I find this kind of patronising attitude utterly enraging and dispiriting. My life has been saved – in a manner of speaking – by my Smartbox, a nifty little computer with a clever voice synthesiser which allows me to “talk” to people. I control it with a mouse attached to my glasses and it enables me to access the internet and change the world through the writing of my blog. It’s difficult to respond to a prognosis of “about a year”: people with terminal illnesses often write that they were inspired by their diagnosis to maximise the remainder of their time and to purge themselves of evil or petty thoughts. I have had no such revelation nor, sadly, have I received a burst of divine wisdom from the jaws of death: I just bumble on in the same time-wasting manner as I have always lived. I feel I’m not really facing up to the truth of my situation, but I don’t know how to. I haven’t discussed it with my family either – how do you start a conversation like that? From a global perspective, I’m aware that I am in an enviable situation. I have enough to eat, my house seems unlikely to be shelled in the near future and I have access to excellent healthcare for free. And yet, global situation apart, it’s incredibly painful to mourn your life in advance. One of the hardest things is worrying about the effect it will have on my family. I have nightmares about one of my nieces or nephews cracking up with depression because of Auntie Helen’s death. Each one of their birthdays I forget, I know it’ll be the last time. Of course this thought makes me cry, but which of us can choose our own destiny?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/20/egypts-ghad-party-leader-makes-discreet-bid-for-presidency","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T17:01:54Z","webTitle":"'No puppet': last challenger in Egypt’s election says he's more than a veneer of democracy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/20/egypts-ghad-party-leader-makes-discreet-bid-for-presidency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/20/egypts-ghad-party-leader-makes-discreet-bid-for-presidency","fields":{"headline":"'No puppet': last challenger in Egypt’s election says he's more than a veneer of democracy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On the streets of downtown Cairo, there is little evidence that anyone is running against Abdel Fatah al-Sisi in Egypt’s presidential election. Even outside the headquarters of the Ghad party, whose leader, Mousa Mostafa Mousa, is the sole competitor against the incumbent president in next week’s vote, there are no posters of Mousa. Inside, however, there are floor-to-ceiling posters of the architect and longtime politician. Mousa tells the Guardian he is cautiously optimistic about his chances of beating Sisi, despite entering the race after every credible candidate was removed. “We entered with the aim of winning. How we win, it I don’t know; with what kind of votes, I don’t know,” he says. “I think I have a chance. Doesn’t mean I’m sure.” Mousa entered what remains a one-horse race at the very last minute, after five other candidates were jailed or otherwise prevented from running. Despite this, Mousa says he felt morally compelled to prevent the election from simply being a “referendum” on Sisi’s rule, and fends off criticism that he is simply there to give a veneer of democracy to elections Sisi is all but certain to win. “I’m no puppet. I’m a leader, in all things including my business,” he says. “Whoever wants a puppet could get one from the 104 political parties. He cannot make a puppet out of me, and everyone in this country knows that ... Puppet is an imaginary word,” he said. The evidence, however, suggests otherwise. Sisi won the 2014 election with 97% of the vote after coming to power following a popularly-backed military coup a year earlier. This year, candidates seeking to present a challenge to Sisi were unable to get on the ballot. The former prime minister Ahmed Shafiq was deported from the UAE and subsequently dropped out of the race, the former military chief-of-staff Sami Anan was arrested for allegedly entering the race illegally and Col Ahmed Konsowa was jailed for making a campaign video in military uniform. Both the leftist lawyer Khaled Ali and Anwar Sadat, the nephew of Egypt’s former president, pulled out of the race citing intimidation. Mousa was an ardent public supporter of the Egyptian president until the day he announced he would run. A screenshot of his Facebook page, circulated in the Egyptian press when he declared his candidacy, shows a pro-Sisi banner. “This is bullshit, it had nothing to do with me,” he says when asked about it. “This was a falsification. Did you see this banner in a computer or in reality? It’s a trick of Photoshop.” The impression that Mousa does not intend to challenge Sisi’s rule on the campaign trail is buoyed by his bland policy platform, which carefully avoids anything that could be interpreted as a criticism of the president’s previous term. It includes price controls for low-income citizens, reopening formerly shuttered factories, and a programme to fight congestion on the streets of Cairo. The 65-year-old also has a long history of government cooperation. A 2008 US government cable published by WikiLeaks describes a “violent clash” between Mousa’s Ghad party and the splinter Ghad al Thawra faction that ended with the torching of the party headquarters. Commenting on the incident, the author remarked on the strange absence of the police and that it was “unlikely that the pro-government Mousa would have marched on party headquarters without informing the Egyptian government of his intentions and obtaining at least tacit approval”. Since announcing his candidacy, Mousa has repeatedly refused to name the 20 members of parliament who reportedly endorsed him, allowing him to enter the race. He initially reported that he received roughly 47,000 endorsements – more than the 25,000 required to enter the race – which, he tells the Guardian, came from unofficial petitions among members of his centrist, pro-government party, which has 42,000 members. His party endorsed Sisi’s presidential bid just 10 days before he announced his candidacy. “Don’t get confused,” he says. “My party was endorsing Sisi before we decided to participate in the elections. We decided only to enter the campaign when we found everyone was thrown out.” Mousa says he is providing a real choice for Egyptian voters when they go to the polls on 26-28 March, although he adds that should Sisi win, he will gift his programme to the president. His reluctance to criticise Sisi is being misinterpreted, he says. “I’m not a naive a man who would enter into competition with the president and also support him, this is game playing,” says Mousa. “I would never tell people I’m supporting my competition – that would be a newcomer, not me.” His message has at least resonated with Ghad party supporters such as Mona Safey, who sat in the waiting room of the party headquarters expressing her joy at both candidates being on the ballot. Safey says that had Sisi been on the ballot alone, she would have happily voted for him – but she saw potential in both. “I can tell you that one of them is an army man, and the other is an economics man ... one is about power and the other one is about money,” she says. “We are blessed, I think Egypt is blessed now – we have something good, and something else good, what more do we want?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/19/marielle-franco-brazilian-political-activist-black-gay-single-mother-fearless-fighter-murder","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T18:18:04Z","webTitle":"Marielle Franco had to resist – no wonder she didn’t survive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/19/marielle-franco-brazilian-political-activist-black-gay-single-mother-fearless-fighter-murder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/19/marielle-franco-brazilian-political-activist-black-gay-single-mother-fearless-fighter-murder","fields":{"headline":"Marielle Franco had to resist – no wonder she didn’t survive","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"‘Being a black woman is to resist and survive all the time.” So said Marielle Franco, the Rio de Janeiro city councillor shot dead in a targeted assassination last week, just 18 months after she was elected. Franco was 38 years old. She was a black, gay, single mother from the Maré favela who stood up for poor people, LGBT people, black people and women. When her car was hit by nine bullets – four of which entered her skull, killing her instantly – she was on her way home from an event titled Young Black Women Who Are Changing Power Structures. This is what can and does befall such extraordinary women. And Franco was extraordinary. She was a fearless, charismatic and popular politician with integrity, operating in a country, characterised by president Michel Temer’s all-male, almost exclusively white cabinet, in which more than half the population is black, mixed race or female. No wonder she had to resist all the time. No wonder she did not survive. The world is at once shrinking and becoming more frightening, and the reverberations of such hateful and emblematic acts travel far and fast. So, too, does the response: tens of thousands turned out across Brazil to protest about the murder of Franco. Hundreds of thousands have pledged their refusal to forget in more than 30 languages using the hashtag #MarielleFrancoPresente. Franco was apparently the subject of more tweets (3.6m in 42 hours) than Dilma Rousseff, after the ex-Brazilian president’s impeachment. However, we can no longer shake our heads in barely disguised relief at the track records of “other” countries on human rights, political crisis, economic recession or even murder. Such atrocities happen here too: think of Jo Cox. And, wherever it happens, it is always as much about the hatred of women as it is about political ideology. It appears that Franco, like Cox, was a woman murdered for her beliefs. (In Franco’s case, you can also add race and sexuality to the list.) Now it feels as though all the threads are coming together: #MeToo, Time’s Up, the gender pay gap, structural racism, lack of diversity, and on and on it coils. Underpinning the vast and nebulous tangle is gross and endemic inequality. And, at the extreme end, the outcome is the destruction of a harbinger of hope like Marielle Franco."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/21/cambridge-analyticas-ruthless-bid-to-sway-the-vote-in-nigeria","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T19:00:02Z","webTitle":"Cambridge Analytica's ruthless bid to sway the vote in Nigeria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/cambridge-analyticas-ruthless-bid-to-sway-the-vote-in-nigeria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/cambridge-analyticas-ruthless-bid-to-sway-the-vote-in-nigeria","fields":{"headline":"Cambridge Analytica's ruthless bid to sway the vote in Nigeria","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If Britain hadn’t voted to leave the EU, and Trump hadn’t won the US election, it’s unlikely anyone outside Nigeria would have given a second thought to what went on during its presidential election campaign three years ago. But the 20/20 vision of hindsight casts a very different light on the events of early 2015, and a campaign that now seems to eerily prefigure what happened in the US a year later. Many of the same characters, some of the same tactics. At the heart of it all – data analytics company, SCL – the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. It had been hired by a rich Nigerian who supported the incumbent, President Goodluck Jonathan. “It was the kind of campaign that was our bread and butter,” says one ex-employee. “We’re employed by a billionaire who’s panicking at the idea of a change of government and who wants to spend big to make sure that doesn’t happen.” This was a standard variation on what SCL had done around the world for 30 years – this time, with a twist. Weaponising information to harm an opponent was standard methodology. It was a methodology honed and developed in the company’s defence and military work – the fifth dimension of warfare, defined by the US military as “information operations”. What was new, or at least new to those employees who have now spoken out, was bringing these techniques to the company’s election work. Seven individuals with close knowledge of the Nigeria campaign have described how Cambridge Analytica worked with people they believed were Israeli computer hackers. The sources – who spoke to the Observer over many months – said the company was looking for “kompromat” on Muhammadu Buhari – at the time, leader of the opposition. They said the hackers offered Cambridge Analytica access to private information about Buhari. Their testimony paints an extraordinary picture of how far a western company would contemplate going in an effort to undermine the democratic process in a country that already struggles to provide free and fair elections. Their claims are disputed by the company, which insists it did not take possession of or use any personal information for any purpose and did not use any “hacked or stolen data”. The company confirmed, however, that it had been hired to provide “advertising and marketing services in support of the Goodluck Jonathan campaign”. That work seems to have come about through Brittany Kaiser, a senior director at Cambridge Analytica, who would go on to play a public role at the launch of Nigel Farage’s Leave.eu campaign, and a senior strategist on the Trump campaign. Regarded by colleagues as a prolific networker, in December 2014 she was introduced to a Nigerian oil billionaire who wanted to fund a covert campaign to support Jonathan. The billionaire wanted total discretion. An ex-employee said: “[Kaiser] got a phone call. It was just before Christmas and she flew out to meet them in Washington DC. It was all a bit ridiculous. It was only six to eight weeks before the election and they were looking to spend nearly $2m.” The election was a big deal. At stake, the future of the most populous country in Africa, and potential access to its lucrative oil reserves. The sitting president was favourite to win, though Buhari was doing unexpectedly well. Not least because his team had hired AKPD, once the firm of former Barack Obama strategist David Axelrod, which was pushing a slick, social media heavy Obama-esque message of hope. “There were a lot of scared millionaires worried that Buhari would get in. It was all very last-minute. A team flew out to Abuja and put together a communications campaign. It was a straightforward, normal comms campaign in most respects,” the employee said. Most but not all respects. The Observer has obtained an astonishing and disturbing video that Cambridge Analytica used in the campaign. “Coming to Nigeria on February 15th, 2015,” the voiceover says in the manner of a trailer for a Hollywood movie. “Dark. Scary. And very uncertain. Sharia for all.” And then it poses the question: “What would Nigeria look like if sharia were imposed by Buhari?” Its answer to that question is certainly dark. And scary. It’s also graphically, brutally, violent. One minute and 19 seconds of archive news footage from Nigeria’s troubled past set to a horror movie soundtrack. There are scenes of people being macheted to death. Their legs hacked off. Their skulls caved in. A former contractor said: “It was voter suppression of the most crude and basic kind. It was targeted at Buhari voters in Buhari regions to basically scare the shit out of them and stop them from voting.” If Buhari wins, the film warns: women would wear the veil. Sharia law would be introduced. And the inference is, you may be macheted to death. It wasn’t just videos spreading fear. The Cambridge Analytica campaign team in Nigeria were jumpy too. “It felt risky, being there. There were various points when we were told we were in danger.” And in the Abuja hotel to which the team was confined in early 2015, rumours abounded. The tales are Graham Greene-esque. The hotel was where slick western consultants, including a team from the now disgraced Bell Pottinger, partied with their Nigerian counterparts. Mingling among them, western intelligence operatives - state backed, or privately commissioned, nobody was quite sure. And then there were the meetings: three sources have told the Guardian about one that took place between Cambridge Analytica employees and two people they were told were Israeli intelligence operatives. “There was a two-hour meeting that took place in the hotel lobby between two senior campaign members and Israeli intelligence. After which they swept our hotel rooms for listening devices and said they would switch out our phones. The story we were told was that there were intelligence agents from a number of different countries, including Israel and France, who were supporting Goodluck Jonathan and helping the campaigns.” There is no suggestion that Jonathan was aware of or implicated in this support. Another employee said: “Basically the Israelis didn’t want [Buhari] to win.” Other employees questioned whether they were “real” Israeli intelligence operatives, or Israeli private contractors. A few weeks later, as the campaign was drawing to a close, there was another meeting at Cambridge Analytica’s London office. An expert had flown in from Israel with a laptop, sources say. And Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica’s now suspended CEO, and Kaiser, asked employees to take a thumb drive and download the contents on to their own computers. The content was private emails and the information, they were told, related to Buhari’s financial and medical records. One employee who was present at the London meeting said he had initially assumed the visiting expert was Mossad or Israeli intelligence passing on what he called “legtimate information”. But he began to realise this wasn’t the case, he said, when he saw the reaction of his colleagues. One of them had “freaked out”, he said. “He was like, ‘What the fuck? I don’t want anything to do with this.’” The witnesses are clear – at least in their own minds. The information they were shown had come from hackers. Back in Nigeria, the team still on the ground found out what was going on from their colleagues in London. There was more “freaking out”. This time with live, pressing concerns. “They were fucking scared,” said a colleague who spoke to them while they were in the country. The campaign fixer, the person with local knowledge who navigated them through the ins and outs of Nigerian politics, made it clear to them: they needed to get out of the country right away. Cambridge Analytica had put them all in danger, they said. If opposition supporters found out, there was no saying what might happen. One member of the team missed his flight and instead of asking the office to re-book it, he got the first fight out – to Dubai – and put it on his credit card. “Everyone just wanted to get out as soon as possible.” A spokesman for the company said its team remained in country throughout the original campaigning period had “left in accordance with the company’s campaign plan”. “Team members were regularly briefed about security concerns prior to and during deployment and measures were taken to ensure the team’s safety throughout.” There are multiple wider political questions about what went on in the Nigerian election of 2015 and the role western powers played. Whether western political campaigners taking lucrative foreign contracts are contributing to the democratic framework of developing countries – or helping to destroy them. If they’re experimenting with methods and techniques that they later re-import back to our more developed democracies. Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower who spoke to the Observer, called it “post-colonial blowback”. “The west found a way of firehosing disinformation into weak and vulnerable democracies. And now this has been turned back on us. This really is about our chickens coming home to roost.” Another said: “Everything the company did after the Mercers got involved was about refining a set of techniques that they would go on to use in the US elections. These campaigns in other countries were experiments. They worked out how to harvest data and weaponise it. And they got steadily better at it.” And what comes across most strongly, the sources say, is how little thought, if any, the senior directors in London had given to their employees and colleagues who became caught up in the activities, many of whom were in their early to mid-20s. One member of staff who met the Israelis in the office on another occasion described them as “special forces” types. He said: “They were cliche alpha males with a certain intellect. Looked military, very composed. They looked like they could beat the crap out of you.” Three years on, there is still stress in some of their voices when they recount these stories. Stress and fear and anger – about the danger they put in, and the lack of care shown toward them, the morally compromising position they were put in, the lack of knowledge they had about what sort of the company they would be working for when they took their jobs. It’s why, despite the personal risks, so many of them agreed to speak. “When I took that job, I did not sign up to any of this,” said one. Three years on, he is still angry and shocked and fearful. “You don’t know what this company is capable of,” he said. In a statement, SCL Elections, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, confirmed it had been hired in December 2014 in support of the Jonathan campaign. “We can confirm that SCL Elections was hired in December 2014 to provide advertising and marketing services in support of the Goodluck Jonathan campaign.” Asked specifically about the meetings in which staff described being asked to transfer personal information that they believed had been hacked, the firm said: “During an election campaign, it is normal for SCL Elections to meet with vendors seeking to provide services as a subcontractor. “SCL Elections did not take possession of or use any personal information from such individuals for any purposes. SCL Elections does not use ‘hacked’ or ‘stolen’ data.” Additional reporting by Ann Marlowe"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/mar/19/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T20:59:20Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/19/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/mar/19/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• A picture of the businessman and anti-corruption campaigner Bill Browder was captioned as being of the late whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who in 2008 helped Browder uncover tax fraud (Russian elite must be forced to explain their wealth, MPs say, 17 March, page 12). • Other recently corrected articles include: Ilford M&amp;S to help build pop-up hostel for local rough sleepers Romy’s Kitchen, Thornbury, Bristol: ‘Not too hip, not too laboured, but welcoming’ – restaurant review What is Cambridge Analytica?

Projections from the Tory peer and psephologist Robert Hayward indicate the Conservatives will lose about 100 council seats. If they lose more than 93 – less than three seats in each of London’s boroughs – the Tories would fall below their previous low of 511 councillors in the capital. That came in 1994, just after the pound had fallen out of the exchange rate mechanism and Labour had begun the recovery that led to its 1997 general election landslide. “I’d be surprised if the Tories did not have an all-time low number of councillors,” Hayward said. “Labour were very successful in London in the general election last year and I’d expect that to continue in 2018.” The Tories could even lose their two flagship boroughs of Wandsworth, which has been in Conservative control since 1978, and Westminster, which has been Tory since the last local government reorganisation in 1964. More likely, Barnet in north London might go Labour and the Liberal Democrats could triumph in Kingston in south-west London where they are also targeting the neighbouring council, Richmond. The most spectacular reverse would be the loss of Kensington and Chelsea, the Conservative heartland won by Labour with the narrowest of margins at last year’s general election, where the Tory council has come under fire for its mishandling of the Grenfell Tower fire. London-only polling reveals the strength of Labour in the capital, where it is 11.8 points up on its 2014 vote share. Outside the capital, however, the party’s share of the vote is up only 5.8 points, overshadowed by a 7.6% rise for the Tories, buoyed by a fading Ukip. That means the Conservatives will be likely to claim a win of sorts if it remains the largest party in local government, a position it has held for more than a decade. Labour is likely to do well in its traditional strongholds such as Newcastle, Leeds, Manchester and Rotherham. The Tories may lose control of the Manchester borough of Trafford, where they hang on by only one seat. But they look unshiftable in their other metropolitan authority in Solihull and in the shires and in the districts. One Labour source said the party wanted to use the polls to plot advances into new territories, which could then be built on in a general election. “This is the cycle that favours us, particularly,” the source said. “Last year was our worst cycle and this year is our best. It’s much less defensive this time – it’s about seeing where we can make gains.” Labour will be assisted by a push from Momentum, the youthful Jeremy Corbyn-supporting group, which hopes to test out election strategies and flood target areas with hundreds of activists. A month ago, Theresa May’s fortunes seemed to hang on the results. But her standing has steadied because of her handling of the Salisbury poisoning and could be strengthened further by the perception of progress on Brexit. Many local councils have redrawn boundaries, making it hard to compare this year’s results with the last time they were contested in 2014. However, the overall picture will reveal how far the divisions that first became apparent in the referendum vote in 2016 and were repeated in last year’s general election may have become even more entrenched. Labour controls the cities, and the Tories the towns and rural areas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/26/dairy-dirty-secret-its-still-cheaper-to-kill-male-calves-than-to-rear-them","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-26T07:00:18Z","webTitle":"Dairy’s ‘dirty secret’: it's still cheaper to kill male calves than to rear them","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/26/dairy-dirty-secret-its-still-cheaper-to-kill-male-calves-than-to-rear-them","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/26/dairy-dirty-secret-its-still-cheaper-to-kill-male-calves-than-to-rear-them","fields":{"headline":"Dairy’s ‘dirty secret’: it's still cheaper to kill male calves than to rear them","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The number of male calves being killed straight after birth is on the rise again, despite efforts by the dairy industry to end the practice known as ‘the dirty secret’. A Guardian analysis shows that it can cost a farmer up to £30 per calf to sell it on for beef or veal, while early disposal costs just £9. A growing number of farmers feel compelled to take the latter option, with 95,000 killed on-farm in the most recent set of figures. Dairy farms depend on female cows to produce milk, so when male calves are born, they are surplus to requirements and farmers are currently faced with few options. They can immediately dispose of the calf, either by shooting it themselves or contracting a knackerman to do it [licensed slaughter business that will kill or collect dead farm animals]. They can sell the calf to be raised for veal or beef. Or they can sell the calf for live export. A few farms are experimenting with keeping the calves with the mothers for longer, but this is an expensive and rarely chosen option. Early disposal is known as the ‘dirty secret’ by farmers, and none relish it. But keeping the calf to sell on to be raised for beef or veal means the farmer will have to rear them for two to four weeks to a good enough weight to interest buyers, at a typical cost of around £2 a day, with selling prices at market as low as £25-40. This doesn’t include extra costs such as getting the calf to market, registering its birth or veterinary bills. In contrast, shooting the calf costs as little as £9, including the cost of the knackerman who will incinerate the body, or in some cases send them to kennels to be turned into dog food. Calves shot on farm cannot enter the human food chain and farmers can only dispose of calves themselves if they have a licensed incinerator. Dairy farmers in the UK have been under extreme pressure to cut costs for the last two decades, with milk long used as a loss leader by supermarkets to draw shoppers into their stores. “Some farmers might do the maths and figure out after rearing, transport and time away from the farm it might not add up,” says Chris Dodds, from the Livestock Auctioneers’ Association (LAA). The estimated 95,000 calves disposed on-farm represents 19% of the male dairy calves born, according to the most recent figures from the dairy industry body AHDB. In 2013 the number had fallen to 13% of male dairy calves born from a previous 21%. The exact numbers shot on farm is difficult to collate as farmers destroying calves within a few days of birth on farm do not need to register the birth - and neither does the company collecting and disposing of the animal. One dairy farmer, who asked to remain anonymous, explained to the Guardian that she could not find a market for her male calves. “This year we’re shooting the Jersey crosses, because we’ve not got the space or money to keep them. It doesn’t make me feel good. “We get the knackerman out to do it. I could never do it. I can’t even feed them if I know they are going to be dead in a few days.” She said the issue was still “kept under the carpet” by the wider food and farming industry and that consumer markets needed to be developed and farmers financially supported to rear the calves. Another farmer told the Guardian: “I shoot black and white bull calves [the Holstein Friesian breed that predominates the dairy sector in the UK], but am still not hardened to like doing it. We have too many calves here. The space available on the farm [an 800-cow dairy herd] is only suitable for a maximum of 80. The less calves I have the better for the overall farm. This is a business and it has to be financially viable to make it worthwhile.” A joint NGO, retailer, farming and government initiative to promote markets for bull calves, that closed in 2013, estimated more than £100m was being lost from calves killed before realising their economic worth. The alternatives to early disposal are not simple. Half a million calves used to be exported from dairy farms via ferries to the continent, which has a larger market for veal.But public protests and industry pressure against animals being sent on long journeys in lorries and lower animal welfare standards in other countries has seen that outlet largely disappear. No calves were exported from England last year, although an estimated 5,000 calves did leave from Scotland and a further 20,000 from Northern Ireland. Attempts to promote a market for high welfare British rosé veal, championed by the likes of Jamie Oliver and Jimmy Doherty, have met with mixed success with margins for farmers tight and consumer interest low. The RSPCA is calling for the food industry to be allowed to rename veal as rosé beef to end consumer misconception of it as a white meat produced from calves kept in crates and fed milk – a system that was banned in the UK in the early 1990s. Another alternative is to rear the calves for longer and sell them as beef. One of the companies doing that is Buitelaar, set up in 2006 and which collected more than 35,000 calves from dairy farms across the UK last year. It arranges for them to be reared indoors on a mixed diet and then sold after 12-14 months through UK supermarkets, restaurants and fast food chains. But some breeds such as Jersey cows are not seen as suitable for this option. There has been a steady growth in the use and effectiveness of sexed semen since the early 1990s, accounting for 18% of total semen sales in 2017. It increases costs for farmers but can reduce the proportion of male calves being born to less than 10%. Supermarkets could play an important role in reforming the situation and providing a market for meat from bull calves. Tesco, Aldi, Iceland, Lidl, the Co-op and Asda do not ban their milk suppliers from shooting bull calves and it is not outlawed under organic standards. But some of the large chains – the Co-op, Morrisons, Sainsburys and Waitrose – have launched schemes, in conjunction with beef companies such as ABP, Buitelaar and Dunbia, to collect calves and ensure they are reared rather than destroyed. The National Farmers’ Union (NFU) warns that post-Brexit trade deals could make it harder for farmers to find a market for male calves. “A trade deal that allows cheap beef from countries with lower standards of production will most definitely damage many of the positive initiatives that have been developed over recent years to utilise dairy bull calf beef and veal within the UK market,” said NFU dairy advisor Siân Davies. A small number of dairy farmers are experimenting with trying to make more use of the bull calves. David Finlay, who runs Cream O’Galloway, one of the UK’s largest ethical dairy farms in southwest Scotland, keeps his male and female calves with their mothers for the first five months. The male calves are then reared separately before being sold to a veal producer at eight months. He loses a large proportion of the milk produced by the female cows, but says his use of a dual purpose breeds of cows (good for milk and meat) means he gains a better market price for the animals. “The message coming to farmers from their peers and the industry is still to chase litres at all costs. But if you are chasing milk there will be a cost in terms of bull calves.” Send us your stories and thoughts at animalsfarmed@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/19/la-liga-title-race-atletico-madrid-barcelona-villarreal-real-madrid","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T15:20:09Z","webTitle":"Game over in La Liga: Atlético's title hopes fade in league that stands still | Sid Lowe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/19/la-liga-title-race-atletico-madrid-barcelona-villarreal-real-madrid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/19/la-liga-title-race-atletico-madrid-barcelona-villarreal-real-madrid","fields":{"headline":"Game over in La Liga: Atlético's title hopes fade in league that stands still","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"And so it ends? If, that is, it hadn’t already – and if it ever really started. “I feel like I lost it,” Diego Simeone said. It was Sunday evening on the east coast and he meant the game, but in all probability it was the title too. Defeated 2-1 by Villarreal, Atlético Madrid’s manager gazed at nothing in particular, an empty look on his face as all around him people celebrated. An old man enthusiastically shook the hand of the man next to him, a solitary square of yellow confetti settled on his tweed hat, while Simeone’s team trudged past towards the tunnel. Vitolo had led the way seconds before, sent off for the first time, and now they followed, knowing that, barring a miracle, the league had just come to a close at the Ceramic Stadium, two months early. “Is it over?” Simeone was asked, to which he said something about winning lots of games and seeing where they are with five weeks to go. But with nine weeks left, Atlético are probably too far off and he could have been forgiven for offering a shorter, simpler answer: “Probably.” On Sunday afternoon, Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 2-0 and that, plus Atlético’s defeat, leaves Simeone’s side 11 points and head-to-head goal difference behind. “It’s finished!” ran the shout on the radio and most agreed: any lingering hope Atlético had of becoming champions again, already radically reduced since that loss at the Camp Nou, slipped through their fingers. “There’s no explanation,” Saúl said. “It was strange; this doesn’t happen often.” He was right, it doesn’t. Ever. Not even against Villarreal, the team Atlético hadn’t beaten in four. At half-time, Atlético were 1-0 up, Villarreal’s president Fernando Roig going down to tell the referee he’d got it wrong when he gave diving Antoine Griezmann an early penalty. Thirty-five times Simeone’s side have led 1-0 at half-time, and they’d never lost. With 10 minutes to go, they were still a goal up. Atlético were relentlessly atléticoing again, in control and on course for a ninth 1-0 of the season, a 19th clean sheet. To make sure, Greizmann came off and Gabi went on. A minute later, Enes Unal made it 1-1. Eight minutes after that, with virtually the last kick, Unal scored again, his sixth of the season – five for Villarreal, one for Levante. No wonder Simeone was blaming himself. “I lost it: the players made a huge effort and I didn’t help them,” he said. “It’s not his fault,” insisted Saúl, but there was something in Simeone’s confession. “Unal punishes el Cholo,” ran the headline in AS. In the match report below, Patricia Cazón was reeling off Clint Eastwood’s films, linking them to key moments of a game which she said had started on the porch, rifle in hand like Gran Torino; in which Griezmann’s penalty had been shot like Dirty Harry; the match became a fight and the pitch a ring, Million Dollar Baby-style; and in which there was, of course, the good, the bad and ultimately the ugly too. One film she didn’t mention was Never say Goodbye, and Simeone wasn’t saying that but they surely know they may soon have to. Three pages on, Picu Díaz insisted: “Defeat meant bidding adiós to the league.” “Atlético say goodbye. If it looked impossible before, that’s a reality now,” agreed El País. “The final lights out – the remote chance they had disintegrated at the Cerámica,” said El Mundo. When Leo Messi had scored against Athletic a few hours earlier, he had done a dance. Well, a momentary wriggle, anyway – and that was enough. “The rhythm of a champion,” cheered El Mundo Deportivo. “This league is a dance,” said the cover of Sport. “It’s official: no one can keep up with Barcelona’s pace: the league is on a plate,” read the editorial. They said Barcelona can “smell” the league, which poses the question: “What does the league smell of?” The front cover of AS, meanwhile, went for: “The league, done.” Well, part of the cover did – in small letters near the top. The big letters were reserved for Cristiano Ronaldo. He had scored four against Girona – as many as he got in the first half of the season – to take him to 22 this term, having got 18 in his last nine league games. Oh, and those goals against PSG too. “What’s unusual is that he was not scoring before,” Nacho said but he is now. Ronaldo’s 2018 has been absurdly impressive. At one point, he was 17-4 down on Leo Messi when it came to league goals; now the score is 25-22. “POKER, and only three from Messi,” shouted the front of AS. “He’s got 22 in the league, had left Luis Suárez behind (21) and is going for the Pichichi.” Marca’s cover led on: “INCREDIBLE!”, noting: “He’s got 22 and is only three from Messi.” Underneath it said: “Madrid, four points off Atlético.” There was no mention of the 15 points they are off Barcelona. Or the 11 Atlético are off Barcelona. In part, the decision to lead with the top scorer award was rooted in the fact they had already given up on the league. Back in November, when he had just one goal, 11 fewer than Messi, Marca reported Ronaldo had bet his team-mates that he would still finish as Pichichi. There was no suggestion he had bet that they would win the title. Perhaps even then there was a feeling it was already gone, that it slipped away when the team wasn’t functioning and Ronaldo, like others, wasn’t scoring. What they’re doing now is a lot, but it is also late. Titles are won in the final weeks, they say – but that’s only true if you’re still in touch and Madrid lost touch some time ago. They dropped points in three of their first five games and in nine of their first 19. They lost the clásico, then returned from Christmas to draw 2-2 with Celta and lose to Villarreal. Almost from the start, few hopes have been deposited in them. If anyone was going to compete for the title, it was Valencia, and then Atlético. Now they too have fallen away. Was this Atletico’s final slip? If the league hadn’t gone before, most think it has now. “Hay Liga!” the phrase goes when the race is on. There is league. Maybe there hasn’t been for a long time. “It’s just a countdown now,” Santi Giménez wrote in AS. Barcelona would have to lose at least four in nine to lose the title. Their run-in is quite difficult – they go to Celta and Sevilla and have to play Madrid, Valencia and Villarreal at home – but few imagine an unbeaten team will lose four times. “Barcelona games have all the emotion and uncertainty of the Russian elections,” wrote Emilia Landaluce in El Mundo. “They have the predictable ending of a fourth-rate porno,” she added, suggesting she either doesn’t watch Barcelona or has very niche taste in films. One thing is true, though: Barcelona keep on going. Twenty-nine games in, they’re still unbeaten; the rest are not given a chance to catch up. They’re afforded but a brief moment. Barcelona’s lead is now back up to 11. They’re still there, where they always were. This has been the season where nothing much has changed, and no one has really moved . There are still 10 weeks to go of course, but until now might-be hasn’t become actually-is; every time it has appeared open, the door has closed. The top four have been the top four since week seven and the top six have been the same since week 10. They have been divided into the same two groups as well, Champions League places on one hand, Europa League places on the other (although it is likely that seventh will provide access to Europe too), and then there’s relegation. At the bottom, only Alavés have broken the pattern, pulling out of the relegation zone, embarking upon an extraordinary run to salvation. Fifteen weeks without a win saw Levante dragged towards trouble, but they’ve now won two in a row under Paco López and, following a huge 2-1 win over Eibar, there are six points between them and the relegation zone, leaving the same old faces in the same old places. Las Palmas and Deportivo played each other this weekend, desperately needing a win. Neither got it, which somehow summed it up. So here we are, another Monday, another week closer to the end, and the same table. Go back and you can see it. This morning Top: Barcelona. Champions League: Barcelona, Atlético, Real Madrid, Valencia. Europa League: Villarreal, Sevilla. Relegation: Málaga, Deportivo, Las Palmas. Five weeks ago Top: Barcelona. Champions League: Barcelona, Atlético, Valencia, Real Madrid. Europa League: Sevilla, Villarreal. Relegation: Málaga, Deportivo, Las Palmas. Five weeks before that Top: Barcelona. Champions League: Barcelona, Atlético, Valencia, Real Madrid. Europa League: Sevilla, Villarreal. Relegation: Las Palmas, Málaga, Deportivo. And five weeks before that Top: Barcelona. Champions League: Barcelona, Valencia, Atlético, Real Madrid. Europa League: Sevilla, Villarreal. Relegation: Málaga, Alavés, Las Palmas. In short, this season in Spain the same nine teams have occupied the same decisive spots for the last 11 weeks. Barcelona have occupied the most important place of all and they have done so from the start to the finish, which almost certainly arrived on Sunday night, nine weeks early. Talking points • “If they come here, we like it to be to support us. The truth is that when you hear whistles – today I’m going to say it – it touches my eggs, honestly. We want to win, but sometimes it doesn’t come off. We’re not perfect, if we were perfect we’d be Barcelona, Bayern Munich; we’re Celta. There are people who don’t know that: calm down and don’t forget where we come from.” Celta captain Hugo Mallo isn’t happy. Touching someone’s eggs (their testicles) means really pissing them off, by the way. • At least Athletic are consistent: that’s four 2-0 defeats in a row on the road. • The revolution begins in San Sebastián.

First, the good news: the feature that allowed the most egregious data harvesting used by the company that gave Cambridge Analytica its data is no longer on the site. Before 2016, Facebook apps could ask for permission to access not only your own data, but also the data of all your friends on the platform. That means that around 300,000 people could sign up for a personality test quiz, and in the process hand over information of 150 times that number. Now, however, Facebook apps are only allowed to gather information from users who have directly signed up for them, greatly limiting their reach. That change was made in 2014, and rolled out to every Facebook app over the course of 2015. But it’s still the case that apps which you have directly enabled can harvest a significant amount of data from your account – often information which you might be surprised to know you’re handing over. The app settings page on Facebook is the place to manage the apps you’ve given access to. Clicking on the link will bring up a list of apps under “logged in with Facebook”. Hopefully you’ll recognise most of them – if there’s any you don’t, consider clicking the “X”, deauthorising them from your account. You might also want to click on the edit button under the “apps others use” heading lower down the page. This takes you to your privacy settings for the modern version of the same feature Cambridge Analytica profited from. The information others can hand over on your behalf is limited, but still includes data such as your date of birth, religious and political views, and activities, interests and things you like. Consider unchecking all the boxes. According to Facebook, leaving them all checked will make your friends’ “experience better and more social”, which doesn’t seem like a good trade-off for you. If that’s not enough for you to feel safe, maybe now’s the time to delete your Facebook account altogether. That’s somewhat harder to do. If you go through the account settings, Facebook will attempt to push you to “deactivate” your account, which “will disable your profile and remove your name and photo from most things that you’ve shared on Facebook”. Notably, it won’t remove any of your data from Facebook’s servers, and your account lies dormant hoping you will change your mind. If you actually want to delete your information from Facebook, the real setting is hidden in a help document with the title “how do I permanently delete my account?” Clicking on “let us know” on that page will take users to the real account deletion screen. Clicking “delete my account” will take you to another screen. Filling in your password and proving you aren’t a robot on that screen will finally… deactivate your account. Wait two weeks after that, and then, at long last, Facebook will begin the 90 day process of deleting all your data from the site. By September, then, you too could be Facebook-free."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/21/mafia-killing-slovakia-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T05:59:03Z","webTitle":"A mafia killing has transformed Slovakia.

But for how long?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On the morning of Monday 26 February, Slovakia learned of a double murder: a young investigative journalist and his girlfriend had been shot dead. It happened in their small house, in a village not far from the Slovakian capital Bratislava. Someone called to tell me what had happened, and I thought: Oh, that’s terrible. That was it. I’d never heard the name Ján Kuciak before. I’d never read his articles – nobody had pointed them out to me. And even if they had, I might not have been able to concentrate hard enough to follow the tangled links he described, links so complicated that they resembled chemical formulas. It was very cold that day, but in Bratislava the pictures of the smiling couple – who were the same age as my own adult children – started appearing in public places, as people lit candles and placed them by the photographs. Nothing would ever be the same again. We simply stopped going about our normal lives. We devoured the news reports, press conferences, discussions and Facebook posts. Kuciak’s last, unfinished article, made available by his editor the next day and published by all the newspapers, was read by more people than any other article anyone can remember. The story that Kuciak told is in fact a jumble of stories, featuring members of ’Ndrangheta – the Calabrian organised crime syndicate – mixed up with Slovaks through investments, agricultural lands benefitting from European subsidies but where nothing is grown, and bankrupt businesses. All this Kuciak connected to judges, tax authorities and politicians from the ruling party. You can read it as a police report, a sociological study, a comedy or drama. In this story there’s even a beautiful woman who enjoyed a meteoric career, rising from being a model in an ad for tractors to become a business person and then a close associate of the prime minister – a journey that led her to a Calabrian businessman as well. Yes, it reads like a soap opera too. This is the Slovakia we now confront in disbelief. Anyone who read Kuciak’s last article could see the absurdity of a murder investigation being supervised by the very same people Kuciak pointed to in his reporting: the minister of the interior Robert Kaliňák and prime minister Robert Fico (who have since stepped down in response to public protest). The response has been a series of street protests, the largest in our country’s history. Crowds were even bigger than those of the November 1989 velvet revolution. People gathered simultaneously throughout the country and even beyond its borders. These were by no means the first protests against corruption. But anger at someone who schemed to steal from you is one thing. Paying tribute to a murdered journalist who uncovered that scheme, and standing by his grieving family, is quite another. Slovakia is no longer divided between the opposition and the governing coalition, the liberals and the Catholics, the left and the right. It’s divided between those who mourn Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová, and the very few who don’t. If politicians had called for rallies, they would not have achieved protests on this massive scale. Instead, the demonstrations have been organised by students. They give the podium to Kuciak’s sister, Mária. And invite activists, including gay rights defenders, and also a bishop who was thrown out of the church for having revealed financial discrepancies within its local hierarchy. People are shouting for the government to step down. The creativity of ordinary people has produced slogans that make fun of political leaders in a hundred ways, even quoting Shakespeare, among other writers. Overnight, our pro-European prime minister became desperate enough to spew out conspiracy theories, in just the way that the far right does, but to little effect. After he blamed George Soros for fuelling the protests, people laughed, and the press laughed too. One young boy at one of the demonstrations wore a sign on the back of his coat saying: “I am too old to believe in fairytales about Soros.” What Fico apparently forgot, when he tried to talk like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, is that Orbán has had years in which to shape his illiberal regime, and has thoroughly taken over the Hungarian media. Yet today, Slovakia is not primed for dictatorship, nor for fascism. In the 1990s we were the first country in post-communist central Europe to experience rule by a strongman – when Vladimír Mečiar governed. In the end, Mečiar’s regime was ousted by a wave of civil resistance. It’s too soon to know the outcome of the recent protests. Romania and Bulgaria stand as examples of countries where huge anti-corruption demonstrations have failed to bring significant political change. It doesn’t help that in Slovakia there is no obvious pro-European alternative to the current government. But it’s still possible that we will manage to change the atmosphere for more than just a few weeks. I believe that our country of 5.4 million people has shown itself to be ready for democracy, thanks in large part to how young people have responded. Czechs and Slovaks are fascinated by “magic numbers”. Czechoslovakia was founded in 1918 and ceased to exist in 1938 when the Munich agreement allowed Hitler to carve it up. The communists took power with a coup in 1948. The Prague spring happened in 1968. Mečiar, whose regime was heading down the road to dictatorship, was defeated in 1998. Ján Kuciak and his girlfriend Martina Kušnírová were killed because they threatened the mafia. After Soviet troops crushed the Prague spring in 1968, a student, Jan Palach, set fire to himself in Prague, in the name of a free Czechoslovakia. These stories may be different, but they have something in common: their heroes were so young. • Marta Frišová is a Slovak journalist, and co-founder of the Central European Forum in Bratislava"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/live/2018/mar/22/schadenfoode","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-22T08:59:22Z","webTitle":"Schadenfoode!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/live/2018/mar/22/schadenfoode","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/live/2018/mar/22/schadenfoode","fields":{"headline":"Schadenfoode!","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The dining room, deep in the hotel, is a broad space of high ceilings and coving, with thick carpets to muffle the screams.

Looking at their track records playing the game, it’s clear that there might be good reasons for paying them differently. After all, since Wimbledon decided in 2007 that the men and women’s championship should offer the same prize money – becoming the last major tournament to do so – we can say men and women’s grand slam titles are more-or-less equally comparable. And the figures speak clearly. Out of Navratilova and McEnroe, one has 18 grand slam titles, and the other has just seven. Sadly for the BBC, it is Navratilova who has the greater number of titles, suggesting either that she should be paid around £385,000 for her punditry services, or that McEnroe should take a pay cut and drop to around £5,800 for his. This is a system that could be extended – the BBC pays both Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer to talk about football, paying the former £1.75m and the latter £450,000 – but their playing records suggest that difference is too big. Going by, say, the number of England caps each received, we should either be upping Shearer to £1.4m or so, or asking Lineker to cut his wage down to a more modest £550,000. It’s possible to suggest, of course, that such a system would be ridiculous: it would be completely arbitrary to judge someone’s skill and value as a pundit and presenter on their talent in an entirely different field. Anyone suggesting that would be right – that system might be nearly as silly as paying people differently based on something as arbitrary as whether they owned a penis or not.

And, although the Fat Controller would cut a comical figure in boxing shorts, he briefly was a dynamic promoter in the 80s and 90s at his casinos in Atlantic City before serial bankruptcies forced him to quit the Jersey boardwalk – and the fight game. Nevertheless, although he ended up president of the United States, it is unlikely Trump will ever get a ringside invitation to watch his country’s latest boxing hero, the Californian-born José Carlos Ramírez. At Madison Square Garden on Saturday Ramírez, the son of Mexican immigrants, outpointed the slick New Yorker, Amir “Young Master” Imam, to win the vacant WBC light-welterweight belt. Later he spoke with passion on behalf of his fans, the Californian farm workers who regard themselves as marginalised by president Trump’s anti-immigration policies. Ramírez, a 2012 London Olympian, was the proud champion of fans who could not afford to make the journey from the west coast. As the Sacramento Bee reported, the victory cap he wore would not say “Make American Great Again” but “Pro-Immigrant and Proud”. Inspired by how his father had championed water rights for thousands of immigrants during California’s long drought, Ramírez became politicised as a teenager around Avenal, where he picked peppers in the fields for 10 hours a day. His manager, Rick Mirigian, told the Bee: “Not since Muhammad Ali has a fighter been this socially active. Whether it’s water or immigrant rights, he puts his money where his mouth is and his fists as well.” Ramírez dropped out of college to pursue a boxing career but his scholarship fund to help immigrants through university has already raised $56,000. “It’s my duty to fight for our neighbours, hard-working, humble families working to provide for their families and make America great,” he said. “A lot of people are afraid, nervous and vulnerable and I’m going to continue to be their voice until something positive happens. We can’t leave it to the politicians.” On Saturday night, boxing with as much heart as art, Ramírez outlasted Imam 115-113, 117-111, 120-108, and his Mexican-born mother said ringside through an interpreter: “He’s dreamed of being a world champion ever since he was eight years old.” There was a subtext to the drama. Ramírez’s promoter was Bob Arum, a signed-up Democrat and one-time legal adviser to Robert Kennedy; Imam is promoted by Don King, one of Trump’s loudest fans. The two octogenarian war-horses, thrown together again in the fading days of their promotional careers, had to share the reflected spotlight, if not the spoils. Before the fight King said of his friend in the White House: “The first thing that Donald Trump said that touched my heart, and it should touch every American’s heart, is, ‘We will create a whole new system. We will take this system apart. I want to make America great again and America first.’ He is unpredictable. He is uncontrollable. He can’t be intimidated or coerced. He can’t be bought and the only people he has to answer to is the American people.” Ramírez might have smiled at that assessment and he provided his own answer with his fists on behalf of his absent friends. Trump was nowhere to be seen, which was not surprising: St Patrick’s Day holds embarrassing memories for him. A year ago the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, left Trump speechless at a Washington reception to celebrate Ireland’s patron saint, when he delivered a powerful defence of all immigrants, particularly those from Ireland. On the undercard the Irish Olympian Michael Conlan continued his impressive progress in the same ring where he made his fairytale professional debut 12 months ago. In his first fight for Adam Booth Conlan took a round-and-a-bit to destroy the willing Hungarian David Berna. Conlan is exciting, quotable and talented. If he continues to move through the featherweight division as he has in his first six fights, he is likely to enjoy a lucrative career in the US, where boxers have historically been sold as representatives of ethnic communities, from the Jewish, Italian, black and Irish fighters of melting-pot days more than a century ago, through to the flourishing Latino diaspora of today. The New York show was shamelessly milked for its Irish quotient, on Top Rank and here on BoxNation. Perhaps Trump (the son of a Scottish mother and from German lineage on his father’s side) watched on TV. It is, after all, where he gets most of his information. Predictably Conlan is being marketed as “Irish Mick”. Fair play to him. And fair play to Ramírez, whose courage extends a long way beyond the ring. Not so uplifting was the news that Amir Khan’s former manager, Asif Vali, is trying to launch a watered-down version of bareknuckle boxing. And that is the last reference to this tawdry enterprise that will appear here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/political-science/2018/mar/21/donald-trump-isnt-waging-war-on-science-he-just-doesnt-care","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump isn’t waging war on science.

He just doesn’t care","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The first time the word “science” appeared in a tweet by Donald Trump was on 13 September 2012, long before he became US president, when he wrote: “Wake Up America! See article: ‘Israeli Science: Obama Birth Certificate is a Fake’.” Since becoming president, Trump has not mentioned the words “science” or “technology” in his tweets, reflecting not so much disdain for these issues but an abject lack of interest. After the 2016 election, the benign neglect of science policy was not an option anticipated by many, including Jack Stilgoe and me on this blog (though Robert Cook-Deegan did). It may not be a bad thing for the scientific community, but it does leave policy gaps that need to be filled. President Trump has gone more than 400 days without appointing a director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, or OSTP (this person would also serve as the president’s science adviser). Occasional rumors circulate about the position being filled, but 14 months into the Trump presidency, it remains vacant. Nonetheless, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education, OSTP now has about 50 staffers, leading Tobin L. Smith, vice president for policy at the Association for American Universities, to suggest that “it now appears that OSTP is staffed and is up and running”. Perhaps, but if so, where is OSTP running to? The answer seems to be “in circles”. Consider that in the president’s 2018 federal budget proposal – the administration’s first – research and development were targeted for large cuts, a 4.6% reduction overall. But for 2019 the president’s budget went in the opposite direction, proposing an overall 4.1% increase in R&amp;D. The whipsaw back-and-forth on science budgets almost certainly doesn’t reflect changing administration priorities, or priorities at all. Rather, the proposed budget increase for 2019 likely reflects the fact that Congress has added money to the discretionary budgetary pie, allowing for a larger slice to be allocated to R&amp;D. The Trump R&amp;D budgets merely illustrate a dynamic identified by Dan Sarewitz more than a decade ago: “marginal changes in the R&amp;D budget are tightly coupled to trends in discretionary spending as a whole”. For the scientific community, at least where R&amp;D budgets are concerned, benign neglect under the Trump administration might be better than possible alternatives. When Trump has voiced opinions on policy issues valued by the scientific community, such as the Paris climate agreement and Iran nuclear deal, he has been far out of step with the views of most scientists. Were OSTP to have a director appointed with a coherent approach to science and technology policy, there is no guarantee that outcomes would be better for science than the current rudderless approach from the administration. Congress deals with research and development in its highly decentralised and fractious ways, but regardless which party has been in charge, it has historically seen R&amp;D very favorably. If Trump lacks conviction on matters of science and technology, the same cannot be said of some of his appointees. Perhaps most visibly, Trump’s appointment of Scott Pruitt as head of the Environmental Protection Agency has resulted in sweeping changes to how that agency does business, notably how it uses science advice. Policy actions related to science and technology, such as Trump’s space policy directive late last year, more likely reflect the work of determined policy entrepreneurs in the bureaucracy rather than any top-down strategy. It may be a mistake to conceptualise a “Trump science and technology policy” in such a free-for-all environment. The Trump administration’s neglect of science and technology has made it difficult for his opponents to generate the sort of outrage that was aimed at George W. Bush’s supposed “war on science”. For example, Trump’s 2019 budget proposal has been called an “assault on knowledge and reason”, but the reality is far less exciting. With Republicans controlling the congressional appropriations process, and the Trump administration now following their lead, the federal R&amp;D budget has come to look like what might be expected from conservatives, for instance less funding for environmental research and more for fossil fuel exploitation. Last December the outrage machine kicked into high gear when the Washington Post reported that the Trump administration had banned seven words at the Centers for Disease Control: “vulnerable”, “entitlement”, “diversity”, “transgender”, “fetus”, “evidence-based” and “science-based.” The Post editorialised that the ban raised “concerns that higher-ups at [Health and Human Services, the CDC parent body] are insisting on banned words to enforce a political and ideological agenda”. Twitter lit up. It seemed the war on science was on again. It was exciting for a few days. It turns out that there never was a list of banned words. According to reporting by Daniel Engber, the list of words originated not with Trump administration political appointees but with career bureaucrats brainstorming on what language to use in their budget requests to avoid irritating those same political appointees. The story morphed into something that Trump would label “fake news”, a misleading story so politically perfect that it must be true. Instead, as Engber explained, the list reads “like some left-leaning functionary’s best guess about the words that might be banned by the White House, if the White House were to bother banning words”. In this episode there are at least two lessons for the scientific community. One is to beware ascribing greater organisation and intent to the Trump administration than it deserves. As Goethe wrote: “misunderstandings and neglect create more confusion in this world than trickery and malice.” The Trump administration’s neglect of science and technology policy means there is no systematic effort to undercut science and technology policy. Instead, they just don’t care. A second lesson is that scientists who are opposed to Trump (and please count me among them) should take care that their zeal does not backfire. Perceived partisanship within the scientific community carries some political risks, and so too do repetitive, routine expressions of actual or faux outrage. Almost one year after the March for Science, there is seemingly little energy in any follow-up or the building of a movement. It is hard to sustain outrage when your opponent doesn’t care, the public overall supports science and technology, and Congress is increasing overall R&amp;D budgets. In this context, Trump can do more outrageous things longer than the community can stay outraged. A more productive use of oppositional energy would be for the scientific community to develop well-considered approaches to science and technology policies. If the president and his administration won’t lead, then groups like the American Association for the Advancement of Science or the National Academy of Sciences should instead. This might mean getting into the weeds of science and technology policy, by, for example, putting together a shadow, bipartisan version of the National Science and Technology Council, a body within OSTP normally tasked with “clear national goals for Federal science and technology investments in a broad array of areas spanning virtually all the mission areas of the Executive Branch”. There is of course no guarantee that any such expert advice would be taken by the administration or Congress, but in the absence of alternatives making available coherent science and technology policy options could help to shape policy discussions in productive ways. There is not much of a US science and technology policy under the Trump administration. However, science and technology policies remain important to the nation. There is a gap here that the science community might fill, if they can avoid getting distracted by the outrageous guy in the White House who just doesn’t seem to care."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/19/luke-shaw-unhappy-jose-mourinho-criticism-not-forced-out-summer-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T13:43:29Z","webTitle":"Luke Shaw unhappy at Mourinho criticism but will not be forced out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/19/luke-shaw-unhappy-jose-mourinho-criticism-not-forced-out-summer-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/19/luke-shaw-unhappy-jose-mourinho-criticism-not-forced-out-summer-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"Luke Shaw unhappy at Mourinho criticism but will not be forced out","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Luke Shaw has been left unhappy at José Mourinho’s public criticism of him but the left-back will not be forced out of Manchester United this summer against his wishes. Shaw is understood not to have made a final decision on his future and may choose to see out the final season of his contract and leave on a free in summer 2019. He could then expect a wider pool of clubs to choose from and be able to agree a lucrative signing-on fee. Mourinho replaced the 22-year-old defender at half-time of United’s 2-0 FA Cup quarter-final victory against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion at Old Trafford on Saturday. The move came despite Shaw having played a key role in the creation of Romelu Lukaku’s 37th‑minute opening goal. Afterwards the United manager said: “Luke in the first half – every time they come in his corridor, the cross was coming and a dangerous situation was coming so I was not happy with his performance.” This was the latest in a series of public admonishments of Shaw by Mourinho. The United manager has praised him, too, but at least once that has led to confusion. On 19 January Mourinho described Shaw as near‑peerless in his position then dropped him the following day for a 1-0 victory at Burnley, preferring to start Ashley Young. On Monday, United triggered a one-year option to keep Young for next season."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/19/women-made-vulnerable-zero-hours-contracts-sexual-harassment-work","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T17:41:52Z","webTitle":"‘I wasn’t protected at all’: why women are made vulnerable by zero-hours contracts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/19/women-made-vulnerable-zero-hours-contracts-sexual-harassment-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/19/women-made-vulnerable-zero-hours-contracts-sexual-harassment-work","fields":{"headline":"‘I wasn’t protected at all’: why women are made vulnerable by zero-hours contracts","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When Charlotte worked for a large pub chain in central London, workplace sexual harassment was so widespread that she describes it as “continuous”. Incidents that particularly stand out, she says, include being asked by a customer to give him a blow job, being groped by a customer while carrying plates of food past their table and being asked to go to a hotel by a man who tipped £20 during the course of the evening. The impact on her mental health was enormous. “It made me feel unsafe and miserable and it made going to work extremely difficult.” At one point, she says: “I broke down and had to go home to my parents for two weeks because I couldn’t do it any more.” Working on a zero-hours contract made Charlotte feel unable to report what was happening, due to “a low-level fear that making too much fuss would reduce my hours when I was already struggling to support myself”. Faye was a carer working on a zero-hours contract at a learning disability care home when a co-worker unexpectedly showed her photographs of his erect penis. She, too, felt pressured to put up with the sexual harassment because of the instability of her contract. “I absolutely did not feel able to protest or report. The guy had been working there longer than me and I felt that if I had reported it, I would be at risk of not receiving any more shifts.” Another woman, who asked to remain anonymous, worked at a five-star hotel and golf resort. While experiencing frequent unwanted touching and groping from customers, she was pressured by managers to accept the behaviour to keep wealthy regular clients happy. “We were constantly told to ‘look after the important customers’: and [they] were pointed out to us by our managers – these were the richest or most-famous customers, of course.” The power imbalance manifested itself in class prejudice as well. One “important customer” would make comments about her accent and the fact that she had not been to university. She felt that “his power came from his wealth and he was determined to exploit it in any way he could”. It meant that she had few options to tackle his behaviour. “One evening, [he] asked me to sit on his lap, but I wasn’t in the mood to play along with his game. I could see this annoyed him. The next day I was called into the office because he’d complained about me. He told my manager that I’d embarrassed him in front of some important clients. I was reprimanded but couldn’t bring myself to say what had happened. I didn’t want to lose my job as I’d only been there a few months, I had no savings and nowhere else to go.” When the Everyday Sexism Project and the TUC surveyed women in 2016, the results revealed that more than half of women had experienced workplace sexual harassment. But that figure leapt to 67% for women in hospitality and leisure. Our report’s recommendations to the government included reinstating Equality Act provisions to protect employees from third-party harassment and extending the full range of statutory employment rights to all workers, regardless of employment status or type of contract. There remains an urgent need to reform the law on employment status and continuity of employment so that those on zero-hours or casual contracts do not lose out on basic rights at work, including protection from unfair dismissal. At the time of the report’s publication, a government spokesman told the Guardian: “No one should experience harassment or abuse of any kind in the workplace – the law on this is very clear and employers must take swift action to tackle this issue. Section 40 has not been scrapped and any employee who experiences harassment is protected by the Equality Act – regardless of who the perpetrator is.” Last year, however, a ComRes survey of over 6,000 adults (men and women) found that people employed by an organisation were significantly less likely (29%) to have suffered unwelcome sexual behaviour at work than people engaged as freelancers, gig workers or on zero-hours contracts (43%). Pippa and Stephanie both worked as waitresses on zero-hours contracts. Stephanie describes being “touched up, backed into corners, fondled and followed … We often had huge tables of businessmen come in and I would be assigned by my boss to ‘look after them’ for the night. I remember one man put £100 down my top as my ‘tip’.” Stephanie didn’t feel able to protest: “The general feel of the workplace was disorganised and chaotic; no supervisions, no contracts, it was cash in hand. So I wasn’t protected at all.” For Pippa, sexual harassment started with “jokey” comments from an older member of staff and progressed to him touching her waist and hips. One day he graphically described her breasts in front of another member of staff. “I finished my shift with my hands still shaking,” she says. But she felt she had little recourse for dealing with the sexual harassment. “I was scared I would not be believed and that I would lose those precious work hours … The zero hours meant that I could be dropped with no warning and the member of staff in question has a permanent contract. I had no union representation and had no idea about the help they could have given me.” The impact of workplace sexual harassment is ongoing and severe. “I was told it was part of the job,” says Charlotte, who stopped working in the pub some years ago. “It made me physically sick to walk through those doors at times, I felt complicit in the harassment by staying in the job.” Pippa says she still smells the perpetrator’s aftershave if someone touches her unexpectedly. So great is the fear about speaking out that the women interviewed for this article asked for only their first names to be used. Recent revelations about sexual harassment in Hollywood, Westminster and elsewhere have triggered vital conversations about women’s right to respect and safety at work. But it is important that the spotlight drawn by the voices of high-profile women also penetrates deeper, to the plight of women in less glamorous jobs, particularly those made doubly vulnerable by precarious working conditions, who are often even less able to share their stories. “Customers ‘pay your wages’, so lots of them feel that the transaction for a pint of Fosters includes the right to make sexual comments or to try to feel you up,” says Charlotte. “While it’s been devastating to hear about the scale of abuse in politics and the creative industries, I think it’s important to make it clear that sexual harassment happens everywhere there’s a power differential.” And, until the law changes, Charlotte and others like her will likely continue to feel pressured to see sexual harassment as “just part of the job”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/19/sean-penn-debut-novel-trump-bob-honey-stuff","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T16:51:01Z","webTitle":"'We're a nation in need of an assassin': Sean Penn's debut novel set to take on Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/19/sean-penn-debut-novel-trump-bob-honey-stuff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/19/sean-penn-debut-novel-trump-bob-honey-stuff","fields":{"headline":"'We're a nation in need of an assassin': Sean Penn's debut novel set to take on Trump","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Actor Sean Penn’s debut novel, Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff – an expanded version of a 2016 audiobook he wrote under the pen name of “sociopath” Pappy Pariah and narrated – will be published in April, featuring references to Donald Trump and the #MeToo movement.The book details the story of Bob Honey, a “man of many trades – sewage specialist, purveyor of pyrotechnics, contract killer for a mysterious government agency that pays in small bills”. Pursued by an investigative journalist, Honey decides to take action wrest back control of his life from the branch of US intelligence that covertly employs him. In one new scene, Honey writes a letter to the US president, named Mr Landlord. “Many wonderful American people in pain and rage elected you. Many Russians did, too. Your position is an asterisk accepted as literally as your alternative facts. Though the office will remain real, you never were nor will be. A million women so dwarfed your penis-edency on the streets of Washington and around the world on the day of your piddly inauguration … You are not simply a president of impeachment, you are a man in need of an intervention. We are not simply a people in need of an intervention, we are a nation in need of an assassin … Tweet me bitch, I dare you.” Penn is an outspoken critic of Trump, whom he called “an enemy of mankind” in an opinion piece for Time magazine in January, and of the Republican party. Other allusions to contemporary politics in the novel include a reference to a “yellow lives matter” march for Aryan people at a Republican National Convention; Mr Landlord’s Democratic opposite number in the US election campaign, who is referred to as “the absolutely worst possible candidate to represent the party”; and a meeting with a drug lord who has just escaped prison, reminiscent of Penn’s infamous 2015 interview with El Chapo, then one of the world’s most wanted men. The book also features a poem in which Honey calls the #MeToo movement “an infantilising term of the day”. “Is this a toddlers’ crusade? Reducing rape, slut-shaming and suffrage to reckless child’s play? A platform for accusation impunity? Due process has lost its sheen?” the poem reads. Penn, who claimed he originally met Pariah at a writers’ conference in Florida in 1979 when promoting the audiobook of the original Bob Honey story, did not reveal he was the author until months later, when he said he wanted to expand on it and publish it as a novel. “It was soon after I finished narrating the short audio of Bob Honey that I began to feel I had only scratched the surface of this story I wanted to tell,” he said when the book was announced. “Expanding that original idea into a fully realised novel has been an exciting challenge.” The novel has been praised ahead of its release by comedian Sarah Silverman and Salman Rushdie, who wrote: “It seems wrong to say that so dystopian a novel is great fun to read, but it’s true. I suspect that Thomas Pynchon and Hunter S Thompson would love this book.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/20/rees-mogg-criticised-over-firms-russian-bank-investment","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T17:48:23Z","webTitle":"Rees-Mogg criticised over firm's Russian bank investment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/20/rees-mogg-criticised-over-firms-russian-bank-investment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/20/rees-mogg-criticised-over-firms-russian-bank-investment","fields":{"headline":"Rees-Mogg criticised over firm's Russian bank investment","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jacob Rees-Mogg was accused by Labour of “letting the side down” because his fund management firm profits from a £60m investment in a Russian bank that has been the target of European Union sanctions since 2014. The criticism came after Somerset Capital Management (SCM) confirmed that it runs an emerging markets fund that holds a stake worth around £60m in Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank. The arch-Brexiter is a partner in SCM and normally earns £14,500 a month for 30 hours’ work there. Owning shares in a sanctions-restricted Russian bank is legal but surprising given Rees-Mogg last week called on Theresa May to hurt Russia by introducing tougher economic sanctions against the country in the wake of the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Referring to Vladimir Putin’s Russia, Rees-Mogg told May in the Commons last week that “tyrants need to be stood up to” and added: “I encourage her to impose a freeze on assets, so that people do not have the opportunity of taking them out of the country in the short term.” Alison McGovern, a Labour MP, said Rees-Mogg should be prepared to back up his words with actions. “British politicians cannot let the side down,” she said. “We have to protect the existing effectiveness of financial measures or Putin will think Britain is simply not serious.” Sberbank is one of several Russian banks that have been subject to EU-wide sanctions since the Ukraine crisis of 2014. It is banned from borrowing money with more than 30 days’ maturity across Europe. In the United States, the limit was tightened to 14 days following allegations of Russian meddling in the presidential election. Rees-Mogg is a founding partner of SCM, which specialises in emerging markets investment. As a partner he is eligible to receive dividends from the firm, although there is no requirement to disclose this on the register of member’s interests. The investment was first noted by Political Scrapbook and it is not the first time there has been controversy about Rees-Mogg and SCM’s investments. Rees-Mogg is opposed to abortion, even in the case of rape, but Somerset invested £5m in an Indonesian pharmaceutical company, Kalbe Farma, which makes stomach ulcer pills that are also widely used to trigger terminations in the south-east Asian country, where abortion is illegal. SCM runs several funds, the portfolios of which are not usually disclosed. But its emerging markets growth fund, with £1.4bn under management, is listed on Hargreaves Lansdown, because retail investors can buy into it. A listing there, which SCM said was accurate, says that the Sberbank holding accounts for 4.1% of the fund, or around £60m. Despite the sanctions, Sberbank would appear to be a good investment. Its London-listed shares are worth roughly four times what they were in May 2015. Rees-Mogg did not respond to a request for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/20/brexit-weekly-briefing-uk-major-concessions-transition-agreement-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T06:00:36Z","webTitle":"Brexit weekly briefing: transition is a done deal as Britain backs down","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/20/brexit-weekly-briefing-uk-major-concessions-transition-agreement-eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/20/brexit-weekly-briefing-uk-major-concessions-transition-agreement-eu","fields":{"headline":"Brexit weekly briefing: transition is a done deal as Britain backs down","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing.

The big stories Britain and the EU agreed the terms of a standstill transition period beginning when the UK exits the bloc in March next year and ending in December 2020, giving some reassurance to businesses worried by an imminent regulatory cliff edge. But Britain had to make major concessions to strike a deal – and because “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed” the transition period will only happen if the two sides reach a legal article 50 withdrawal agreement, which is far from certain. On the biggest obstacle to an article 50 accord, the UK was forced to accept that Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic would stay in regulatory alignment unless a hard border can be avoided either by a future trade deal or new technology. Among other UK climbdowns: the transition period cannot be extended; the future relationship cannot be negotiated until the transition is over; and Britain must abide by European court of justice rulings during the transition and continue paying into the EU budget until 2064. Despite earlier pledges, Britain has also had to allow EU vessels continued access to its fisheries and permit free movement (with the same rights) throughout the transition period. Nor can it implement any trade deals negotiated with third countries until after 2020. In short: although the CBI welcomed a status quo transition as “a victory for common sense” that “lifts a cloud of uncertainty”, it came at heavy cost – and provides little or no certainty about the future relationship.

Top comment The New Statesman’s political editor, George Eaton, writes that the transition agreement shows “the EU, not the UK, has taken back control” – leave politicians have been forced to back down on every front: In the distant era of 2016, Brexiteers insisted no transition at all would be needed. Britain, leave politicians promised, would simultaneously negotiate its divorce from the EU and a new trade deal. After last year predicting a summer-long row, David Davis capitulated on the first day of the EU talks. Since then, the government has accepted a £35-39bn divorce bill (a figure for which Boris Johnson said the EU could ‘go whistle’), which will not be paid off until 2064. It has agreed to grant EU citizens full rights during the transition period (with European court of justice oversight until 2027). It has accepted a ‘backstop’ plan of keeping Northern Ireland under EU law to avoid a hard border with the republic. More than four years on from the referendum, in the summer of 2020, the UK will have no new trade deals in place. The risk is now not that the agreed transition is too long but that it is too short. But the Tories are determined to break free well before the next election (2022) and the EU has no desire to allow the UK to linger in a Brexit antechamber. Once Britain formally exits the EU, however, its weak negotiating position will become weaker still. The point at which the economic self-harm of Brexit finally becomes clear has been deferred – but it has not been averted. The actor Patrick Stewart, writing in the Guardian, says war shaped his childhoodand Brexit shouldn’t be allowed to risk the peace – UK citizens should be allowed another say: When the UK and Ireland were brought in as members I felt, for the first time in my life, that the brutality of the wars of 1914-18 and 1939-45 could never happen again, and at last collaborative, collective cooperation would assure benefits for everyone. Perhaps I had too utopian a vision of what a new Europe might be like. Nevertheless, the term ‘European’ had come to mean something different. The first time I was back on the continent after the 2016 referendum I felt distinctly uncomfortable, bordering on ashamed, that my country was now seeking to unravel all that had been achieved. Especially given that the Brexit campaigners deceived the British people with their false and deliberately misleading slogans and speeches. Doctors, nurses and staff are quitting, many of them to return to the countries they left. We have told them, in effect: ‘We don’t want you. Go home.’ A recent report from the LSE found that in the most pessimistic scenario the cost of Brexit could be as high as £6,400 for each household. So I want to urge that we think again, now that we are learning the real cost of Brexit.

In a letter to the education secretary, Damian Hinds, the city’s primary school heads said they no longer had the resources to properly look after children with special educational needs (SEN). Hull’s specialist schools and pupil referral units were all full and mainstream schools were finding it “virtually impossible” to deal with the influx of children with specialist needs or challenging behaviour, they said. “Mainstream schools are increasingly having to resort to fixed-term and permanent exclusion to deal with challenging pupils. This is despite the best efforts of dedicated staff in schools. There is a feeling that something has to change or schools will implode,” the headteachers wrote. Teaching unions raised alarm about what they described as a “crisis in high-needs funding” after freedom of information requests in December revealed a £226m shortfall between the amount provided by central government and the amount local authorities across the country said they needed. In Hull, the high-needs budget is in a £2.2m deficit. As many as 526 children aged four and under in Hull have been identified as displaying challenging behaviour or SEN – a figure that has grown in recent years, according to Michael Whale, the Hull secretary of the National Education Union. “This is a ticking timebomb that is heading towards mainstream schools in the first instance,” he said. Whale said the city’s six specialist schools and five pupil referral units were full. One of those schools, Northcott, recently had 100 applications for 18 places for pupils with SEN, he said. Headteachers in the city said schools were struggling to cope with a “perfect storm” of squeezed school budgets, increased demand on SEN provision and cuts to children’s services, which they said had previously acted as a safety net to resolve issues before they were brought into schools. In the letter to Hinds, the heads demanded a £5m increase in high-needs funding “to ensure that no child is left behind”. They said the city had twice the national average of children in social services care and that one-third of the city’s families were in relative poverty, which they said was statistically likely to affect children’s education. Phil Webster, the Hull councillor responsible for education, said the council had seen an increase in requests for statutory assessments of children with SEN following the introduction of government reforms in 2014. The changes have been met with confusion and criticism by some schools, councils and campaigners. Webster said: “This increase is resulting in a significant pressure on the high-needs budget. We are aware of the concerns raised by schools and are working closely with the headteachers and other agencies in the city to increase specialist provision and support through a variety of proposals.” A Department for Education spokesman said: “Core schools and high-needs funding has been protected in real terms per pupil and will rise to a record £43.5bn in 2019-20.” The spokesman said Hull would receive more than £28m in high-needs funding in the next financial year, 3.6% higher than presently, and the budget was due to rise to more than £29m in 2019-20. However, schools and councils have said the pressure on resources is far outstripping any rise in funding, driven partly by central government extending the age for which local authorities are responsible for young people with SEN from 18 to 25. The number of children in England with a statement of special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), or an education, health and care plan (EHCP), has risen by 8% from 223,945 in 2010 to 242,185 in 2017, according to Cordis Bright, a public services consultancy. Whale said the crisis in high-needs funding was an issue for local authorities across Britain. He added: “The simple fact is that there are not the resources to properly provide the education that the children of Hull deserve. It’s ironic that a city that prides itself that no child should be left behind – well, I’m afraid that children are being left behind and it’s an absolute scandal.” The number of pupils in Hull with EHCPs – a measure of more complex special educational needs and disabilities – rose to 1,226 last year, according to government figures, following a steady increase over the past decade. This equates to 3% of the city’s total school population, higher than the national average of 2.8%. Schools in Torbay, in Devon, the City of London and Tower Hamlets have the highest percentage of pupils with SEND, at 4.5%, 4.4%, and 4.2% respectively."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/21/councils-foot-bill-prevent-homelessness-housing-need","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T07:30:05Z","webTitle":"Who will foot the bill to prevent people becoming homeless? | Patrick Butler","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/21/councils-foot-bill-prevent-homelessness-housing-need","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/21/councils-foot-bill-prevent-homelessness-housing-need","fields":{"headline":"Who will foot the bill to prevent people becoming homeless?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Southwark council’s housing solutions service is hidden away on a side street in Peckham, south London. Inside, the waiting area is crowded and tense. This is where you come if you have nowhere to live, or are about to be kicked out of your home. For the past year it has been a test site for the most significant homelessness legislation in England for 40 years, which comes into force next month. The Homelessness Reduction Act is the centrepiece of Theresa May’s mission to refresh the government’s lamentable eight-year record, which has seen all forms of homelessness soar, including rough sleeping, up 134% in England since 2010. A comparative study published today by EU homelessness organisations found low-income households in the UK have seen housing costs rise by 45% over the past six years (the second highest in Europe). May’s approach is, she said, to focus on “the underlying causes which can lead to somebody losing their home”. In a small cubicle, housing officer Natasha Staple starts an individual homelessness assessment. These can take up to two hours. The applicant, Joseph, 27, has been given notice to quit his shared housing association-owned accommodation after a breach of tenancy following a “breakdown in communication” with the landlord. There was an altercation, it transpires. A door was kicked in. Any medical needs, asks Staple. “Just mental health,” says Joseph quietly. In the past, Joseph could have been sent quickly on his way by his local council housing department. Because he is adult, single, and has no children or dependants he may not have been regarded as a legal “priority” for housing help. As a result, he may have ended up sofa surfing, or even rough sleeping. Joseph had his bags packed in anticipation of leaving (although Southwark says his serious mental illness means it would be highly likely he would have been rehoused). The council’s intervention means he will be staying put for now, until a room in supported housing can be found. He won’t be on the streets. Whereas before, local authorities could turn away those deemed to be less vulnerable, under the act, single adults like Joseph are guaranteed help of some kind. From next month, English councils will have a duty to assess all eligible applicants who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, identify their housing needs, and provide them with a personalised housing plan (although it does not extend to a right to housing). From 3 April, authorities must take “all reasonable steps” to prevent and relieve homelessness. On their part, applicants will be expected to “co-operate” with the council. Whether helping tenants off the street, maintaining a threatened tenancy, or finding alternative homes, the idea is to try to stop people falling into housing crisis, and to arrest the growth of homeless households ending up in expensive temporary accommodation. It hopes to emulate the early success of the Housing Wales Act 2014, which triggered a fall in Welsh homelessness (and spending) after councils adopted a more preventive approach, which included paying rental deposits and letting agents fees, and in some instances clearing the rent and mortgage arrears of those facing eviction. “Any law that can help reduce homelessness we welcome,” says Stephanie Cryan, deputy leader at Labour-run Southwark council, which has been piloting the new duties for just over a year. It has had a positive effect. Southwark’s £1m two-year pilot grant from the government has enabled it to hire 13 more staff (an increase of 30%). It has brought in expert advice through partnerships with housing charities Shelter and Solace Women’s Aid. It is doing more mediation work, Cryan says, to reconnect young people with their families. In 11 months, thousands more people have accessed the service and, she says, results are encouraging. A year ago, 326 homeless households were in unsuitable bed and breakfast accommodation; since November there have been none. Some 358 households have been placed in private sector housing to prevent them becoming homeless, an increase of 66%. But Cryan warns the act could become “the sticking plaster on the severed artery”. This endeavour has not come cheap. Southwark topped up pilot spending with £750,000 from its own budget. That level of investment can’t go on, Cryan says, as local government resources become increasingly squeezed. More people, including low-income working families, are at risk of losing their homes as a result of welfare reform and rising rents, and finding it harder to find somewhere else to live as more landlords refuse to rent to tenants on housing benefit or universal credit. “The good news is we are preventing more homelessness,” says Cryan. “But how do we fund it? That’s the worry.” Labour-run Newcastle city council,chosen as a government homelessness prevention trailblazer in 2016, has been developing a programme to prevent people losing their homes since 2013 as part of its ambition to be a homelessness-free city. Council deputy leader Joyce McCarty welcomes the Homelessness Reduction Act “as a way of helping others to do what we are already trying to do”. She adds: “It reassures us we are going in the right direction.” The city has been carefully stitching together a comprehensive early intervention safety net, bringing together a wide range of local agencies, including Jobcentre Plus, to work closely to help households at risk of losing their home. The guiding principle is to stop debt and poverty escalating into a homelessness crisis. As a result, it says, fewer people are being formally registered as homeless, and social housing evictions are down, while more people at risk have been kept in their home. English councils have been allocated £72m over three years to help them with the cost of the new duties. Newcastle, like many other councils, does not believe this is enough. And it is lucky to have social housing available, unlike councils in areas where high rents and right to buy have decimated the affordable housing stock. The test of the Homelessness Reduction Act, says McCarty, is how far it can cope with the contradictions of government policy: seeking to prevent homelessness, while at the same time driving forward welfare reforms, such as the benefit cap and the housing benefit freeze, that put people at risk of losing their homes; shifting huge homelessness duties on to councils, while simultaneously shredding their budgets. No doubting the act’s intentions; whether it will work is another question altogether."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/19/cynthia-nixon-governor-new-york-running-against-andrew-cuomo","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T19:11:57Z","webTitle":"Cynthia Nixon announces candidacy for New York governor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/19/cynthia-nixon-governor-new-york-running-against-andrew-cuomo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/19/cynthia-nixon-governor-new-york-running-against-andrew-cuomo","fields":{"headline":"Cynthia Nixon announces candidacy for New York governor","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The actor Cynthia Nixon announced that she is running for New York governor on Monday, in a move that will pit her against the incumbent Democrat, Andrew Cuomo. Nixon, best known for her role in Sex and the City, had long been rumored to be mulling a bid for the governorship. She declared her run on Twitter. “I love New York, and today I’m announcing my candidacy for governor,” Nixon said. She posted a campaign video which focuses on inequality and the need for education reform – Nixon is a longtime education activist in New York City. “I’m a proud public school graduate and a prouder public school parent,” Nixon says in the video. “I was given chances I just don’t see for most of New York’s kids today. “Our leaders are letting us down. We are now the most unequal state in the country with both incredible wealth and extreme poverty.” Nixon will face a tough battle against Cuomo, who is running for his third term as governor, although the incumbent was given a closer-than-expected run by the progressive Zephyr Teachout in 2014. Nixon, who would become both the first female and first openly gay governor of New York, became a vocal defender of public education in the early 2000s, when then New York mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed cutting the schools budget. She also campaigned for same-sex marriage before the supreme court ruling in favor in 2015 and fundraised for New York City mayor Bill de Blasio in his 2014 campaign. Nixon spoke at the Women’s March in January 2017 and at the progressive People’s State of the Union event earlier this year, and has been a vocal critic of Donald Trump. “We want our government to work again – on health care, ending mass incarceration, fixing our broken subway,” Nixon said in the launch video. “We are sick of politicians who care more about headlines and power than they do about us.” A request for comment sent to Nixon’s representative was not immediately returned."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/20/trey-songz-domestic-violence-charge","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T08:26:16Z","webTitle":"Trey Songz surrenders to LAPD to face domestic violence charge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/20/trey-songz-domestic-violence-charge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/20/trey-songz-domestic-violence-charge","fields":{"headline":"Trey Songz surrenders to LAPD to face domestic violence charge","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The US singer and rapper Trey Songz has handed himself in to police to face charges of felony domestic violence. On 21 February, Andrea Buera filed a police report claiming that he hit her in the face while the pair were attending a party in the Hollywood Hills, claiming that the musician became upset when she started talking to another man. She sought hospital treatment for her alleged injuries, TMZ reports. Songz, born Tremaine Aldon Neverson, denied Buera’s claims on his Twitter account: “I am being lied on and falsely accused for someone’s personal gain.” His lawyer, Shawn Holley, is said to have accompanied him to the Los Angeles Police Department, where he was booked at 6am on 19 March and released shortly after 8am, having posted a $50,000 (£35,600) bond. On 13 March, Buera gave a news conference in which she claimed that she and Songz have known each other for three years. In her account of the incident, she claimed, “Trey began yelling at me, choking me, punching me and ultimately he knocked me to the ground. While I was on the ground he continued punching me and he did not stop until his security guard pulled him off of me.” Buera claimed that the alleged attack left her with a concussion, and that she continues to experience trauma as a result. In August 2017, Songz pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer causing injury following an incident after a performance in Detroit in December 2016. He was required to complete anger management classes and pay compensation. Songz’s most recent release, Tremaine the Album, was released in March 2017 and debuted at No 3 on the US Billboard 200."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/20/homelessness-minister-heather-wheeler-austeriry","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T09:00:36Z","webTitle":"If you’re homelessness minister, maybe you should know something about it | Neil Coyle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/20/homelessness-minister-heather-wheeler-austeriry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/20/homelessness-minister-heather-wheeler-austeriry","fields":{"headline":"If you’re homelessness minister, maybe you should know something about it","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The new “homelessness minister” has begun her job badly. Heather Wheeler claims not to know why homelessness has risen for seven consecutive years – that’s every year since she was elected. She has also been gazumped by the Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, who is also chair of the government’s rough sleeping advisory panel. The panel has finally held its first, belated, meeting. Wheeler needs to get to grips with the brief she has held since January. The first step in tackling any problem is understanding what has caused it. Admitting she doesn’t understand this basic element of her brief is terrible news for homeless people and bodes badly for her government’s commitment to halve homelessness by 2022. I welcome this target as co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group for ending homelessness and support the minister’s claim she will “move heaven and earth” to tackle the problem, but the first step is a hard, objective look at how it has come about. Since austerity programmes pursued by the government in 2010, councils’ ability to tackle homelessness has been undermined by a dramatic reduction in funds to help build sufficient, genuinely affordable homes. Public health cuts and attacks on community pharmacy budgets have ended some drug and alcohol cessation services. Mental health services have been axed and direct financial support has been pulled from people’s pockets. The government recently announced, for example, it would have to reassess 220,000 people with mental health problems for personal independence payments after failing to properly take into account the impact of their conditions. The Department for Work and Pensions fought the case through the courts, wasting thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money, but has finally had to admit its mistake. Given that 40% of homeless people have a mental health condition, the scale of the government’s damage to this group is incalculable. With falling financial support, a failure to tackle the housing crisis, and a reduction in support to manage mental health conditions, the scene has been set. Universal credit has made matters worse for those people who struggle to manage finances, especially for the month-and-a-half automatic waiting period for a first payment. The personal debts and arrears clocked up in this period are worth about £5m to my local council alone and universal credit was specifically cited as the cause of homelessness by one man I met recently while out with St Mungo’s in Southwark. The minister’s failure to understand the root of the problem hasn’t prevented its rising visibility. With more than 300,000 families now in temporary accommodation and almost 5,000 people rough sleeping nightly, people are more aware of the issue. The death of a man on parliament’s doorstep shamed the UK and led to greater demands for action. Wheeler needs to catch up. The government’s absence of leadership created a vacuum that charities and others have struggled to fill. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, are pioneering their own efforts and extending help. The Robes Project in south London now covers 28 churches in two boroughs for the whole of winter, offering a safe, warm space for homeless people, and in some shelters even a hot meal. The appetite for change is growing: witness the thousands of referrals from the general public to the Streetlink app in London to help rough sleepers into shelters. The minister’s claim not to know why the problem has become so dramatic is a revelation. In any other job, I suspect an employer would be seeking her resignation. But then, Wheeler reports to a government with collective responsibility for causing this growth in homelessness. Ignorance may seem preferable to culpability. • Neil Coyle is Labour MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/20/scrapping-eu-tariffs-would-do-little-cut-uk-prices-institute-fiscal-studies","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T06:01:32Z","webTitle":"Scrapping EU tariffs would do little to cut UK prices – thinktank","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/20/scrapping-eu-tariffs-would-do-little-cut-uk-prices-institute-fiscal-studies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/20/scrapping-eu-tariffs-would-do-little-cut-uk-prices-institute-fiscal-studies","fields":{"headline":"Scrapping EU tariffs would do little to cut UK prices – thinktank","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Scrapping EU tariffs on foreign imports after Brexit would do little to cut the cost of a weekly shop in the UK, according to a report. In new research contradicting Brexiters’ claims that leaving the EU could lower the price of food on the shelves, the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank said consumers would see little benefit from the removal of trade tariffs, which are a form of tax applied on imported goods. Designed to protect domestic industry and agriculture – although sometimes criticised for driving up the cost of consumer goods – import tariffs on goods arriving in Britain are currently dictated by Brussels as part of the UK’s membership of the EU customs union. Leaving the EU gives the government an opportunity to set an independent trade policy and to cut the tariffs charged on imports, which Brexit backers have said would make the UK more competitive and benefit consumers. However, the IFS said the removal of these tariffs would reduce prices by as much as 1.2% overall. That would fail to offset the 2% increase in consumer prices caused by the sudden drop in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote, which has put pressure on household budgets and led to a slowdown in spending on the high street. The report is likely to reignite debate over the shape of Britain’s post-Brexit trade policy. Labour has called on the government to stay in a customs union with the EU, while the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, and other Brexit supporters want to strike new deals with the rest of the world. However, the prospect of a global trade war instigated by Donald Trump could undermine Britain’s chances of striking new deals, while campaigners have also warned the government against lowering its health and safety standards to boost trade volumes. Prof Patrick Minford, who leads the pro-Brexit Economists for Free Trade group of academics, criticised the findings of the IFS report, which was funded by the group UK in a Changing Europe. He said abolishing import tariffs could lower consumer prices by 8% and boost economic output."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2018/apr/06/vague-pixels-alter-army-indian-game-developers-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T08:55:11Z","webTitle":"Develop and conquer!

The 16-year-old game prodigies taking India by storm","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jaipur has a population of around three million people, but only one video game development studio – or so Vague Pixels claims. Founders Mridul Bansal and Mridul Pancholi are set to release their debut game, the frenetically paced action platformer Alter Army, at the end of the month. An early build of the game shows enormous potential – it’s a little rough-hewn, as you’d expect from an unfinished version, but it’s energetic, characterful and boasts an entertainingly hard challenge. What makes it more remarkable is that it’s been created in less than two years by 16-year-olds with no game design experience. In fact, as Bansal explains to me over a patchy Skype connection, the pair were barely 14 when they started working together. He had recently moved schools when he met Pancholi; they were classmates, but rarely spoke. “One day we heard each other talking about computers and game development, and we thought we should discuss it,” Bansal recalls. “I went to his house and we decided to start a project so we could polish our skills.” They set a target: develop a game in a month. They watched the documentary Indie Game: The Movie, and the success of its subjects, Edmund McMillen and Jonathan Blow (Bansal refers to them as “legends”), inspired them to pursue their idea further. Then they heard of a game jam in Delhi, and took a five-hour train journey to attend. Bansal showed Alter Army to the event’s organisers, who later offered to fund their project and provide development support. That was Bansal and Pancholi’s ticket to Nasscom, India’s largest game developers’ conference, where Alter Army was chosen as one of five finalists for the upcoming game of the year award. By this time, their parents were on board. “[They] used to tell us to focus on our studies, but then my father went to NGDC with us, and met a lot of the people who were supporting us. After that, he said I could make my own decisions.” And what do they think of Alter Army? “Actually, they don’t play games at all,” Bansal admits. “It’s like they don’t even know how to use computers properly, not even mobiles.” Inspired by indie hits such as Broforce, Hollow Knight and Nuclear Throne, Alter Army forces the player to be aggressive. Successful combinations mean you can move faster, hit harder and recover more efficiently. But Bansal says a lack of project-planning experience resulted in several false starts for the game, which in part explains their exhausting work schedule. For a while, the two would wake at 6am, got to school, arrive home at 2pm, finish their homework, then work on the game together until three the following morning. That’s changed now, Bansal says. After Alter Army squeaked through the green-light process on the Steam marketplace, Bansal expanded his role as lead designer to market it (Pancholi handles programming and art). Views of their videos on Facebook and Twitter were barely reaching double figures, but after approaching specialist publications for coverage he finally got a bite: PC Gamer ran an article about the game, which brought it to wider attention. Though everyone has told Vague Pixels not to worry about sales – experienced Indian developer Shailesh Prabhu advised the pair to pursue game development as a learning process for the time being – Bansal clearly hopes it will become a commercial success. “Obviously we are concerned about how it does, because it’s our first project. We want it to be popular.” In that light, the coverage has had its downsides. “In the beginning, we weren’t getting much popularity, so it [would have been] easy for us to release Alter Army even if no one saw it,” Bansal says. “But now more people know about us and the game, that puts pressure on us to make the game as interesting as possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/mar/19/barclays-wakes-up-to-find-a-bull-called-bramson-in-the-shop","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T19:40:15Z","webTitle":"Barclays wakes up to find a bull called Bramson in the shop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/mar/19/barclays-wakes-up-to-find-a-bull-called-bramson-in-the-shop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/mar/19/barclays-wakes-up-to-find-a-bull-called-bramson-in-the-shop","fields":{"headline":"Barclays wakes up to find a bull called Bramson in the shop","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Get ready for some sport at Barclays. Edward Bramson, an activist investor out of New York with a taste for barging into boardrooms and metaphorically smashing up the crockery, has unveiled a 5% stake in the bank. Previous UK targets have included F&amp;C Asset Management, Electra Private Equity and 3i, so Barclays represents a major step-up in ambition. It’s one thing to make a splash in the lower leagues of London financial firms, but another to try to call the shots at a highly regulated high street lender. But that is not a reason to think Bramson will divert from his usual practice of making specific strategic demands and never taking a backwards step. Jes Staley, Barclays’ £4m-a-year chief executive (yes, despite a share price that has gone roughly nowhere on his watch) may find Bramson to be a major irritation. His new activist shareholder is richer than him and has never been accused of being excessively charming. What does Bramson want? A higher share price, obviously. How does he think it should be achieved? His Sherborne fund is in its usual non-communicative mode at this early stage, so it’s impossible to know. But the investment bank could be on the radar. The division consumes two-thirds of Barclays’ capital but has produced sub-par returns for years. Demerge it? Sell it? Give it less capital? All those ideas would put Bramson on a collision course with a Staley regime that is committed to investment banking and thinks its strategy will come good within two years. The Staley philosophy says you can’t be half-hearted. His predecessor, Anthony Jenkins, tried running a pared-down investment bank and the experiment was deemed a flop. Bramson’s view could be fascinating. Does he, for example, think Barclays is better at generating bonuses for its top bankers than it is at making money for the shareholders? If so, bring on the debate – Staley’s “trust me” approach on investment banking has had a ridiculously easy ride so far. Optimistic, but out of focus Micro Focus’s share price hit £22 on the day in September 2016 that the UK’s largest quoted technology company unveiled its bold $8.8bn (£6.3bn) purchase of Hewlett Packard’s unwanted software division, including parts of the old Autonomy business. Now the shares are £10.11, down by almost a half on Monday as executive chairman Kevin Loosemore was obliged to concede that a deal that trebled Micro Focus’s size was a huge mistake. Actually, Loosemore did no such thing. Instead, Micro Focus argued that the “fundamental thesis” of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) acquisition “remains intact”. It is merely “operational issues” that have led to a “disappointing” short-term performance, including a miss on revenues that were supposedly fine in January. Top marks for optimism. But, come on, when the list of things that have gone wrong is so long, the distinction between a bad deal and bad execution is semantic. Micro Focus cited: “issues” with integrating the two IT systems, under-powered sales teams, poor cash collection and general disruption in separating HPE. One could shrug and say upsets happen in the world of cutting-edge technology. But that’s not Micro Focus’s market. The company operates in the dull, and supposedly lower-risk, field of rewiring legacy software systems with the minimum of fuss. But after only six months – the HSE deal completed in September last year – it has parted company with Chris Hsu, the chief executive who arrived with the new business. The plunge in the share price removed almost £4bn from Micro Focus’s stock market value. The reaction was severe, but so is the credibility deficit at a company that had previously prospered on a diet of much smaller acquisitions. Micro Focus shelled out $2.5bn in cash and doubled the number of shares in issue to the HPE deal. If you bet the farm, have a bullet-proof plan for integration. Why it helps to be nice to your shareholders It’s a bit rich for David Tyler, chairman of Hammerson, to grumble that a £4.9bn bid approach from French shopping centre group Klépierre is “opportunistic”. Tyler and Hammerson created the opportunity themselves by negotiating an all-share deal their own shareholders clearly hate – the planned £3bn merger with smaller UK rival Intu. Hammerson’s shares had fallen 18% since announcement of the Intu deal, which is in effect a doubling down on exposure to UK shopping centres, an asset class deeply out of fashion in the age of internet shopping. Klépierre’s initial pitch – a 615p offer only half in cash – is probably too low to succeed. But the French have given Hammerson’s board a clue on how to proceed: listen to your shareholders."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2018/mar/21/nerve-agent-attack-salisbury-scientists-supported-budget-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T07:17:04Z","webTitle":"​It shouldn’t take a nerve agent attack before UK scientists are supported","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2018/mar/21/nerve-agent-attack-salisbury-scientists-supported-budget-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2018/mar/21/nerve-agent-attack-salisbury-scientists-supported-budget-cuts","fields":{"headline":"​It shouldn’t take a nerve agent attack before UK scientists are supported","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The city of Salisbury has been thrust into the international spotlight after the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.

They are dedicated to their work, highly professional and, as we have seen over the last 10 days, able to respond promptly to matters of national security. Dstl’s remit is to maximise the impact of science and technology for the defence and security of the UK, but in my position as the deputy general secretary of Prospect, which represents a number of people who work at the facility, I know that government funding decisions have made that task harder. The figures are stark: the annual defence budget has been cut in real terms by 14% – or £6bn – since 2010. Total UK investment in defence research and development across the public and private sectors has been cut by around half in the past 10 years. Dstl is only part of the picture. There are many other agencies with predominantly civilian staff dealing with similar challenges. These include the Defence Equipment and Support agency, the Defence Infrastructure Organisation and the UK Hydrographic Office. At Dstl, turnover has declined by 12% since 2014, according to the accounts. Its specialist workforce has been reduced – figures provided to us by the Office for National Statistics show the number of science and engineering professionals working at Dstl has fallen by 2% in the last year. That trend is reflected more starkly in the Ministry of Defence (MoD) as a whole, where the decline is 8%. Of course these kinds of cuts will have an impact on the agency’s work. The government’s own review (pdf) of the MoD’s scientific and technology capability acknowledged this in 2015. Mark Walport, the government chief scientific adviser, said: “Even where Dstl retains a predominately in-house science and technology capability in chemical and biological defence, the panel deemed this as now being fragile. Further cuts could undermine the comprehensive approach required in chemical and biological defence and would weaken the science and technology capability as a whole.” These cuts are often overlooked. They result in skills gaps in areas such as cyber threat analysis, electronics, software development, commercial services, radiation protection, health physicists and contract management. Civilian staff are the backbone of our defence industry, but they have been cut by a third since 2010, with further cuts planned before 2020. The 1% pay cap has made retention and recruitment harder, particularly among mid-career experts, recent graduates and apprentices who have finished their training, all of whom can earn much more money in the private sector. There are growing concerns about the reliance of some departments on the skills and experience of employees due to retire within the next 10 years. The announcement by the defence secretary last week that the government will build a new £48m chemical weapons defence centre is welcome if it presages more investment in Dstl, but it must be understood against a background of inexorable cuts to funding. It shouldn’t take such a serious incident to remind the government that there are public servants working behind the scenes to keep us safe. Flashy announcements in response to a crisis are no substitute for the sustained investment and competitive pay needed to help organisations like Dstl.

In secretly recorded conversations, Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix, claimed he had met Trump “many times”, while another senior member of staff said the firm was behind the “defeat crooked Hillary” advertising campaign. “We just put information into the bloodstream of the internet and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again over time to watch it take shape,” said the executive. “And so this stuff infiltrates the online community, but with no branding, so it’s unattributable, untrackable.” Caught on camera by an undercover team from Channel 4 News, Nix was also dismissive of Democrats on the House intelligence committee, who had questioned him over Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign. Senior managers then appeared to suggest that in their work for US clients, there was planned division of work between official campaigns and unaffiliated “political action groups”. That could be considered coordination – which is not allowed under US election law. The firm has denied any wrongdoing. Cambridge Analytica said it had a firewall policy in place, signed by all staff and strictly enforced. The disclosures are the latest to hit Cambridge Analytica, which has been under mounting pressure since Sunday, when the Observer reported the company had unauthorised access to tens of millions of Facebook profiles – and used them to build a political targeting system. In Tuesday’s second instalment of an undercover investigation by Channel 4 News in association with the Observer, Nix said he had a close working relationship with Trump and claimed Cambridge Analytica was pivotal to his successful campaign. “We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting. We ran all the digital campaign, the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy,” he told reporters who were posing as potential clients from Sri Lanka. The company’s head of data, Alex Tayler, added: “When you think about the fact that Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 3m votes but won the electoral college vote that’s down to the data and the research. “You did your rallies in the right locations, you moved more people out in those key swing states on election day. That’s how he won the election.” Another executive, Mark Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analytica’s political division, was recorded saying: “He won by 40,000 votes in three states. The margins were tiny.” Turnbull took credit for one of the most well known and controversial campaigns of the last presidential campaign, organised by the political action group Make America Number 1. “The brand was ‘Defeat Crooked Hillary’. You’ll remember this of course?” he told the undercover reporter. “The zeros, the OO of crooked were a pair of handcuffs ... We made hundreds of different kinds of creative, and we put it online.” Turnbull said the company sometimes used “proxy organisations”, including charities and activist groups, to help disseminate the messages – and keep the company’s involvement in the background. When the undercover reporter expressed worries that American authorities might seize on details of a dirty campaign, Nix said the US had no jurisdiction over Cambridge Analytica, even though the company is American and is registered in Delaware. “I’m absolutely convinced that they have no jurisdiction,” he told the purported client. “So if US authorities came asking for information, they would simply refuse to collaborate. “We’ll say: none of your business.” Turnbull added. “We don’t talk about our clients.” Speaking to Channel 4 News before seeing the undercover film, Hillary Clinton said: “There was a new kind of campaign that was being run on the other side, that nobody had ever faced before. Because it wasn’t just all about me. It was about how to suppress voters who were inclined to vote for me … when you have a massive propaganda effort to prevent people from thinking straight, because they’re being flooded with false information.” In the report, Nix also implied that it was possible to mislead authorities by omission, discussing his appearance in front of the House intelligence committee, for its inquiry into possible Russian election meddling. The Republicans only asked three questions, which took five minutes, he told the reporter. And while the Democrats spent two hours questioning him, he claimed they were so far out of their depths that he didn’t mind responding. “We have no secrets. They’re politicians, they’re not technical. They don’t understand how it works,” he said, when asked about whether he was forced to testify. He went on to describe how political candidates are manipulated. “They don’t understand because the candidate never, is never involved. He’s told what to do by the campaign team.” The reporter asks if that means the candidate is just a puppet, and Nix replies simply: “Always.” In another exchange, Tayler describes an apparently planned division of spending on the campaign trail, with the candidate organising “positive” messages, with negative attack ads left to the super Pacs, which may engage in unlimited political spending independently of the campaigns. “As part of it, sometimes you have to separate it from the political campaign itself ... campaigns are normally subject to limits about how much money they can raise. Whereas outside groups can raise an unlimited amount.” “So the campaign will use their finite resources for things like persuasion and mobilisation and then they leave the ‘air war’ they call it, like the negative attack ads to other affiliated groups.” This raises questions over whether Cambridge Analytica blurred the boundaries between official campaign groups, which have spending limits, and unaffiliated political action groups or super Pacs. The latter can spend as much as they want but must not coordinate with the candidate they support. The Campaign Legal Center has accused Cambridge Analytica over allegations of illegal coordination of this nature. It has filed evidence with the FEC alleging that the super Pac Make America Number 1 made illegal contributions to Trump’s campaign, “engaging in unlawful coordinated spending by using the common vendor Cambridge Analytica”. Cambridge Analytica said it had never claimed to have won the election for Donald Trump. “This is patently absurd. We are proud of the work we did on that campaign, and have spoken in many public forums about what we consider to be our contribution to the campaign.” It said there was no evidence of coordination between the Make America Number 1 super Pac and the Trump campaign. The company said it was not under investigation. It has accused the Channel 4 News undercover investigation of grossly misrepresenting how the company conducts its business. However, speaking to the BBC on Monday, Nix said he had “huge amounts of regret that we undertook this meeting and spoke with a certain amount of hyperbole”. On Tuesday the website Politico reported that Trump’s 2020 campaign was moving to distance itself from Cambridge Analytica. A campaign official told Politico it had no existing contracts with the firm and no plans to hire it in the future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/28/britain-ideas-factory-uk-industry-creators-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T05:00:13Z","webTitle":"Meet Britain’s Willy Wonkas: the ideas factory that could save UK industry | Aditya Chakrabortty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/britain-ideas-factory-uk-industry-creators-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/britain-ideas-factory-uk-industry-creators-economy","fields":{"headline":"Meet Britain’s Willy Wonkas: the ideas factory that could save UK industry","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 1985, one of the world’s greatest scientists rang the alarm. After a career in biology, Edward O Wilson was convinced that Earth was being stripped of its variety of life. Scientists hadn’t even counted all the species sharing the planet, yet they were already disappearing fast. In a paper soon to become seminal, he set out the looming catastrophe. The chopping down of tropical rainforests meant that, within a century, about 12% of all bird species in the Amazon basin would be lost for ever. This was a mass extinction – “the most extreme for 65 million years”. Titled The Biological Diversity Crisis, his essay helped give birth to a shorthand: biodiversity. This new discipline began from the premise that all species matter – indeed, that when one dies out they all suffer. An expert on the unphotogenic ant, Wilson wryly acknowledged “the natural human affection for big organisms”, for sleek dolphins and cute chimps. But he also knew that even a mouse “is richer in information than a Caravaggio painting, Bach fugue, or any other great work of art”. Although an environmentalist, his warning applies to post-industrial Britain too. Because our economy has become more and more unbalanced, with our fortunes hitched to a few industries in one corner of the country, while we let other sectors, such as manufacturing, slide. That last sentence is not mine, but taken word for word from David Cameron’s very first speech upon moving into No 10 in 2010. And he was right: the UK’s lack of economic diversity led it to be utterly flattened by the banking crash. Shamefully, despite identifying the problem, he did almost nothing about it. A decade after the crash, finance grips London more tightly than ever. No longer penned into the Square Mile and Canary Wharf, it now gropes its way along the South Bank and has turned Mayfair into a shadow-banking quarter. The rest of the city centre provides butler services to the super-rich: luxury developers and estate agents, fad restaurateurs, tax-loophole spotters, reputation launderers in PR. For Cameron’s Conservative colleagues, this is success, to be celebrated. In 2014, the capital’s then-mayor, Boris Johnson, rejoiced: “London is to billionaires what the jungles of Sumatra are to the orangutan. It is their natural habitat.” Groovy for the great apes, not so fun for us worker ants. Economic diversity in the heart of the capital now hides out in some unlikely places. Go to Bermondsey, just a tube stop away from London Bridge. Follow the signs to the old further education college, whose students and teachers have long gone. Upstairs is a former home economics kitchen, the kind in which you tried and failed to cook an apple crumble. Except now it’s a farm. Over by the windows, mealworms are breeding. Running along the walls are tanks of fish. In the middle is a mini-greenhouse with huge water tanks where tomatoes and squash will sprout. Any free space is crammed with leafy green plants. And just wait till you hear the plans for a trout farm. Here, slap-bang in the middle of the capital, lies agriculture. Nestling in this abandoned college are a whole bunch of companies. And the laser cutters and 3D printers make it a manufacturing site too. Most of all, it’s a challenge to Britain’s crocked model of how to shape a city, how to a run an economy, and how to affix value. As challenges go, it’s rough and ready, and a tad dog-eared – but it demands attention. This deserted campus was spotted by a not-for-profit company called 3Space, which convinced the landlord to give it the keys until demolition day. Since then it has made it a base for an army of eager startups, who pay a modest rent. This income then subsidises other rooms that go free to non-profits. And one day in 2016, 3Space boss Andrew Cribb rang up a guy he’d met a while back. “Hey, Ande. Remember your crazy green idea?” he said. “Fancy doing it?” Cribb was wrong: Ande Gregson didn’t have one crazy idea – he had a couple. The green one came from reading about food. He’d see numbers, like the UN forecast that, by 2050, 9.8 billion people would share the planet, and he’d worry: how are we going to feed all of them? Then he’d read how 1.3bn tonnes of food are wasted every year, and he’d think: I’m going to help fix this. Him. Without government backing or a multinational’s budget. Him. With no background in food or environment. When he was nine, Gregson wanted to be a marine biologist – but as a child of the 1980s he was given a Commodore computer, and from that point it was technology all the way. His CV was peppered with names such as Apple, BT and Sky. What did he know about public sanitation? That was a big obstacle, which he hurdled with yet more unusual thinking. He opened a laboratory – called Green Lab – which others could use to invent solutions to the looming crisis in food and waste. He wouldn’t employ any of them, but they’d share the space and the hi-tech equipment, and make their own ideas fly. Green Lab is a makerspace, and Britain has more than 150 of them. But You can find thousands of others from Barcelona to Shenzhen. Gregson’s approach is the makerspace ethos in action. Rather than rely on big institutions to solve the food crisis, he just dived in, displaying the same bloody-mindedness that led him to compete in the Marathon des Sables (the “toughest footrace in the world”) not once but three times. Instead of snaring himself some qualifications, he brought in a pool of expertise. And when things got mucky, he got his hands dirty – clearing the kitchen of years of debris and turning old timber into benches and tables. Makerspaces are full of such stories – of begging and borrowing, of just doing it, of fools rushing in where angel investors fear to tread. “Animal spirits” is how John Maynard Keynes referred to it, the bullishness that gets businesses investing and consumers spending. In his canonical The Maker Movement Manifesto, Mark Hatch writes: “Make. Just make. This is the key. The world is a better place as a participatory sport. Being creative, the act of creating and making, is actually fundamental to what it means to be human.” Britons get their furniture from Ikea, their lunch in Pret and their love lives off Tinder. We buy, break and junk – and to hell with the environmental consequences. Instead of that pre-digested individualism, Gregson and other makerspacers want to improvise, recycle and collaborate. Gregson calls Green Lab a “Willy Wonka factory”: a crew of enthusiasts pursuing their own outlandish projects, all to do with making the most of our food supply and reducing waste. Fish skins are turned into leather; tiny green vegetables are grown in repurposed airducts. At Entocycle, black soldier flies are bred on spent grain from local breweries to turn them into a high-protein meal for salmon – a possible replacement for the far more land-intensive soya beans. This work has social value, yet most of the people here wouldn’t get space to do it elsewhere in the capital. The fish tanner, Anoushka Cole, is going through the same London hell as most other 28-year-olds: the only way she can afford her small flatshare on the city’s outskirts is by cramming three people into two bedrooms. A former cycle courier, Jon Katona spent half a decade carting around heavy, urgent deliveries on a precarious contract with no sick pay or holidays – a work-history that leaves him with little cash to get his sustainable drinks business off the ground. Gregson has a solution: outfits such as Entocycle, which has gained funding, can use Green Lab but “silver will cross my palm before you walk through the door”. Others such as Katona pay nothing, but are expected to help out with the composting system. Politicians in Westminster and London’s City Hall have essentially created a business model for the capital in which young people are expected to live and work in intolerable conditions; that in turn starves the city of the new ideas and energy on which it relies. Makerspaces are usually found in rundown buildings, with rudimentary toilets and equipment straining under all that shared use. They are small-scale factories, run not by a big company but by communities of the idiosyncratic and inventive. They are also oases of cheapness in a city that extorts money from its residents – and the great urban theorist Jane Jacobs knew the value of cheap. “For really new ideas of any kind – no matter how ultimately profitable or otherwise successful some of them might prove to be – there is no leeway for such chancy trial, error and experimentation in the high-overhead economy of new construction,” she wrote in The Death and Life of Great American Cities in 1961. “Old ideas can sometimes use new buildings. New ideas must use old buildings.” Green Lab bears that out to the letter: it’s a home for the genuinely speculative in an economy that thrives on financial speculation. Politicians love makerspaces – for all the wrong reasons. They coo over their digital technology and are wowed by their occupants’ relative youth. Yet they overlook how makerspaces’ tolerance for the uneconomic makes them so important – and so fragile in a city with galloping rents. Green Lab runs on borrowed things – most of all, borrowed time. By the end of this year, it will be booted out of that college, which will itself be bulldozed to make way for new flats and shops – and London will have lost a bit more of its economic diversity. In just the seven years to 2013, the capital saw almost 604 hectares – about 750 football pitches-worth – of industrial land disappear to make way for housing. The simple-minded assertion that London needs more houses, so often chanted by politicians and pundits alike, takes little account of how affordable they should be and where their occupants are meant to work if the space for employment has been magicked into concierge towers. Gregson is “building a piggybank” to move elsewhere, but is resigned to being edged out of the centre. This is happening to makerspaces across the city. Some die natural deaths: their animal spirits only carrying them so far. But others suffer the lethal blow of runaway rents. Machines Room is about to lose its east London home because its rent has doubled. “We’ve been talking to people for ages about possible new sites,” says Nat Hunter of Machines Room. “Just. Not. Happening.” David Cameron promised Britain that “the new jobs, the new products, the new ideas that will lift us up will be born in the factories”. Although they will never create thousands of jobs, makerspaces do fit the “new ideas” bit. Britain now does proportionately less research and development than Slovenia, but a place such as Green Lab is full of experiment and innovation. If politicians really do want to do more with makerspaces than use them for photo-ops, they could do so cheaply and relatively easily. Local councils could identify empty sites for makerspaces to set up, and could collect registers of residents and other businesses who are willing to help with accounts and marketing and old kit. Most of all, they could lean on Ikea, DFS and other retailers to tell their shoppers about these nearby scrappy little places (who pose no threat to such giants), where kitchens and furniture can be customised by young artisans who are inventive, and a damn sight more interesting to talk to than a self-service checkout. None of that requires money – just some of the effort and inventiveness shown by the makerspaces themselves. The reward would be young people getting a start in their careers, and a city retaining a bit of economic diversity. • We’d like to hear about your experiences of makerspaces, or similar.

After three packages exploded earlier in March, killing two people and seriously injuring another while baffling the authorities, the city’s police chief appealed on Sunday for the suspect or suspects to make contact. But later that night another bomb seriously injured two more people, deepening the mystery – and the alarm. The men, aged 22 and 23, were by the side of a road in a quiet residential area, known as Travis Country, about seven miles west of downtown just after 8.30pm on Sunday when, police said, they triggered a tripwire next to a fence. They were taken to hospital with significant injuries and were in stable condition on Monday morning. The location and the detonation method are in marked contrast to the three previous incidents. Anthony House, 39, died on 2 March. Then 17-year-old Draylen Mason was killed on the morning of 12 March and his mother was hurt. About five hours later, Esperanza Herrera, 75, was seriously injured. All three picked up packages left on their doorsteps that exploded; the package that killed the teenager detonated in his kitchen. Police had begun exploring possible connections between the victims. The two who died were African American and their families know each other, raising suspicions of a racial motive. The attacks took place in the east of a city in which the Interstate 35 freeway that runs through downtown has historically acted as a dividing line between predominantly white areas to the west and mainly black and Hispanic neighbourhoods on the other side. Sunday’s victims, though, are white; the neighbourhood is to the west, 10 miles from the previous attack; and the use of a tripwire in a public street suggests a perpetrator aiming for random targets. “We are clearly dealing with what we expect to be a serial bomber at this point,” Brian Manley, the police chief, told reporters on Monday. The latest explosion raises the fear that simply walking outside – particularly in the dark when a thin tripwire will be almost impossible to spot – could prove fatal. Police have appealed for residents to provide footage from home surveillance, such as doorbell cameras. Rewards for information worth $115,000 have been offered. Austin welcomed thousands of visitors last week for the annual South by Southwest festival. A man was arrested on Saturday for an emailed bomb threat that prompted the cancellation of a concert by the Roots, but police said the suspect was not linked to the explosions. The Travis Country neighborhood was cordoned off by police and residents were told to stay indoors. “We were not willing to classify this as terrorism, as hate, because we just don’t know enough. And what we have seen now is a significant change from what appeared to be three very targeted attacks to what was last night a target that would have hit a random victim that happened to walk by,” Manley said. However, the NAACP, the civil rights organization, on Monday called the bombings acts of domestic terrorism. Police were guarding the main entrance to the subdivision in Travis Country on Monday afternoon, with FBI trucks parked behind yellow crime scene tape. One local, who gave his name as Joe said: “This morning when I left the house I was even afraid to open the door, thinking there might be a wire there.” “We heard it at home. From a block and a half away it sounded very loud. it sounded like it was two [bangs] as the sound travelled.” The incident took place in an affluent area where the city’s dense urban core gently gives way to gated communities where secluded mansions nestle in rolling hills and abundant greenery features hiking and biking trails. “This is a family neighbourhood,” Joe said. “I can guarantee you it’s affecting the whole community … I have a 13-year-old and I have to worry about him, how it’s going to affect him.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/20/sister-jean-loyola-chicago-ncaa-tournament-nun","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T09:00:36Z","webTitle":"Sister Jean: how a 98-year-old nun became the hottest property in basketball","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/20/sister-jean-loyola-chicago-ncaa-tournament-nun","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/20/sister-jean-loyola-chicago-ncaa-tournament-nun","fields":{"headline":"Sister Jean: how a 98-year-old nun became the hottest property in basketball","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A 98-year-old nun has become the face of college basketball and the sport is probably all the better for it. Over the past week, Sister Jean Dolores-Schmidt, who acts as the chaplain for the Loyola University Chicago Ramblers, has became one the most recognizable figures in US sports following the team’s back-to-back upset wins in the NCAA Tournament, college basketball’s end-of-season showdown that has Americans glued to their screens for most of March. Dolores-Schmidt, who has fond memories of celebrating Loyola’s last championship win in 1963, was a cult figure in Chicago sports even before she became the team’s chaplain in 1994. But she’s no mere mascot and she offers more than just thoughts and prayers. The former player and coach provides scouting reports, pregame speeches and postgame analysis by email, along with more spiritual guidance. “She’s like another coach,” guard Donte Ingram told the Chicago Tribune. “[In my first ever game], it caught me off guard. I thought she was just going to pray. She prayed, but then she starts saying, ‘You’ve got to box out and watch out for 23.’” Sister Jean’s fame blew up after an interview following Loyola’s buzzer beating win over the higher-ranked Miami on Thursday. Sister Jean made an immediate impression on TV audiences, as she celebrated in her wheelchair draped in the team’s Gryffindor-esque scarf. Once she was interviewed, her obvious love for the team and her basketball smarts won viewers’ hearts. Loyola’s 63-62 win over No3 seeds Tennessee on Saturday was Loyola’s second victory featuring a dramatic game winner, and ensured us that we will get another few days of Sister Jean. The Ramblers are the lowest-ranked team remaining in the tournament and, Sister Jean is the team’s most recognizable figure. She has received tweets from Barack Obama, another basketball fan with Chicago roots, and there’s a petition to get her to appear on Ellen. She’s perpetually trending on Twitter where her reputation is being defended by normally cynical journalists who demanding apologies from those heartless enough to direct the f-word at her and are hoping (perhaps even praying) that she survives the week without getting Milkshake Duck’d. Sister Jean was asked how she felt about being a national celebrity. She promptly took her interviewer to task: “Really, if I can correct you, international,” she joked. It makes a certain amount of sense that the most prominent figure of the 2018 NCAA tournament isn’t a player or even a head coach. An unconventional tournament demands an unconventional hero, and this March has been madder than most, and filled with upsets. Embarrassing flameouts have eliminated some of the event’s most recognizable names and endless replays and reviews have transformed the last minute of games into Kafkaesque nightmares. More often than not, however, the results have made it worthwhile. The UMBC Retrievers didn’t survive the weekend but they managed to secure their place in basketball history by being the first No16 to defeat a No1 in men’s tournament history with their first-round victory over Virginia. Loyola’s upcoming opponent Nevada? They gave us the second biggest comeback in tournament history, rebounding from a 22-point deficit to defeat Cincinnati on Sunday. As others have pointed out, college basketball needed all the “feel good” it could get. Heading into the tournament, the NCAA was dealing with not just the fallout of an FBI investigation into illegal payments to supposedly amateur players but a growing public sentiment that the greater scandal was the rules in place which prevent student-athletes from being paid legally. Fans desperately needed the in-game action to distract from the off-the-court ethical quagmire. It didn’t hurt that Arizona, Auburn, Michigan State, Seton Hall and other schools implicated in reports went down in the first two rounds. If you wanted to hope for a spiritually redemptive script for college basketball to follow, one could do worse than a series of games in which the sinning teams were punished and the lower seeds inherited the later rounds. If you were to write this story, filled with unlikely game-winning moments that we reflexively call “miracles,” why wouldn’t you include a basketball-obsessed nun helping her team achieve improbable victories? You don’t have to be religious in the slightest to understand that it would make a fantastic story if Loyola somehow make it the Final Four – or beyond – under Sister Jean’s watch. For what it’s worth, even Sister Jean thinks that this is unlikely. After Loyola’s defeat of Tennessee she admitted that she only had them going to the Sweet Sixteen in her bracket, not any further. She knows, as we all do, that sporting events aren’t morality plays.

When my parents bought it, the owner said the cat had disappeared and they couldn’t find her anywhere. The woman selling the house said: ‘If she comes back, can you look after her?’ And once we had moved in, she did come back – and then she was ours. It was soon after that that I was born, so Fluffy was the first pet I ever had. She was really cute. She always played with the string I used to dangle over her. I really loved her. And by getting to know her, she made me love cats so much. But she was always the most special, of course. When I was seven, we had to say goodbye to Fluffy. I remember being really sad. But her death taught me something important, which is that things in life do come to an end and you have to make the most of them while they’re still here. Now we have two new cats, Olive and Pip. I love them, too. Pets give you so much warmth and happiness. It’s like my mum looks after me and my brother, and we look after the cats. I really like that in our family.

There’s no reason why you should. He wouldn’t have done, if it hadn’t actually been him. His name’s Erik Hagerman and he used to be a Nike executive, but now lives on a pig farm and doesn’t even farm pigs. He just works on his art and goes for coffee and plays guitar and gives interviews to the New York Times. Which presumably he then doesn’t read, so the interviewer could have indulged in a rare consequence-free, easy-to-write hatchet job, but didn’t. I don’t mean to be snide – things I say neutrally just come out like that. It’s the rhetorical equivalent of people whose faces’ resting expressions look deeply sad or intensely cross, so they have to smile to seem normal (which must cumulatively be depressing or irritating, thus retrospectively giving them temperaments to match their looks). Because, as it happens, I support Erik Hagerman’s life choice. Then again, I’ve got a few nits to pick. For a start, the whole art thing’s a bit lame – you can see his stuff online. He just does sort of scrunched things and patterns and, well, fine, but if there’s enough rolling news in the world, there’s more than enough crap art. Plus, his non-consumption of news media seems to involve a lot of slightly precious “business”. It smacks of the self-involvement of those who believe their allergies make them interesting. For example, in order to avoid accidentally hearing any careless talk at the coffee shop he goes to every morning, he wears headphones playing white noise. He says music won’t do because “stray conversation can creep in between songs”. He still watches basketball on TV but on mute so that no contemporary reference sneaks through. And he’s given his lifestyle a name, which is annoying even before you hear the name, at which point it gets more annoying. He’s called it “the Blockade”. That’s all wrong, and not deliberately, I don’t think. A blockade is a siege. Ingress to, or egress from, an entity is prevented by outsiders. What Hagerman’s doing – the entity in the middle trying to prevent ingress from the outside world – isn’t a blockade, it’s Trump’s immigration policy. What’s more, Hagerman certainly doesn’t oppose informational egress from the central entity in his blockade (which is him) because, as I mentioned, he gave an interview to the New York Times. It seems like he wants other people’s attention while simultaneously withholding his own. “Watch me ignore stuff!” is the pitch. However, leaving aside my cynicism about how Hagerman advocates his approach, the approach itself is tremendously attractive. The NYT interviewer touched upon criticism it had received in a way that, to me, merely encapsulated its appeal: “To avoid current affairs is in some ways a luxury that many people… cannot afford.” I mean, why not just liken it to a holiday in the Maldives? A lobster dinner? A dishwasher? Yes, not everybody can afford it: for many, ignoring the news is impossible because it affects them directly – just as, for many, buying a dishwasher is impossible. But does that mean, if you can, you shouldn’t? Probably. In an ideal world. But you’d need to have ignored the news for a very long time to be willing to believe that’s what Earth is. Capitalism is pretty horrible, but the various attempts at improving on it have either led to totalitarianism or gradually eroded back into capitalism. Or, in the case of modern China, both. Obviously, people are much more likely to get slagged off for ignoring current affairs than for buying dishwashers. And that’s appropriately capitalistic: keeping up with the news, like buying a dishwasher, involves purchasing stuff. Or, when it doesn’t, it involves being sold: allowing the fact that you’ve looked at something to be marketed to advertisers or worse. Either way, it’s economic activity. However, ignoring the news doesn’t add to the GDP and so, unlike other luxuries that do more tangible harm (eg air travel or golf), it can be widely condemned without commercial risk. Erik Hagerman himself broadly goes along with this consensus: “It makes me a crappy citizen,” he says of the Blockade. “It’s the ostrich head-in-the-sand approach to political outcomes you disagree with.” He has been pouring his energies into an ecological project instead – he’s bought 45 acres of former mine workings that he hopes to develop into a public park – and the New York Times interprets this as an atonement. Over the past few weeks, while not having to find subjects for columns, my own attitude to reading the news has become (to adapt Hagerman’s unsatisfactory blockade metaphor) a medium-strength raft of sanctions. I’ve kept half an eye on events, just in case I suddenly have to stock up on water purification tablets and look for a defensible cave, but no more than half. And I’ve loved the comparative calm of it, feel no guilt whatsoever and have no intention of paying for some penitential local swings. I think I’ll always value a vague sense of what seems to be generally going on – the alternative would feel like a denial of society. But the way the news reaches us these days, with so much of it either “fake” or “breaking”, is worse than ignorance. It’s a decontextualised screech that monetises its ability to catch our attention, but takes no responsibility for advancing our understanding or avoiding disproportionate damage to our peace of mind. It’s a barrage of human pain and tragedy, which our brains are not evolved to process without either retreating into a carapace of indifference, or perpetually experiencing the kind of trauma previously reserved for medieval villagers witnessing the Black Death. And it’s also up-to-the-minute micro-snippets of information about events, the real significance of which will only become evident in many weeks’, months’ or years’ time; it’s like trying to assemble a 5,000-piece jigsaw puzzle of Satan’s face by being given one piece every hour, each one accompanied by a bone-rattling fanfare. Under capitalism, current affairs are presented like this because it makes economic sense. The media generate money by getting our attention and we grant it most reliably not in response to the accurate, illuminating and proportionate, but to the loud, sensational and frightening. That’s a problem we can only solve by ignoring it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"guardian-masterclasses/2018/mar/19/how-to-build-your-perfect-pitch-deck-and-win-andy-pemberton-andy-cowles-business-course","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-masterclasses","sectionName":"Guardian Masterclasses","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T15:18:39Z","webTitle":"PowerPoint mastery - how to create a successful pitch deck","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2018/mar/19/how-to-build-your-perfect-pitch-deck-and-win-andy-pemberton-andy-cowles-business-course","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/guardian-masterclasses/2018/mar/19/how-to-build-your-perfect-pitch-deck-and-win-andy-pemberton-andy-cowles-business-course","fields":{"headline":"PowerPoint mastery - how to create a successful pitch deck","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This course has now passed, but you can be the first to know about the next one - and other workshops like this - by signing up to our newsletter here.

Your body gets turned inside out and there’s no gratitude for it afterwards. But after six months, it’s the most amazing thing. I have a problem with breastfeeding though. Your child won’t even look at you. It’s so rude. They don’t look at you adoringly. They’re just: “Shut up, bitch, give me your tit.” I was a very insular and shy child. Every extrovert is a closet introvert. When I was 15 I decided I’d had enough of being manipulated by other people and being what other people wanted me to be, and I decided to change everything. I’d accept invites to parties I wouldn’t have had before. I’d volunteer for stuff in class I hadn’t before. It was a conscious effort. I felt like I was dying inside. I had to force it, but then it became very natural. My mum is a socialist and I had that drummed into me as a child – the idea that everyone deserves to live a good life. I’m not very religious, but before bed every night, she’d make me pray. She’d tell me to say goodnight to all the dead relatives, to the trees and the sky, and then she’d put bits in from the day to thank people who’d invited us for dinner, or to think of the person we’d seen on the street asking for money, or the person on the news dealing with something. That taught me about empathy. Kindness has become very uncool. But I think it’s the coolest. The world needs empathy so badly right now because nobody is immune to any problem. People can become homeless so easily. People’s lives can fall apart. If someone in this government made a very bad decision, we could be seeking asylum in another country. We need to close the distance between people. #MeToo is complex. There are far too many issues to deal with in one hashtag. There are two major problems. One is everyday sexism. There is inequality between men and women, and there are sweeping statements made about women that are incorrect based on socially cultivated prejudice. And the other is much more extreme – where people have been raped, or abused, or had other horrendous things happen to them by powerful men. I think it’s really difficult to have a conversation about those things when you lump them all in together. I’m a decent cook. Paella is my specialty. I’m half Spanish so it’s a nostalgic food for me; it reminds me of childhood. Also, not a lot of people can make a proper paella, so people find it impressive when I serve it for them. I normally just follow Jamie Oliver’s cookbook. My baby has taught me I’m capable of anything. I think that’s why many women have children and come back and do better than they have before. I’m much more confident about my inadequacies. I don’t care about them any more. Life is hard, having a child with someone is hard. But I’ve realised that life is all about phases. If you hang in there and do the work, you will get out the other side. You’ll survive. There were times after I had my child when I thought: “This can’t be for ever!” But then you come out the end of the year and you realise: “Oh yeah, I do love you!” I’ve always been a piss-taker. I think people take life too seriously. I bumped into an old teacher of mine the other day, and he said: “Paloma, you were always capable of fitting into any subculture,” and I think it was just because I liked a laugh. There are things that are serious, but a lot isn’t. Paloma’s new album, The Architect, is out now.

In the mid-1960s he was a key player in the plans of his Canadian proprietor, Lord (Roy) Thomson of Fleet, to ring London with new evening papers, located on the emerging motorway network and printed on state-of-the-art web offset presses. With well-run local papers still profitable, the big idea was eventually to print and distribute Fleet Street newspapers away from the clutches of its famously disruptive unions. For a host of reasons Thomson’s plan never came to fruition. But in 1965 Green was the pioneer editor of the Reading Evening Post, who took it to a 55,000 circulation by 1969 and – despite local industrial troubles – a profit of £1m in 1979. By this time Green was managing director, heading for a seat on the TRN board as personnel director, supervising 8,000 staff in 14 regional centres. It had been a long journey for a man born in Barry, south Wales. His father, John, was a rivet warmer at Barry docks, while his mother, Doris (nee Cutler), was secretary to the docks manager. Howard attended St Helen’s school and then became a trainee reporter at the Barry and District News. He nearly caused a walk-out at Newport docks when he published dockers’ pay slips in the South Wales Argus, details not always known to their wives. Green moved to Reading after being Welsh editor of the old Empire News and deputy editor of the South Wales Echo. He took a clutch of “Taffia” talent with him, old journalistic veterans who trained the new breed of keen graduate reporters such as me with scepticism and patience. There is nothing quite like being a local paper reporter, covering everything from fatal car crashes and crime to the county council. Under Green, I became the arts reporter and education correspondent. He presided over all this in a benign way, even (I later realised) when his staff criticised the local grammar school, which his son was attending. He was an active Roman Catholic, the holder of two papal decorations. His first wife, Audrey (nee Lyons), with whom he had two children, Damian and Helen, died in 1998. He later married one of his former journalists, June Sparey, hired in 1967 after telling him he “ought to have a female reporter”. Damian became a Conservative cabinet minister. As such he was a colleague of Boris Johnson, over whose selection as Michael Heseltine’s successor in Henley Howard presided in retirement as chairman of the South Oxfordshire constituency association. Soft-spoken and emollient by the boisterous standards of his profession, Green was a warm and humorous man who inspired enduring loyalty. His last big job for TRN was to return to Cardiff and devise a plan to save the Western Mail. A venerable national institution, but loss-making, it was facing closure. Green saved it. He later became managing director at the Advertiser series in Essex before retiring to Shiplake in Oxfordshire in 1991. He is survived by June, Damian and Helen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/18/pub-saved-by-locals-serves-first-pint-after-reopening","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T16:57:27Z","webTitle":"Pub saved by locals serves first pint after reopening","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/18/pub-saved-by-locals-serves-first-pint-after-reopening","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/18/pub-saved-by-locals-serves-first-pint-after-reopening","fields":{"headline":"Pub saved by locals serves first pint after reopening","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A 15th-century pub near Bath that was saved from being turned into flats after residents raised more than £1m has served its first pint after reopening. Almost 500 residents chipped in to buy the Packhorse Inn in South Stoke, Somerset, from property developers who had bought it six years ago. Dom Moorhouse, the project lead with the Save the Packhorse team, said it was the biggest community pub buyback project in British history. “I think people got stuck in because they wanted to save a beautiful old building, but also because they did not want to lose a place of social connection,” he said. The pub’s rescue was partly made possible by the 2011 Localism Act, which allows communities to apply to their local council to have a building listed as an “asset of community value”. If the owner of a listed asset then wants to sell, a moratorium period is triggered during which it cannot be sold. The period gives community groups time to develop a proposal and raise the necessary funds to bid for the property. In March 2012, the Packhorse Inn was first put up for sale by Punch Taverns and sold to the highest bidder, who revealed plans to turn it into a residential property. But the village formed a committee with the aim of buying the pub back, and the act allowed them a period of time to gather funds. The law allows a council to deem a building to be an a “asset of community value” if it is or was used to further the wellbeing or social interest of the local community. Volunteers spent about 1,000 hours clearing out the pub’s garden, and 25 skips of rubbish were removed from its interior. Sunday’s reopening was welcomed by dozens of villagers including Brian Perkins, 87, who poured the first pint. He was born there when it was run by his family, and he had the reception for his wedding to his wife, Edith, 88, there. He told the Daily Mail: “I was very sad when the pub closed a few years ago. I would go to the pub every Sunday up until then. It was an honour to be asked to pour the first pint – a last bit of fame in my old age.” Moorhouse said he hoped the Packhorse would inspire others. “We’ve proved to local communities across the country what is possible and we’d love to see similar successes elsewhere. It’s been hard work but worth the effort. It’s brought together so many people across the generations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/19/fake-news-social-media-twitter-mit-journalism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"Why fake news on social media travels faster than the truth | Paul Chadwick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/19/fake-news-social-media-twitter-mit-journalism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/19/fake-news-social-media-twitter-mit-journalism","fields":{"headline":"Why fake news on social media travels faster than the truth","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"False news is more novel than true news, and that may be why we share the false much faster and more widely. Prominent responses to false news include surprise, fear and disgust. True news tends to be met with sadness, joy, anticipation and trust. Humans are more likely than automated processes to be responsible for the spread of fake news. These insights emerge from a large and impressive study published on 9 March in the journal Science. Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, interested in how and why true and false news stories spread differently, used 126,000 stories that had been tweeted by 3 million people a total of 4.5m times. The data spanned 2006, when Twitter began, to 2017. The study is unsettling reading, especially in light of what has so far emerged from US intelligence agencies, congressional inquiries and the special prosecutor Robert Mueller about use of social media to distort the 2016 presidential election. I hope the research helps to persuade more people that fake news powered by social media is a serious threat to all democracies’ health. A growing bundle of studies shows that this is a qualitatively and quantitatively new problem, not just a digital manifestation of the yellow press of old. Apart from effects on elections and referendums, fake news in social media can assist hate speech to turn into communal violence more quickly. And some government responses are troubling on free-speech grounds, such as Sri Lanka’s week-long ban on social media, or “digital curfew”. The MIT researchers studied what they called “rumour cascades”. A cascade starts with a Twitter user making an assertion about a topic – with words, images or links – and continues in an unbroken chain of retweets. The researchers analysed cascades about news stories that six fact-checking organisations agreed were true or agreed were false. The study found that “falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper and more broadly than truth in all categories of information”. False political news reached more people faster and went deeper into their networks than any other category of false information. The study compared the emotional content of replies to true and false rumours by using about 32,000 Twitter hashtags and a lexicon of about 140,000 English words that associate with eight basic emotions: anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy and disgust. Were automated processes, or “bots”, the main culprits in spreading falsity? No – the researchers found, it’s humans. Calling for more effort to identify the factors in human judgment that spread true and false news, including interviews with users, surveys, lab experiments and neuroimaging, the paper points to some obvious reasons to look deeper. “False news can drive misallocation of resources during terror attacks and natural disasters, the misalignment of business investments, and misinformed elections.” Two features of this study, besides its published results, are heartening. Artificial intelligence was successfully deployed to good effect, for example, a bot-detection algorithm. And Twitter provided access to its data, some funding, and shared its expertise. The researchers have conditionally offered to share their dataset. More openness by the social media giants and greater collaboration by them with suitably qualified partners in tackling the problem of fake news is essential. Traditional journalism organisations are potential partners too. They find, check and disseminate news, are well placed to assess veracity, attract masses of comment online and discussion on social media platforms, and have a clear incentive to maintain trust in their own contributions to democratic life. • A Guardian podcast released on 16 March includes more detail about the MIT study, including an interview with one of its authors. • Paul Chadwick is the Guardian’s readers’ editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/18/chelsea-liverpool-womens-fa-cup-quarter-final-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T18:58:57Z","webTitle":"Jonna Andersson sets up easy FA Cup win for Chelsea women at Liverpool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/18/chelsea-liverpool-womens-fa-cup-quarter-final-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/18/chelsea-liverpool-womens-fa-cup-quarter-final-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Jonna Andersson sets up easy FA Cup win for Chelsea women at Liverpool","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A game in miserable conditions is never straightforward, but Chelsea made their FA Cup quarter-final easy in the circumstances, dispatching Liverpool 3-0 at Valerie Park.

Chelsea’s first goal was scored by Jonna Andersson. The Swedish wing-back only joined the London club at the end of December but has made a fine start, and with 21 minutes gone applied a deft finish to Drew Spence’s low cross at the end of a sweeping move orchestrated by Ramona Bachmann. The away team extended their lead in the final minute of the first half, Katie Chapman powering a header over Siobhan Chamberlain after being left unmarked from Magda Eriksson’s free-kick. The error was repeated a few seconds later when Chapman was again first to an Eriksson free-kick – but this time her thumping effort was saved. Chelsea did not let up in the second half, with Drew Spence and Erin Cuthbert both coming close before Gemma Davison battled down the right and into the box, whereupon Alex Greenwood upended her. Maren Mjelde took the resultant penalty, sending Chamberlain the wrong way, and with 58 minutes gone, the tie was effectively over.

The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) is urging ministers to resist pressure to unwind key public health measures in their quest for a future transatlantic trade deal. “We’re concerned by the evidence of US hostility in trade talks towards countries that want to set their own domestic agenda on reducing sugar intake, particularly the push [from the US] to keep traffic light labelling voluntary. We can’t allow trade talks to undermine efforts to tackle childhood obesity,” said Prof Russell Viner, the RCPCH president. “Children’s health outcomes are much worse in the US than in many other comparable countries, and we don’t want to import these along with the sugar.” Viner’s warning comes as Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, prepares to fly to Washington this week for talks about the shape of a future UK/US trade deal after Britain has left the EU. Donald Trump wants US farmers to be able to export more of their produce to Britain after Brexit and has railed against the EU for its “very unfair” and “very, very protectionist” policies. Previous discussions have been overshadowed by a row over whether or not Britain in future would have to accept chlorinated chicken from the US as part of any agreement. Sustain, the food charity, highlighted a US government document on striking trade deals with other countries – the 2017 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers – as evidence of US “aggression” towards countries it trades with having tougher food rules than apply in America. “The US record on trade is clear. They export corn syrup, processed junk food and sugar. And along with it obesity, diabetes and diet-related disease,” said Kath Dalmeny, Sustain’s chief executive. “We’ve been told that No 10 is preparing to update its obesity strategy. Part of that must be to get us all eating more healthily. “But a sugary, junk-filled trade deal will drive a coach and horses through it all. We mustn’t sell off our children’s health in exchange for a trade deal with the US. Trade deals must put public health first.” Recent research by the Harvard University school of public health pinpointed free trade deals involving the US as a key factor in a process of “nutrition transition” – from a traditional native diet to a much more western one – which is producing greater obesity in countries as a result of globalisation. “Trade liberalisation gives people access to different types of food and, often, more high-calorie foods,” it said. “It also removes barriers to foreign investment in food distribution and allows multinational companies and fast-food chains to expand into new countries.” The authors cite China as an example of where globalisation has made low-cost, high-calorie food more available. Chinese consumption of meat and dairy products more then tripled between 1989 and 1997, while higher intake of vegetable oil between 1989 and 2004 – thanks to its fall in price – means that Chinese people now consume an average of 183 calories a day from that source. While globalisation has improved the life of many people in the developing world “it has also increased access to cheap, unhealthy foods and brought with it more sedentary, urban lifestyles. From a public health perspective the combination of these changes is creating a perfect storm of a catastrophic and costly rise in obesity and obesity-related disease.” There is also concern that Britain could be forced to accept lower-quality milk from cows with infected udders as part of a future UK/US trade deal. US rules on milk production allow it to contain more than double the amount of somatic cells – white blood cells that fight bacterial infections – than are found in British milk. The US dairy industry wants the UK to relax its standards and has lobbied the Trump administration about the future deal. Milk containing a high number of somatic cells is poorer nutritionally and of a lower quality, and can suggest low animal welfare standards. “In general, animal welfare standards in the UK are higher than in almost any other country, including the US,” Peter Plate, a lecturer at the Royal Veterinary College, said last month. “So a free trade deal has the potential danger to either dilute welfare standards here or put UK farmers into an uncompetitive position. We must avoid a race to the bottom.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/18/rugby-union-six-nations-scotland-gregor-townsend-italy","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T22:00:14Z","webTitle":"Gregor Townsend demands Scotland improvement in readiness for World Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/18/rugby-union-six-nations-scotland-gregor-townsend-italy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/18/rugby-union-six-nations-scotland-gregor-townsend-italy","fields":{"headline":"Gregor Townsend demands Scotland improvement in time for World Cup","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It has been a rollercoaster of a Six Nations Championship for Scotland who have hit the highs and the lows, admitted Gregor Townsend after they wrapped up their tournament with a scrappy late win in Italy. The head coach said the group had probably played to their potential for about four of the 10 halves of the games they had played, but even when performing well he saw room for improvement. “There will always be things to improve,” Townsend said. “The game against England was a great performance and a great win because of what it meant for the country, but having watched it a few times I know we could have been better – and that was probably our best performance. “We demand a lot of our players. We know they can deliver and it is about doing that over 80 minutes and also away from home against different opposition. That’s the challenge we have. This is a brilliant championship. The standard of rugby has gone up over the past few years, it is very hard to win away from home.” Statistically, an argument can certainly be made that Scotland are on the way up. Though they finished on 13 points in the Six Nations table, a point worse off than a year ago, the last campaign came with the advantage of a cycle where they had three home games. Two years ago, when they had the same cycle as this year, they would have had nine points under the current scoring system. The other significant stat is that it is the first time in the Six Nations that Scotland have won three matches in two consecutive seasons, beating all their rivals at least once and winning all of their home games. Statistically it is the first time they have managed the feat since the 1995 and 1996 seasons and only the third time they have managed it, though it was a much tougher task when the championship had only five teams. “We know a lot of work has to go in over the next 18 months. Over the next 12 months to have a better championship, and then over 18 months to have a good World Cup,” Townsend said. “In terms of performances in games I don’t think we have produced our New Zealand performance or our Australia performance [in the Six Nations], though for 60 minutes of the England game we were right up there. “What we have experienced in our last six months has been great for our development. We played the number one, two, three and four teams in the world and put on performances that asked them a lot of questions.” For Greig Laidlaw, who was captain before a broken ankle meant John Barclay took over, there is no doubt that the side are on an upward curve. “We have worked on our character in both defence and attack. We have been building this over a few years now trying to win ugly,” he said as he reflected on the Italy game where his 79th-minute penalty pulled them to victory. “We might not have come back from that a couple of years back. To be able to do that now is pleasing. Also to understand that when we are behind we can still back our skill-set and still cause teams problems. “That is part of the evolution. That has been pushed through the leadership group. Against Italy, it was really impressive. Everybody took a couple of deep breaths, listened to the leaders. The plan was there, we stuck to it and we pulled ourselves out of a hole.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2018/mar/18/letter-michele-hanson-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T16:09:41Z","webTitle":"Letter: Michele Hanson obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/18/letter-michele-hanson-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/mar/18/letter-michele-hanson-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Letter: Michele Hanson obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I was in the same year as Michele Hanson at Haberdashers’ Aske’s school in the 1950s.

There’s Yes featuring (original singer) Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin and Rick Wakeman. Then there’s this one, kept going (after founding bassist Chris Squire’s death in 2015), by guitarist Howe and drummer Alan White, whose back surgery has left him unable to perform for long. The rival band have branded them a tribute act, although flowing-haired singer Jon Davison (who once was in a Yes tribute act called Roundabout) doesn’t need his tight trousers to help tackle his predecessor’s angelic upper ranges. The younger vocalist explains that they are celebrating “50 years of Yes”, but with no song less than 40 years old, they are in fact honouring Yes circa 1971-78, when the band’s revolutionary mix of psychedelia, pop and classical (and Roger Dean album sleeves) bestrode the era like a prog colossus. Although two sides of 1973’s ornate, time signature-shifting double album Tales from Topographic Oceans starts to suggest why punk had to happen, the place erupts as White clambers on the drum stool for the final sequence and encores. Arguments still rage about which band is really Yes, but with 70-year-old guitarist Howe’s virtuosity undimmed and the ailing, trilbied drummer beaming at the ovations for Roundabout and Starship Trooper, these time-served warriors are surely entitled to a few more moments in the sun. • At Sage One, Gateshead, 18 March.

Salah has scored 36 goals for Liverpool in all competitions this season, a truly remarkable feat considering Easter is still a way off. His four goals against Watford on Saturday were just the latest in a campaign that looks set to secure his place in Anfield folklore. It is not inconceivable that the Egyptian could reach 50 goals by May and while that is a tall order, the fact is that he has defied all expectations and logic so far. Watford could summon no answer to Salah’s invention, wit and positional understanding yet the manager is still demanding another gear, even if he did admit that Salah’s talents as a striker are proving as revelatory to Klopp as to the man himself. “He [Salah] played more on the wing for Roma, where he had a very dominant striker in Edin Dzeko,” Klopp said. “Nobody could know [that he could play as a striker]. We learned it step by step. We didn’t know exactly that he’s capable of playing in the centre. “But we will not treat him like: ‘You don’t have to train, Mo – just come on Saturday for the game and we’ll see you there at Anfield or whatever.’ He doesn’t want that. He’s in the moment of his career but he knows there is a lot for him to come. He wants to learn and he wants to improve.” At one stage on Saturday evening Klopp could be seen applauding after Salah chased back towards his own half, one of his few attempts at adding something defensively to Liverpool’s cause. That is not to suggest he is lazy, just that some players do not have that instinct. Fortunately for Liverpool, Klopp believes Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané are putting in a lot of extra yardage so Salah can concentrate on finding the back of the net. “He does it. But sometimes he needs a little ... [reminder],” Klopp said of Salah’s defensive skills. “A lot of my players need that. Don’t misunderstand me, it’s only a thing, it’s not exactly the same strength. If you talk about Roberto, he loves running in that direction and chasing the players. If I said to him ‘Stop it’, he couldn’t. “That’s why I took him off, because he will never rest. He runs all the time but then Mo didn’t stop as well tonight – in the other direction. He took each sprint like the 100-metre final in the Olympic Games. That’s what I mean: the team adapts to the strengths. Nobody is talking and saying, ‘Mo, but you have to …’ At the moment, nobody is saying anything to Salah other than “carry on”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/18/letter-ednyfed-hudson-davies-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T15:50:24Z","webTitle":"Letter: Ednyfed Hudson Davies obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/18/letter-ednyfed-hudson-davies-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/18/letter-ednyfed-hudson-davies-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Letter: Ednyfed Hudson Davies obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The eccentricities of Ednyfed Hudson Davies endeared him to his students at the Welsh College of Advanced Technology in the 1960s.

You’re joking","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I’m increasingly disturbed by the “spycops” public inquiry into the undercover policing of political protest groups, which is having yet another hearing on Wednesday to decide whether or not individual officers should be identified. The Metropolitan police is dictating the terms of this public inquiry and, even to a former undercover police officer like me, it has begun to look like a whitewash. In 2015, in the spirit of transparency, police misconduct hearings were made public. This means that any constable accused of wrongdoing now features in local newspapers or the national press. So why isn’t the behaviour of the Special Demonstration Squad and the National Public Order Intelligence Unit – at the centre of this inquiry – being examined with the same transparency? We are told that there is a risk to safety. From whom, exactly? I was undercover for many years, and the jail time of all the people I put in prison adds up to about a thousand years. During the last hearing, Peter Francis, that spycop turned whistleblower, pointed out that this was greater than the total prison time meted out by the SDS in its 40-year history. Clearly, the SDS was not investigating dangerous people; there’s certainly no evidence to suggest they were dangerous. My life has genuinely been threatened on many occasions. I’ve put notorious gangsters behind bars who use rape and mutilation to build their reputation. I just can’t work out where the comparable danger is from London Greenpeace, or anti-war groups. If the spycops had infiltrated paramilitary groups or terrorist organisations, then of course I would concede a risk, but it is clear that this is not what we are talking about here. I now use my real name. I’ve published a memoir. People know that I live in Hereford. I gave up my anonymity because it was the right thing to do. Surely I’m in more danger than the officers at the centre of this inquiry? I have a particular interest – not just because of my history in the police, but also because I could have been one of those NPOIU officers. Mine was a different type of undercover work: my brief was to catch drug dealers, and by the late 1990s I’d had some years of success. I was approached to participate in political work: specifically, to infiltrate animal rights groups such as the Animal Liberation Front. I wasn’t interested, as at the time I was wholly invested in catching gangsters. I wanted to make the streets safer and thought that my work did that. So I asked my recruiter, where’s the bad guy? Why would I spend months, or even years, infiltrating a group of people who want to rescue beagles? I was approached again a few weeks later with a more earnest recruitment pitch. My nation needed me, I was told. If the group of businesses that relied on animal testing left the UK, then we could lose 5% of GDP overnight. This would apparently lead to a catastrophic recession. I was stunned by this “revelation”, but also dubious of the economics and a little offended that someone thought that this would persuade me. But, most of all, I was disturbed by the idea that police were being directed by political motivations. Or more to the point, that police were being used to protect a specific sector of business and the investments of shareholders. This aspect of long-term political spying demands examination and transparency. What is our democracy if the police are tools of politics and business? Multiple officers have – it is incontestable – used and abused women at the behest of the state, and there are no doubt more of whom we haven’t heard. And for what? As the Metropolitan police has revealed its position I’ve become increasingly shocked at the farcical claims and downright dishonesty. We are told that the anonymity of those spycops is essential to protect their privacy and their safety. The Met claims that these covert police were promised that their real identities would always be protected. It is a dark, uncomfortable irony that these officers cite article 8 of the Human Rights Act – about the right to privacy and family life – to avoid examination for systematically eroding this right for others. The notion that these detectives were promised permanent secrecy is ludicrous anyway – I was taught from the start of my undercover deployments that anonymity is a privilege. We always remain police officers, and accountable for our actions. The work I did was genuinely dangerous. I caught some of the most vicious gangsters in the UK, but I went into every operation knowing that if I behaved improperly the cost could be the loss of my pseudonym. It could not be more obvious that allowing transparency into these proceedings is the right thing to do. Those who have done wrong should answer for it. The abuse that has so far been revealed is shocking. The inquiry should be taking an investigatory stance to uncover every similar instance. I am appalled that yet again we have the establishment protecting itself at the expense of justice. • Neil Woods was an undercover police officer, and is the author of Good Cop, Bad War"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/18/judgmentalism-over-giving-beggars-belief","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T18:05:48Z","webTitle":"Judgmentalism over giving beggars belief | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/18/judgmentalism-over-giving-beggars-belief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/18/judgmentalism-over-giving-beggars-belief","fields":{"headline":"Judgmentalism over giving beggars belief","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s just so unbearably judgmental and patronising to decide not to give to a beggar because he or she might belong to the alleged 80% who are trying to fund a drug habit, and because the charities advise us not to do so (On our unruly streets, rich and poor are not so far apart, 17 March). I cannot help feeling that anyone in a position of having to beg, for whatever reason, is in a truly shitty position, so much worse than mine. It’s not up to me to insist on how the begging person is going to use the money I’ve handed over. In the shopping bag I’m carrying back to my warm home there’s likely to be a bottle of wine and maybe some unhealthy snacks and no one’s judging me. Meanwhile, the drug-free 20% (or maybe the drug-using 80% too, depending on where you stand) might still appreciate being accorded some respect and dignity by their fellow citizens, as well as an acknowledgment of their right to handle their money in whichever way they want. Such a position can legitimately co-exist alongside the official charitable and other efforts to tackle these serious problems. Peter Kaan Exeter • Ian Jack raises the age-old objection to giving money to beggars. To which the correct answer is “so what?” Samuel Johnson put it better though. When asked “what signifies, giving halfpence to beggars? They only lay it out in gin or tobacco”, he replied “and why should they be denied such sweeteners of their existence? It is surely very savage to refuse them every possible avenue to pleasure, reckoned too coarse for our own acceptance. Life is a pill which none of us can bear to swallow without gilding; yet for the poor we delight in stripping it still barer, and are not ashamed to shew even visible displeasure, if ever the bitter taste is taken from their mouths.” I’m with Johnson. Peter Haydon London • Ian Jack’s amusing remark that before the 1970s Britain’s drugs and beggars were “only in quantities small enough to look exotic” reminded me – somewhat tangentially – of a category of homelessness which now seems to have vanished entirely. I spend a lot of time in the countryside, often on foot, but cannot remember when I last encountered a real tramp; one of those much-bearded, many-coated gentlemen of the road who used to be as quintessentially part of the British landscape as oak trees and thatch.

We’d negotiated that our season ticket holders would have been covered for the game, too. “Hopefully, if it happens further down the line we can revisit that. Catalans were on board with us, and the game had a real international appeal to it with them being involved, but we’re going to try and carry on regardless and get another game over there.” The deal had been agreed in principle between all parties about hosting the game on the same weekend England play New Zealand in Denver, but that plan collapsed after opposition from rival Super League clubs and the RFL. The New York consortium are still waiting for a verdict on their application to join the professional ranks next year, meanwhile, but the man in charge of the bid, Ricky Wilby, is hopeful both they and other prospective north American sides can emulate the success of Toronto and be accepted. “We’ve also been talking closely with the people who are involved in the bid in Boston and we genuinely think there is a potential for us to work in partnership with them, Toronto and possibly one further team to bring these teams into the RFL structure,” Wilby said. “We have always said that we do not want to take the place of teams that are already in the structure, but to come in alongside them and to add value in terms of television revenue and sponsorship. It’s nice to talk with the team involved in the Boston bid who share a similar vision.” Blease also revealed that a purported “competitive advantage” was behind the reasoning for the Catalans game not being switched. It would have meant both sides would have played just once over the traditional Easter period, when Super League clubs play twice in four days. “We have had the knockback from the RFL regarding some form of competitive advantage – that was why,” Blease added. “The integrity of the game was mentioned, which is not something both sides set out to compromise. It was about promoting the sport in one of the biggest cities in the world, with our brand being splattered all across that particular area. “We’ve done some work with Ricky and his team on the PR side of things, and they had some well-known superstars planned, were going to do a concert, and it was going to be a real marquee event. Several clubs and the RFL gave us the knockback, though – but it isn’t over.” With plans still on the table for a Super League game in the US this summer, Wilby remains optimistic the New York franchise will learn its fate in the coming weeks – with likely mayoral support further strengthening its claim for a place in the RFL. “We’re hoping that with taking a game to the city, and the mayoral support we’re working on, that those sponsors we have been speaking with will also document their interest in the team to enhance our bid.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/19/navratilova-bbc-pays-mcenroe-10-times-more-for-wimbledon-role","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T00:01:04Z","webTitle":"Navratilova: BBC pays McEnroe 10 times more for Wimbledon role","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/19/navratilova-bbc-pays-mcenroe-10-times-more-for-wimbledon-role","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/19/navratilova-bbc-pays-mcenroe-10-times-more-for-wimbledon-role","fields":{"headline":"Navratilova: BBC pays McEnroe 10 times more for Wimbledon role","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tennis champion Martina Navratilova has accused the BBC of valuing male voices more than female voices, after discovering that fellow Wimbledon pundit John McEnroe is paid at least 10 times more than her. Navratilova, who was crowned Wimbledon ladies’ champion nine times, told Panorama she was paid about £15,000 by the BBC for her commentator role at Wimbledon while McEnroe earned between £150,000 and £199,999. McEnroe’s pay packet was revealed in a list of the BBC’s top-paid talent last summer. In an interview for Panorama: Britain’s Equal Pay Scandal, which airs on Monday, Navratilova said: “It was a shock because John McEnroe makes at least £150,000 ... I get about £15,000 for Wimbledon and unless John McEnroe’s doing a whole bunch of stuff outside of Wimbledon he’s getting at least 10 times as much money.” Navratilova said she was told she was getting paid a comparable amount to men doing the same job as her, adding: “We were not told the truth, that’s for sure.” “It’s still the good old boys’ network ... The bottom line is that male voices are valued more than women’s voices,” she said. She added that that her agent would ask for more money in future. BBC Sport defended the discrepancy, saying McEnroe’s role was of “a different scale, scope and time commitment”, to Navratilova, adding: “They are simply not comparable.” A spokeswoman said: “Along with Sue Barker, John is regarded as the face of our Wimbledon coverage. He is a defining voice within the BBC’s coverage. He is widely considered to be the best expert/commentator in the sport, highly valued by our audiences and his contract means he cannot work for another UK broadcaster without our permission. His pay reflects all of this – gender isn’t a factor.” Panorama said it estimated that McEnroe, who was crowned Wimbledon champion three times, appeared about 30 times for the BBC at Wimbledon last year, compared with Navratilova’s 10 appearances. The gender pay row at the BBC erupted last summer when it published a list of its top-earning, on-air stars, which revealed that just a third were women and the top seven were men. This led to more than 40 of its highest-profile female presenters, including Clare Balding, Fiona Bruce and Emily Maitlis, to publicly call for change through a letter to the director general, Tony Hall. The furore prompted the BBC to review its pay structure, with the corporation finding that men were being paid 9.3% more than women at the broadcaster on average and that nearly 500 employees may be getting paid less than colleagues in a similar role simply because of their gender. Meanwhile, former China editor Carrie Gracie, who resigned from her role in protest at inequalities and now works for the BBC in London, told Panorama she could leave the corporation and former BBC news presenter Maxine Mawhinney said she was considering bringing a case against the broadcaster over pay. Fran Unsworth, the BBC’s director of news and current affairs, told Panorama: “We don’t think we have acted illegally in regard to equal pay. That doesn’t mean, however, there won’t be instances and cases where there is inequality and we need to address those.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/18/trump-andrew-mccabe-memos-james-comey-fbi","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T12:04:06Z","webTitle":"Trump tweets raise fears for Mueller but White House says he's safe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/18/trump-andrew-mccabe-memos-james-comey-fbi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/18/trump-andrew-mccabe-memos-james-comey-fbi","fields":{"headline":"Trump tweets raise fears for Mueller but White House says he's safe","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Donald Trump cast doubt on memos of conversations between him and the fired FBI deputy director that have reportedly been handed to Robert Mueller, claiming Andrew McCabe did not take notes during their meetings. Seeing Trump’s offensive against McCabe as an attack on Mueller himself, several senior Republicans rallied to support the former FBI director, who is investigating Russian election interference and links between Trump aides and Moscow. “Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe,” Trump tweeted on Sunday morning in a volley of angry messages, “but he never took notes when he was with me. I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?” McCabe was fired on Friday night, two days short of qualifying for his pension and officially for allowing a leak to the press and failing to be candid about it under oath. Trump also targeted Comey, the FBI director he fired last May, a move that led to the appointment of Mueller. Comey has also said he wrote memos concerning interactions with Trump. Trump tweeted: “Wow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked ‘have you ever been an anonymous source … or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?’ He said strongly ‘never, no.’ He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.” Trump was evidently watching a Fox News show which played an exchange from a 3 May 2017 congressional hearing in which Comey was questioned by Republican senator Chuck Grassley and denied leaking information about FBI investigations. Speculation over a potential move against Mueller grew on Saturday when Trump’s personal lawyer, John Dowd, said he hoped the firing of McCabe would prompt Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, to shut down the Russia inquiry. Dowd first claimed to have been speaking for the president, then told outlets including the Guardian he was not. He then told Axios Trump “didn’t have any problem” with his statement. On Sunday Trey Gowdy, the Republican chair of the House oversight committee, used an appearance on Fox News Sunday to advise: “If you have an innocent client, Mr Dowd, act like it.” Jeff Flake, a Republican Arizona senator and fierce critic of the president, told CNN’s State of the Union Trump “seems to be building towards” firing Mueller, adding: “I just hope it doesn’t go there, it cannot – we cannot in Congress accept that. I would expect pushback in the next few days, urging Trump not to go there.” Former New Jersey governor and Trump ally Chris Christie told ABC’s This Week he did not think Trump would fire Mueller. “If he did do it it would be inappropriate,” he said. “Bob Mueller has conducted this investigation so far with great integrity, without leaking and by showing results and I don’t think the president is going to fire somebody like that.” Late on Sunday White House lawyer Ty Cobb said the president was not contemplating a move against Mueller. “In response to media speculation and related questions being posed to the administration, the White House yet again confirms that the president is not considering or discussing the firing of the special counsel, Robert Mueller.” Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, told ABC both parties should oppose any move against Mueller. If it happened, he said, “I would hope that it would prompt all Democrats and Republicans in the House to pass an independent counsel law and reinstate Bob Mueller. It undoubtedly would result in a constitutional crisis.” Schiff said Democrats on his committee “will certainly be able to show the facts supporting the issue of collusion” between the Trump campaign and Russia when they issue their findings. The Republican committee leadership closed its inquiry this week and announced it had not found any such collusion. Regarding McCabe’s dismissal, Schiff said that while it may have been justified it was too early to tell if it “could also be tainted”. He asked rhetorically whether those around Comey were being targeted because they would corroborate any charge of obstruction of justice by the president arising from Mueller’s work. “That’s a question that we also have to answer,” he said. The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said on Friday he fired McCabe in part because he allowed two FBI agents to speak to a Wall Street Journal reporter about the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and the activities of the Clinton Foundation. McCabe, who was quick to characterise his firing as an attack by the Trump administration on Mueller, has said he was authorized to allow the exchange. On Saturday, Trump repeatedly claimed his innocence, tweeting: “The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!” On Sunday, he claimed Mueller’s team of investigators contained “13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans … another Dem recently added” and asked “does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!” Mueller and McCabe are Republicans. McCabe’s wife ran for office in Virginia as a Democrat and received donations from a political action committee run by a Clinton ally. McCabe told Axios Trump had asked him: “What was it like when your wife lost? … So tell me, what was it like to lose?” Dowd told the same website the president “never made that statement according to two others who were present”. Comey will publish a book, entitled A Higher Loyalty, next month. On Saturday he tweeted: “Mr President, the American people will hear my story very soon. And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/18/texas-newspaper-same-sex-marriage-obituary-edits","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T12:55:54Z","webTitle":"Texas newspaper edits son's same-sex marriage out of mother's obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/18/texas-newspaper-same-sex-marriage-obituary-edits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/18/texas-newspaper-same-sex-marriage-obituary-edits","fields":{"headline":"Texas newspaper edits son's same-sex marriage out of mother's obituary","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When Brenda Light died last month, her obituary in a small-town Texas newspaper included a wealth of biographical details. But one important family connection was missing – the fact that her son is married to another man. The obituary submitted to the Olton Enterprise included the line “Those left to cherish her memory include her son, Barry Giles, and his husband, John Gambill of Dallas”. But there was no mention of Gambill or the union in the published version. “It wiped John completely off the picture like he didn’t exist,” Giles told Fox 4 local news. It was evidently not an oversight on the part of the newspaper, which is based in a town of about 2,200 residents more than 350 miles north-west of Dallas. The publisher, Phillip Hamilton, doubles as a Baptist pastor. He told the station in a statement: “It is my religious conviction that a male cannot have a husband. It is also my belief that to publish anything contrary to God’s Word on this issue would be to publish something in the newspaper that is not true. “The newspaper respects the first amendment rights of those who express such opinions. The newspaper’s decision to edit the obituary is both ethical and lawful. It would be unethical to publish a news item that is known by the editor to be false. Based on the truth found in the Word of God, I could not in good conscience identify Mr Gambill as the husband of Mr Giles.” Giles and Gambill – a trained funeral director – have been together for 31 years, according to the Dallas Voice, and Light moved from Olton to Dallas after her husband died and lived only a mile from the couple. “We spent holidays together. We did what a family would do,” Gambill told the Voice. Same-sex marriage was legalised nationwide by the US supreme court in 2015, prompting a backlash from conservatives. The Texas supreme court last year declared that the landmark ruling does not mean states must also provide the same benefits to all married people. The case arose from conservative activists’ attempts to stop Houston from offering spousal benefits to city employees in same-sex marriages. Also in 2017, the Texas legislature passed a so-called religious freedom bill that civil rights groups argue gives faith-based adoption agencies the right to discriminate against potential foster and adoptive parents based on their sexuality. There is no state law banning discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/18/saturday-night-live-kiss-me-irish-canadian-harvey-weinstein","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T11:22:20Z","webTitle":"Saturday Night Live: Kiss Me I’m Irish good, Canadian Harvey Weinstein … bad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/18/saturday-night-live-kiss-me-irish-canadian-harvey-weinstein","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/18/saturday-night-live-kiss-me-irish-canadian-harvey-weinstein","fields":{"headline":"Saturday Night Live: Kiss Me I’m Irish good, Canadian Harvey Weinstein … bad","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“I’m just a simple man who wanted to make things bad for immigrants, and here I am taking away the pension of a Christian white!” Jeff Sessions (Kate McKinnon) is being interviewed by Anderson Cooper (Alex Moffat). Cooper turns to Rex Tillerson (John Goodman). “It really wasn’t a good fit,“ Tillerson says, struggling to drink a glass of water. “It’s just crazy how you can be the CEO of Exxon … and the next day, you get fired by a man who used to sell steaks in the mail.” He smashes his glass. Cooper’s final guests: it’s Michael Wolff (Fred Armisen, who, I must say, really does look a lot like Michael Wolff) and Anthony Scaramucci (Bill Hader), who’s wearing “the first suit made by the Olive Garden!” “Is it as bad as they say?” Cooper asks Wolff. “Trump would line up his staff and use a laser pointer and circle their love handles every day,” Wolff says. Tillerson does a dinosaur impression. Live from New York, it’s Saturday night. Hader is hosting. “I was on this show for eight seasons,” he reminds us, “210 episodes. I was nervous for every one of them and I’m nervous now.” He makes a joke about fake ads being fake, which isn’t funny, and then he says “you can make the monologue as short as you want” before a team of dressers sprints out and puts him in a handyman’s outfit and blonde wig for the next sketch … … in which he plays a soap opera handyman opposite McKinnon’s jaunty maid (“I’m not a maid, I’m an estate manager”) and Armisen’s creepy rich guy and a photo of Vanessa Bayer. There’s a lot of jokes about traffic and blonde wigs. Kiss Me I’m Irish: “One fellow will choose between three Irish roses to see which smells the sweetest.” It’s a chance for several players to demonstrate their best Irish accents. Hader is Niall, the bachelor. He’s related to the one played by Cecily Strong. “No3 is my cousin, so she’s definitely off to an early lead.” Aidy Bryant is an Irish-American, and she’s not down with the cousin thing. Then he discovers that the first bachelorette (McKinnon) is his cousin too. “What’s your idea of a romantic evening?“ says Hader. “I guess dinner with someone I’m not related to?“ Then a priest arrives. This is the funniest sketch of the night, but the Irish people who hated the Aer Lingus sketch earlier in the season are really not going to like it. They might also hate the next sketch, because it’s just quite filthy: it’s about a young woman (Strong) dating a much-older man (Hader) and trying to conceive under a tartan lap blanket. “It’s like breastfeeding in public,” she says, to her friends, as she sits on his knee, “it’s not a sexual thing.” Eventually, Strong and Hader try to ride off into the sunset on his electric wheelchair. He crashes repeatedly into the furniture, which might not be scripted. Jurassic Park screen tests: an opportunity for cast members to do impersonations of 1990s actors. Well done, guys. Leslie Jones makes her only appearance in the episode as Whoopi Goldberg, and that’s a shame. Arcade Fire are here. They’re dressed in gold lamé, like some kind of space Canadians, and singing Everything Now. As I always do when I see Arcade Fire, I wonder how my life would have been different if I’d made an effort to befriend them when we were all at university together, instead of getting annoyed when some of them were having a party in my shared house kitchen at 4am. Weekend Update! Colin Jost and Michael Che discuss the latest White House firings, noting that “Tillerson will return to his previous job as the Eagle from the Muppets.” On to Stormy Daniels. “This lady is just trying to show us revenge porn of a grandpa, and we’re OK with that?“ Michael Che asks: “What if it’s good?“ McKinnon, busy tonight, rolls in to play Betsy Devos. Jost asks what went wrong with her Lesley Stahl interview. “I think the problem is that the words coming out of my mouth were bad,” she says, with a big smile. “We’re working hard to ensure that all schools are safe learning environments for guns.“ Next, Hader revives his classic character Stefon to offer some local recommendations. “If you’re drunk in Midtown, doing coke off your laundry card, I have just the place for you!” He calls in John Mulaney to get him to help tell a very complicated joke that mocks little people and references a bit he used to do years ago. It feels like quite a deep cut. The next sketch is set in an Arizona hotel with Hader playing a manager with a strong Swedish accent and a story about anal-probing aliens. And next: Hader is “the Canadian Harvey Weinstein“. He admits to all of his misdeeds, exposed as “a monster by Canadian standards“ because he complimented a woman’s sunglasses. “As soon as realized, I said I was soary,“ he said. The members of Arcade Fire are soary, too. “Silly,” my husband sighs, and he is correct. We return from commercial to the second Arcade Fire song, Put Your Money On Me, which they’re already singing – awkward cut! – accompanied by a what may be an unintentionally hilarious video of flashing dollar bills and some extras pretending to play slot machines. Or are they members of the band? It is a very large band. Maybe the extras are people who were nice to the Arcade Fire in college. The final skit is about a man who uses a toilet in his office that’s disguised as a lamp. It’s disgusting, and not really in a funny way. And that’s it! Is it true that you can’t go home again, Bill Hader? It could be. It could be true."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/01/walmart-hiding-cosmo-arent-there-better-targets","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T05:00:13Z","webTitle":"Walmart hiding Cosmo?

Aren’t there better targets?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Cosmopolitan has been removed from the checkouts at Walmart in the US, which the chain has attributed to a business decision, although it accepts that “concerns raised were heard”. The conservative anti-pornography group, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, has claimed this as a victory, following a long campaign against the magazine. According to the group’s executive director, Dawn Hawkins, Cosmo “places women’s value primarily on their ability to sexually satisfy a man and therefore plays into the same culture where men view and treat women as inanimate sex objects”. The NCOSE, formerly known as Morality in Media, produces an annual “Dirty Dozen” list “to name and shame the mainstream players in America that perpetuate sexual exploitation”. Oddly, this year, it found no room for the current president of the United States. Instead, it’s a roll call of what you might call “the internet”. It calls out Snapchat, Twitter and YouTube, in addition to Amazon and iBooks. As history has taught us, the censorship of literature, burning books, that sort of thing, is usually a surefire sign that there’s nothing at all to panic about in any political climate. The current US issue of Cosmo, now relegated to “designated magazine areas” of the stores, promises to “Heat Up Sex!” I think it’s referring to more than just turning on the electric blanket. There is probably not that much need to consider “sizzling foreplay” and “warm toys for hot spots” when stocking up on bread and milk, but Walmart sells firearms and ammunition, too, and I’d rather drift into a land of sex tips by women for women than think about what those bullets are going to do. The NCOSE claims the magazine targets young women and encourages male sexual entitlement; outrageously, it has couched this in the language of resistance. “This is what real change looks like in our #MeToo culture,” said Hawkins. While I realise that pornography is a divisive area within feminism, to say the least, let’s not pretend that this particular shuffle towards puritanism is a feminist decision. Cosmopolitan is not a perfect magazine, but it is aimed at women, not at men, not at kids. It may be sexually explicit at times, but compared with the internet, which is where kids actually learn about sex now, it’s relatively benign; at its best, it’s a frank big sister telling it like it is. When I was at school, we had More! magazine’s “Position of the Fortnight” passed around like sweets, and I am happy to report that, like many women of my age, I emerged unscathed from seeing these illustrations. To put women talking about sex between themselves on the wrong side of #MeToo is troubling.

Argento, who has appeared in films such as Land of the Dead and Marie Antoinette, accused Weinstein of rape and forcibly performing oral sex on her in 1997 at the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc. Gutierrez, a Filipino-Italian actor, wore a wire when she encountered Weinstein at a hotel in Tribeca, resulting in audio in which Weinstein can be heard admitting to sexually assaulting her the day before. The sting operation was set in motion when Gutierrez reported the assault to the NYPD. The Manhattan district attorney’s office dropped the investigation after two weeks, filing no charges. The actors will be joined at the summit by Laura Boldrini, an Italian journalist and politician who tells the Guardian that “the #MeToo movement in Italy has not had the same strength in impact as in the States.” The ninth annual summit will also feature a panel moderated by Hillary Clinton and appearances by Viola Davis, senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Lisa Murkowski, and the MSNBC anchor Joy Reid. In conversation with Farrow, who in October published a series of investigations into Weinstein’s alleged systemic abuse, Argento will talk for the first time about how she has been treated in the wake of her allegations, the reception she has received in Italy, and the difficulties faced by Italian women particularly with regard to sexism and harassment. “Americans tend to have a romantic view of Italy,” she told the Guardian. “The reality, for a working woman, is different: the rise of Berlusconi has only made it worse, institutionalizing sexism and oppression and making it acceptable.” Both Argento and Gutierrez have weathered a storm of criticism from the Italian press for their personal disclosures, as well as their efforts to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace. “A theme of Women in the World this year is how to take #MeToo global and take it to places where misogyny drowns it out,” Brown told the Guardian. “One of those countries is post-Berlusconi Italy, where sexism is served up every day like pasta.” Before revealing her story in the same New Yorker article, Gutierrez memorably testified against the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, after attending one of his “bunga bunga” parties. During an investigation into Berlusconi’s conduct with an underaged prostitute (he was ultimately found not guilty of paying her for sex), Gutierrez revealed that she had been offered Tiffany jewelry on a silver platter and had been selected as one of the women “destined for Berlusconi’s bedroom” at the party. The former prime minister was initially convicted of the charge but was later acquitted on appeal. Afterwards, Gutierrez was maligned in Italian media for her testimony; she was met with a similar backlash from American media organizations after coming forward with the Weinstein accusation. In the New York Post, Gutierrez was referred to as the “image of the perfect she-devil” and subject to a slew of speculative articles about her motivations for coming forward. “The situation in Italy – where the mainstream press has viciously shamed women, including Asia Argento, for speaking out about this issue – provides a window into just how far we still have to go in so much of the world,” added Farrow. “I’m honored that Asia, and another Italian woman who was instrumental in breaking the Weinstein story, Ambra Gutierrez, will be joining us for this important conversation.” Battilana Gutierrez adds: “When Ronan’s story was released in October, I felt relieved and started to come out of my depression knowing this behavior would no longer be accepted and soon come to an end.” The Women in the World Summit, which will tackle the #MeToo movement as well issues such as human trafficking and pay inequity, will take place 12-14 April at Lincoln Center in New York City. Hillary Clinton will be leading a debate on the rise of strongmen dictators in Russia, Turkey, and China alongside journalists from those regions. All three days of the summit will be available to live-stream on the Women in the World website."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/30/the-guardian-view-on-the-man-booker-prize-time-for-a-turnaround","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T15:32:53Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the Man Booker prize: time for a turnaround | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/30/the-guardian-view-on-the-man-booker-prize-time-for-a-turnaround","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/30/the-guardian-view-on-the-man-booker-prize-time-for-a-turnaround","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the Man Booker prize: time for a turnaround","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This week the British world of books finds itself in a peculiar position: one literary prize is asking another to change its rules. The Folio prize is run by a 250-strong academy. Surveyed, 99% of them say American writers ought to be ineligible for the Man Booker; the prize should remain open only to those from Britain, the Commonwealth, Ireland and Zimbabwe. In February, leading British publishers also urged the change. Even the Washington Post has pleaded with the British to “take your Booker prize home”, saying “Americans don’t need any encouragement to trumpet their own books”. Back in 2014, the Man Booker changed its rules from the slightly eccentric rubric of “everyone except the Americans” to embrace US authors. It made absolute sense at the time. The Man Booker, it was argued, ought to scan the entire literary horizon. It ought not to be parochial. It ought to serve readers the very best in fiction, and scour the Earth to do so. Excluding the US, a literary colossus, looked ridiculous, when so many riveting adventures in form and language were being undertaken there. The move was widely supported. What could be more logical? The pendulum of opinion has, however, swung back. Inviting the Americans in has seemed a little like allowing the US to compete in the Commonwealth Games. Certainly, if you did, it the overall quality would go up – but it might make for a rather monotonous contest. At a time when sales of literary fiction have crashed in Britain, the dominance of American titles on the past few shortlists has seemed especially hard for publishers and authors to bear, since prizes have become one of the few factors that significantly drive sales. The US, simply by virtue of its size, risks crowding out everyone else. And the Americans have plenty of prizes of their own. There are still those who strongly argue that the Man Booker’s regulations are better for being clear, logical and global. And if Americans have seemed to dominate recent shortlists they will not necessarily always do so (the past two winners have been from the US). Furthermore, excluding the US now could severely damage the credibility of the award – changing the rules because the host team is losing. What is the purpose of the Man Booker? Turning back to its founding statements, it is clear that it was instituted to reward “the best novel in the opinion of the judges”. Its sole criterion was to be quality. But it also said: “The real success will be a significant increase in the sales of the winning book … that will to some extent be shared not only by the authors who have been shortlisted, but, in the long run, by authors all over the country.” It was, in short, intended to have a beneficial effect on the UK publishing industry and its authors. And it was intended to be distinctive. With the inclusion of Americans, all that could be squandered. Were the Man Booker organisers to row back now, they would not lose much face. Globalisation, after all, is not an unalloyed good."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/02/law-of-physics-odd-socks-washing","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T10:15:08Z","webTitle":"Is there a law of physics to explain odd socks in the washing?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/02/law-of-physics-odd-socks-washing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/02/law-of-physics-odd-socks-washing","fields":{"headline":"Is there a law of physics to explain odd socks in the washing?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Is there a law of physics to explain why I always end up with odd socks after I have done the washing?

An excellent day’s Test cricket. Jonny Bairstow completed a brilliant century, his fifth in Tests, then Stuart Broad returned to something close to his best. But, having had NZ 35 for five, the day slipped away from England thanks to a brilliant record partnership of 142 from BJ Watling and Colin de Grandhomme. Broad got CdG, but Watling is still there, and feels the key player tomorrow. The debutant Jack Leach bowled very tidily, for those wondering. Rob Smyth and I will be back to bring you that, and Vic Marks’ report will be online before long. Speak tomorrow, thanks for your company. No one is complaining as the players leave the field. Umpires seemed to feel it wasn’t safe to bowl short in the gloaming, so the players came off. That’s stumps. So, New Zealand remain 115 behind. A compelling day. England dominated the first half, New Zealand the second. A belting third day awaits. 74.5 overs: New Zealand 192-6 (Watling 77, Southee 13) Lots more short stuff in the dark from Wood. Southee is in a tangle first ball, with short leg taking a catch off the thigh pad. No dice. Southee is trying to “access the legside” and is almost bowled round his legs as he hops across! He gets off strike with one to square leg, and Watling cops some similar treatment. They know what’s coming. And, with a ball left of the over, the umpires are taking the players off... 74th over: New Zealand 191-6 (Watling 77, Southee 12) Broad, then, hunting a fifth. Watling knows he needs to be there at the close and has turned defensive. There’s one very sharp single to short leg – Bairstow’s shy isn’t close but it might well have been a run out had it been better. Southee pinches a single from the last too. 73rd over: New Zealand 189-6 (Watling 76, Southee 11) This could be great fun. Wood digging it in, Southee taking it on. Round one is won by Southee, with a nice swat evading the two men back. He sways the next, which is very short. A third man goes out, and he sways again, before being struck on the arm-guard by one he was leaving. In goes silly-point, and there’s a big swing and miss. Amazingly, with all these men back, Southee has ended the over as he started it, by just popping it in a tiny gap for four. One of the fielders should probably have just owned that. Between overs, Southee is having his elbow looked at. Seemed sore... 72nd over: New Zealand 181-6 (Watling 76, Southee 3) Southee gets himself off strike with a very ugly shovel to a Broad short ball. There’s another low edge from Watling; his soft hands mean these just won’t carry. There’s just one from another good over. Worth noting that 16 wickets have fallen in this match, and to only four bowlers: Southee (6), Boult (4), Broad (4) and Anderson (2). More in it for the best bowlers, but also those who get first use. 71st over: New Zealand 180-6 (Watling 76, Southee 2) Suddenly it’s a nice time for Wood to bowl. Watling cannot afford to do anything silly, and Southee is fresh to the crease. It’s a maiden, the final ball of which takes a thick edge of Watling’s bat but falls just short of the cordon. There’s some really dark clouds about. We probably won’t get through 10 more overs. 70th over: New Zealand 180-6 (Watling 76, Southee 2) Southee in, then. There is an opening for England here, with a bit of new ball action first thing in the morning. Southee is off the mark with an angled bat through gully. A short ball ends the over and really troubles him. A word for de Grandhomme, who batted brilliantly. He and Watling put on a record 142. He fell to a slightly tired shot, but it did just move a touch. Broad’s back and strikes second ball! He has four. It just nibbles a touch, de Grandhomme drives and he’s caught behind! Now, Broad doesn’t have a Test five-fer since January 2016. Now would be a really handy time to pick another up by stumps... 69th over: New Zealand 176-5 (Watling 74, de Grandhomme 72) Stokes bowled three overs for five runs, but Wood is back on now. Broad has not bowled for what feels like an age. It’s another tight over, with just two from it. This is now the highest sixth wicket stand for New Zealand against England... 142. 68th over: New Zealand 176-5 (Watling 74, de Grandhomme 72) England will be fairly happy that New Zealand are going nowhere fast; there’s not been a boundary for nearly 10 overs. Anderson’s continuing to his very offside field, and de Grandhomme is still resisting. Leaving more than you might expect him to, and this is a maiden. 67th over: New Zealand 176-5 (Watling 74, de Grandhomme 72) Stokes is into his third over, and he’s looking good. He sneaks one past CdG’s outside edge and, after a single, wangs in a bouncer to Watling. His run is slower than usual, but he’s still getting it down at a decent lick. One from it. 66th over: New Zealand 175-5 (Watling 74, de Grandhomme 71) Gah! Anderson’s first ball after drinks, which is wide of off-stump, draws an edge from Watling, but it bounces short of Bairstow. Mid-on is the only fielder on the legside by the looks of things, while the covers are rammed. Jimmy will hang it outside off. England’s best chance of a decent first innings lead (say 50) is to keep things really tight until the new ball, take it in the morning and try to skittle the tail. It’s certainly been a new ball pitch so far. This is a maiden. 65th over: New Zealand 175-5 (Watling 74, de Grandhomme 71) Stokes’s line to CdG is dull: he’s trying to probe away outside off stump. Big Colin is very restrained today and the result of that is a maiden, and drinks. England won’t mind that. 64th over: New Zealand 175-5 (Watling 74, de Grandhomme 71) It’s got rather dark at Hagley Oval. There are two singles from this Anderson over, the second because of an excellent bit of fielding from Leach, running round at mid-on. Would have been four without his diving stop. Henry Wood writes: England are so depressing these days whether bowling or batting.. you check in as they’re bowling and it’s 29-4 and so a couple hours later you check in again thinking ‘maybe it’s at best 120-8 or something but no, it’s 170-5 or so. Or maybe England are 78-1 and you check in a couple hours later thinking ‘maybe 300-5 or so’, but no, all out for 129. Just popping in and out is better than watching the whole thing, I reckon... 63rd over: New Zealand 173-5 (Watling 73, de Grandhomme 70) So Stokes is on, and second ball there’s a big appeal! Caolin de Grandhomme is beaten by one that nips back. It pins him on the pad and carries through. The decision is not out, England send it upstairs, and they will have two bites at the cherry - caught behind and lbw. He didn’t hit and it went over. Not out. Stokes is a little stiff here but has the ball doing a bit. If they could get four overs of him this evening England would be very happy I reckon. CdG takes one off the third ball (which measures 141kph), then Watling gets a single. The over ends with a scuffed pull for two by CdG. Here we go! Stokes is having a bowl... 62nd over: New Zealand 169-5 (Watling 72, de Grandhomme 67) Anderson has another. With some funky fields, he’s trying to bore Watling out. It’s another maiden. 61st over: New Zealand 169-5 (Watling 72, de Grandhomme 67) No Stokes yet. More Leach. Three dots round the wicket to CdG, then he goes over and one of the slips goes to short leg. Three more dots make a maiden. 60th over: New Zealand 169-5 (Watling 72, de Grandhomme 67) Ben Stokes is loosening up, says Bumble as Anderson charges in again. He sure is, and it’s quite concerted. Anderson’s just probing away around de Grandhomme’s off-stump and there’s just one single from the over. It’s 5pm in Christchurch, some clouds are fathering and the shadows are lengthening. 59th over: New Zealand 168-5 (Watling 72, de Grandhomme 66) Leach, bald and bespectacled, is just gently changing his pace and flight. No luck yet, but he’s bowled well. Four! That’s Watling’s favourite shot, and it’s gone very square on the slog-sweep. Shot. Time for some Broad I reckon. 58th over: New Zealand 163-5 (Watling 68, de Grandhomme 65) Anderson, as he wants, gets a look at CdG. There’s a big play and miss outside off stump as he starts with four dots. A single to leg follows then Watling leaves the last. Finbar Anslow has been in touch with a good point and a good question. “Good morning, it’s nearly 6am here in Cabella Ligure where I’m just about to embark on a 4 hour drive across Italy for my friend’s marriage (congratulations Antonio and Veronica) I thought Coverton’s exclusion was a bit harsh, and when was the last time we saw 2 Somerset players in the side?” Big Craig did OK in Auckland, but they clearly felt they really needed to shuffle the pack and Wood is a little different. My best guess re Somerset is 2003, and Richard Johnson’s last Test. Tres, of course, was the other... 57th over: New Zealand 162-5 (Watling 68, de Grandhomme 64) Leach just keeps plugging away. CdG takes one through the covers, and that’s it for a very tidy over. Quite. 56th over: New Zealand 161-5 (Watling 68, de Grandhomme 63) Anderson’s back! England could really do with him breaking this partnership. He’s been given two slips and a gully, but Watling just drives him down the ground – perhaps off the inside edge – for four. And then four more through the covers! The old ball is doing nowt. To be fair, England lost three times in a year in 2016-17 having posted 400 or more in the first innings! Re Morgan – he has indeed been an excellent white-ball captain for England. Probably their best in those formats. 55th over: New Zealand 153-5 (Watling 60, de Grandhomme 63) They are reeling off stats about Watling’s ability to form big partnerships (two of 350+ and two more of 200+ for the sixth-wicket in Tests), as he sweeps Leach for a really excellent four. This pair are becoming very pesky. The last ball of the over is driven down the ground for one, and cut off well by Root. 54th over: New Zealand 148-5 (Watling 55, de Grandhomme 63) Wood is still hammering it in at Watling. Over the wicket at the moment, and without his silly point. Still lots of men close. There’s a backfoot drive for three, which is fielded by Liam Livingstone, on the field for someone or other. Now de Grandhomme has got lucky! It’s not that short and he’s had a huge hoick, which goes off the top edge and into no man’s land for two on the legside. 53rd over: New Zealand 143-5 (Watling 52, de Grandhomme 61) Shot! Leach is going over the wicket to Watling, and he’s slog-swept him for six! That takes him to 50. A classy knock from 125 balls. Gritty, and tough. After a single, de Grandhomme resists smacking Leach again... Comms have noticed that Leach is from the George Bailey, Tymal Mills school of folks who throw with the wrong hand. He lobs it in right handed but bowls left arm. Eh? Can you think of any others? 52nd over: New Zealand 136-5 (Watling 44, de Grandhomme 61) Watling is going back and across. Might actually be worth a leg-stump yorker. Most of them are short, and now Wood is going over the wicket. Watling pulls! It wasn’t totally in control but he gets away with it and they take one, which brings up the 100 partnership. Absolutely vital, this. Good over from Wood in an absorbing passage of play. 51st over: New Zealand 135-5 (Watling 44, de Grandhomme 61) Leach, once more, is just playing on Big Colin’s patience. Pleasingly, Leach looks like he could bowl all day at this level and not leak too many. He’s slipping along at about two an over at the moment. He draws a big play and miss on the drive, and then gets a big miscue! It’s gone for four, but it’s a big outside edge and it flies to short extra cover’s left and trickles away! A plan so nearly came together and England will be encouraged by that. 50th over: New Zealand 131-5 (Watling 44, de Grandhomme 57) CdG gets himself off strike, and Wood gets stuck into Watling again. He has a wee swing at another bumper, and misses. The last four are ducked, weaved, and generally played better. He’s stepping over to the offside and trying to get right out of the way. 49th over: New Zealand 130-5 (Watling 44, de Grandhomme 56) Fun to watch Leach to de Grandhomme here. Skill on both sides, and CdG gets off strike with a drive that splits the field. For Watling, Leach goes over the wicket. Ouch. He slog-sweeps hard and, at short-leg, Mark Stoneman has worn one just below the elbow. He’s hard as hell, but that hurts. Anyway, he saves four and it’s just one from the over. 48th over: New Zealand 129-5 (Watling 44, de Grandhomme 55) Wood is bombing Watling. There’s a man in close on both sides of the bat (Root is the silly point), and a legslip. He’s round the wicket and, with no protection in the covers, he swats a cut away for four when the ball’s there. Literally no one from gully to mid-on apart from that silly point. The last ball of the over is a bouncer that troubles Watling. He just rides it. 47th over: New Zealand 125-5 (Watling 40, de Grandhomme 55) Two slips and two shortish extra covers for Leach to CdG. Get him driving! He nudges two to leg. This is de Grandhomme’s longest Test innings – even his century only lasted 74 balls. He’s 90 for his 55 here, and is battling to play against type. It’s impressive stuff. Here goes for that final session then. BJ Watling and Colin de Grandhomme having a bat, and Leach to continue with the ball. We’re about five minutes away from the start of a fascinating 35-over final session. I imagine James Anderson will get us going, perhaps alongside Leach, who has started really nicely. Here’s a piece on David Warner’s slightly strange, slightly sad press conference that left more questions than answers. Everything is rather out of hand now. Good session that. Anderson got Williamson early on, but since Watling and de Grandhomme have been excellent in putting on 87 and frustrating England. New Zealand’s session. Back in a tick. 46th over: New Zealand 123-5 (Watling 40, de Grandhomme 53) Well that Root experiment lasted just one very poor over. Wood’s back! He bangs one in to de Grandhomme, who plays that nice controlled pull for one that he’s been doing. For Watling, Wood goes round the wicket with a short leg and a leg slip. A silly point goes in too, but Watling’s up to the challenge. He’s played really well. 45th over: New Zealand 122-5 (Watling 40, de Grandhomme 52) Leach has got through 10 overs on debut now, and not one of them has been poor. This one is very tidy, and ties CdG down on and around off-stump from round the wicket. He takes a single off the last ball, and we will have one more over before tea. 44th over: New Zealand 121-5 (Watling 40, de Grandhomme 51) The skipper is having a bowl! Tea is nearing, and Broad has popped off the field, so Root is coming on. From round the wicket, he’s very lucky not to be wided first ball. But de Grandhomme gets a single, then Watling sweeps four very well. That was a gimme from Root. And again. That’s pants. Four more on the sweep, and nine from the over. 43rd over: New Zealand 112-5 (Watling 31, de Grandhomme 50) There’s just one single in this latest Leach over, but it’s a relevant one: it’s Colin de Grandhomme’s fifty! It’s taken 75 balls and has been a really clever knock. He came out swinging, but has been measured since. His battle with Leach at the moment is utterly absorbing. He brought up the milestone with a gentle drive into the gap on the offside. The weather looks lovely over the next few days, although daylight saving ends in New Zealand tonight so there may be some light issues late in the remaining days. But they are starting an hour earlier to counter that. 42nd over: New Zealand 111-5 (Watling 32, de Grandhomme 49) Fly slip, four men back in the deep on the legside, round the wicket. Broad is going short against de Grandhomme again. Ha. He’s managed to paddle four very fine, evading all those fielders. New Zealand, by the way, have avoided the follow-on. He gently pulls another to move to 49. Again, the plan totally changes for Watling. The impish keeper blocks and leaves his way through the rest of the over. Good stat. There’s a little over 10 minutes until tea, by the way. 41st over: New Zealand 106-5 (Watling 32, de Grandhomme 44) Big Colin gets himself off strike without having a big hoick at Leach, then Watling turns one to leg. De Grandhomme’s turn to midwicket then sees them scamper two. The over ends with another single. Tidy, though. Tom Bancroft (any relation?) has the subject line “De Grandhomme” to his email, which reads: “Is his name the French equivalent of Longfellow, Oldman, or Bigman?” Bigman, I always like to think. But the fact that he’s CdG always makes me think of Charles de Gaulle. 40th over: New Zealand 101-5 (Watling 31, de Grandhomme 40) Right, a chance of tack from Broad for CdG. He’s going round the wicket and sticking heaps of men back on the legside. No prizes for guessing the plan. He gets in a tangle to the second bouncer and it deflects off something or other to third man for a legbye. The field completely changes for Watling, with Root employing old suicide gully in really close on the line of third slip. That’s a good position – the edges England have found since the ball went soft have not been carrying. Watling’s defence is resolute. Sachin Paul has a question. “Time to give Stokes’ “golden arm” a go?” he asks. “The match is slowly heading to equality if we can’t get a wicket now.” I wonder if Stokes might be tempted to have a couple of overs. He’s apparently been bowling in the warm-ups. New Zealand are still a long way behind the game – Southee is in next... 39th over: New Zealand 100-5 (Watling 31, de Grandhomme 40) This intriguing little battle between Leach and Big Colin continues, with ever more flight. There’s a brave leave early on, and a couple of good stops by English fielders. The batsman splits the infield with a big drive, but there’s a man back and he just gets one. A nice little premeditated sweep from Watling ruins a good over from Leach. It’s tickled away fine for four. Nicely played. 38th over: New Zealand 95-5 (Watling 27, de Grandhomme 39) This partnership has been chugging along for 100 minutes or so, but England have pulled some greater control back in the last few minutes. Broad is bowling well to Watling, who gets four with an uppish drive that the bowler can’t quite reach. An edge runs along the ground to second slip, then Broad swings one back in to Watling. Nice bowling. 37th over: New Zealand 91-5 (Watling 23, de Grandhomme 39) It’s been a really promising start from Leach, and it’s more of the same here. He’s trying to tempt a big shot out of CdG, and is confident enough to boss the fielders – including his captain – about. The upshot is second maiden. Really good. How long can de Grandhomme resist? 36th over: New Zealand 91-5 (Watling 23, de Grandhomme 39) CdG scuffs a pull of Broad for one to begin the new over. He still has three slips, which is good. Watling is tied down a touch, and at one stage looks like he might just chip it back to the bowler. No dice, and it’s just one from a very good over. I should say, if you’d like to contact me, you can (please do!): I’m on twitter @willis_macp and can be emailed at the ever so cumbersome will.macpherson.freelance@guardian.co.uk. 35th over: New Zealand 90-5 (Watling 23, de Grandhomme 38) Two covers in for CdG now, and one is Cook, who dives well to stop both the first two drives. Leach floats it up even more, and Colin has a huge swing and miss! That ragged, and Stokes pulled off a brilliant one-handed stop at slip! Very good bowling. Big Colin pushes to mid-off for one off the fifth, so short leg goes back in for Watling. Dot. 34th over: New Zealand 89-5 (Watling 23, de Grandhomme 37) “You really are a dropkick at times, aren’t you?” says Ian Smith to Mike Atherton, as he questions the former Kiwi keeper’s physique. As they chat away about the merits of Smith’s shape, Broad hones in on Watling’s front pad. He finally steals a single off the fourth ball, and that brings up the fifty partnership! What an important one it is. Big Colin turns two more to leg, and the over ends with a very tight single to mid-off. Root’s shy is unsuccessful. 33rd over: New Zealand 85-5 (Watling 22, de Grandhomme 34) More Leach. It’s ben a nice tidy start from him. Mid-off is three-quarters of the way back for CdG, and Leach tosses a tempter or two up. No nibble. He drives the fifth ball hard to that man at mid-off’s right and they take one. Leach drops a touch short with the last – his first poor ball – and Watling cuts three. He likes that shot, does BJ. 32nd over: New Zealand 81-5 (Watling 19, de Grandhomme 33) So Broad it is. He has three for 18, which are very handy figures. CdG’s instinct would be to whack it, but he leaves a couple then pinches a single into the legside. Watling leaves one, and then has a poke outside off and it drops just short of third slip! Diving full length, Vince couldn’t quite get there. Good over. David Warner is talking to us again. And it all sounds fair enough really. Hiya! Will here, to guide you through the last 50 overs of the day. All being well, there should just be 48 overs, what with a change of innings and all. That’s tempting fate for you. Anyway, Broad – who was excellent earlier – is coming on. And with that, I shall depart. Your friend and mine Will Macpherson will take you through the rest of the day, and trust me when I tell you, you couldn’t possibly be in better hands. Email Will, or tweet him @Willis_macp 31st over: New Zealand 80-5 (Watling 19, De Grandhomme 32) Excellent to see Leach bowling in spectacles, in the home country of probably the second-best bespectacled cricketer ever, Daniel Vettori. The first of course being Clive Lloyd. Just one from the over, a drive from De Grandhomme out to the cover boundary sweeper. And with that, drinks. 30th over: New Zealand 79-5 (Watling 19, De Grandhomme 31) Great shot by Watling off Anderson, crouching slightly to hit a sort of frontish foot cut just behind point and to the boundary. The rest of the over is more of Anderson’s general standard, a couple of benign edges found. 29th over: New Zealand 75-5 (Watling 15, De Grandhomme 31) Spin! Leach might get a decent bowl now, after his single over before lunch. Watling prods at one that turns and it squirts just wide of slip for a couple, then he turns a single off his pads behind square. 28th over: New Zealand 72-5 (Watling 12, De Grandhomme 31) Beauty of a shot from De Grandhomme, a sort of half front-foot drive that flashes through the covers to the boundary. Root then takes himself out of the slips and to short cover, only for inevitably De Grandhomme to edge through exactly where Root was - along the ground, which takes the edge off a little, but still four runs. 27th over: New Zealand 64-5 (Watling 12, De Grandhomme 23) Wood continues around the wicket, a pseudo leg theory field in place, which he tries for three balls then reverts to over. Watling swats a shortish one outside off but doesn’t time it properly - still, he gets two runs for it. 26th over: New Zealand 62-5 (Watling 10, De Grandhomme 23) More of the same from Anderson, who De Grandhomme seems to have abandoned the counter-attack plan against. He beats the edge with a lovely one, then De Grandhomme very nearly gets himself into a terrible fuzzy when leaving one just outside off. 25th over: New Zealand 62-5 (Watling 10, De Grandhomme 23) Wood continues, he keeps going short but still no joy. Watling gets three through the covers with a nice back-foot punch, De Grandhomme dabs a single. Wood then tries around the wicket, and that time does get Watling jumping all over the place with the first, then nails him in the side of the head with a riser. Watling says he’s OK, but the protector at the back of the helmet flew off and the physio runs on just to be sure everything is fine. The psychology of bowlers who hit a batsman on the head must be interesting: you absolutely must think twice, or maybe take a bit off the next short delivery. 24th over: New Zealand 58-5 (Watling 7, De Grandhomme 22) Uneventful over from Anderson, the only action to speak of being De Grandhomme flicking a couple down to fine leg. 23rd over: New Zealand 56-5 (Watling 7, De Grandhomme 20) More short stuff from Wood to De Grandhomme. One goes up in the air, but Broad dashing in from fine leg can’t get to the catch (it drops short of his dive), they get two runs and Broad treads on and demolishes his sunglasses as he retrieves the ball. Nightmare. 22nd over: New Zealand 53-5 (Watling 7, De Grandhomme 17) As it turns out De Grandhomme picks up a single from the first ball, then Watling plays out the remainder of the over, featuring two pretty fruity leaves that don’t miss off stump by a huge amount. 21st over: New Zealand 52-5 (Watling 7, De Grandhomme 16) De Grandhomme looks like he’s got counter-attackin’ on his mind. He absolutely nails a pull off Wood past deep backward square, who wasn’t that far away from where it crossed the boundary but the fielder had no chance. England look like they’re going to try buying his wicket, sticking a man just in front of square, one behind and one at a more traditional fine leg. It costs them another eight runs though, Wood not helping matters by bowling a couple of fairly tame long-hops that De Grandhomme batters to the fence, twice in about the same spot. The plan then changes, as another slip comes in and Wood pitches it up. De Grandhomme nicks a single from the final ball, which shows he wants the strike to hit back, but countering against Anderson might be a rather different proposition to playing Wood. 20th over: New Zealand 39-5 (Watling 7, De Grandhomme 3) De Grandhomme plays a couple of flicks off his pads, one unconvincing - it looped up but dropped short of mid-on - one rather better, earning him his first two runs down to fine leg. He picks up another with a dab into the covers. Oh Kane! New Zealand’s best batsman goes to a strangle down the leg side, wafting at a ball that would have comfortably gone past his thighs, getting a tickle on it in the process and Bairstow takes the catch. Biiiiiiig problems now. 19th over: New Zealand 36-4 (Williamson 22, Watling 7) Wood starts from the other end: slightly odd one, considering he did basically nothing in his four morning overs. He digs some in, potentially thinking he can trouble Watling around the ribs. The New Zealand keeper plays them pretty well, though. 18th over: New Zealand 36-4 (Williamson 22, Watling 7) Four runs for Williamson, as Anderson - possibly searching for that away swing - drifts onto his thighs, and it’s flicked around the corner and to the fence. The players are back out on the field. Anderson will continue, and will be looking for more of the away shape he got before lunch. Here’s Tom Williams with a haymaker: “It seems that over the past week the Australian cricket team have learnt how to take ‘mental disintegration’ to a new level.” Here’s a full story on Warner’s press conference... Back to Christchurch and, unlike David Warner, AB Parker - who yesterday advocated wholesale changes including binning Broad - is on with a convincing mea culpa: “Well, Broad has proved me wrong within one day. Cricket, eh?” Whoever the Cricket Australia media person is seems to be making sure everyone is only asking one question, but nobody has followed up on that deliberately evasive answer about whether anyone else is involved. When asked if he things he’s been made a scapegoat, he repeats the line about taking responsibility for “my own actions.” He’s eventually ushered out with questions being fired at him as he exits. Sure, you feel a bit sorry for a man whose career might well be over - he was asked if he’s going to retire, and answered that he was going to think about what will come - but that was entirely unsatisfactory. By the by, David Warner is giving his press conference. Says he takes full responsibility for his actions, gives apologies to everyone, says he’s resigned to the fact that he may never play for Australia again. Much like Steve Smith, he breaks down in tears, in particular when he mentions his family. He takes questions, but basically just repeats the same soundbite about taking responsibility for his actions, and quite pointedly dodges a question about whether anyone other than the three players we already know about were involved in this whole thing. A terrific morning for England’s bowlers. Broad has picked up three wickets and has been superb, but Anderson bowled just as well for one wicket, toying with Raval like my cat with the worms he brings in from the garden. Kane Williamson has steadied the ship, because he’ll do that, but if England can get through him you suspect a healthy first innings lead will be in the bag. 17th over: New Zealand 32-4 (Williamson 18, Watling 7) Whheeeeey - its An Over Of Spin Before Lunch. Jack Leach gets his first bowl in an England shirt, on the button straight away even if there’s not a huge amount of spin. Watling defends and prods, and that’s a maiden to end the session. 16th over: New Zealand 32-4 (Williamson 18, Watling 7) Anderson is back for an over or two before lunch. And immediately there’s some away swing that was missing from the other end. The batsmen trade singles from the over. 15th over: New Zealand 30-4 (Williamson 17, Watling 6) Wood’s in, and goes up big style for lbw against Watling, but it was probably going down leg and might have been a touch high too. Oh, and hotspot shows a little inside edge. Other than that, it was a strong shout. Two singles from the over, and these two batsmen have at least managed to bring a bit more solidity to the innings. 14th over: New Zealand 28-4 (Williamson 16, Watling 5) Broad is in again for his seventh over. Williamson sort of looks squared up by a couple, but at the same time without really looking in danger of losing his wicket. He turns a sharp one just in front of short-leg - for about a millisecond there was a brief thought of a catch - and they dash through for three. 13th over: New Zealand 24-4 (Williamson 13, Watling 4) Wood hasn’t really looked massively penetrative. There’s a half-appeal against Williamson for lbw, which is far too high to be about but the NZ skipper will probably think he should have put it away. Each batsman gets a single. 12th over: New Zealand 22-4 (Williamson 12, Watling 3) A relative flood of runs: a single from Williamson, then a nice back-foot punch by Watling through point, and they run three. “What are the odds of New Zealand are all out for 59?” asks Matthew Doherty. If Williamson goes soon, it might be on... 11th over: New Zealand 18-4 (Williamson 11, Watling 0) New Zealand’s first run since the 7th over comes from the final ball of the 11th, as Williamson flicks a Wood delivery off his thigh for a single. 10th over: New Zealand 17-4 (Williamson 10, Watling 0) Boy, Broad looks good here. New Zealand need a hell of an effort to make anything of their innings from this point, but as long as Williamson stays there is hope. He did not hit it! Some nice tail in from Broad catches Nicholls, as it turns out, bang in front of middle/off. New Zealand deep in it now. Broad thinks he has Nicholls trapped, there’s some debate about whether he hit it but they eventually decide to review... 9th over: New Zealand 17-3 (Williamson 10, Nicholls 0) A change, as Mark Wood with his lovely smile is into the attack. Williamson leaves most of his over alone, but a sharp bumper does suggest Wood has some pace in him here. 8th over: New Zealand 17-3 (Williamson 10, Nicholls 0) Broad tries a couple of short ones first up to Nicholls, then pitches a few up and beats the bat. Somewhere, Ian Botham is telling someone he told them so. Told you he was looking good. Actually this wasn’t a particularly special ball, pitched up just outside off with perhaps a vague hint of away movement, but Taylor launches a pretty ropey drive which he seemed to regret before he finished playing it, and the ball rattles around in Cook’s hands at first slip, but he hangs on. 7th over: New Zealand 17-2 (Williamson 10, Taylor 1) Not that it’s necessarily the end of the world, but thus far Anderson only seems to have got the ball swinging left to right - so away to left-handers, in to righties. Two singles from the over. “Two candidates for me too,” writes Niall Mullen, on the matter of tailend batting. “Monty (including diving back into his crease) at Cardiff in 2009 and this...” Which reminds me - I wrote something on a related issue in January: a Joy of Six on 10th-inning partnerships, featuring Marshall’s effort... 6th over: New Zealand 15-2 (Williamson 9, Taylor 1) Taylor plays a couple of fairly unconvincing drives, then Broad tries to bounce him. Always tricky to judge this sort of thing, but Broad looks like he’s running in smoothly and with purpose, and when he’s doing that he usually takes wickets. Great tail end innings nomination from Thomas Jenkins. Cannot in all good conscience endorse the final statement, though: “I’m sure that we can all think of bigger scores and many more important innings, but for me there’s no better tale of tail-end romance than McGrath’s 61 against New Zealand. It’s not that it’s the last two batsmen combining together to utterly demoralize the opposition. “It’s not watching Dizzy unfurl beautiful shots as McGrath looks every inch his average at the start of his innings. It’s watching all of the all-time batting greats in the Aussie dressing room beam with delight and utter incredulity as McGrath somehow morphs temporarily into a batsman capable of consistently playing shots of which any of them would have been proud. It’s watching teammates revel together in the unlikeliest of successes of a clearly beloved team member. We all love to hate the Aussies, but sometimes it’s impossible not to love them too.” 5th over: New Zealand 15-2 (Williamson 9, Taylor 1) Eeesh, that was close to a massive wicket for England. The ball before, new bat Ross Taylor had got off the mark with a tuck behind square-leg. No! He didn’t hit it! But the ball hit Williamson’s pad a gnat’s eyelash outside off stump, so even though with the in-swing it was crashing into middle stump, they stay with Marais Erasmus’s decision. Anderson absolutely screams for lbw against Williamson, but it looked like he hit the cover off the thing. Nevertheless, they go upstairs... Jeet Raval’s relatively brief but intense nightmare is over: the inevitable happens as he gets a feather edge on one of those quite brilliant Anderson away-shapers, and he can now seek peace in the dressing room. 4th over: New Zealand 14-1 (Raval 5, Williamson 9) A third three for Williamson, driving through the covers, making batting look rather easy on this strip. Raval then leaves one that takes a coat of paint from the off bail, before finally playing a good stroke, driving past mid-off for yet another three. Then the roles are reversed somewhat, as the previously imperious Williamson firstly gets a leading edge on one that plops just in front of him, then is beaten on the outside twice with a lovely pair of Broad seamers. 3rd over: New Zealand 8-1 (Raval 2, Williamson 6) Obviously I am not one to offer advice to Jimmy Anderson on what sort of line to bowl, but I would recommend that a leg-stump half-volley to Kane Williamson isn’t the best. He’s lucky to only concede three really, as Williamson drives past mid-wicket and the slow outfield keeps it from the ropes. For the remainder of the over, Anderson continues bullying Raval, who is again fortunate not to snick some absolute beauties. 2nd over: New Zealand 4-1 (Raval 1, Williamson 3) Here’s the main man, and he’s away with a tuck into a broadly unpatrolled area of the field, down towards the mid-wicket fence, for which he collects an easy three. Raval squirts a single off a thick inside edge, just past a crouching short-leg. Meanwhile, an appreciation of Courtney Walsh’s batting, from Robert Wilson: “Guy Hornsby is, of course, quite correct. There are many cherished, spectacular or notably hilarious tailenders of legendary status but no one comes close to Courtney Walsh. That spasmodic masterpiece of a leave (someone described it as being like watching an octopus falling out of a tree) was not unusual. He always batted like that. This superbly, graceful athlete and occasionally terrifying bowler batted like a kitten doing bomb-disposal with wet spaghetti. His frank terror is deeply thrilling. He was the same against the bloody spinners. “You can’t teach that.” Stu Broad has the ball from t’other end, and he nearly gets through Latham’s defences with his first delivery, a thick inside edge eventually running harmlessly away. But he has more joy with the third one, a full one that just seams a little, Latham drives unconvincingly and Bairstow takes the most regulation of catches. Brilliant start for England. 1st over: New Zealand 0-0 (Raval 0, Latham 0) Anderson starts off with a few balls looking for some swing, and although there isn’t anything extravagant there he beats Raval with the last three of the over that move just enough to have the New Zealand opener grasping. The last one in particular, pitching on about middle, heading for the left-hander’s off and shaping away, was the sort of ball that a batsman just has to shove his bat towards and hope for the best. The players are out for New Zealand’s reply: Jeet Raval and Tom Latham are the batsmen, Jimmy Anderson has the ball first up. For what it’s worth, this is the fifth Test at the Hagley Oval and the previous first innings scores have been 441 (New Zealand vs Sri Lanka, 2014), 370 (New Zealand vs Australia, 2016), 289 (Bangladesh vs New Zealand, 2017) and 133 (Pakistan vs New Zealand, 2016). Basically impossible to reliably judge whether it’s a good score yet or not. Instinct says it isn’t, but let’s see. Tough to criticise Bairstow after the innings-saving knock, but he tries to lift a ramp shot from a short ball to the boundary, but in fact just guides it straight to the sort of fly slip thing fielder that Kane Williamson had recently put there for just such an eventuality. Taylor takes a comfortable catch, and England are done. 96th over: England 307-9 (Bairstow 101, Anderson 0) Jimmy Anderson, final man in, keeps out the remaining four balls of the over, if not with the utmost confidence. Terrific bowling from Southee, angling one across Leach which moves away a touch, takes the edge and Watling catches. Six wickets now for Southee, who will record his best analysis (currently 7-64) if he takes the final one sharpish. 95th over: England 306-8 (Bairstow 100, Leach 16) Leach edges the last ball of the over, but short of the slips. Bairstow goes to 99 with a push in front of point, then is returned to the strike with - good grief - yet another absurd short one that Watling this time just manages to parry. But the next ball, Bairstow nudges through square-leg, runs through for a single and that’s his fifth Test match century. Terrific scenes. 94th over: England 303-8 (Bairstow 98, Leach 16) Bairstow gets off the mark for the day with a careful push to mid-wicket. Then poor BJ Watling can only wave at another flamboyant bouncer, this time from Southee, and this time that heads to the boundary and brings up the 300 for England. Quite why they weren’t wides is anyone’s guess: Watling essentially has six byes against his name in the last two overs because he isn’t, to paraphrase Richie Benaud, Joel Garner standing on Joel Garner’s shoulders. Peter Rowntree has a couple of slightly less, erm, ‘mainstream’ selections for the tailenders’ innings riff. “Two candidates for me - the famous ‘chalk rings’ on the bat by Wardle on Ashes debut 1953 at Trent Bridge, when Wardle wound up Lindwall in a way no other cricketer has done. It was outrageously original humour. Then also the partnership of Nixon and Millns for Leicestershire v Lancs, when Lancashire had scored over 500 on the first day, Leicestershire were 138-7, Millns came in as nightwatchman, their number 11, the next day they not only saved the follow-on, Millns was still there near tea-time.” 93rd over: England 298-8 (Bairstow 97, Leach 16) Boult digs one in to Leach, it really lifts on him but the debutant plays it pretty well, keeping it down as best he can. The next ball is a wild legside bouncer that Watling flings himself to his right to try and stop, but can’t and they run two of the harshest byes. Leach then drives at a couple, missing the first but connecting with the second, sending it just in front of point for two. 92nd over: England 294-8 (Bairstow 97, Leach 14) Tim Southee has the ball from the other end, as Bairstow watchfully approaches his century. No runs from the over, despite a couple of positive drives. Chris Bourne writes: “The tail-end innings that popped into my head was Tim Southee’s exuberant debut vs England in 2008. He made a scorching 77 runs off 42 balls - and took a 5-for during the match as well. It remains his best Test innings but although I’m not a Kiwi, I’d love to see him repeat his heroics one of these days. It was a hopeless cause, but while he was at the crease, with the certainty of a 19-year-old, anything seemed possible.” 91st over: England 294-8 (Bairstow 97, Leach 14) Trent Boult opens up, bowling to Jack Leach, and he’s a little all over the place in his first few balls, one of which heading way down leg is swatted to the fine leg boundary. Leach, with a crouched stance as if he’s contemplating a gardening problem, keeps out a decent yorker from the last ball. The players are out there, the Hagley Oval is looking utterly wonderful, and cricket is about to happen. Leave the rest of the world for a while and enjoy this. The thing I hadn’t realised about that innings from big Devon is, he wasn’t batting at 11. Phil Tufnell, of course, took that honour. “Devon Malcolm at Sydney in 1995,” suggests Peter Lee. “During those long, bleak winters the sight of the archetypal bunny long-handling Warne into the stands was fabulous.” After Mark ‘The Don’ Wood’s knock yesterday, let’s have your favourite innings by a tailender. An obvious one, but Ashley Giles at the Oval in 2005 will always have the most special place in my heart. Preach. Here’s bowler Mark Wood, on batting. Wood admitted that he started as a batsman as a kid and at the Hagley Oval he played some copybook drives. “The trouble is,” he said, “when I get to 20 I think I’m like Bradman and play too many shots. Sometimes I get ahead of myself. There were a lot of bouncers, especially when Wagner was bowling, and that may have helped. At least I knew where the ball was likely to be.” It was one of those bouncers that Wood cracked over ropes at square leg. Get yourself up to speed with Vic Marks’s report from day one at the Hagley Oval. Difficult to know what to make of this score so far for England. It feels below par, and it they have reached this point in spite of their top/middle order batsmen rather than because of them. But should the remaining two wickets manage another 60 or 70 runs, then they will at least have something competitive. Watching Jonny Bairstow score his century, which barring calamities he will do early on, will be suitable reward for those of us who sat through James Vince’s efforts yesterday. And the rest of the top six really, but particularly Vince, the possibly the worst good batsmen to have ever represented England. He played a couple of straight drives yesterday you could frame and put on your wall, but then he was out. Without warning, apart from in every other Test innings he’s ever played. But enough of Vince. Attention will turn to the bowlers at some point in the next couple of hours, and there are plenty of questions with them as well as the batsmen. Will Ben Stokes bowl? What sort of pace will Mark Wood achieve? How will Jack Leach do on his debut? Will England have to rely on Jimmy Anderson? Settle in.

Parts of the tree are used to treat malaria and infertility. On occasion, women give birth inside its hollow trunk. Now, the rest of the world is catching on to the benefits of the baobab fruit, which health food companies are trumpeting as the newest “superfood”. According to the Grocer, Ocado has reported a 27% increase in weekly sales since the start of 2018, thanks, in part, to the rise of “liquid breakfasts”. Baobab, in its white powder form, is used predominantly in smoothies and porridge. It was approved for European markets only 10 years ago, but thanks to its purported levels of antioxidants, potassium and phosphorus, high level of vitamin C, calcium and fibre, it has seen its uses expanded into gin, beauty products and yoghurt. And with an increased interest in west African cooking, it is also appearing on British menus such as Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen in east London. “We make baobab butter for our baobab popcorn, we also use it to marinate and pan-fry tilapia and prawns sometimes and we’re experimenting with a baobab ice cream,” said Zoe Adjonyoh, the restaurant’s founder. Across Africa, the baobab tree is a common sight – as is the fruit in local markets. But, given its health properties and the hype around fellow super imports such as açaí and goji berries, it seems surprising that it’s taken this long to catch on elsewhere, though western companies have long used the tree as a way to appear authentically “African”. In an attempt to connect with Nigerians, McDonald’s proclaimed itself to be as “deeply rooted” in the community as “the unique African baobab tree”. The issue is, perhaps, an aesthetic one: though the tree is photogenic and pops up in Instagram feeds, the fruit – large, oblong with a velvety green fur – is less appealing for social media. The fruit’s inside off-white powdery appearance also makes it a challenge for food photographers. Chandni Sanghani of Aduna, a company specialising in African-based foods, said: “It’s hard to sell to a western customer because of how it looks – we have no frame of reference.” Taste-wise, she added, it has proved a surprising hit among her customers for its “healthy sherbet flavour”. Baobab is harvested using a stick that is looped around a branch 20-metres high and pulled down, causing the fruits to fall. While Aduna works to ensure trade is fair, there are concerns that if it takes off internationally, the baobab would become tantamount to a crop, which could threaten it as a local resource and a key part of local diets and medicines. Failure to regulate the harvest and export, and over-farming, could also affect the tree’s biodiversity. The hope is that if farmers are able to regulate in the same way the coffee industry has attempted to, it could be a boon to the African market. Until then, it is best used with care and consideration for its sourcing. Remember too, the old Akan and Ewe proverb: “Knowledge is like a baobab tree; no one person can embrace it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14955","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T23:00:21Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,955","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14955","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14955","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,955","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/02/how-petula-clark-and-harry-belafonte-fought-racism-arm-in-arm","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T09:00:06Z","webTitle":"How Petula Clark and Harry Belafonte fought racism arm in arm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/02/how-petula-clark-and-harry-belafonte-fought-racism-arm-in-arm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/02/how-petula-clark-and-harry-belafonte-fought-racism-arm-in-arm","fields":{"headline":"How Petula Clark and Harry Belafonte fought racism arm in arm","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Had you asked anyone in 1968 to pick the British female singer most likely to become embroiled in a race-related TV scandal, no one would have said Petula Clark. Not “Pet”. Not pop’s prim Miss Jean Brodie to the St Trinian’s brass of Sandie, Cilla and Lulu. Not the “Singing Sweetheart” of the wireless era. Clark’s elocutionary voice was first immortalised on shellac in 1949 and filed under “easy listening” ever since, whether it was her first UK No 1, Sailor, in 1961, or her signature anthem Downtown. The latter swam with the tide of the Beatles-led British Invasion to top the US charts in early 1965, helping her become the first British female singer to win a Grammy. That it was also written by the man later responsible for the theme to Neighbours, Tony Hatch, says much about Clark’s immunity to the Vidal Sassoon cool of her younger, earthier pop peers: she was an anomalous supper club chanteuse for whom the 60s often shone but never swung. And yet it was Clark who, in the decade’s “year of revolt”, found herself at the centre of a media controversy involving race, censorship and endemic bigotry in a newly desegregated yet depressingly divided US. All because she had dared to place her white, English fingers upon the black Caribbean-American arm of her friend and fellow singer, Harry Belafonte. “It sounds stupid now,” says Steve Binder, the TV director responsible for encouraging their contentious intimacy. “But back then it became an international story in Newsweek and Time magazine. It wouldn’t even have been an incident if the show’s sponsor hadn’t said anything. Petula touched Harry’s arm and the next thing they went bonkers.” Binder was a 35-year-old pop TV veteran when he was hired by NBC to direct Clark’s first one-hour US TV special. The sponsor was Plymouth motors, a division of Chrysler, and the catalyst for all the ensuing hullabaloo was its head of advertising: a 49-year-old decorated US Air Force pilot and former second world war PoW named Doyle Lott. Lott’s military record almost certainly had something to do with his evident opposition to Clark’s choice of guest star. Once the “King of Calypso”, by 1968 Belafonte was using his celebrity to become a prominent civil rights activist. That February, he’d stood in for Johnny Carson as host of the Tonight Show, discussing Vietnam, poverty and racial inequality with political ally Bobby Kennedy, and his close friend, Dr Martin Luther King Jr. Belafonte’s liberal, anti-Vietnam stance wouldn’t have sat well with Lott’s Silver Star medal for valour in combat, nor his waiting plot in Arlington cemetery. Whatever his motives – political or racial – from the moment Binder first brought Belafonte’s name into discussion, Lott attempted to veto him. “As soon as Belafonte said yes to the show, I rang up the ad agency to tell them the good news,” says Binder. “They said: ‘You’ve got Belafonte! Wow!’ Because at that time Harry had more or less stopped doing variety TV. So this was a real coup, to have Belafonte back singing on screen. But then two minutes later, I get another call from a different guy at the agency who tells me: ‘We have to get rid of Belafonte.’ I was confused. And the guy said: ‘Off the record, the reason is Lott’s a bigot. He doesn’t want a black person on the show.’ I was speechless.” The head of Chrysler overruled Lott and allowed the network to keep Belafonte on the show. Lott, however, wasn’t to be outdone. For the show’s filming, he took residence in a green room near the soundstage, following along on a monitor. The Belafonte sequence was a 10-minute solo spot with minimal staging, climaxing with Clark’s reappearance on screen for a duet of her own song On the Path of Glory, a sober lament on the horrors of war. “NBC were nervous,” notes Binder. “We had to convince them that it wasn’t about Vietnam but about war in general.” The script said nothing about Clark and Belafonte touching. “It was improvised,” Binder says. “The first few takes, Petula walked up and stopped a few steps behind Harry, but I felt it wasn’t working. So I said to Petula: ‘Just go right up alongside him and stand shoulder to shoulder.’ So we do this take and all of a sudden it starts happening. Her eyes are tearing up, Harry’s eyes are tearing up and Petula becomes so emotional that she reaches over and physically holds Harry’s forearm. And I’m tearing up too, thinking: ‘This is great! This is the take!’ And then it all blew up.” No sooner had Binder cried “cut” than Lott stormed crimson-faced out of the green room and on to the set. “Screaming,” says Binder. “Because a white woman had touched a black man on screen. Seriously! It sounds comical but he was yelling ‘This will never get on TV!’ and ‘We’ll all lose our jobs!’ and demanding that I reshoot it, which I point blank refused to do. He was literally shouting ‘You’ll never work in this town again’ and threatening to fire me.” In his 2011 autobiography, My Song, Belafonte admits he was prepared to acquiesce to Lott’s demands, if only for the sake of damage limitation to Clark’s stateside reputation. “Perhaps, I told her, we should pick another fight, another day – at least while her best interests were at stake. ‘Forget my best interests,’ she said. ‘What would you do?’ I grinned. ‘I’d nail the bastard.’ ‘So we will,’ she replied.” Binder and Clark’s husband, Claude Wolff, grabbed the tapes while Lott was on the phone, and had a technician erase all the earlier edits. “The only one NBC had, the only one they could broadcast, was the last one where they touched. When Lott came off the phone and found out, he went even more nuts.” The irony to Lott’s pitiful wrath was that its ultimate victim was himself. A whole month before Petula was scheduled to be broadcast, it was Belafonte who took the story to the papers and generated a media storm, publicly disgracing Lott for what he described as “the most outrageous case of racism I have ever seen in this business”. A mortified Lott pleaded he’d merely been “tired” and had “overreacted to the staging, not to any feeling of discrimination”. He also telephoned Belafonte, offering an apology. It wasn’t accepted. “Apologies in these situations mean nothing,” Belafonte later explained. “They change neither that man’s heart nor my skin. Inside, he feels the same way because of how I look on the outside. He can apologise for the balance of his life but it won’t alter the attitude he has today. And a man with such an attitude has to be exposed.” An embarrassed Chrysler further distanced itself from Lott, insisting the matter “resulted solely from the reaction of a single individual and by no means represents the Plymouth division’s attitude or policy on such matters”. When Petula was finally broadcast on Tuesday 2 April 1968, “the touch” intact, Lott had been relieved of his post and moved in the company. Clark’s acceptance into the US entertainment mainstream continued with a Golden Globe nomination for her first Hollywood musical, Finian’s Rainbow, and the following year’s summer season at Caesar’s Palace. Binder similarly prospered, earning himself a place in rock’n’roll history as the director of NBC’s next big TV special, rescuing Elvis Presley from the brink of obsolescence. Most viewers who saw Clark’s hand caress Belafonte’s arm that evening in April 1968 probably wondered what all the fuss had been about. Yet within 48 hours, America’s racial tensions were violently cast into far sharper relief by a single gunshot in Memphis: King’s assassination. One week to the day that Belafonte appeared on prime-time TV screens with Clark hanging on his arm, he was stood at an Atlanta graveside with another female hand clinging to his elbow: that of Martin Luther King’s widow, Coretta."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/30/trump-distracts-america-three-existential-threats","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T15:52:00Z","webTitle":"Trump distracts America from the task of facing three existential threats | Michael H Fuchs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/30/trump-distracts-america-three-existential-threats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/30/trump-distracts-america-three-existential-threats","fields":{"headline":"Trump distracts America from the task of facing three existential threats","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s daily assaults on American democracy and the pillars of America’s role in the world are disastrous – and they are also distracting America from even bigger global challenges. At just the moment when the United States must be joining together with the rest of the world to confront three existential threats – climate change, challenges to democracy, and the rise of China – Americans are forced to spend every waking minute mitigating Trump’s damage. In Trump’s America, it’s hard to keep up. The news and controversies come so quickly they eat into each other’s news cycles. Actions by the Trump administration that previously might have brought down a presidency (or at least merited a congressional inquiry) pass in a matter of hours as the next jaw-dropping scandal explodes. As Trump forces America’s attention span to shrink (was that even possible?), we are unable to address the three threats that could fundamentally endanger American national security. First, climate change. It’s hard to overstate the magnitude of this threat. The seas are rising, imperiling hundreds of millions of people in coastal communities from Shanghai to Miami. Climate change is likely enhancing the devastation of extreme weather like storms and heatwaves. Unless national and global actions are taken, the World Bank estimates that by 2050, more than 140 million people in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia will be forced to leave their homes because of climate change. The near to mid-term effects of the heating planet could affect hundreds of millions. The long-term effects could wipe out humanity. Preventing the worst effects of climate change and reversing its course would require a global effort the likes of which we’ve only seen in the movie Independence Day, in which the countries of the world put aside their disagreements to fight an alien invasion threatening all of humankind. That’s how difficult this would be in normal circumstances. But in Donald Trump’s world, we are moving backwards, from announcing the intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement to gutting the federal government’s role as a defender of the environment. The necessary efforts of actors like the US Climate Alliance to encourage US states to continue the transition away from dirty fuels can only do so much in the absence of presidential leadership. And America has vacated the global effort – and abandoned its leadership role – to forge solutions. Second, the rise of China. China is increasingly willing to throw its weight around the world and to invest in the foundations of long-term global influence. China’s bullying of neighbors in the East and South China Seas and Doklam reveal a brazenness of a more militarily powerful China. The creation of the Belt and Road Initiative, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) bank are Chinese moves to extend its economic and strategic sway. In the coming years, China may have an extraordinary ability to shape the world’s economic and strategic landscape in ways that could undermine the interests of the United States, from sparking instability in Asia to bolstering the strength of authoritarians. Meanwhile, Donald Trump can’t figure out what he thinks of China. He praises Xi Jinping – expressing jealousy of China’s removing presidential term limits – while planning tariffs on Chinese goods. He criticizes China’s relationship with North Korea while ignoring China’s destabilizing acts in the South China Sea. At the same time that China is finding new confidence in its global role, the one country capable of pushing back is missing in action. Third, the endurance of liberal democracy. From Poland to the Philippines, Hungary to Turkey to the United States and beyond, democracies are under attack from within by demagogues, authoritarians and radical populists. America’s prosperity and stability has long depended on friends that share democratic values and today that foundation is under pressure. If the ranks of democracy wither, America will face growing threats to its peace and prosperity. Democratic values are in jeopardy in Trump’s America too. Trump is attacking democratic institutions from the judiciary to the FBI. He is eroding norms once thought sacred, such as avoiding business conflicts of interest. He exhibits authoritarian impulses like asking officials for personal loyalty. And he is stoking white nationalism while pursuing discriminatory policies against minorities. In the face of this grave danger to American democracy, many Americans are resisting. Honorable government officials, civil society organizations and concerned citizens are working hard to safeguard laws and institutions. This battle to protect American democracy itself is the most urgent task – and without a strong, democratic America, it will be difficult to tackle the other existential threats. Unfortunately, much of the work shoring up democracy in America amounts to bailing out the sinking ship as Trump pokes holes in it – trying to stay afloat rather than building a more powerful democracy. And as we try to save our own ship, liberal democracies across the world must face their own existential challenges without America’s help. Today, America is fighting to safeguard its identity as a welcoming, tolerant, democratic country. But when we emerge from our Trumpian nightmare – assuming we do so intact – America will have lost precious time to tackle global existential threats that are growing.

Mourinho also said he expects Luke Shaw to still be at United next season, despite substituting the defender at half-time in the win over Brighton before the international break and again criticising the left-back’s display. Pogba suffered the hamstring problem early in the first half of the 3-0 win over Basel in the Champions League on 12 September. He had been in fine form until then but since his return for the 4-1 victory over Newcastle in November, the 25-year-old has laboured. While Pogba was dropped and an unused replacement against Brighton, Mourinho dismissed the suggestion the player’s continued omission was because of any lingering effects of his spell out. “It’s nothing to do with his injury,” Mourinho said. “His recovery was good. He is very fine after the injury. It was a difficult injury, it was an injury that other players, other clubs, other medical assessments – they end in surgery, his option with the medical opinions was not to go to the surgery table and his recovery was really good. He is more than fine in relation to his recovery from the injury which is an area sometimes where you have a recurrence. In his case, not at all.” Pressed on what the dip in form is down to, Mourinho said: “Ask him when you get a chance.” Pogba scored for France in their 3-1 friendly win in Russia on Tuesday, yet Mourinho refused to give an assessment of his display. “I don’t comment on my players’ performances in national teams,” he said. Of Shaw still being at Old Trafford next season, Mourinho said: “I think so but I always say the door is open for everyone [to leave] so no problem for him, but I think so.” Mourinho also confirmed Shaw is in the squad for Saturday’s home game against Swansea. “He’s selected, he’s in the 18,” the manager said. Mourinho brushed off a report that claimed Shaw had challenged him regarding his substitution against Brighton. “You are saying he asked me why I changed him. That is what you are saying. A report that Luke asked me why I changed him? I told him [at the time]. He didn’t ask me the question – I told him.” In January, Mourinho said Shaw was one of the best left-backs in the Premier League. “It’s true,” he said. “What happened since then? Nothing. I am the coach. I make the changes I want to do. If I want to change the player in minute five I change the player in minute five. If I want to change in minute 98 I change in minute 98. The moment when a new rule comes to football that forbids managers to do that then I become a pundit, not a manager. Nothing happened.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/08/british-jazz-invasion-moses-boyd-matthew-halsall-nubya-garcia","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T08:30:25Z","webTitle":"The British jazz explosion: meet the musicians rewriting the rulebook","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/08/british-jazz-invasion-moses-boyd-matthew-halsall-nubya-garcia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/08/british-jazz-invasion-moses-boyd-matthew-halsall-nubya-garcia","fields":{"headline":"The British jazz explosion: meet the musicians rewriting the rulebook","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Every so often, British jazz pops its head above the parapet, gets a Mercury nomination, and has a noodle on telly to remind everyone that it’s still there, like it’s always been, parping away from mainstream view. For many of us, jazz has seemed like something other people listened to. But in the past few years, the genre has had a serious overhaul. When Kendrick Lamar released his landmark album To Pimp a Butterfly in 2015, one of its most extraordinary aspects was its liberal use of jazz, which dovetailed with hip-hop and opened it up for a new generation. Not only did it immediately feel more accessible but, played by the likes of strikingly cosmic characters such as Thundercat and Kamasi Washington, it looked commandingly cool. In the UK, a new and thrilling jazz movement has evolved. As with Lamar, Thundercat and Washington, it is born out of fresh experimentalism, is reaching far younger, more diverse audiences and doesn’t care for snootiness. Unlike in previous waves, these musicians are in their 20s and early 30s, come from diverse backgrounds and, as with grime, have created their own community outside of major labels and concert halls. Their music, meanwhile, pulls liberally from other genres, whether hip-hop, neo-soul, UK club sounds such as broken beat, or from the African and Caribbean diaspora. And it’s not just at gigs that you can hear it but, much like in the acid jazz days, nightclubs too. British DJs such as Bradley Zero and Floating Points have liberated jazz for the dancefloor to the extent that it’s now not unheard of for a 10-minute Pharaoh Sanders odyssey to be spun on the decks to an appreciative, twentysomething crowd. Notable, too, is how prolific this wave is, with jazz musicians infiltrating summer music festival listings, signing to indie labels or taking their sound abroad. The sheer volume of talent is being recognised across the world. “Wherever I’m travelling, whether it’s in the States, Argentina, Japan, or all over Europe, everyone is talking to me about the British invasion,” says DJ and broadcaster Gilles Peterson, who himself helped usher in the acid jazz sound of the mid-80s. “I’ve had people talking about Courtney Pine and Steve Williamson in slightly hushed tones, but I’ve never had this before. They feel this is a very important movement.” The movement hasn’t just sprung out of nowhere. In London especially there is the sense that today’s jazz musicians have come up together over the past few years. They are collaborative, constantly threading through one another’s projects, and jamming together at a number of DIY stomping grounds, including the Church of Sound in an east London chapel and Dalston’s Total Refreshment Centre. South of the river, where much of the capital’s abundant scene has coalesced, music nights Steez and weekly Afrofuturism session Steam Down – recently attended by Kamasi Washington – are where players team up and try out new material. Broadcaster Teju Adeleye says: “The artists don’t feel like inaccessible superstars, they come to all the gigs and jam nights.” Adeleye is one of the new crop of radio hosts who are supporting jazz’s rising stars on internet stations such as NTS and Worldwide FM. “Having affordable spaces where people can go and experiment in front of audiences is important,” she says. “It fosters something genuine in a city where so much is driven by corporate ventures.” Also crucial are the jam sessions and artist development charities that have nurtured many of the new wave. These include Tomorrow’s Warriors, at London’s Southbank Centre, whose ethos is to support the development of jazz newbies, especially women and musicians of colour. It’s an ethos shared by Jazz re:freshed, Justin McKenzie and Adam Moses’s promotions company turned label, which has played a huge part in supporting new jazz, whether giving musicians a stage in the UK or overseas. Perhaps what’s most exciting, though, is the sense that this generation is wresting jazz from its gatekeepers and making it their own. With this scene, says Adeleye, “not everyone is classically or formally trained”, and as a result “there’s an accessible, anti‑hero energy that feels like sweet vindication for a music that should be for everyone, but has felt locked away and preserved only for a few. They’ve liberated the sound.” Soweto Kinch, an established saxophonist who runs Birmingham-based jam session The Live Box, agrees. “Genre boundaries are more fluid,” he says. “There’s less kowtowing to the jazz police.” The UK’s next-gen jazzers have an important confidence and it’s bolstered by the fact that their audience want to hear something original. It’s why Kinch hopes this jazz wave won’t end up being a wave at all, but will be here to stay: “It’s music of quality and of longevity; it’s not disposable new music,” he says. Peterson agrees: “This lot are all doing original music, and that’s a really important sign. The last thing jazz needs is another version of Summertime or Feeling Good. Just make original music – that’s what people want.” Moses Boyd: ‘Seeing how Gilles Peterson used jazz in club culture, the dots all started to connect for me’ London-based drummer, composer and producer, 26 “I’ve been in Cape Town and people are talking about what’s going on here,” says Moses Boyd of the London jazz scene, which he has played a central role in shaking up and making new over the past few years. “In New York and at South by Southwest, people stop me in the street and show interest. It’s definitely a good time.” Boyd grew up in Catford, south-east London, absorbing a wide range of musical influences, even as he found his rhythm as a jazz drummer. “I was into [grime collective] Roll Deep and I was into Duke Ellington, there was no separation to me,” says the 26-year-old. “It was just me following my interests.” You can hear this very clearly in Boyd’s 2017 solo EP Absolute Zero, which fuses live jazz drumming with synthesised sounds and grime rhythms. Even his more straightforward jazz tracks have the potential to fill dancefloors. When he recorded Rye Lane Shuffle in 2016, Boyd sent it to his mentor Sam Shepherd, AKA DJ and producer Floating Points. “Before I knew it, Sam had cut a dubplate and was sending me videos of him spinning it across the world. Suddenly my inbox was filling with DJs asking, ‘Where can I get this?’ That was a big shift for me.” These days Boyd is surrounded by jazz musicians with a similarly open-minded approach to genre and process, but 10 years ago, when he started playing around London, things felt very different. “There was a big audience but it wasn’t really people like me. The jazz world felt very separate.” Touring with Soweto Kinch and meeting Gilles Peterson helped Boyd find his own way. “Seeing how Gilles used jazz in club culture, the dots all started to connect for me. I was like, ‘there is a place for the music I’ve been hearing in my head’. Because it’s easy to get disillusioned: maybe it’s just me, maybe I’m in the wrong country, maybe I’m some alien planted here. But gradually it started to click.” It’s not just the music and the people behind it that are changing, he says, but also “how it’s all presented. Obviously technology has a big part to play. Whether it’s through Instagram or Twitter, you’re seeing more of the personalities behind the music. Our generation has been a lot more switched-on to how the music is branded and where it’s featured – like, does it go in the jazz listings or on [electronic music listings site] Resident Advisor?” Another big influence on the current sound, Boyd says, is London itself and its vibrant sound‑system culture. “I think London is a unique place, a very culturally integrated place,” he says. “You walk down the street and hear 10 different languages being spoken and that’s not strange. That definitely seeps into the music.” Interview by Killian Fox Moses Boyd plays at the Love Supreme jazz festival, Glynde, East Sussex, 29 June-1 July Shabaka Hutchings : ‘Young musicians aren’t trying to satisfy the standards that were set by jazz in the past’ London-based bandleader and saxophone and clarinet player, 33 Shabaka Hutchings is easily one of the most interesting bandleaders of the past decade. He deals in shape-shifting sax and clarinet, but it’s his carefree approach to other genres that’s established him as a musical outlier who’s rattling rigid jazz traditions. His three projects, Shabaka and the Ancestors, Sons of Kemet and The Comet Is Coming – the latter a nominee in the Mercury’s “token jazz category”, he jokes – are peppered variously with calypso, dub, Afrofuturist beats and hat-tips to Sun Ra, Miles Davis and sweat‑soaked New Orleans party music. Trumpeter and Gondwana label boss, Matthew Halsall, calls Hutchings “the Kamasi Washington of the UK jazz scene” and it’s easy to see why. Hutchings – who is from Birmingham by way of Barbados, where he lived till he was 16 – is a similarly gifted brass player, has a commanding presence, and comes with a penchant for all things cosmic. He is also as ubiquitous, having played with the likes of mid-00s breakthroughs Melt Yourself Down, Ethio-jazz pioneer Mulatu Astatke and Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, on the latter’s soundtrack for Paul Thomas Anderson’s film The Master. The fact that Hutchings has “never been completely comfortable with jazz” figures. “When I was younger, I struggled with how to play jazz as the great art form,” he says, which is why his music pulls from so many different places instead. “I might be in a regular jazz quartet, and I might want to write something that’s complex, [but I’ll] rack my brains and come out with something more simple – and maybe that’s a bashment bassline.” There’s plenty of the latter on the new Sons of Kemet album, Your Queen Is a Reptile, which explores dual Caribbean and British identities. Its songs, named after lesser-heralded influential women from history, reject the monarchy, finding new “queens” to celebrate instead – such as Angela Davis and Doreen Lawrence – with Hutchings’s sax and clarinet tangled with Theon Cross’s tuba and guest MCing from junglist Congo Natty. Hutchings is also helping to document the scene, and last month oversaw We Out Here, a compilation that spotlights south London’s rising stars. He gathered together Maisha, Ezra Collective, Moses Boyd, Theon Cross, Nubya Garcia, Triforce, Joe Armon-Jones and Kokoroko and recorded them over three days of jamming last year. He says of these musicians that, much like him, “the differences in the generation now and generations past is that it feels like young musicians aren’t trying to satisfy the standards that were set by jazz in the past. They’re just going, ‘What is the music that represents me today?’” This generation are bringing with them a younger audience, though it tickles Hutchings because, at 33, he’s old enough to remember “the time where jazz wasn’t cool at all. If you said, ‘I play jazz’, people were just like, ‘Oh no, that’s terrible’.” But he suggests that jazz will continue to innovate regardless of trends. Like punk, “it’s an attitude of, ‘Fuck it, we’re doing something that’s probably not going to be popular anyway’. Jazz is that music that no one’s expecting to go anywhere, and the musicians are just getting on with it.” Interview by Kate Hutchinson Your Queen Is a Reptile by Sons of Kemet is out now on Impulse! Sheila Maurice-Grey: ‘People are taking from different aspects of their culture and making it a British thing’ London-based trumpeter, 27 If there is a movement happening in the UK, says Sheila Maurice-Grey, then it’s not limited to jazz alone, it’s a “new wave of British culture”. The 27-year-old trumpeter and visual artist grew up in Vauxhall, south-west London, her mother from Sierra Leone, her father from Guinea Bissau and her stepfather from South Africa and Zimbabwe. She says that heritages such as hers – “this idea that I’m British, but I’ll never be classed as English” – is “what’s adding to the scene everyone keeps talking about”. She and her peers are changing things up because they are “taking from different aspects of their culture and making it a British thing”. Maurice-Grey was encouraged to pick up her instrument by the late Mat Fox, who as well as being her music teacher also ran the carnival band-style youth project Kinetika Bloco. She was inspired to hold her own masterclasses as part of Kinetika, called Bloco Lates, because “it’s important to always be aware of the people coming behind you”. Kinetika is also where the west African influences in her band, Kokoroko, have come from. She met their percussionist, Onome Edgeworth, during a musical project in Kenya and the two were “complaining to each other that there are so many Afrobeat bands in the UK that perform for people that don’t look like us”. They decided to start a group to challenge that and represent “the idea of being young, black and British”. She says the jazz world at large is closed off “and that’s a big problem”. She belongs to a seven-strong, mostly female collective, Nérija, and says, “most of our audience is basically white, middle-class [and] upper-class, elderly people. It’s cool, but that’s not what we want to do. In the next five years, we want to play to people our age.” But the jazz establishment is finally waking up to her generation, and Kokoroko are themselves due to play London jazz club Ronnie Scott’s in May. Maurice-Grey thinks there’s still a way to go; Scott’s is “trying to develop a new relationship with different artists, it’s interesting,” she says, one eyebrow raised – but she’s ready for the test of trying to make a seated dinner club get up and dance. “The audience is very much part of the show,” she says. “There’s no us and them. It’s more about collaborating to make it magical. We’re all part of this journey.” KH Yazmin Lacey: ‘There’s an undercurrent of everybody speaking their truth now, and that’s what jazz means’ Nottingham-based singer-songwriter, 29 Yazmin Lacey didn’t exactly elbow her way into a career as a singer of smoky, soulful jazz music; she had to be enticed. Growing up in a musical family in east London, she had a strong singing voice but never felt inclined to show it off. Shortly after moving to Nottingham in 2013, she let her guard down. “I’d had a lot to drink,” she laughs. “Someone persuaded me to sing. Then this girl came over and said, ‘Oh my gosh, I run this acoustic night, do you want to perform?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, take my number.’ “Three days later I saw that she’d put my name on a flyer. That freaked me out,” Lacey tells me when we meet in central London. But she kept her promise and, accompanied by a guitarist, performed three songs to a small room above a Nottingham vegan cafe. It helped that she was far from home. “I don’t think I would have done it if I was in London,” she says. “Some of [the lyrics were] so honest and not meant to be heard by people I know. But up in Nottingham, where I didn’t know anyone, I was like, ‘Fuck it.’” Gradually, while working at a children’s charity by day, Lacey built up a repertoire and a following. Performing at a night organised by Gilles Peterson’s Brownswood Recordings brought her to the attention of Future Bubblers, the label’s talent discovery scheme, and she was accepted on to the year-long development programme in 2015. It connected her with like-minded musicians and set her up to release an assured, richly melodic EP called Black Moon last summer. A second EP, 90 Degrees, is out on 19 May. Though her music blurs genres, including R&amp;B, soul, reggae and even garage, the 29-year-old feels especially connected to the resurgent British jazz scene – she cites Ezra Collective, Nubya Garcia and Shabaka Hutchings as inspirations. “I think there’s an undercurrent of everybody speaking their truth now,” she says, “and for me that’s what jazz means. It’s rebellion music, there are no rules. You sing from the heart, tell the stories that are real, say what you see, what’s going on in society. There’s a strength in that.” She finds strength, too, in collaborating with other musicians. “My guitarist said something that really stuck with me: when it was just the two of us, the music sounded so lonely and delicate, but play the same song now with a band and it sounds really powerful. That’s jazz in action: people connecting and talking about what’s real.” KF Matthew Halsall: ‘Manchester is different to the London scene. The people I work with are quite spiritual’ Manchester-based trumpeter, composer, arranger and bandleader, and founder of Gondwana Records, 34 Manchester may be best known for its wayward rave days, but Matthew Halsall has more recently helped to put the city on the jazz map. A trumpeter from the age of six, he grew up in a mill town near Wigan and balances music-making with running Gondwana Records, the label he started 10 years ago to capture the cross-pollination of jazz with hip-hop, trip-hop, classical and electronic styles that was happening live on stage at a Manchester haunt called Matt &amp; Phred’s. The venue was a hub for acts such as the Cinematic Orchestra, hosting jam sessions where Halsall, now 34, was able to play alongside local A-listers including Nat Birchall, Jon Thorne and Chip Wickham. Inspired by their shared sensibilities, he began building his own collective, explaining how “all the early Gondwana releases were the same group of Manchester’s most interesting musicians performing together on each other’s records”. The sound they’ve developed references the ruminative approach of John and Alice Coltrane – but it’s also distinctively northern and, says Gilles Peterson, “beautifully delicate”. “Someone wrote that it has a ‘rain-stricken spiritual jazz feel to it’,” says Halsall. “It’s definitely different to the London scene. In some ways it’s more mellow and floaty. The people I work with are quite spiritual and into meditation, and a lot of them live in the countryside, so they are very chilled out.” Meditation in particular, he says, is “ingrained in the music”, Halsall having attended the Maharishi Free School in West Lancashire, which teaches a “consciousness-based education”. These days, though, he is “more interested in the exciting movement of a larger number of people”, adding that jazz has “always been greater than the sum of its parts”. It’s why he started the Gondwana Orchestra, an official ensemble of his regular players, who’ll be performing as part of the label’s 10th anniversary festival at London’s Roundhouse in October, alongside established minimalists Portico Quartet and north African‑inspired Norwich newcomers Mammal Hands, who have also recently released music on the label. Back in Manchester, Halsall says, there is a “massive demand” for jazz, with his early discovery and last year’s Mercury prize nominees GoGo Penguin due to play the city’s Albert Hall in November. And it continues to evolve, too. “The hip-hop scene in Manchester has brought in a lot of jazz recently, and when I go out on weekends it’s amazing now how many DJs will be playing jazz records.” Being a hometown hero, even an unassuming one in a flat cap and cardigan, does he get stopped on the street? “Yeah, yeah I do,” he says. “You wouldn’t think that was possible in the jazz world. But people are really into it now.” KH Gondwana 10 is at the Roundhouse, London NW1, on 10 October Theon Cross: ‘Playing intensely with two drummers for an hour and a half… that requires real stamina’ London-based tuba player, 25 When Theon Cross was eight, his parents signed him and his brother Nathaniel up for brass lessons at school in Nunhead, south London. Nathaniel chose the trombone, and now he’s a prominent trombonist on the London jazz scene. Theon, meanwhile, picked up a French horn. Later he progressed to the euphonium and eventually, when he was big enough to grapple with it, a tuba. Now Cross’s tuba playing underscores some of most exciting UK jazz records of the past few years, including Rye Lane Shuffle by Moses Boyd and the last two albums by Sons of Kemet, as well as his own highly accomplished Aspirations EP from 2015. The largest and lowest-pitched member of the brass family may seem an odd presence on a London jazz stage – you’re far more likely to see it in marching bands or classical orchestras – but Cross reminds me that “the tuba was actually the first bass in jazz. When they were recording for gramophones, the tuba was the only instrument loud enough to be picked up, so they used it instead of the double bass. It’s been at the forefront right from the start.” Now Cross is making it a fixture of the new London jazz sound. “It’s an anchor for music, it’s got so much power,” he says. “I’m quite a reserved, quiet guy and I’m amplified by that instrument.” Recently he’s been playing with the London rapper Kano, who features a brass section in his live show. “When I come out at Glastonbury with my tuba, people are like, ‘What’s that about?’ But when they hear me doubling the bassline, they’re like,” – he widens his eyes and nods his head – “‘OK!’” Cross credits much of his success to good music teachers at school and free workshops around London supported by now-dwindling arts funding. As a teenager, he played with Kinetika Bloco, a youth performance group that runs a summer school at the Southbank Centre. “We’d be playing the Notting Hill carnival or Thames festival and marching for hours,” he says. This prepared him for Sons of Kemet’s frenetic live shows where he plays “intensely with two drummers for an hour and a half. That requires real stamina.” Much of the year ahead will be given over to Sons of Kemet – he’s just got back from playing with them in São Paulo – but he also needs to clear some space for his own music: he’s releasing a new single in October, with an album to follow around the end of the year. Clearly, committing to an unusual instrument has not served him badly in the London jazz world. “I’ve been lucky with the tuba,” says Cross. “I’ve always gravitated towards it since I was young. It wasn’t really a choice: I’d say the tuba picked me.” KF Nubya Garcia: ‘We have an opportunity to create a new dynamic… that’s so exciting to me’ London-based saxophonist and composer, 26 As one of the few female brass players at the forefront of contemporary jazz, Nubya Garcia is familiar with challenging expectations. “People do look at you, and it used to bother me a lot, but I’m trying to learn how to deal with it,” she says. “If you get comments like ‘Whoa, it’s so nice to see a woman on stage’ every time you gig, which I do, eventually you’re like, ‘Godammit!’ It’s not a negative thing, it’s just that person one doesn’t know that person 30 is also saying that. It’s just normal to me, but not normal to everyone else.” Garcia, 26, from Camden, north London, graduated from Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance two years ago and since then her career as a saxophonist and composer has taken off. She got back a few days ago from playing taste-making Texas festival South by Southwest, where she was a little unprepared for the demand. “This huge queue of people followed me outside to buy my vinyl,” she says. “I was like, ‘fuck, I’ve only got 11’.” That record was last month’s When We Are, a solo EP laced with jazz, gospel, neo-soul and the electronic touches she picked up under the tutelage of the jazz/dance producer Floating Points. She has also soundtracked a current touring production of A Streetcar Named Desire and she’s part of spiritual jazz-inspired ensemble Maisha. And with Nérija, the collective she is in alongside Sheila Maurice-Grey, she’s just signed her first record deal with indie label Domino. Nérija formed at Tomorrow’s Warriors, a Southbank Centre jam session founded by scene stalwart Gary Crosby that’s been pivotal in helping young jazz musicians thrive. She says that Warriors was “a warm place of people my own age, that looked like me and came from the same background” and “fed her soul” in a way that her traditional, “rich kids” music education (Garcia was a bursary student) didn’t. Strong bonds were forged there, and she and trumpeter Sheila Maurice-Grey and guitarist Shirley Tetteh would use the practice rooms “every Monday, shed [jazz lingo for hardcore practising], swap music and play tunes we couldn’t play. It gave us a purpose.” Despite being a relative newcomer herself, Garcia is keen to ensure jazz has a more equal future. She remembers how “a good friend of mine said, ‘So who did you have growing up to look up to, a sax player who’s a woman?’ And I didn’t have anyone. That’s nuts!” It’s why she wants to bring her music to the masses, so that young musicians can see that it’s possible. “[When you ask yourself] ‘Why am I here, why am I doing this?’” she says, “it’s because someone came and put an instrument in our hands rather than say, ‘Hey, you’re a woman, you should sing.’ We have an opportunity to create another dynamic that two, three generations from now could be equal, gender-wise, ethnicity-wise. That’s so exciting to me.” KH Nubya Garcia plays Field Day, London SE24, 1 June. Moses Boyd, Shabaka Hutchings and Yazmin Lacey are also playing the festival.

It was going to be in London with a €1m prize fund, but now there are rumours of a much higher bid, a venue switch to St Louis and tricky negotiations. The first American-born challenger since Bobby Fischer defeated Boris Spassky in 1972 lives in St Louis, which has become a renowned global chess centre hosting inter alia the US championship and an annual elite event in which both Carlsen and Caruana compete. The billionaire Rex Sinquefield bankrolls it all and was financially responsible for Caruana, who has dual nationality, electing to represent the US rather than Italy from 2015. Caruana was born to Italian-American parents in Miami, was home schooled, learned his chess skills in Brooklyn, and at 14 broke Fischer’s age record as the youngest US grandmaster. He moved to Europe in search of the best tournaments and coaching, living in Madrid, Budapest and Lugano and representing Italy. As an American again, he led the US team in 2016 to their first ever gold medals at the biennial 150-nation Olympiad. Sinquefield is a long-time Fischer fan, who once met his idol on a plane trip, and a few years ago bought up Bobby’s personal library. Four-time US champion Yasser Seirawan, a Sinquefield confidant, said that a St Louis bid would be “significantly higher” than the €1m in London, which may be in some doubt anyway, since it was raised from primarily Russian sponsors before the Berlin result was known. For the embattled and financially stretched global chess body Fide, St Louis could prove a lifeline. Its president, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, has been sanctioned by the US Treasury for allegedly aiding the Syrian government, and Fide’s Swiss bank will shortly close its account. A successful high profile partnership with Sinquefield, who contributed to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, could restore credibility for Fide in Washington. However, Fide’s commercial partner Agon, based in Moscow but probably planning a move to London, holds the rights to the match and is sure to fight its corner. Fide will also remember how in 1993 its then president awarded the world championship to Manchester without consulting the players. Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short took their match outside Fide, and the resulting schism lasted 13 years. Carlsen has played several times in St Louis, captured his crown from Vishy Anand in India in 2013, and beat his Russian challenger, Sergey Karjakin, in New York in 2016, so he will be relaxed about playing away again if the prize money jumps. In a statement, the St Louis Chess Club said: “[We have] not been asked to host the 2018 Fide World Chess Championship nor have we submitted a formal bid to host.” Back at the board Caruana showed class and strong nerves in the decisive moments after he lost to Karjakin two rounds from the end. The resilient American won his final two games, even playing out for a full point against Alexander Grischuk when a draw would have sufficed. Caruana’s penultimate round win over Levon Aronian, who was the pre-tournament favourite but ended up last, became a complex struggle, decided by a few key moments. White’s 8 d3 and 9 Bd2!? is the latest anti-Marshall nuance aiming for a small edge, and Caruana builds up pressure until Aronian mixes it by 25…Bxg4!? and 27…Nxf2!? Two moves later, 29 N5e3! gives White a clear advantage as in the game Black missed the tactic 31…Nxb4! 32 cxb4 Rd4! with wild but probably drawing complications. After that, Caruana stormed through on the h file and Aronian resigned due to 39…Kxh6 40 Nxg4+ Kh7 41 Qxg5 Qf8 42 a7."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/30/chinas-tiangong-1-space-station-will-crash-to-earth-this-weekend","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T14:40:44Z","webTitle":"China's Tiangong-1 space station will crash to Earth this weekend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/30/chinas-tiangong-1-space-station-will-crash-to-earth-this-weekend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/30/chinas-tiangong-1-space-station-will-crash-to-earth-this-weekend","fields":{"headline":"China's Tiangong-1 space station will crash to Earth this weekend","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It will all be over in a flash. At some point this weekend, a dazzling fireball will tear across the sky as China’s out-of-control space station tumbles back to Earth at 16,500mph and burns up in the atmosphere. The Tiangong-1, or “Heavenly Palace”, has been hopelessly adrift since the Chinese space agency lost control of the prototype space lab in 2016, five years after it launched as a bold symbol of the nation’s ambitions in orbit. From the moment it was lost, scientists around the world began plugging information on the stricken craft into computer models to predict how its final act would play out. On Friday, the European Space Agency said that the unoccupied wreckage would crash back to Earth between Saturday night and Sunday evening UK time. “If you’re in the right place at the right time, and the sky is clear, it will be quite spectacular,” said Holger Krag, head of ESA’s space debris office in Darmstadt. “It will be visible to the naked eye, even in daylight, and look like a slow-moving shooting star that splits into a few more shooting stars. You might even see a smoke trail.” Compared with the International Space Station (ISS), Tiangong-1 is a minnow. The 400-tonne ISS would barely fit inside a football field, while the 8.5 tonne Chinese station is no bigger than a bus. Visitors to Tiangong-1, including China’s first two female taikonauts, Liu Yang and Wang Yaping, had two sleeping berths at their disposal, but the toilet and cooking facilities were on the Shenzhou module that ferried them to the orbiting outpost. Though Tiangong-1 will be the largest lump of space junk to fall back to Earth so far this year, it is nowhere near a record-breaker. In 2001, the Russian space agency steered their 120 tonne Mir space station safely into the Pacific Ocean. The far less controlled re-entry of Nasa’s 74 tonne Skylab in 1979 scattered pieces of space hardware over hundreds of miles of Western Australia. The re-entry of Tiangong-1 will be uncontrolled too. About 100 tonnes of spent rocket stages, defunct satellites, and other space debris come down each year. Most of the material burns up in the atmosphere as air ahead of the object is compressed to generate ferocious heat. As a rule of thumb, only about 20 to 40% of a spacecraft survives the inferno of re-entry. The components that hit the ground tend to be heat-resistant fuel tanks, thrusters and other parts, such as metal docking rings, which can be the size of a rear tractor wheel. On Friday, the Chinese space station was still hurtling around the planet more than 180km above the surface. The atmosphere is tenuous at that altitude, but thick enough to drag on the solar panels and body of Tiangong-1. Gradually this slows the spacecraft down until gravity can pull it from orbit. When the spaceship falls below 100km, it will begin its re-entry in earnest. “Within minutes it will be fully decelerated and the energy it carries will be translated into heat and aerodynamic forces that rip it apart,” said Krag. Between 1.5 to 3.5 tonnes of the spaceship may survive the ordeal and reach the Earth’s surface in dozens of pieces cast over hundreds of miles. The most dangerous could be fuel tanks that typically hold toxic hydrazine propellant. Space agencies around the world have sophisticated computer models to predict where and when space debris may land, but even the best cannot give anything close to a precise answer. The speed at which spacecraft travel, and the unpredictability of their breakup high in the sky, means the calculation is beyond the means of modern science. “We will never be able to say upfront where debris will fall because these objects are moving so fast,” said Krag. “Even if you can narrow the re-entry window to two hours, that still means you have tens of thousands of kilometres where debris may come down.” The situation would not be much better if the exact point of re-entry, 100km above the Earth, could be calculated, either. “From that altitude, you still have a fallout zone of 1,000km which might stretch over several countries,” Krag said. The Chinese space station flies over land and sea from 43 degrees north and 43 degrees south, which rules out re-entry over the UK and much of Europe. But more than five billion people do live beneath its flightpath, in vast stretches of North and South America, China, the Middle East, Africa, and Australia. With most of the Earth covered in water, and huge areas home to few if any people, the chances of being struck by space debris are remote. To date, the only person thought to have won this unenviable lottery is Lottie Williams from Tulsa, Oklahoma, who had a lump of Delta II rocket strike her shoulder in 1997 while on a stroll through a local park. “The risk is not zero, but history tells us that the risk is not that high,” Krag said. “Inside the zone, the risk of being hit is about the same as being hit by lightning twice in the same year.” • This article was amended on 18 April 2018 to more accurately describe the process by which heat is generated as a spacecraft re-enters the atmosphere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/21/gardens-what-to-do-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T10:00:01Z","webTitle":"Gardens: what to do this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/21/gardens-what-to-do-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/21/gardens-what-to-do-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Gardens: what to do this week","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Plant this The heady perfume of a mass of tiny white burkwood osmanthus blooms (Osmanthus x burkwoodii) is the essential scent of spring: this hardy evergreen shrub reaches 3m x 3m but it can be clipped like box or even fashioned into hedges.

Why talk of winter vegetables when you can start thinking of sweet lettuce hearts? But we surely need to stop seeing kale as being only for the winter; sure, it is a cold-weather vegetable, but it can be as tender as any lettuce. Kale is ancient stuff: it’s considered to be far closer to wild cabbage than, say, brussels sprouts or broccoli. In case you missed the millennial memo, kale is king of nutrition. It’s certainly the most nutritious vegetable you can grow at home. It’s one of the best sources of vitamin K, a rich source of vitamins A, C, B6 and folate, and a good source of iron, calcium and vitamin E. It’s a multivitamin, without the plastic pot. Now, there’s a small rub to all these health benefits, which is that you need to eat your kale raw. Faced with a tough bunch of winter-hardy leaves, that’s a daunting task; but kale can be as tender as any other leafy green, as long as it is picked young and small. And the best way to grow it is as cut and come again. The best leaves are somewhere between 5-10cm high. For a continuous supply, sow roughly every two weeks. Sow direct from now onwards and thin seedlings to 7.5cm apart. Cut and come again can be sown up until the end of July/beginning of August. If you want traditional big plants for winter, you need to sow by June and space plants to 45cm apart in either direction. You can raise kale microgreens on a windowsill year-round. Although kale is more than capable of surviving periods of drought, that’s when you get tough leaves. If you are transplanting young plants to their final growing position, puddle them in with plenty of water and mulch. If your leaves are too tough to eat, massage with salt and oil and let them sit for 30 minutes before dressing with a vinegar or lemon juice; you’ll find they flop delightfully that way. There’s a whole suite of new kales that are stunning to look at, both in the garden and on the plate. ‘Midnight Sun’ is a curly kale with bright magenta midribs; ‘Jagallo Nero’ has serrated blue-green leaves; ‘Emerald Ice’ is textured, ruffled and has ice-white midribs and new variegated new growth; ‘Red Ruble’ is a red, Russian-type kale for baby leaf production (the red fades as the plant matures); ‘Dazzling blue’ is a blue-green palm kale with striking pink midribs, and ‘Red Ruffled’ (both from Real Seeds) has tasty ruffled leaves with red veins."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/02/walking-dead-review-season-eight-8-episode-fourteen-14-recap-still-gotta-mean-something","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T02:30:14Z","webTitle":"The Walking Dead: season 8, episode 14 recap – Still Gotta Mean Something","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/02/walking-dead-review-season-eight-8-episode-fourteen-14-recap-still-gotta-mean-something","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/02/walking-dead-review-season-eight-8-episode-fourteen-14-recap-still-gotta-mean-something","fields":{"headline":"The Walking Dead: season 8, episode 14 recap – Still Gotta Mean Something","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"What is with The Walking Dead’s sudden fascination with turnips? Last week, in a stunning exchange, it was Michonne who heroically gambled upon “I saved you this turnip” being an appropriate thing to say to someone you presumably intend to have sex with again. This week, in the wildly uneven Still Gotta Mean Something, the ‘umble turnip was back, deployed as some kind of back-to-basics low-carb tracking device – merely one of the litany of often-overlooked alternative uses for Pliny the Elder’s favourite root vegetable. With regards to the show itself – The Walking Dead, that show we’re here to talk about – it says much about Still Gotta Mean Something that once it was over, and not for the first time in my life, all my immediate thoughts turned to turnips. The episode wasn’t a total, utter and complete car crash – more a pathetic low-speed shunt in a discount supermarket car park – and taking a look at the things it did well seems as good a place to start a review as any. Since abandoning her preposterous trash-patois, Jadis has managed to redeem herself as one of the show’s most intriguing players, with Pollyanna McIntosh handling her engorged dramatic range superbly. Understandably crushed by the death of her Pandas – yet apparently doing just fine in a plush, minimalist container-flat which would easily fetch half a million on the London market – her initial plan to torture Negan made perfect sense. We’re still none the wiser as to how Jadis managed to preternaturally locate Neegs after his basement ding-dong with Rick. Maybe she used a turnip. And this is a show in which people seem to get knocked out for precisely as long as the plot requires, while conveniently suffering no pesky after-effects of what must be a fairly serious concussion. But fine. It’s TV land. Jadis wanted Negan to die slowly, but not before he watched his precious rounders bat go up in smoke. Seemed logical enough to me. “What the shit?”, indeed. Taking off your shoes and going barefoot, while continuing to live in a dump populated almost exclusively by sharp and pointy things, makes zero sense, however you try to spin it as a physical manifestation of a character’s reawakening. And leaving a gun, a flare and some pictures – the only objects left in the world of any value to you – within reach of a prisoner is also deeply stupid, to the extent that you wonder if Jadis one-syllabled her vocabulary so she could free up enough brainspace to communicate and walk at the same time without falling over. Nevertheless, Jadis and Negan’s gradual coming-to-terms was nicely done. Character-building (and possibly false) revelations about Negan’s past, and why he loves that bloody bat (literally/figuratively), were welcome. It was a hoot seeing Negan relying on his wits to survive, as opposed to his usual shtick of leaning awkwardly until everyone else’s wills bend to match. He seemed genuinely sorry – and he swore on his sack, so he must be. Jadis’s link to the mysterious helicopter is something I’m hoping is explored sooner rather than later. And while Negan’s desire to relieve Simon of his pulse, for now, unites he and Jadis in common purpose, Negan will surely see knowledge about the whirlybird as a resource he can strip from the premier Panda further down the line. What else was good, what else.... Oh yes! The moment Rick buried an axe in that poor Savior’s back was a genuine, almost literally-backstabbing OMG – one that left the extent of Rick’s grief following Carl’s death in no uncertain terms. It had been Morgan who was giving it the Big I Am to the Saviors with regards to wanting to do a lot of murders at them. In the end, though, it was Rick who lied, manipulated and slaughtered. Bear with me here, and please excuse my language, but we might have to consider the possibility that Rick is a bit of a git. I wasn’t expecting it, but nor did it feel out of character, which is a tricky tightrope to walk after eight seasons. (Note to any remaining Saviors: a man’s word is trash. Get him to swear on his sack. It’s the only way to be sure.) There were, ofcourse, logic-holes the size of fat elephants in Rick and Morgan’s appallingly handled capture. Firstly, we got another convenient consequence-free knockout, with Morgan even remarking that Rick was indisposed for exactly the right amount of time. Then there’s how easy it appears to be to sneak up on Rick, an experienced, hardened post-apocalyptic survivumalist. Oh, and you’re telling me the ensconced Saviors couldn’t spare a single person to keep watch? Someone who might have said “erm, guys, sorry to interrupt, but there are, like, a billion zombies outside,” before aforementioned billions of zombies lurched through the front door? Idiots. Dead idiots. Didiots. Ignoring all this though, much as a parent may choose to stubbornly overlook the ugliness of a child, the zombie invasion (zombasion? Nah) was easily the high-water mark of the week. Jared’s death in particular was eye-scrunchingly nasty. Being held in place as zombies masticate your cheeks off looks deeply disagreeable. So, yeah, as zombie attacks go, on the whole it was decent. Well done. I could probably save us all some time and say that pretty much everything besides that which I’ve mentioned above was a huge, blazing manure fire, but I’m contractually obliged to elaborate, so we’re stuck here for at least for another 200 words or so. Henry. Dear Henry, with your face like a whiney knee, you caused everyone so much trouble, got yourself trapped in a tree, and still didn’t even have the common decency to die, putting you out of our misery. You’re cured now then, are you? Wait, before you answer, I don’t care. Morgan – yes you, Morgan, who somehow manages to make the mighty Lennie James annoying – your hallucinations are absurd and not interesting or entertaining in the least. Hear me: if you and Carol have one more protracted A-level-drama conversation about “coming back from the brink” or “not giving up on your humanity” or whatever, I will personally come round to both your houses and lick all your spoons. The same goes for you Ezekiel, so watch it. At least Still Gotta Mean Something put a couple of flapping story threads to bed. If nothing else, you have to give it that. And the arrow that Tara took at the hands of Dwight does indeed appear to have been clean, as several commenters suggested last week – further proof that the people below the line on this blog are much brighter than the feckless gonk wanging on above it. It’s probably best to forget the vast majority of Still Gotta Mean Something, though, and hope the two episodes remaining are good enough to shift the taste of bums that it left in my mouth. Eugene’s assassination. Simon’s comeuppance. Negan v Rick. Dwight’s divided loyalties. Helicopters. Possibly some turnips. There’s plenty to work with. The omens are good. We’ve stuck with you this long, Walking Dead, through thick and thin. Please, please don’t mess it up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/30/lionel-messi-supercharged-genius-antidote-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T18:08:00Z","webTitle":"Lionel Messi’s supercharged genius the ideal antidote to grey World Cup | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/30/lionel-messi-supercharged-genius-antidote-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/30/lionel-messi-supercharged-genius-antidote-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Lionel Messi’s supercharged genius the ideal antidote to grey World Cup","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I see a bad moon rising: I see trouble on the way. Or if not quite trouble, then some interesting times this summer for the poor old beleaguered World Cup; and indeed for Lionel Messi in what is surely a last realistic shot at the ultimate prize for the most exhilarating footballer of the modern age. Argentina’s travelling fans are still among the most vivid memories of the last tournament in Brazil, a sweaty, gleeful, Messi-worshipping horde from across the border that in the last few days before the final seemed to be coming up through the Rio drains and falling down from the trees, emerging in ever greater numbers from the Copacabana surf. By the end they were sleeping in cars in the Rio side-streets, packing out the bars and parading in the main streets, and all the while singing that song to the tune of Bad Moon Rising that ends with the line: “You’re going to see Messi, he’ll bring us back the cup.” Except, of course, it didn’t happen like that. And it seems even less likely to happen this time around given Argentina’s 6-1 shellacking at the hands of Spain on Wednesday. In mitigation, Spain were sensationally good in Madrid. Plus, of course, Messi didn’t play, watching instead from the stands and looking as mournfully blank as he had four years ago, wandering off the Maracaña pitch past a huge screen proclaiming him the player of the tournament. And really it is the sense of heaviness that is striking here. “The World Cup is like a revolver to his head,” the manager, Jorge Sampaoli, had said even before the evisceration by Spain, referring to Messi having to carry both his team and his own elite sporting destiny. But his words chimed uneasily with the wider weather fronts of Russia 2018, a tournament that has become ever more grey and ominous, from the relentless politicking on all sides, to the bad moon that hangs over every Fifa event, an ugliness spawned in the Sepp Blatter end-times that must now play itself out over four more years of curdled power-play. Against this backdrop the idea that Messi, now 30 and who has done nothing but bring sporting joy, might get another shot at winning a World Cup has felt like a glimmer of something redemptive, a happy ending of sorts, a way of making this tournament beautiful. Even this is complicated, however. It would be fair to suggest at this point there is nothing particularly subversive or novel about the world’s most famous multimillionaire footballer illuminating Vladimir Putin’s circus. Better, from this perspective, for France to go and win it after Tuesday’s reports of racist Russian taunts, or for some perennially menaced Baltic state to make a late entrance and thrash the host nation in the semis. But this is where Messi himself becomes interesting, where glory at this World Cup might also add another layer, or at least some actual substance to the basic meaning of Lionel. Let’s face it, away from the on-field feats, the most interesting thing about Messi is how startlingly uninteresting he is, the peculiar remoteness of his public persona. Has any near-ubiquitous public face ever had so little content, so little depth? He seems nice. But Messi really does have nothing to declare but his own genius, no context beyond that endlessly gushing well of brilliance. This is not meant as a criticism. There is no extra obligation for sports people to intersect with the wider world. But usually great athletes just can’t help being political beings. Diego Maradona got to mean something simply by being poor and brilliant and flawed, the charismatic outsider with shades of darkness and light. Even Pelé, who seemed to have spent most of the 1970s travelling the world in a fur-lined helicopter wearing a solid gold hat, had a depth of meaning to his feats, a kid from Bauru who emerged from poverty to conquer the sporting world. And then we have Messi. For a while his defiantly ordinary demeanour felt like it might carry some significance, a kind of holy fool dynamic. The best player in the world didn’t have tattoos and a douchebag hairstyle. Then he got tattoos and a douchebag hairstyle. So that was that. At the end of which the meaning of Messi is, simply, that being really good at football is really good. Being the best is the best. Have a good time – all the time. Except, of course, there is something else here. The joy. As Sampaoli also said in Madrid, Messi needs to be able to enjoy football, to relax, to exist as a free spirit, to become his most exhilarating self. And this is perhaps Messi’s wider significance, a reminder that playfulness and joy are the essence of what he does, that he succeeds by communicating this basic sense of freedom, of something upliftingly impish. This enduring spark is the most striking thing about his years of success in the most managed of footballing worlds, a place of corporate lockdown and annihilating physicality. In the middle of this, hiding in plain sight, Messi is the opposite of control, an antidote to grey. It isn’t so far-fetched he could do it in Russia too. Argentina very rarely lose with him in the team. Messi himself looks fitter than four years ago and more at ease, an oddly gentle supercharged sporting genius who is still, and for all the gongs and glories, an element of grace within the machine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27480","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T23:00:42Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,480","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27480","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27480","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,480","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/30/letter-cardinal-keith-obrien-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T12:47:23Z","webTitle":"Letter: Cardinal Keith O’Brien’s record","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/30/letter-cardinal-keith-obrien-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/30/letter-cardinal-keith-obrien-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Letter: Cardinal Keith O’Brien’s record","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Cardinal Keith O’Brien was indeed “not an out-and-out reactionary”.

I’d been on a couple of different trains with different operators that day, each for a few hours, with my six-month-old child, whose nappy I’d attempted to change in the stinky toilet, wipes clamped in my teeth, swaying to and fro, head beaded with sweat. I’d been asked to fold up her buggy earlier in the day, which I’d done with one hand, breastfed her on the floor outside a loo and tried to stop her rolling out of the train while clearing up various toys, sterilised bottles and manky fruit I’d spilled over the vestibule floor, where we were sitting. I was, shall we say, having something of a sense of humour failure. I travel by train a lot. I don’t drive and my family is scattered around, as is the modern way. Before motherhood, the bugbear was mainly financial. It would be cheaper to fly to another European country and back again than to visit family in Scotland by rail. But the experience of using trains alone with a baby or toddler was much harder than I expected. The rail companies do have basic provisions. Normally there are baby-changing facilities and the lifts work. Virgin do a mums-to-be pass, which offers a seat if you are 20+ weeks pregnant, though that isn’t much help in the first 20 weeks, when nausea and sickness are more common. But the general logistics are a nightmare. Prams or pushchairs are not officially allowed on most trains unless they are folded up. If a baby or toddler is asleep, which is a fairly common occurrence at this life stage, it means waking them up, and folding up the buggy with one hand, which isn’t a walk in the park – especially when you haven’t had more than five hours sleep a night for six months. Asking a stranger if they can hold the baby while you fold up the buggy is also less than ideal. It’s a nice idea to carry a child in a sling, but it’s impractical for some children and longer journeys. It’s no wonder so many parents drive everywhere. People always offer to help and, without them, it would be impossible. But if you’re feeling tired and fragile, be warned: travelling by train with a baby is high risk for a public blub. The stress, yes, but also the kindness of random strangers can bring on the tears. I’ll always be grateful to the woman who picked up my daughter’s book and read to her so I could gather myself for the next leg. Parents on a Facebook group I’m a member of posted highly detailed strategic advice in the early months (dress light, cold coffee, wheelie bag). The main instruction was to buy a ticket for the baby using a Family &amp; Friends railcard so you get more space, which is a good idea if you can afford it, but doesn’t solve the buggy problem. But there is a simpler way: family-friendly compartments or carriages. It’s a solution implemented by many of our European neighbours. Eurostar, TGV in France, Germany’s Intercity Berlin and ICE International have family-friendly carriages and prams are specifically welcomed. Swiss and Finnish inter-city trains even have play areas in their family carriages. NSB, Norway’s rail network, puts on quite the spread, of course. There’s a separate playroom, books and films, and, crucially, you can book space for a pram. A family-friendly carriage was trialled last summer by Chiltern Railways. Other passengers said it was easier for them, too, without children running up and down the train. Working commuters would surely also prefer the peace and quiet. Call me a whinger, but in a supposedly progressive society, rail travel for people travelling with young children shouldn’t be this stressful. Mothers may be recovering from major abdominal surgery, suffering chronic sleep-deprivation, or even mental illness (10-15% of mothers and between 4% and 10% of fathers will have postnatal depression). Loneliness is common in new parents, and with families often dispersed across the country, rail travel may be the only way to connect. And if the government wants us to drive less to cut carbon emissions, it needs to make this easier. A major railway modernisation is currently underway. The rail minister Paul Maynard recently said he would be “putting passengers first so that they benefit from a transformational programme of upgrades as quickly as possible”. Paul, I’m not asking for a hot tub or silver service, just a small area of designated space for those with babies and small children. Is that too much to ask? • Lucy Jones is a freelance journalist and author"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/02/bernice-king-flame-mlk-martin-luther-king-50th-anniversary","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"Bernice King on the 50 years since her father's death: 'This nation is awoke'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/02/bernice-king-flame-mlk-martin-luther-king-50th-anniversary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/02/bernice-king-flame-mlk-martin-luther-king-50th-anniversary","fields":{"headline":"Bernice King on the 50 years since her father's death: 'This nation is awoke'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Of all the many faces of Martin Luther King that will be invoked this week as America marks the 50th anniversary of his assassination – King the orator of the mountaintop speech, King the non-violent protester marching towards Montgomery, King the visionary with the dream of justice rolling down like a mighty stream – the most tender is the Martin Luther King of the kissing game. He would play it with his wife Coretta and four young children whenever he got back to the family home in Atlanta, Georgia, after long days and nights on the civil rights trail. Having braved police batons and attack dogs across the deep south, he would finally turn into the drive of what was to be his last home in Sunset Avenue, where he would be met by a little girl rushing towards him and leaping into his arms. “Today we’re going to play the kissing game,” King would say to Bernice, his youngest child, as she clung to him. Then he would point to a special place on his face and invite her to kiss it. “He called it a ‘sugar spot’,” Bernice says. “We each had one – mummy’s sugar spot was, of course, in the middle of the lips; my two brothers’ were on either cheek; my late sister Yolanda’s was off the corner of the mouth.” Bernice’s sugar spot was on his forehead. In the public world of Dr Martin Luther King Jr, Bernice and her siblings – Yolanda, who died in 2007, Martin and Dexter – are forever associated with the famous line in his 1963 speech at the March on Washington: “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” In the private world of the King family, however, and for Bernice in particular, who was so young when her father was untimely ripped from her, there are only slivers of memory. Shards of recollection, some her own, some handed to her by her older relatives. She recalls very little of that day, 4 April 1968. It was a week after her fifth birthday, and when the TV networks began to carry news that her father had been shot in Memphis she was drifting off to sleep. She has only a pointillist picture of what happened next, the days and weeks of noise and hurt, disjointedly composed out of tiny dots of memory. It was Dexter who recalled the babysitter falling backwards and exclaiming “Oh my God!” when, they surmised later, she was informed that the bullet that pierced their father’s neck as he stood on the balcony of the Lorraine motel had taken his life. Confusion. That was Bernice’s main recollection. Not the confusion of the adults that in turn morphed into anger that set rioting ablaze across the nation. But the confusion of a child for whom none of this made any sense. As the family was boarding the plane that would take them to Memphis, to her father’s body lying in the casket, Coretta told Bernice that he was dead and that he wouldn’t be able to speak to her any more as his “spirit has gone on to live with God”. The child heard a hissing noise at the back of the plane which she knows now must have been the plane’s engines, but back then it sounded to her just like daddy. “I said, ‘Well, he’s breathing, I hear him breathing in the back’. And she said, ‘No’.” At the funeral service at the Ebenezer Baptist church, at Coretta’s request they played the recording of King’s famous Drum Major Instinct sermon, the last he gave in that same place. As her father’s taped voice could be heard echoing around the congregation, eerily describing the funeral that he wished to be given – “If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice” – she couldn’t make sense of that either. “I guess my mother didn’t realize that she didn’t prepare me, because she told me earlier he wouldn’t be able to speak to me, and yet I hear his voice booming out of the speakers and I’m looking around wondering where is he. I remember that very well.” Bernice King has spent a good deal of the past 50 years trying to comprehend that moment in which her father was taken from her. It’s been a personal journey that strikingly matches the public journey that America has pursued as it tries to make sense of what it did to one of its most cherished sons. For many years she pushed the thoughts of her father away, wrestling with her own bouts of anger until in her late teens and early 20s she found her way back to him. She was called to the ministry, and in time made his life’s mission fighting for justice and equality her own. Over the half-century since his death she has managed to avoid most of the ugliness that has enveloped her brothers as a result of their controversial money-oriented handling of King’s estate. Instead she has focused her energies on the struggle against South African apartheid, police brutality in the US and the war on poverty – in short she has grown into the nearest personification that exists of keeper of the Martin Luther King flame. Which makes her a very good person to ask, in the course of a Guardian interview for the 50th anniversary, how she sees the threat to her father’s legacy emanating from the current White House and from Republican-controlled state legislatures across the country. At a time when voting rights are under unparalleled attack; when inequality and poverty are deepening, especially for African Americans; and when even measures to combat racial segregation are being rolled back, isn’t she fearful that everything she and her father have struggled for is on the chopping block? King is having none of it. “I guess I don’t look at it the way other people do,” she says, using the word “it” to stand in for another that begins with a T and ends in a P. “I look at it as a wonderful moment. Here we have people being galvanized all over this nation, and even the world, who are speaking up in ways perhaps they never have.” Warming to her theme, she insists that the challenges of the past 15 months have further strengthened King’s legacy, not diminished it. “Sure, our country is faced with some serious issues, but that makes protest and free speech all the more critical now. Now you see people standing in the tradition of Martin Luther King Jr and saying this is an injustice, enough is enough, we are going to resist.” She adds: “I don’t see it as a threat, but as an opportunity to complete some of the work he did not get to complete himself.” Her point was made for her last month at the March for Our Lives in Washington. There was the moment when her niece, nine-year-old Yolanda Renee King, spoke so movingly about her dream of a gun-free world. But more importantly there was the spectacle of hundreds of thousands of kids, led by the student survivors of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school, coming together to demand that their inert and corrupted political representatives do something to combat gun violence. What could be more in the spirit of MLK than that? “Something big is going on,” King says. “I’m talking about a society that refuses to allow injustice just to persist without making our voices heard and without organizing to bring about effective change through our voting system.” She was particularly struck at the march, which she attended in Washington, to see young people assiduously registering other young people to vote. In her analysis, that is the first indication that the apathy that has set in among young Americans – youth turnout in the 2014 midterm elections was the lowest in 40 years – may be about to change. “The best way to sum it up is what my mother said, which is that struggle is a never-ending process, freedom is never really won – you earn it and win it in every generation. In my personal opinion this most recent generation has been in danger of not making their contribution to the freedom struggle.” That’s a severe charge to be levelled at an entire generation, especially coming from the daughter of Martin Luther King: young Americans are failing in their epochal duties. But she quickly sweetens the accusation with a message of hope. “Now there is an opportunity for them to make their contribution to the freedom struggle, to tackle what Daddy called the triple evils of poverty, racism and militarism. It’s coming back again, with strength and fervor.” There’s no holding King back now. There is inherited fire in her belly that is very much alight. “This nation is awoke, there is a new, different kind of vigilance that we haven’t seen in the past 25 years,” she says. “In the end I still have the same hope as my father – that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the last word.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27482","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T23:00:21Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,482","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27482","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27482","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,482","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/03/tuesdays-best-tv-cunk-on-britain-come-home-last-laugh-in-vegas","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T05:00:08Z","webTitle":"Tuesday’s best TV: Cunk on Britain; Come Home; Last Laugh in Vegas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/03/tuesdays-best-tv-cunk-on-britain-come-home-last-laugh-in-vegas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/03/tuesdays-best-tv-cunk-on-britain-come-home-last-laugh-in-vegas","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday’s best TV: Cunk on Britain; Come Home; Last Laugh in Vegas","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Cunk on Britain 10pm, BBC Two Diane Morgan’s deadpan ignoramus tackles the big questions in this series, starting with the big bang and stumbling blindly forward.

The cascading crazy paving and interlocking sandstone facades supposedly, in the architects’ vision at least, represent the desert heart of Australia. Across the road, a banner hangs from the walls of St Paul’s Cathedral: “Let’s fully welcome refugees.” Melissa, an academic, walks out of the Koorie Heritage Trust, housed in the Yarra building on the square’s south side. It is due to be demolished to make room for a “flagship” Apple store, under plans announced by the state government a few months ago out of the blue and without public consultation. The proposal for the jarring two-storey pagoda, dubbed “the Pizza Hut” by critics, was met with a fury that is hard to over-estimate. Petitions were started. Public debates were held. Melissa is “very, very upset” about Apple intruding in this public place. “This is a nice spot for people to be.” When Federation Square opened in 2002, it was a shock: uneven surfaces, all angles and scant greenery. Oh so modern, and so out of place alongside the elegant, establishment Melbourne of the 1910 Flinders Street railway station and St Paul’s Cathedral across the road. But like everything about Melbourne – a bar you stumble upon, your favourite barista, exuberant street art in tiny laneways – Fed Square grows on you. Film star and Melburnian Chris Hemsworth has said it is a “mellower Times Square, where all paths seem to lead”. It attracts 10 million visitors a year, two million more than the Sydney Opera House. Locals and tourists have embraced it as a place to both protest and celebrate. It is a civic place: an old-fashioned term that somehow captures something indefinable about the city. It was here that more than 150,000 people protested the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the biggest anti-war gathering in the country since the Vietnam war. We come together to share events on the big screen – World Cup soccer, the Australian Tennis grand slam, and especially Australian Rules Football, the free-flowing game we follow obsessively. We take free dancing lessons and meet friends, or swarm to catch a glimpse of Oprah. If Melbourne is going through a wobbly moment – and it surely is – you can sense it here. For a city weighed down by its gong as the “world’s most liveable city” for seven years straight, it’s uneasy about where it’s going, uncertain whether it wants to be a global megacity doubling its population to eight million by midcentury, or hang on to its charms. The city has been through many booms and busts since its European foundation in 1835 but, as urban historian Graeme Davison puts it, one of the threads through its history has been a quaint sense of civic values; an idea of a shared purpose beyond commerce and getting ahead. Davison is the author of The Rise and Fall of Marvellous Melbourne, chronicling the heady days after the Gold Rush in the 1850s. This was a time when Melbourne swaggered – it was reputedly the richest city in the world and the fastest growing. Davison says the city has always been a pragmatic, commercial place – it was settled by land speculators, after all – but from its earliest days Melbourne had a strong streak of public benevolence. A site for the city’s glorious English-style botanic gardens was picked barely a decade after it was founded. A few years on, its early leaders thought to establish what would become the National Gallery of Victoria, the first major art gallery in the country. “On the whole Melbourne has been that kind of city, but I sense a danger to it now,” says Davison. There are many strands to that danger: astonishing population growth – the fastest of any capital in the country – and rising inequality, epitomised by housing prices beyond the reach of ordinary wage earners (houses have a median price tag of more than $AU 900,000 – though Melbourne remains cheaper than Sydney, which tops $1m). It has become a two-tiered city, with cosmopolitan Melburnians living near transport and cultural facilities, and the neglected fringe dwellers sitting in traffic for hours to get to work. Then there is the fury over Federation Square, and the idea that the public’s sense of ownership of it may be lost. Davison was so dismayed about the Apple announcement he wrote an article for The Conversation website. “It would not occur to the average Briton to ask whether Trafalgar Square is paying for itself, much less to install an Apple store beside Nelson’s Column,” he wrote. “Isn’t it time we grew up and recognised that not everything that is important to our collective life has a price? That commercial values do not trump civic ideals?” It was a “plea from the heart” to recognise that the idea of “civic good” is threaded through Melbourne’s history and is central to the city’s character, says Davison. Unlike New South Wales (NSW), Queensland and Tasmania, the state of Victoria was never a penal colony and Melbourne was never a convict town. The Gold Rush made it a boomtown: optimistic, modern, and seductive to so many people dreaming of gold that its population soared from 29,000 to 169,000 in a decade. Then in the 1890s came the crash and the depression; a slump in wealth and confidence from which it only gradually recovered. Melbourne’s leaders were often different to those in other places in Australia, says Davison: progressive, looking to the long-term. This was the city of Alfred Deakin, a progressive liberal crucial to Australian federation, and later prime minister; of H B Higgins, the judge who brought down the famous Harvester decision, which guaranteed wages high enough for “a human being in a civilised community”. “All those people articulated common values in Melbourne,” says Davison. “Melbourne had a character that tended to draw people to the middle politically.” For much of last century, Melbourne was the most establishment of places, known as the jewel of the Australian conservative party’s crown. It was censorious. Pubs shut at six, because that was good for all of us, leading to the famous “six o’clock swill”, where boozers would down as many as they could before closing time. It was – and remains – the private school capital of Australia. But a few decades ago, Melbourne threw off its staid image. Mass immigration after the second world war shook it up, and clever planning brought the central business district to life. The Postcode 3000 campaign that began in the 1990s is considered an international lesson in how to revitalise city centres that hollow out after the work day ends. About 150,000 people now live in central Melbourne, and high-rise apartments house people, as well as offices. More people brought more nightlife and cafes, and old laneways – once a dumping ground for trash – were transformed into hidden gems. Along the way Melbourne has become the most politically progressive city in Australia. If it were up to Melburnians, Australia would already be a republic and have negotiated a treaty with Indigenous Australians. Almost 65% of voters in the state of Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital, voted Yes to the same sex marriage survey last year, compared with 57.8% from NSW. A Green politician, Rohan Leppert, has a good chance of becoming the new lord mayor of Melbourne at next month’s election. If that happens, he will be the first Green to oversee a capital city in Australia. Even Melbourne’s conservatives tend to be small “l” liberals at heart. The radio shock-jocks of Sydney are disdained by Melburnians, who would rather debate than shout. The city was transformed in large part by the astonishing influx of immigrants after the second world war – many from the UK, but tens of thousands from Italy and Greece, as well as displaced East European Jews. Then in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, Vietnamese immigrants came. Melbourne is in now in another people boom, with around 120,000 new residents settling in the city each year, and record immigration from China and India. Last year, the state of Victoria saw the addition of 144,000 new citizens, with the vast majority settling in Melbourne – way above the national average of 1.6%, which is way above the OECD average. In the decade to 2016, Melbourne added a quarter of its population, growing faster than London, Vancouver or Mexico City. Population growth is the conversation Melburnians are having – or want to have, if political parties would engage. The political editor of the Age newspaper, Josh Gordon, articulated the unease last year when he wrote that the pace was unsustainable: “It’s time to accept that Melbourne has, over the past decade, lost much of its coveted liveability and no longer deserves the title.” Melbourne is headed towards a population of five million and is predicted to overtake Sydney as Australia’s most populous metropolis by the 2030s. Its growth is dizzying, and the city is groaning with it. The state government is trying hard now to provide the infrastructure needed. Cars crawl through city streets dug up for the biggest public transport project Victoria has ever undertaken: the $11bn Metro underground railway project that will add stations and ease bottlenecks. The problem is that it won’t open until 2025, by which time the city will have added another million people. High demand for housing is one reason prices are out of reach for many. “If we keep going with city rents and prices the way we are, we’ll end up in a city where only the very rich will be able to live,” says Independent mayoral candidate Sally Warhaft. “The people who make the city tick will be forced further and further away.” Davison says he worries about the pervading political message that there is no alternative to rapid growth. “There is a legitimate argument about how big the city can be, and how big is should be. Just to take it for granted that this is irresistible is a mistake.” We meet for lunch in Box Hill, a suburb about 20km east of the city centre that is a designated “activity centre” – which means it is slated for growth. Once a conservative, white middle class house-and-garden suburb, it remains one of the few quaint spots in Melbourne that is “dry”. There are no pubs or clubs, and restaurants cannot serve alcohol – although that is slowly and quietly changing. Today it is a suburb where 30% of residents are Chinese or Hong Kong-born – the highest percentage in the city. Thirty-storey high rises have popped up, with more on their way. There is unease, even resistance from the local council, but it’s happening: Box Hill will be a suburb of skyscrapers. Davison has no problem with areas being earmarked for fast growth, but fears that what is being lost is Melbourne’s character: its sense of connectedness, of civic good. More prosaically, Melbourne is one of the lowest-density cities in the world – a great sprawling place. Davison says that it might seem an outdated, 20th-century notion now, but putting space between people made city living less irritating and more comfortable.” Box Hill is a hotspot, but if you really want to see growth, look to the west of Melbourne: once derided and neglected, it provided workers for big manufacturers that have slowly gone out of business. Wyndham, an outer south-western local government area, is growing at a frenzied pace. With a 37% population increase between 2011 and 2016, it is now home to 250,000 people. People move here because it gives them a chance to own a house – you can buy a three-bedroom place for $450,000. Among the incomers are thousands of immigrants, especially from India. Ninety babies are born a week – its mayor, Peter Maynard, knows the statistics by heart. Wyndham is a terrific place to live, he says – “people say g’day in the street” – but it has its strains. For the first time, the council has put up temporary, demountable buildings to house kindergarten children because demand is too high to wait for permanent structures. “We’ve got about 26 kindergartens now, and we still need another 26 in the next 17 years,” says Maynard. “We need 20 primary schools and five secondary schools. Build us five primary schools yesterday and we’d fill them already.” One of Wyndham’s claims to fame is that it has the highest proportion of people in the country spending two or more hours a day in traffic travelling to and from work. #nightmarecommute was the hashtag used to document the area’s transport woes on the inaugural western suburbs’ “National Nightmare Commute Day” last year. Across Melbourne there is angst about infrastructure, and governments are scrambling to catch up. Even with all the road and public transport work going on, it is estimated that half of all car trips in peak hour will be congested in two decades, up from a third now. There are murmurings in Australia’s most successful multicultural city that perhaps immigration should slow for a while to allow everyone to take a breath; for a few more schools to be built, for public transport to improve, for housing costs to settle a little. Former New South Wales premier Bob Carr has called Australia’s rate of population growth – far higher than in comparable countries – a “weird experiment”. Sydney is also struggling to cope, but nowhere is that struggle so obvious as it is in Melbourne. Does Melbourne want to be a city of eight million people? If so, will it lose its connectedness, its civic values, of common purpose? Does it have a choice? Davison’s phrase “Marvellous Melbourne” has often been cited with pride, but just as often with irony. How marvellous that young people can barely afford a house. How marvellous that people living in outer suburbs spend weeks of their lives stationary in traffic. How marvellous that homelessness is on the rise. The “world’s most liveable city” is used ironically too, at least among many locals. The Economist Intelligence Unit has declared Melbourne to be so for seven years, a record, taking into account safety, health care, education, infrastructure and the environment. The Economist’s index is a corporate thing – a guide for companies sending their executive staff overseas. Politicians boast about it. “This world record is an amazing feat that all Melburnians should be extremely proud of today,” the-then mayor said last year, but those here roll their eyes. Travelling corporate executives will not live in Melbourne’s outer suburbs, or struggle to afford the rent, or spend weeks of their lives stuck on freeways. It’s telling that the Economist notes that cities that score best tend to be mid-sized, in wealthy countries with low population density. The city that came second last year was Vienna, with 1.8 million people, then Vancouver with 2.5 million. “These can foster a range of recreational activities without leading to high crime levels or overburdened infrastructure,” the Economist says. Any bigger and people pay the price in crime, strained transport and inequality. Perhaps they lose touch with each other, too. Back at Federation Square, it’s worth visiting the gallery of Australian art. It contains one of the most famous paintings of Melbourne: John Brack’s Collins St, 5pm. It’s Melbourne in the 1950s, and portrays dull workers leaving their offices and heading home to the suburbs. Every person faces the same way, their countenances drawn and unsmiling, a picture of dreary conformity. Melbourne is nothing like that now. It’s lively and feisty, comfortable with its diversity and confident in its creativity. It’s just that it’s changing – again – very fast. It might turn out to be marvellous, of course. Or what makes it special might may swept away, without us noticing until it’s too late. In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

The National Book award-winner writes that Baldwin “told me I was worthy of love. Told me I was worth something in the world. Told me I was a human being”. Standout pieces include Garnette Cadogan’s superlative essay on walking the streets as a black man, Natasha Trethewey’s searing poem Theories of Time and Space, and Ward’s own piece on getting her DNA tested. The Fire This Time is dedicated to murdered teenager Trayvon Martin and the many other black people who have been “denied justice for these last 400 years”. The Half Sister Catherine Chanter Canongate, £14.99, pp400 In April 2016, an earthquake causes devastating damage to Wynhope House and Valerie Steadman’s body is found beneath the rubble. She had been staying in the country home of her estranged half-sister Diana on the night of their mother’s funeral. Whether Valerie’s death was accidental or linked to Diana provides the tension in this gripping novel, which is filled with the acute psychological insights that distinguished the author’s debut, The Well. Despite some stilted dialogue, Chanter’s gift for depicting emotional upheaval pervades this tale of crumbling families. Floating Joe Minihane Duckworth, £9.99, pp240 (paperback) Joe Minihane writes with refreshing candour about the depression that struck the year he gave up his job to go freelance. Swimming was the only thing that provided succour, prompting him to read Roger Deakin’s Waterlog and copy the naturalist’s wild swimming pilgrimage through Britain. With a talent for detail – he refers to the “soaring high” of seeing a kingfisher – Minihane examines how his engagement with the outdoors took him on a transformative emotional journey. • To order The Fire This Time for £15.29, The Half Sister for £12.74, or Floating for £8.49, go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

This is achieved, the company says, by spraying milk, water and sugar into warm air and then drying the mixture. The idea is that the milk stops the spray-dried sugar becoming too sticky and the sugar dissolves faster – like candyfloss – giving a sweeter taste. “Healthy” versions of much-loved classics are, as a rule, disappointing, as McVitie’s found when they slashed the fat content of their digestives, but given the Milkybar is the sweetest thing in the known universe, I’m keeping an open mind about Nestlé’s new reduced-sugar Wowsomes range, which come in at 18g and 95 calories apiece. My first guinea pig is my diabetic friend Stephen, who agrees it might be a helpful innovation for what he dubs “sugar counters – but if I want a chocolate bar, I’ll have one”. Having done just that, however, he’s pretty impressed with the Wowsome’s “biscuity flavour” and says he might even consider making it his “chocolate bar of choice”. High praise indeed. A friend’s three-year-old proves a similar pushover, but then, he’s not allowed sugar very often, which calls his judgment into question. I tuck into the last one, and find that it tastes exactly like the bottom of a mug of Horlicks: very sweet, slightly malty, and actually quite enjoyable, in moderation. And moderation shouldn’t be a problem given the largest Wowsome weighs the same as fun-size Mars Bar (and is actually very slightly more calorific). Would I buy it again? Yes, if I wanted a modest sugar hit. But, to be honest, I’d rather eat two-thirds of an ordinary Milkybar."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/2018/apr/01/azed-crossword-2390","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T23:01:03Z","webTitle":"Azed crossword 2,390","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2018/apr/01/azed-crossword-2390","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2018/apr/01/azed-crossword-2390","fields":{"headline":"Azed crossword 2,390","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Click here for a printable version.

The Holy See issued a terse statement saying a lengthy article published in La Repubblica on Wednesday by Eugenio Scalfari, 93, the newspaper’s founder, was “the fruit of his reconstruction” and not “a faithful transcription of the Holy Father’s words”. While the Vatican conceded that Scalfari, an atheist who struck up a friendship with Francis in 2013, had held a private meeting with the pontiff before the Easter weekend, it said an interview had not been granted. During the meeting Scalfari asked the pope where “bad souls” go, to which he was quoted as responding: “They are not punished. Those who repent obtain God’s forgiveness and take their place among the ranks of those who contemplate him, but those who do not repent and cannot be forgiven disappear. A hell doesn’t exist, the disappearance of sinning souls exists.” The Vatican said the “literal words pronounced by the pope are not quoted” and that “no quotation of the article should be considered as a faithful transcription of the words of the Holy Father”. Scalfari is said to pride himself on not taking notes or recording high-profile interviews. But this is not the first time he has been accused of misrepresenting the pope: in 2014 he was rebuked by the Vatican for an article saying Francis had abolished sin. The friendship has been criticised in the past, with Scalfari once saying that it was the pope who asked for the meetings as he liked to “exchange ideas and sentiments with non-believers”. The Catholic church’s teachings affirm the existence of hell and its eternity, saying “the chief punishment of hell is eternal separation of God”. Pope Benedict XVI said in 2007 that hell “really exists and is eternal, even if nobody talks about it much anymore”, while in 1999 Pope John Paul II announced that hell was “the ultimate consequence of sin itself … rather than a place, hell indicates the state of those who freely and definitively separate themselves from God, the source of all life and joy”. The controversy came as Pope Francis washed the feet of 12 prisoners at Rome’s Regina Coeli prison on Holy Thursday. Among the inmates were two Muslims, an Orthodox Christian and a Buddhist. He told them: “Everyone has the opportunity to change life and one cannot judge.” It was the fourth time since becoming pope that he held mass in an Italian prison. “I am a sinner like you but today I represent Jesus … God never abandons us, never tires of forgiving us,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/30/like-being-raped-three-claims-of-coerced-exorcism-in-the-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T13:00:00Z","webTitle":"'Like being raped': three claims of coerced exorcism in the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/30/like-being-raped-three-claims-of-coerced-exorcism-in-the-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/30/like-being-raped-three-claims-of-coerced-exorcism-in-the-uk","fields":{"headline":"'Like being raped': three claims of coerced exorcism in the UK","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Melanie Melanie was experiencing difficulties in her personal life – an abusive husband, a daughter diagnosed as autistic – when her vicar and others in the leadership of her Anglican church suggested she needed deliverance. “They said that things that were going wrong in my life might be because of a demon, and if we got the demon out, things would get better.” In 2015, Melanie fainted during a choir rehearsal. “As I was regaining consciousness, they said that I looked at them with an inhuman face and laughed at them. I was told this was a mocking spirit. “Rather than get medical attention or first aid, they took me for prayers and kept me there in quite a forceful manner for three hours, despite being in considerable pain. Later, it was discovered that I had a perforated eardrum, and that had been the cause of the faint.” A few months afterwards, she was collected from her home and taken to the house of a person unknown to her. “Things took a really strange turn. They pushed me to my knees and shouted in my face, saying the spirits were in me and that I was going to bring down the church. They forced me to be sick. “It went on for about two hours. I felt very traumatised and just blanked it out. “They said I mustn’t tell anyone about it, and I mustn’t come to church for six months until they were sure all the demons were gone. I was in a state of shock.” Later, one of those involved suggested to Melanie that her four-year-old daughter might not be autistic but possessed by demons, and that the child needed deliverance. When Melanie’s grandmother died, she found another church for the funeral. “The vicar asked me why we didn’t have the funeral at our old church, so I told him what had happened. He was horrified, and said we must report it.” The diocese safeguarding team investigated Melanie’s account. The vicar – who had not been present during the alleged exorcism – had moved to another parish, but others from the church were asked to refrain from delivery ministry and reminded of Church of England guidance, Melanie said. She has since had a meeting with her bishop. “He was very apologetic about both the abuse and also the way it was investigated,” she said. “The long-term spiritual abuse has had a massive impact on my life. I have lost the faith and community that was so important to me, and it has left me unable to trust the very people that you are told to go to for support and understanding. I don’t want this to happen to other people.” Sue Sue described what happened to her as “like being raped”. “It was a forced exorcism in broad daylight in a busy NHS ward in the middle of London [performed] by a doctor employed by an NHS trust,” she said. Sue, 67, has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for almost 25 years after a breakdown in her early 40s. In 2011, shortly before she was expecting to be discharged from a London hospital having made good progress as an inpatient, she claims she was subjected to an exorcism by an agency doctor originally from Nigeria. According to her account, the doctor led her into a consultation room and closed the blinds. “She then leaned over the table and grabbed my hands and held me across the table, totally imprisoning me. She was so strong that I couldn’t wriggle out of her grip. She didn’t speak to me and never looked at me. “She then started chanting and praying in a language I had never heard. I was crying and sobbing and begging her to let me go. I was terrified. I felt acute, animal terror.” The doctor demanded Sue repeat certain phrases which included the word “God”, she said. Sue complied: “I felt it was the only way I could get out.” She added: “I had no idea what was happening at the time. I had no experience of extreme religious practices. It was only much later that I was told about exorcisms and this seemed to fit with what I had experienced.” After the alleged assault, she said her recovery went into reverse. “I feel seriously traumatised. I feel very unsafe in the world.” Sue later reported the alleged incident to the General Medical Council. Its Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service considered the case in July 2015. In a letter to Sue, the MPTS said: “Faced with two contradictory versions of the principal events, the panel did not find the facts proved on the balance of probabilities.” Sue said that not only were psychiatric patients vulnerable to emotional, physical, sexual or spiritual abuse, but their accounts were less likely to be believed. The doctor, who did not attend the MPTS hearing, is currently practicing at a private psychiatric hospital in the home counties. Chris Chris was in his early 20s when he was exorcised about three decades ago by members of a free church youth community with Pentecostal links. “I had undergone a Christian conversion at the age of 17, when I was also feeling guilt and fear about my sexuality,” he said. During the exorcism, “I was physically restrained by three men who believed my sexuality was the result of demonic possession. They held me down and pinned my head to the floor with a giant lectern bible so Satan would be unable to resist the word of God. “Afterwards, I was told not to discuss it with anyone. I went into emotional shutdown over it. It took me until my mid-40s to realise – or admit – I’d been subjected to a form of physical abuse. Deliverance was seen as acceptable within church circles, he said. “Even if people didn’t quite agree with exorcisms, homosexuality was seen as something to be ‘fixed’. A lot of people were in denial about exorcisms, and others brushed it under the carpet. “It was quite common in radical evangelical circles in the 1980s and 90s. Now there is a lot more awareness and regulation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/mar/30/agatha-christie-reshoot-with-ed-westwick-stand-in-is-seamless","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T15:20:59Z","webTitle":"Agatha Christie reshoot with Ed Westwick stand-in is 'seamless'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/30/agatha-christie-reshoot-with-ed-westwick-stand-in-is-seamless","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/mar/30/agatha-christie-reshoot-with-ed-westwick-stand-in-is-seamless","fields":{"headline":"Agatha Christie reshoot with Ed Westwick stand-in is 'seamless'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The actor Christian Cooke who saved the BBC flagship drama production Agatha Christie’s Ordeal by Innocence, which finally screens on BBC One on Easter Sunday after being pulled from the Christmas schedule, described the process of starring in the reshoot as “surprisingly seamless”. A crucial 35 minutes had to be reshot over 12 days in Scotland in bitter January weather and stitched together with the original scenes that were filmed in summer sunshine. The sharp-eyed may spot that at one point while Cooke is manfully not shivering, his breath is steaming in the icy air. The series was completed in November and was expected to be a highlight of the Christmas schedule but was pulled after allegations of historic sexual assault in the US were made against the actor Ed Westwick, best known for his role in the US series Gossip Girl. Westwick has vehemently denied the accusations but the decision was taken to pull the series and reshoot all his scenes. Cooke was recast as Mickey Argyll, one of five adopted children of a wealthy philanthropist – played by Anna Chancellor – whose murder sparks the drama. All the cast involved in Westwick’s scenes, including Bill Nighy and Anthony Boyle, who had to fly back from rehearsals for the Broadway opening of JK Rowling’s stage hit The Cursed Child, had to return to Ardgowan, a mansion and estate on the west coast of Scotland. Alice Eve was unable to join the rest of the cast and so her original scenes were merged with new ones with Cooke using split-screen technology. All the props had to be reassembled to re-dress the rooms in 1950s style, and costumes were flown back from other productions in Paris and Rome. The 12-day shooting and post-production work are believed to have cost the BBC around £2m. Cooke told BBC Breakfast: “It was surprisingly seamless, which is a credit to the producers and the director. I think they had worked tirelessly behind the scenes to get everybody back together and logistically I’m sure it was difficult for them, but they were very sensitive towards the fact that they wanted it to be a fresh experience for me and the cast were more than welcoming. To be honest, it felt like the first time for everybody.” Cooke said he had no idea how his role had originally been played. “I didn’t have a clue and I wouldn’t have wanted to know. Every actor would perform a role differently and so a prerequisite for me was that I could come in and make it my own and interpret it my own way.” The reshoot had the blessing of the Agatha Christie estate. The author’s great grandson, James Pritchard, told the Telegraph: “We didn’t want to lose it. It’s as simple as that. What seemed an impossible idea – that you may be able to get a bunch of actors back, however much later, and that you can film July in January in Scotland – was actually achievable.” The series was written by Sarah Phelps, a former Eastenders script writer, who had never read an Agatha Christie novel before her successful adaptations of And Then There Were None in 2015, and Witness for the Prosecution in 2016. Phelps set this series in 1956, in a Britain which she sees as still haunted by the horrors of the second world war, and she also changed Christie’s original ending. The screenwriter cheerfully shrugged off any possible protest from Christie’s legions of devoted fans, telling the Observer: “I don’t give a bollocks about people saying it has to be pure. No, it doesn’t. If you want a pure adaptation, go and get someone else to do it.” Ordeal by Innocence begins on BBC One on Sunday 1 April at 9pm"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/30/london-air-pollution-criminal-71-risk-prison-protest-filthy-air","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T10:34:40Z","webTitle":"London’s air pollution is criminal.

That’s why at 71 I’m risking prison","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For more than 50 years I have loved living in London: but I am now more and more worried about the pollution. I’m worried about the pollution in the water, the pollution in the ground, and the pollution in the air from the busy arterial roads and airports. It’s affecting me and it will affect the crops on my allotment. I have a bike, but in order to go out on a bike now I have to wear a mask which, with my asthma, makes it difficult. When I was arrested last week for spraying “air pollution is criminal” on City Hall, the mayor of London’s office, I was singing “maybe it’s because I’m a Londoner” – I don’t believe Londoners should have to suffer these conditions any longer. People need to be made aware of the issues of air pollution and climate change and start communicating with each other about them. I’m taking this visible action because I want to give people something to talk about; we are calling on the mayor to sit down with community groups and discuss solutions to air pollution. There are already thousands of people in this country and across the world standing up to say now is the time to act on the climate. I am standing up with them, and risking time in prison, to pressure our politicians into acting now. Along with other clean air defenders, we sprayed “air pollution is criminal” on the walls of City Hall five times last week and were arrested every time. At the police station, the police officers were respectful to us in spite of clearly being overworked and understaffed. In some cases there was even genuine understanding of our action for clean air, even if they did not approve of the methods. Taking action in the way we did, a kind of “art drama” politics, is a rollercoaster of emotions. Part of me says why bother, why not just enjoy the rest of my life, but my awareness of the danger and future damage won’t let me. I have not given up on provoking people to act on what is happening, to work to cut air pollution and avert climate breakdown. For instance, so far a dozen London community groups have started working in coalition to put increasing pressure on Sadiq Khan to take urgent action. The London Coalition for Clean Air is holding an open introductory meeting on 17 April and I hope that more people and groups will get involved with it. If that happens, then our actions last week will have been worth it. The mayor should be providing ways for people to get involved and excited about fixing our air pollution crisis – something that is so crucial to the health of all citizens. Money needs to be used to spur people to be creative around technology and to change our cities so we have room for all people to move through them without these deadly health risks. Room for disabled people, room for cyclists, space for people who go slow or fast. I want to see lots of trees, and every house using alternative energy, with plants growing everywhere. Open the parks, don’t close them. We must get rid of pollution. We need to keep the fossil fuels in the ground. We need an urgent transition; we should all be demanding it and encouraging others to do so too, whether that is through acts of protest, writing to our politicians or talking to our neighbours. This pollution is causing more than 9,000 Londoners to die prematurely every year. Stop killing Londoners. • Genny Scherer is a 71-year-old anti-pollution activist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/30/manchester-arena-firefighters-no-need-to-apologise-says-andy-burnham","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T10:16:15Z","webTitle":"Manchester Arena firefighters don't need to apologise, says Andy Burnham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/30/manchester-arena-firefighters-no-need-to-apologise-says-andy-burnham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/30/manchester-arena-firefighters-no-need-to-apologise-says-andy-burnham","fields":{"headline":"Manchester Arena firefighters don't need to apologise, says Andy Burnham","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Frontline firefighters in Manchester who turned up two hours late to the Manchester Arena bomb last year have nothing to apologise for, according to Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester. Some firefighters asked for forgiveness after an independent review into the arena terror attack criticised the fire service for playing “no meaningful role” in the aftermath of the bombing on 22 May last year. Poor communication and a risk-averse culture led to fire chiefs preventing the service from deploying until two hours after the bomb went off, according to a review by the former civil service head Bob Kerslake this week. But Burnham published an open letter to firefighters on Friday in which he said: “No frontline firefighter has to apologise for anything. You and your colleagues did nothing wrong that night.” He said he knew that many were desperate to help that night, “but were prevented from doing so by decisions taken above you. The failure is not yours but one of process, leadership and culture.” One unnamed firefighter told the Manchester Evening News he wanted to ask for forgiveness from those affected by the attack. He said he had been ordered by his bosses to move three miles away from the arena after the bomb exploded, leaving paramedics to use his base at Manchester Central fire station, which is just 0.6 miles away from the concert venue. The firefighter described how he and many of his colleagues have found it impossible to come to terms with what happened. He said: “I would like to ask for the forgiveness of the victims, their families, and other emergency service workers for not upholding my end on the night. “If it ever happens again I will do what I should have done on that night – pick up the first-aid bag off the taxpayers’ fire engine and walk to the incident myself, or hitch a ride with the true heroes of the incident — the ambulance service. “Many of us have been left distressed and devastated by what happened.” Burnham commissioned the review by Lord Kerslake after firefighters contacted him in the days after the attack expressing their frustration at being prevented from helping that night. He told the whistleblowers: “Let me be clear: you were right to speak out and you should be proud that you did.” The chief fire officer in charge during the arena attack took early retirement in September. His successor, Dawn Docx, said Greater Manchester fire and rescue service was cooperating fully with a wide-ranging review into its culture and practices being carried out by the deputy mayor, Beverley Hughes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/apr/09/juul-ecigarette-popular-children-vape-pen-nicotine","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T11:51:06Z","webTitle":"Meet Juul – the Marlboro of e-cigarettes that comes in creme brulee flavour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/apr/09/juul-ecigarette-popular-children-vape-pen-nicotine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/apr/09/juul-ecigarette-popular-children-vape-pen-nicotine","fields":{"headline":"Meet Juul – the Marlboro of e-cigarettes that comes in creme brulee flavour","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Name: Juul. Age: Three years old. Appearance: A small rectangular pen that contains a ton of nicotine. Listen, I already know what e-cigarettes are. But the Juul isn’t just any e-cigarette. It’s the iPhone of cigarettes. I don’t know what that means. Does it get drastically harder to use whenever a new model comes out? No, it just means that it is cool and well branded and kids love it. Kids love e-cigarettes? Yep – despite the fact that the Juul website is only accessible by over-21s. E-cigarette manufacturers aren’t allowed to market to children – but last year, one Boston high school had to send emails home to parents because so many students were Juuling underage. Specifically Juul? Yes. Juul has a 54% share of the e-cigarette market. That’s more than Marlboro had at its peak. Why Juul, though, rather than any other brand of e-cigarette? Well, it might be the range of flavours. The Juul website offers vapeable pods that come in cool mint, creme brulee and cucumber, among others – although they are targeted at cigarette smokers, not children. So that’s it? Juul is popular because it inspired kids to smoke cucumbers? Not quite. There is also something called the Juul Wave. I’m not sure I want to know about this. The Juul Wave is when Juuls go viral. You can customise your Juul with nail polish. You can tweet memes about your Juul. You can hashtag your Juul on Instagram. In a horrorshow of inevitability, someone has already started making and selling a fidget spinner attachment for Juuls. I hate everything about this. There is also a nicotine issue that we should probably address. What nicotine issue? Each Juul pod contains 59mg of nicotine, which is the equivalent to an entire packet of cigarettes, and designed to last just as long. Dear God. And although vaping isn’t thought to be as harmful as smoking traditional cigarettes, the general effects of nicotine still include addiction and “difficulty exerting energy and breathing”. I’ve had an idea. Let’s ban them. The trouble is that Juul was initially designed as a cigarette replacement for people trying to give up smoking. But kids have discovered it, and it’s often the first thing they smoke. But why? According to one student interviewed by the Panther, Chapman University’s newspaper, “(People) assume you’re cool if you’re Juuling. It’s a statement.

Authorities were tipped off when two children were spotted wandering alone near a train station in Junagadh, a city in the western state of Gujarat. The children had told police they were lost and had boarded a train 100km away in Rajkot after escaping a workshop in the city. There they had worked “day and night” assembling imitation jewellery, police said, often sleeping in the same room with up to a dozen other children and being subjected to frequent beatings. “They were kept in inhuman conditions and forced to do work that is not suitable to the nature of a child,” said Balram Meena, a deputy commissioner at Rajkot police. So far 73 children – most aged between eight and 14 – have been found in the city, where about 700 imitation jewellery firms are based. Another 25 employers and traffickers have had cases registered against them, Meena said. Most of the children were from the West Bengal state and had been brought to the city by middlemen promising to pay them about 6,000 rupees (£65) per month. They had been receiving about half that amount, Meena added. Questioning of employers and the children was in turn revealing other workshops that employ children in the nearly £109m industry with which Rajkot has become synonymous. Narendra Mehta, president of the Rajkot Imitation Jewellery Association, told Thomson Reuters Foundation the necklaces, bracelets and other pieces manufactured in the city were exported to the UK, Europe, the US, Pakistan and the Middle East. He said the presence of children in the supply chain was difficult to detect because the industry operated along informal lines with most firms outsourcing work to homes around the city. Most of these home workers were women who earned between 5,000 and 7,000 rupees per month, depending on how many pieces they produced. Indian law prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 in most occupations including jewellery manufacturing. But the International Labour Organisation estimated in 2015 there were about 5.7 million child workers in the country, more than half toiling in the agricultural industry. Police operations that “free” hundreds of children are frequently reported but analysts say raids and criminal charges alone fail to address the factors that lead many families to give their children up to traffickers. Administration and oversight of the industry is poor and some rescued children simply end up employed elsewhere. The prospect of a legal penalty deters some employers but drives others to push the work further underground, which can mean even worse conditions and less protection for employed children."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/14/tim-dowling-my-wifes-favourite-family-holiday-doesnt-come","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T05:00:13Z","webTitle":"Tim Dowling: this is my wife’s favourite sort of family holiday","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/14/tim-dowling-my-wifes-favourite-family-holiday-doesnt-come","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/14/tim-dowling-my-wifes-favourite-family-holiday-doesnt-come","fields":{"headline":"Tim Dowling: this is my wife’s favourite sort of family holiday: the kind where she doesn’t come","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"From time to time, it becomes necessary to blur the identities of the people who appear in this column, either for reasons of privacy or legality, or because I don’t want to seem like the kind of person who goes skiing twice in the same season. This precaution will not, I hope, interfere with the essential truth of what follows. So, anyway, my partner – let’s call him Sean – is trying to convince me to take our adopted ex-research chimps skiing. This is Sean’s favourite sort of family holiday: the kind where he doesn’t come. But I’ve already skied once this year, by myself. I’ve had my fill. Sean can be very persuasive and, when that fails, insistent. I remain apprehensive. In my experience, putting young chimpanzees on skis is expensive, dangerous and hilarious. But ours are now adults; this will be unprecedented. I manage to book cheap flights for myself and the two younger chimps, Anton and Kurt, but a question mark hangs over the availability of Heinz, the eldest. He’s currently participating in a landmark primatology study, the completion date of which is uncertain. “I’m sure he’ll come,” Sean says. ‘When will you get a chance to do this again?” He’s right: soon enough, the chimps will be living in separate zoos and refuges. But I don’t buy Heinz’s ticket that day, or the next. I imagine the price rising in the night. A week later, Sean asks if I’ve booked the ticket and I admit I haven’t. “He wants to go,” Sean says. “Are you sure?” I say. “I texted him, but he didn’t answer.” “He’s a chimp,” Sean says. Sean asks about the ticket in the morning, and again in the afternoon. Later that night, I sit down at my computer. The updated ticket price is, as I suspected, more than double what I paid for the others. My finger hovers above the mouse for some minutes before I finally click. Afterwards, I sit in the dark for a bit, feeling generous and stupid. I go up to bed, where Sean is reading a book. “Have you booked Heinz’s ticket?” he asks. I leave a slight pause while preparing to answer triumphantly in the affirmative. “Because he’s definitely not coming,” Sean says. Two weeks later, I rise at 3am, dress Anton and Kurt in hoodies, and head for the airport. Once we’re through pet passport control, Kurt makes the sign for coffee and Anton makes the sign for headphones. They begin to fight over which direction to go, their cycle of alarm-barks rising sharply. “Not here,” I say. By lunchtime, we are high in the Alps. Kurt and Anton are dressed in mismatched winterwear, fur on end. They look tired, and hilarious. I march them to a window to ask the woman behind the glass about lift tickets. She writes the price on a bit of paper and shows it to me. A long silence follows. “But they’re chimps,” I say. She says that is the price for chimps. I buy the tickets, and sit down on some steps to weep. Then I leave Sean a voicemail telling him that we are ruined. He rings back a minute later. “How’s the weather?” he asks. “It’s lovely,” I say. “But…” “And the snow?” “Amazing, apparently,” I say. “Shall I tell you what I’m up to?” Sean says. “I’m currently locked out of the car we borrowed from the mechanic. The electronic key is dead, I’m illegally parked and it’s raining. And I have been here for half an hour.” “The lift ticket price for an adult primate is, if you can believe this…” “You know what?” Sean says. “I think I’m having a worse time than you.” Then he hangs up on me. I gaze up at the majestic peaks in the distance, feeling hollow. Anton throws a snowball at Kurt, who emits his distinctive pant-hoot. Bananas, I think. We will need to get some bananas. My phone rings. It is Sean. “OK, so,” he says. “It turns out I was trying to unlock the wrong car. An identical car, across the street.” He laughs, and I laugh, too. This – not only this, but mostly this – is why I love him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/09/douma-inhabitants-prepare-leave-deadly-syria-chemical-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T11:27:39Z","webTitle":"Douma inhabitants prepare to leave after deadly chemical attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/09/douma-inhabitants-prepare-leave-deadly-syria-chemical-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/09/douma-inhabitants-prepare-leave-deadly-syria-chemical-attack","fields":{"headline":"Douma inhabitants prepare to leave after deadly chemical attack","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rebel fighters and civilians have begun preparing to leave the besieged town of Douma near the Syrian capital of Damascus after a chemical weapons attack over the weekend killed dozens and drew worldwide condemnation. Buses expected to transport local rebels and residents to their forced exile in northern Syria began arriving in the early hours of Monday, after negotiators announced a deal had been reached in the immediate aftermath of the suspected toxic gas attack, which killed at least 42 people. “I am leaving tomorrow, God willing, because our mission has ended,” said a paramedic who treated the chemical attack victims. “I am saying thank God that the mass killings are over, but I am saddened that I will leave my land and my people, possibly never to return. But I will leave knowing that I gave everything I could until the end. “I will take the memories of my home that was bombed and some photographs. All I will carry is two suitcases, but in my mind and my memory is so much of what we lived through.” On Monday, Russian military police reportedly entered the besieged city and visited the site of the alleged chemical attack. Local activists published a video showing an armoured Russian personnel carrier arriving at the building where the projectile laced with chemicals landed, and were shown being directed by locals and entering the building. The Russian vehicle was shown driving away from the scene as civilian onlookers watched from the street. It was unclear whether the Russian personnel at the site took any samples from the scene and what the purpose of the visit was. Douma is home to more than 100,000 civilians, according to UN estimates. It is the largest town in eastern Ghouta, a region that was once the breadbasket ofthe Damascus region but has been besieged for years by the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Tens of thousands of people have already fled other parts of Ghouta after a two-month bombardment that has killed nearly 2,000, and other rebel groups have agreed to surrender deals that allow their exile to northern Syria. A similar deal for Douma had foundered in recent days over the insistence of the local rebel group, Jaish al-Islam, that it wanted to stay in the city. But after the alleged chemical attack, which followed an intense bombardment that began on Friday and appeared aimed at forcing a deal, negotiators said they had reached an agreement that would allow the exile of fighters and those who wish to leave from among the civilians. Under the terms of the deal, those who choose to stay behind are supposed to be protected by Russia from prosecution and will reconcile with the Assad regime, and will not be called upon to do mandatory military service for six months. Russian military police are supposed to deploy in Douma to act as a guarantor of the agreement. Civilians and fighters are expected to be transported to Jarablus, a town near the Turkish border that is controlled by Ankara-backed rebel fighters who reclaimed it from Islamic State last year. Similar forced displacement deals have taken place all over Syria. Syrian state media said the deal also required that Jaish al-Islam hand over kidnapped individuals and prisoners of war in exchange for safe passage. Families of those in the rebel group’s prisons had gathered near the road into eastern Ghouta to await their release, after an earlier exchange that saw dozens of prisoners handed over to the Syrian government. Though more than two dozen buses had gathered near Douma to begin the evacuation, it was unclear on Monday afternoon whether any had left the besieged city yet. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said buses that had been filled with those leaving the city were waiting for others to be packed before departing for northern Syria. Civilians reached by the Guardian said they were happy their suffering, which extended over several years of siege, punishing air raids and chemical attacks including a sarin gas attack in 2013, was finally at an end. But they said they were saddened to leave their homes behind for an uncertain future of displacement, arguing that they could not trust a regime that had deployed so many weapons against them. “I am now spending my last farewell moments with my city, Douma, and I am leaving it hoping to return one day,” said an activist who planned to leave on Tuesday aboard the buses. “The bombing and destruction that we lived through for seven years has been concluded. All the masks have fallen. “I have no choice, and my heart is aching with sadness at leaving my city, my small home, my street and its kind people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2018/apr/10/immaturity-means-young-adults-need-more-support-in-court-centre-for-justice-innovation","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T23:01:11Z","webTitle":"Immaturity means young adults need more support in court, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/apr/10/immaturity-means-young-adults-need-more-support-in-court-centre-for-justice-innovation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/apr/10/immaturity-means-young-adults-need-more-support-in-court-centre-for-justice-innovation","fields":{"headline":"Immaturity means young adults need more support in court, report says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Young adults should be given special treatment in court because they are immature and need help understanding proceedings, according to a report by an influential legal reform group. The call for a fresh approach for 18- to 24-year-olds comes from the Centre for Justice Innovation as the sharp rise in knife crime highlights the criminal justice system’s problems in dealing with that age group. The report, A Fairer Way, highlights the fact that brain development continues well into young adulthood. “Impulse control, reasoning, and decision-making capabilities are in formation until the mid-twenties,” the report says, citing medical studies. “In typical brain maturation, temperance – the ability to evaluate the consequences of actions and to limit impulsiveness and risk-taking – is a significant factor in moderating behaviour and the fact that its development continues into a person’s twenties can influence antisocial decision-making among young adults.” Young adults are heavily overrepresented in crime figures and have a high reoffending rate: 75% of young adults in England and Wales released from prison are reconvicted within two years. The report also argues that changes to “societal norms” have extended the age at which people reach key markers of adulthood: they typically occur five to seven years later than a few decades ago. In order to help young adults through magistrates’ court hearings, the Centre for Justice Innovation has been working with magistrates’ courts and agencies in five areas: Coventry, Ipswich, Leicester, Northampton and Swansea. It has developed a model that involves providing better information to young adults before court, grouping their hearings into a nominated sitting each week and holding pre-court meetings to identify any communication needs. Other measures include preparing young adults for direct engagement with magistrates, ensuring probation reports are completed that take maturity into account and explaining the roles of people in the courtroom. The report says there should also be a follow-up after hearings and support to help community services tackle wider needs that may be contributing to offending behaviour. The scheme is backed by the police and crime commissioners of Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, the West Midlands and south Wales. Stephen Mold, the Northamptonshire commissioner, said: “Early intervention will present these young people with the opportunity to change their behaviour before their pattern of offending becomes more deeply rooted. There is a high degree of local enthusiasm in each of our areas for the pilots and much thought has been put into how the pilots could work in practice.” Phil Bowen, director of the Centre for Justice Innovation, said: “At the moment, people are coming out of court and feeling unclear about what has happened to them.” The centre has worked closely with the Ministry of Justice before, promoting US-style problem-solving courts where judges continue to review defendants’ progress after conviction – an initiative supported by the former justice secretary Michael Gove. There is growing interest in the way young adults are dealt with by the courts. Last year, a government-backed review into racial bias in the criminal justice system, led by the Labour MP David Lammy, said allowances should be made for younger defendants’ immaturity and their criminal records sealed to help former offenders find work. Lammy backed a West Midlands scheme, Operation Turning Point, in which suspects enter rehabilitation programmes without having to admit guilt; their charges are dropped if they complete their work. Since 2012, judges have been required under Sentencing Council guidelines to take “lack of maturity” into consideration as a mitigating factor when dealing with certain offences."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/14/carlo-rovelli-exploding-commonsense-notions-order-of-time-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T07:01:15Z","webTitle":"'There is no such thing as past or future': physicist Carlo Rovelli on changing how we think about time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/14/carlo-rovelli-exploding-commonsense-notions-order-of-time-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/14/carlo-rovelli-exploding-commonsense-notions-order-of-time-interview","fields":{"headline":"'There is no such thing as past or future': physicist Carlo Rovelli on changing how we think about time","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What do we know about time? Language tells us that it “passes”, it moves like a great river, inexorably dragging us with it, and, in the end, washes us up on its shore while it continues, unstoppable. Time flows. It moves ever forwards. Or does it? Poets also tell us that time stumbles or creeps or slows or even, at times, seems to stop. They tell us that the past might be inescapable, immanent in objects or people or landscapes. When Juliet is waiting for Romeo, time passes sluggishly: she longs for Phaethon to take the reins of the Sun’s chariot, since he would whip up the horses and “bring in cloudy night immediately”. When we wake from a vivid dream we are dimly aware that the sense of time we have just experienced is illusory. Carlo Rovelli is an Italian theoretical physicist who wants to make the uninitiated grasp the excitement of his field. His book Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, with its concise, sparkling essays on subjects such as black holes and quanta, has sold 1.3m copies worldwide. Now comes The Order of Time, a dizzying, poetic work in which I found myself abandoning everything I thought I knew about time – certainly the idea that it “flows”, and even that it exists at all, in any profound sense. We meet outside the church of San Petronio in Bologna, where Rovelli studied. (“I like to say that, just like Copernicus, I was an undergraduate at Bologna and a graduate at Padua,” he jokes.) A cheery, compact fellow in his early 60s, Rovelli is in nostalgic mood. He lives in Marseille, where, since 2010, he has run the quantum gravity group at the Centre de physique théorique. Before that, he was in the US, at the University of Pittsburgh, for a decade. He rarely visits Bologna, and he has been catching up with old friends. We wander towards the university area. Piazza Verdi is flocked with a lively crowd of students. There are flags and graffiti and banners, too – anti-fascist slogans, something in support of the Kurds, a sign enjoining passers-by not to forget Giulio Regeni, the Cambridge PhD student killed in Egypt in 2016. “In my day it was barricades and police,” he says. He was a passionate student activist, back then. What did he and his pals want? “Small things! We wanted a world without boundaries, without state, without war, without religion, without family, without school, without private property.” He was, he says now, too radical, and it was hard, trying to share possessions, trying to live without jealousy. And then there was the LSD. He took it a few times. And it turned out to be the seed of his interest in physics generally, and in the question of time specifically. “It was an extraordinarily strong experience that touched me also intellectually,” he remembers. “Among the strange phenomena was the sense of time stopping. Things were happening in my mind but the clock was not going ahead; the flow of time was not passing any more. It was a total subversion of the structure of reality. He had hallucinations of misshapen objects, of bright and dazzling colours – but also recalls thinking during the experience, actually asking himself what was going on. “And I thought: ‘Well, it’s a chemical that is changing things in my brain. But how do I know that the usual perception is right, and this is wrong? If these two ways of perceiving are so different, what does it mean that one is the correct one?’” The way he talks about LSD is, in fact, quite similar to his description of reading Einstein as a student, on a sun-baked Calabrian beach, and looking up from his book imagining the world not as it appeared to him every day, but as the wild and undulating spacetime that the great physicist described. Reality, to quote the title of one of his books, is not what it seems. He gave his conservative, Veronese parents a bit of a fright, he says. His father, now in his 90s, was surprised when young Carlo’s lecturers said he was actually doing all right, despite the long hair and radical politics and the occasional brush with the police. It was after the optimistic sense of student revolution in Italy came to an abrupt end with the kidnapping and murder of the former prime minister, Aldo Moro, in 1978 that Rovelli began to take physics seriously. But his route to his big academic career was circuitous and unconventional. “Nowadays everyone is worried because there is no work. When I was young, the problem was how to avoid work. I did not want to become part of the ‘productive system’,” he says. Academia, then, seemed like a way of avoiding the world of a conventional job, and for some years he followed his curiosity without a sense of careerist ambition. He went to Trento in northern Italy to join a research group he was interested in, sleeping in his car for a few months (“I’d get a shower in the department to be decent”). He went to London, because he was interested in the work of Chris Isham, and then to the US, to be near physicists such as Abhay Ashtekar and Lee Smolin. “My first paper was horrendously late compared to what a young person would have to do now. And this was a privilege – I knew more things, there was more time.” The popular books, too, have come relatively late, after his academic study of quantum gravity, published in 2004. If Seven Brief Lessons was a lucid primer, The Order of Time takes things further; it deals with “what I really do in science, what I really think in depth, what is important for me”. Rovelli’s work as a physicist, in crude terms, occupies the large space left by Einstein on the one hand, and the development of quantum theory on the other. If the theory of general relativity describes a world of curved spacetime where everything is continuous, quantum theory describes a world in which discrete quantities of energy interact. In Rovelli’s words, “quantum mechanics cannot deal with the curvature of spacetime, and general relativity cannot account for quanta”. Both theories are successful; but their apparent incompatibility is an open problem, and one of the current tasks of theoretical physics is to attempt to construct a conceptual framework in which they both work. Rovelli’s field of loop theory, or loop quantum gravity, offers a possible answer to the problem, in which spacetime itself is understood to be granular, a fine structure woven from loops. String theory offers another, different route towards solving the problem. When I ask him what he thinks about the possibility that his loop quantum gravity work may be wrong, he gently explains that being wrong isn’t the point; being part of the conversation is the point. And anyway, “If you ask who had the longest and most striking list of results it’s Einstein without any doubt. But if you ask who is the scientist who made most mistakes, it’s still Einstein.” How does time fit in to his work? Time, Einstein long ago showed, is relative – time passes more slowly for an object moving faster than another object, for example. In this relative world, an absolute “now” is more or less meaningless. Time, then, is not some separate quality that impassively flows around us. Time is, in Rovelli’s words, “part of a complicated geometry woven together with the geometry of space”. For Rovelli, there is more: according to his theorising, time itself disappears at the most fundamental level. His theories ask us to accept the notion that time is merely a function of our “blurred” human perception. We see the world only through a glass, darkly; we are watching Plato’s shadow-play in the cave. According to Rovelli, our undeniable experience of time is inextricably linked to the way heat behaves. In The Order of Time, he asks why can we know only the past, and not the future? The key, he suggests, is the one-directional flow of heat from warmer objects to colder ones. An ice cube dropped into a hot cup of coffee cools the coffee. But the process is not reversible: it is a one-way street, as demonstrated by the second law of thermodynamics. Time is also, as we experience it, a one-way street. He explains it in relation to the concept of entropy – the measure of the disordering of things. Entropy was lower in the past. Entropy is higher in the future – there is more disorder, there are more possibilities. The pack of cards of the future is shuffled and uncertain, unlike the ordered and neatly arranged pack of cards of the past. But entropy, heat, past and future are qualities that belong not to the fundamental grammar of the world but to our superficial observation of it. “If I observe the microscopic state of things,” writes Rovelli, “then the difference between past and future vanishes … in the elementary grammar of things, there is no distinction between ‘cause’ and ‘effect’.” To understand this properly, I can suggest only that you read Rovelli’s books, and pass swiftly over this approximation by someone who gave up school physics lessons joyfully at the first possible opportunity. However, it turns out that I am precisely Rovelli’s perfect reader, or one of them, and he looks quite delighted when I check my newly acquired understanding of the concept of entropy with him. (“You passed the exam,” he says.) “I try to write at several levels,” he explains. “I think about the person who not only doesn’t know anything about physics but is also not interested. So I think I am talking to my grandmother, who was a housekeeper. I also think some young students of physics are reading it, and I also think some of my colleagues are reading it. So I try to talk at different levels, but I keep the person who knows nothing in my mind.” His biggest fans are the blank slates, like me, and his colleagues at universities – he gets most criticism from people in the middle, “those who know a bit of physics”. He is also pretty down on school physics. (“Calculating the speed at which a ball drops – who cares? In another life, I’d like to write a school physics book,” he says.) And he thinks the division of the world into the “two cultures” of natural sciences and human sciences is “stupid. It’s like taking England and dividing the kids into groups, and you tell one group about music, and one group about literature, and the one who gets music is not allowed to read novels and the one who does literature is not allowed to listen to music.” The joy of his writing is its broad cultural compass. Historicism gives an initial hand-hold on the material. (He teaches a course on history of science, where he likes to bring science and humanities students together.) And then there’s the fact that alongside Einstein, Ludwig Boltzmann and Roger Penrose appear figures such as Proust, Dante, Beethoven, and, especially, Horace – each chapter begins with an epigraph from the Roman poet – as if to ground us in human sentiment and emotion before departing for the vertiginous world of black holes and spinfoam and clouds of probabilities. “He has a side that is intimate, lyrical and extremely intense; and he is the great singer of the passing of time,” Rovelli says. “There’s a feeling of nostalgia – it’s not anguish, it’s not sorrow – it’s a feeling of ‘Let’s live life intensely’. A good friend of mine, Ernesto, who died quite young, gave me a little book of Horace, and I have carried it around with me all my life.” Rovelli’s view is that there is no contradiction between a vision of the universe that makes human life seem small and irrelevant, and our everyday sorrows and joys. Or indeed between “cold science” and our inner, spiritual lives. “We are part of nature, and so joy and sorrow are aspects of nature itself – nature is much richer than just sets of atoms,” he tells me. There’s a moment in Seven Lessons when he compares physics and poetry: both try to describe the unseen. It might be added that physics, when departing from its native language of mathematical equations, relies strongly on metaphor and analogy. Rovelli has a gift for memorable comparisons. He tells us, for example, when explaining that the smooth “flow” of time is an illusion, that “The events of the world do not form an orderly queue like the English, they crowd around chaotically like the Italians.” The concept of time, he says, “has lost layers one after another, piece by piece”. We are left with “an empty windswept landscape almost devoid of all trace of temporality … a world stripped to its essence, glittering with an arid and troubling beauty”. More than anything else I’ve ever read, Rovelli reminds me of Lucretius, the first-century BCE Roman author of the epic-length poem, On the Nature of Things. Perhaps not so odd, since Rovelli is a fan. Lucretius correctly hypothesised the existence of atoms, a theory that would remain unproven until Einstein demonstrated it in 1905, and even as late as the 1890s was being written off as absurd. What Rovelli shares with Lucretius is not only a brilliance of language, but also a sense of humankind’s place in nature – at once a part of the fabric of the universe, and in a particular position to marvel at its great beauty. It’s a rationalist view: one that holds that by better understanding the universe, by discarding false beliefs and superstition, one might be able to enjoy a kind of serenity. Though Rovelli the man also acknowledges that the stuff of humanity is love, and fear, and desire, and passion: all made meaningful by our brief lives; our tiny span of allotted time.

The lack of police on the streets in areas of deprivation and violence is the savage outcome of a wilful lack of support services, from Sure Start to school education and social services. These are political decisions and they are all about what a government chooses to prioritise. Amber Rudd will fall in the next general election. Asktherightquestion ‘Driving legal highs underground while cutting police funding is about as stupid as a policy can get’ May has compounded the problem with her ridiculously regressive “psychoactive substances bill” that nary gets a mention anymore. Driving legal highs underground while cutting police funding is about as stupid as a policy can get, especially when other countries are liberalising drug laws to wholly positive results. Yesterday I read of a gang arrested for lifting nitrous oxide canisters from hospitals. Can anyone imagine that happening if the completely harmless sale of nitrous-oxide whippets wasn’t unnecessarily banned just so the tories looked like they were doing *something*? CropplyCrab The struggle for Melbourne: has the world’s ‘most liveable’ city lost its way? Guardian Cities and Guardian Australia are embarking on a week long series looking at changing metropolitan lives in the country. You’ve been sharing thoughts on this piece about Melbourne. ‘The upsides of living in Melbourne are intrinsically linked to migration’ I lived in Melbourne for a year back in 2012/13 and had an absolute blast. What I loved about it was that it had all the multicultural influences that you get in London (my home city) but in a more condensed space and in an embryonic phase. Street art was accepted and everywhere. Loved the bars and underground music was still actually underground, with small crews putting on great parties which had an organic, community vibe to them which I have never experienced in the UK. Amazing food too. The people I met, lived and worked with in Melbourne were rarely born and raised in the city. They were either Australians who had moved there from other parts of the country or international, like me. To me, the upsides of living in Melbourne are intrinsically linked to migration/immigration. You can’t have one without the other. oooobobbyzamora ‘Much needs to be done to make sure we can keep pace with the growth’ I don’t think I’ve travelled enough to say for sure just how good it is in Melbourne, but I haven’t been to many places I’d rather be living. Much needs to be done to make sure we can keep pace with the growth, but we’ve plenty or land if the transport infrastructure can be in place. Roads or trains, I don’t think concentrating ever more on the city centre is really viable. The outer suburbs all around need the kind of attention the East has had. Box Hill, Ringwood, Dandenong. These places can be centres in their own right, rather than a stop along the way to the CBD. They are reasonably well connected and the suburbs around them benefit from the links there.

Cubeyou, a New York-based data analytics firm that offers “fast, easy and accurate consumer insights” to customers, gathered some of its user data with Facebook quizzes developed in conjunction with the University of Cambridge. The quizzes carrying the disclaimer that information gathered would be used “for non-profit academic research”. According to CNBC, which first reported Cubeyou’s data harvesting techniques, the company used an app called You Are What You Like – a “one-click personality test” – to harvest data from users and build up a psychometric profile of them. Users were told the app was “developed by University of Cambridge Psychometrics Centre, in collaboration with Cubeyou”. The discovery suggests that collecting data for marketing purposes under the guise of academic research may have been a common practice, and not simply isolated to Cambridge Analytica. Aleksandr Kogan, the University of Cambridge academic who was contracted to gather data from millions of Facebook users, has long maintained that his work was standard practice. “Honestly we thought we were acting perfectly appropriately,” he had told the Guardian. “We thought we were doing something that was really normal.” Facebook said it would suspend Cubeyou from its platform while it investigated the claims. “If they refuse or fail our audit, their apps will be banned from Facebook,” Ime Archibong, Facebook vice president of product partnerships, told CNBC. “In addition, we will work with the UK ICO [Information Commissioner’s Office] to ask the University of Cambridge about the development of apps in general by its Psychometrics Centre given this case and the misuse by Kogan.” The University of Cambridge said in a statement to the TV channel that “we have not collaborated with [Cubeyou] to build a psychological prediction model – we keep our prediction model secret and it was already built before we started working with them. “Our relationship was not commercial in nature and no fees or client projects were exchanged,” the University continued. “They just designed the interface for a website that used our models to give users insight on their data. Unfortunately collaborators with the University of Cambridge sometimes exaggerate their connection to Cambridge in order to gain prestige from its academics’ work.” Cubeyou said that its link with Cambridge was only active from 2013 to 2015, and that since then it has not had access to information from new quiz-takers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/09/patrick-reed-crowd-rory-mcilroy-masters-glory","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T08:33:56Z","webTitle":"Patrick Reed says crowd favouring Rory McIlroy spurred him to Masters glory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/09/patrick-reed-crowd-rory-mcilroy-masters-glory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/09/patrick-reed-crowd-rory-mcilroy-masters-glory","fields":{"headline":"Patrick Reed says crowd favouring Rory McIlroy spurred him to Masters glory","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Patrick Reed said the knowledge that he was a crowd underdog inspired him towards Masters glory. Reed was victorious by a single shot over Rickie Fowler at Augusta National but the 27-year-old champion was well aware that the runner-up, plus Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy, all seemed favoured by the galleries on Sunday. Despite being a key part of the US Ryder Cup equation, Reed has never been embraced by fans. With the American and McIlroy paired in round four, it was the Northern Irishman who drew by far the louder encouragement as the duo were announced at the 1st hole. McIlroy was to slip to a 74, three worse than Reed, as his wait for a Masters win continued. Reed said: “I walked up to the 1st tee and had a really welcoming cheer from the fans but then when Rory walked up to the tee, his cheer was a little louder. That’s another thing that just kind of played into my hands. Not only did it fuel my fire a little bit, but also it just takes the pressure off of me and adds it back to him. “I think that’s the biggest thing going into a Sunday, especially trying to win, for me trying to win my first [major]; for him, trying to win the career grand slam, it’s who is going to handle the pressure and who is going to have more pressure on them. “Honestly, I felt like a lot of that pressure was kind of lifted and kind of taken off of me. The fans, yes, were cheering for me, but some of them were cheering more for Rory. At the same time, you had a lot of the guys picking him to win over me, and it’s just kind of one of those things that the more kind of chatter you have in your ear and about expectations and everything, the harder it is to play golf. “I just kind of went out there and tried to play golf the best I could and tried to stay in the moment and not worry about everything else.” Reed did, though, swat aside the notion of him being an unpopular winner. The US president, Donald Trump, was among those to offer public congratulations, as did Tiger Woods. “I don’t think it’s really as much a popularity thing with the fans as it is that Rory has been in this position before to win here,” Reed said. “He’s played some really solid golf here. A lot of people are wanting him to win to get that career grand slam. “Yeah, it’s just nature, and honestly to me it was just go out there and play golf. When I am overseas, they will cheer for good golf no matter what. It’s the same thing here. If you hit quality golf shots, they are going to cheer. “For Rory being in a position and trying to win here in the past, and you know, having some success here, it didn’t surprise me that the fans were cheering for him in the beginning.” A complex Reed back-story largely centres around his estrangement from his parents, with whom there has been no contact since 2012. Jeannette and Bill Reed – who are Augusta residents – were not present at their son’s wedding in the same year. When asked whether it was bittersweet not to share Masters glory with his family, Reed’s reply was noticeably lacking in emotion. “I mean, I’m just out here to play golf and try to win golf tournaments,” he said. As Reed celebrated, McIlroy was left to rue a “frustrating” Sunday where putting woes came to the fore. But he remains adamant that he will prevail at the Masters. “I think 100% I can come back and win here,” he said. “I’ve played in two final groups in the last seven years, I’ve had five top‑10s, I play this golf course well. I just haven’t played it well enough at the right times.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/13/rugby-sevens-continues-upward-trajectory-at-commonwealth-games","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T18:00:15Z","webTitle":"Rugby sevens continues upward trajectory at Commonwealth Games | Jill Scanlon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/13/rugby-sevens-continues-upward-trajectory-at-commonwealth-games","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/13/rugby-sevens-continues-upward-trajectory-at-commonwealth-games","fields":{"headline":"Rugby sevens continues upward trajectory at Commonwealth Games","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Rugby sevens is sometimes viewed as the code’s new kid on the block. That’s not so. It has been around as a sport since 1883, originally developed in Scotland played in tournament format and considered historically more as an off-season run around for the XVs players. That said, when the Commonwealth Games tournament kicks off this week at Robina Stadium on the Gold Coast, the game will bear little resemblance to that early incarnation. Sevens came into its own when in late 2009 the IOC accepted a submission proposing its inclusion in the Olympic program and the wheels were set in motion around the world as rugby playing nations adjusted their attitudes and launched development programs aimed at Rio 2016. It was the perfect sport for the Olympic format, which views marketability and spectator appeal among the key factors for being a successful member of the modern era Olympic family. The IOC’s decision created more validity for sevens as a sport in its own right, giving World Rugby the opportunity to reshape and develop it on a global scale. Its pace, brevity, physicality, athleticism and prolific scoring have pulled in spectators and kept them transfixed – that is those who are not making frequent visits to the refreshment stand. There can be little doubt the stage on which the sport is set is promoted as party central and the colour, costumes and interactive themes all come together to make that a key element of each tournament on the world circuit. However, World Rugby has worked hard to shift the balance back to an on-field focus while retaining some of the party atmosphere. The women’s game has also come into its own, becoming the fastest growing aspect of the sport globally. While this is the sixth appearance of the men’s competition in the Commonwealth Games, it is a first for the women. There are eight teams in two pools in the women’s competition, with the top two teams progressing to the semis and getting a shot at a medal. Australia go in as favourites but they will not have it all their own way on this stage. Their biggest challenge, probably at the pointy end of the tournament, will come from regular on-field rivals and neighbours New Zealand, with Canada looking to spoil the party for both the Oceania teams. It is hard to see where these three powerhouses will be challenged, except, if they can hit their straps, by Fijiana or England, both of whom have been struggling to perform this year at their usual top level. Australia’s women, who won the inaugural Olympic gold in Rio, currently sit 10 points clear of their nearest rivals in the World Series standings having won the first two rounds and with four to come. They are looking to repeat their feat of 2016 when they were crowned World Sevens Series Champions and then won gold at the Olympics. These Games will be coach Tim Walsh’s last hurrah in charge before he steps down from his six-year role to take up the men’s head coach position, to replace Andy Friend, who also bids farewell on the Gold Coast. The men’s competition is bigger with 16 teams in four pools. Unlike the regular World Series tournament format, only the top team from each pool progresses to the semi-finals, skipping the usual quarter-final fixture. As such, a cut-throat competition is in store from the first kick. Men’s sevens has been a part of the Games since 1998 and Australia have picked up medals in three of the five previous editions – silver in 2010 and bronze in 1998 and 2014. Home prospects looked bright just a month ago, but forced list changes through injuries – both on and off the field – have put pressure on this young team to reach the similar heights. Captain Lewis Holland was ruled out with a hamstring injury three weeks ago before replacement captain James Stannard was attacked following a social function and suffered a fractured skull. The injury ruled the veteran out of what would have been his third and final Commonwealth Games. Fellow member of the leadership group Jesse Parahi will step up into the captaincy role. Unlike the women’s game, the top ranks of the men’s are filled with Commonwealth nations and competition will be fierce as South Africa, New Zealand, Fiji (the current top three in the World Series) will be hard to overcome. England and Kenya are also in the mix, with several other teams capable of pulling off an upset on their day. But the Australian men remain a chance to make it onto the podium if they can use the emotional element affecting the team and run with it – especially in front of a home crowd."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/12/china-forced-confessions-report","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T04:00:21Z","webTitle":"'My hair turned white': report lifts lid on China's forced confessions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/12/china-forced-confessions-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/12/china-forced-confessions-report","fields":{"headline":"'My hair turned white': report lifts lid on China's forced confessions","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"China must stop airing forced confessions from human rights activists, a campaign group has said in a report that details how detainees are coerced into delivering scripted remarks. There have been at least 45 forced televised confessions in China since 2013, according to the report from Safeguard Defenders, a human rights NGO in Asia. The group called on the international community to put pressure on the Chinese government to end the practice and recommended imposing sanctions on executives at China’s state broadcaster, including asset freezes and travel bans. Those coerced into confessing describe being dressed by police and handed a script they are required to memorise, and even being given directions on how to deliver certain lines or cry on cue, the report says. One person described enduring seven hours of recording for a television piece that ultimately amounted to several minutes. Others reported police ordering retakes of confessions they were unhappy with. Some occur in jailhouse settings, with the accused wearing an orange prison vest and sometimes seated behind bars, while others are made to look more neutral. The confessions are almost always aired before a formal conviction, violating Chinese law asserting a presumption of innocence. Chinese courts have a conviction rate over 99% and cases rely heavily on confessions. Five of the 37 people described in the report who have confessed on Chinese television have since publicly retracted their confessions. Since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012 there has been a wholesale crackdown on civil society and dissent, leading to hundreds of arrests targeting human rights activists and the lawyers that defend them. The practice of forced confessions was especially prominent during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, a decade of political upheaval during which “counter-revolutionaries” were paraded through the streets and forced to confess to their alleged crimes. “[The police] threatened that if I did not cooperate with them they would sentence me to jail time, I’d lose my job, my family would leave me and I’d lose my reputation for the rest of my life,” said one person quoted in the report, identified only as Li. “I was only 39 years old, my hair turned white with the enormous pressure and torture of it all.” Peter Dahlin, a former China-based NGO worker from Sweden, was forced to say he had violated Chinese law in a televised confession in 2016. He said the purpose, especially when foreigners were involved, was to shape the conversation from the beginning and preempt any international criticism. “This goes to show this is not done simply by police for murky propaganda purposes but directly by the state as a part of foreign policy,” he said. Confessions by a range of suspects have been aired on China Central Television, the nation’s official broadcaster, including those by a British corporate investigator, a Chinese-born Swedish book publisher and dozens of Chinese activists who agitated for change. Gui Minhai, the bookseller, has been paraded in front of media outlets on three separate occasions. He went missing from his apartment in a Thai resort town in late 2015 only to reappear months later in a Chinese jail, confessing to a traffic incident from 2003. “These ‘confessions’ are about the crushing of dissent wherever it may arise,” David Bandurski, a researcher at the University of Hong Kong’s China Media Project, said in a conversation on the website China File last year. “The supposed crimes are of middling importance relative to the act of submission itself, the knuckling under to authority. In a word, then, this is political bullying. “As Xi Jinping trumpets the principle of rule of law, these clearly forced admissions telegraph exactly the opposite message.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/09/fiorentina-use-victory-as-coping-mechanism-after-death-of-astori","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T10:53:08Z","webTitle":"Fiorentina use victory as a coping mechanism after death of Astori | Paolo Bandini","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/09/fiorentina-use-victory-as-coping-mechanism-after-death-of-astori","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/09/fiorentina-use-victory-as-coping-mechanism-after-death-of-astori","fields":{"headline":"Fiorentina use victory as a coping mechanism after death of Astori","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Since Davide Astori died, Fiorentina cannot stop winning. To lay it out in such blunt terms feels almost too crude and yet how else should we put it? The Viola have strung together six consecutive victories in Serie A, a feat they last achieved in 1960. Only the first game in this sequence was played with their captain, who died on 4 March. How do we talk about these events in a way that is honest and respectful? Football results are a trivial thing in the context of a lost life. A few Fiorentina wins are unlikely to offer great solace to Astori’s family, his partner, his two-year-old daughter. Or even, indeed, to the people who used to work with him every day. Yet, there is no question in the minds of Fiorentina’s players and coaches that this run owes a great deal to his influence. A week ago, following the 2-0 victory at Udinese, the manager, Stefano Pioli, observed: “After the tragedy, our team pulled together. These lads have shown an uncommon strength in the way they have carried forward the work Davide left us.” A more prolonged reflection was offered by Riccardo Saponara in this week’s edition of Sportweek magazine. The Fiorentina playmaker shared a devastatingly raw moment-by-moment account of the morning when Astori died, of piecing the news together in stages: his friend failing to show up at breakfast, before an ambulance appeared outside the team hotel and then a pale Stefano Pioli at his bedroom door. There were tears and bewilderment that day. In Saponara’s account, some Fiorentina players wept, others paced the halls and others still sat in silence outside Astori’s room and simply stared at the walls. “If it had happened on the pitch, when the heart is under stress, perhaps I would even have accepted it,” Saponara said. “But this way is hard.” So, too, is knowing how to continue. “Every now and then we talk about it, we remember him. We ask ourselves: ‘What would Davide have done? How would he have carried himself? Imagine if he was in this situation; Davide used to say …’ “But it’s difficult. Sometimes what happened, even saying his name, still feels like a taboo. We keep the pain that we have felt locked up inside us. We have decided to press ahead and we are doing it well but it seems as though each of us is also afraid to re-evoke that suffering.” That sentiment was echoed by Giovanni Simeone on Saturday. The 22-year-old striker had scored the second goal in a 2-0 win at Roma. It was a win that set Fiorentina on course for a place in Europe, as well as the first time in the current run that they had beaten a team ahead of them in the standings. “We have stayed united through the difficulty we have faced,” he said. “And this is a thing that gives you strength. After every training session, for example, nobody wants to go home because staying is the only way not to think about what happened.” Victory as a path of pain avoidance? It is not the neat healing narrative we might want for those closest to Astori but the idea of throwing yourself into work as a coping mechanism for grief is one that many people will be able to relate to. This column has been as guilty as any of trying to apply some grand story arc to football at times, when in fact it is just real life. Only Fiorentina’s players can fully understand how they have experienced this tragedy. As observers, the aspects most visible to us are those extraordinary results on the pitch. Fiorentina were missing two key starters on Saturday, with Federico Chiesa suspended and Milan Badelj injured, yet they were absolutely ruthless when it mattered. Both goals were exceptionally well taken. Marco Benassi’s first-time effort from a Saponara cross was placed expertly into the bottom corner. Simeone showed impressive strength as Kostas Manolas barged him into Bruno Peres, bouncing off each opponent like a pinball before finishing coolly past Alisson. It was, conversely, a frustrating day for Roma, who mustered 25 shots to their opponents’ three without ever finding the net. Edin Dzeko, Patrik Schick and Federico Fazio all hit the woodwork but manager Eusebio Di Francesco insisted afterwards that this defeat owed less to ill-fortune than insufficient application during training throughout the week. Perhaps Roma were also distracted by the prospect of their Champions League quarter-final second leg against Barcelona on Tuesday. In any case, Roma slipped to fourth. It could have been worse but Torino did them a favour by beating Inter a day later. Fiorentina climbed to seventh, good enough for a spot in Europe if the season ended today – since Coppa Italia finalists Juventus and Milan are both in the top six. Hundreds of fans were waiting to greet the victors as they returned to Florence. They sang Astori’s name and remembered him in countless social media posts. For Fiorentina, he is at once ever-present and always absent. “Sometimes he would send me WhatsApp messages of encouragement during our coach journeys,” Saponara remembered in his Sportweek interview. “Instead of listening to music through his headphones like everyone else, he was busy thinking about others.” And now, we all think of him. Talking points • It looked as if the Scudetto race might be over on Sunday, as Napoli fell behind at home to Chievo in the 73rd minute of a game they had dominated. The score was still 1-0 in the 89th minute before Arkadiusz Milik and Amadou Diawara turned it on its head. The impact made by the former, in particular, served as a vivid reminder of what a valuable – and, crucially, different – forward this team was missing through the middle part of this season. • Juventus did not have things all their own way against Benevento – twice seeing leads wiped out before eventually winning 4-2. Will it be a regret, for Benevento, that they took so long to tap into the potential of Cheick Diabaté after his January arrival from Osmanlispor? He got both goals here and has five in only 195 minutes of Serie A action – two more than anybody else on the team has managed. • A unique sight in Udinese’s game against Lazio, as the hosts lined up in 11 different shirts – every player wearing a different one from the recent past. The shirts would be auctioned, with each raising funds for a specific supporter’s dream project. Lazio did nothing to help the prices, mind, by winning the game 2-1. • It might be too little too late for a run at Europe, given the competition ahead of them, but Torino made it three wins in eight days by beating Inter. “Now everyone has understood what I’m asking for and you can see it from the spirit of sacrifice shown by players like Iago Falqué and [goalscorer Adem] Ljajic,” Walter Mazzarri said at full-time. “This means we are becoming a Team with a capital T.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/10/johnson-johnson-accused-of-failing-to-warn-patients-at-higher-risk-from-vaginal-mesh","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T23:37:46Z","webTitle":"Johnson & Johnson accused of failing to warn patients at higher risk from vaginal mesh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/10/johnson-johnson-accused-of-failing-to-warn-patients-at-higher-risk-from-vaginal-mesh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/10/johnson-johnson-accused-of-failing-to-warn-patients-at-higher-risk-from-vaginal-mesh","fields":{"headline":"Johnson & Johnson accused of failing to warn patients at higher risk from vaginal mesh","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The pharmaceutical giant Johnson &amp; Johnson allegedly failed to warn women that its vaginal mesh devices posed a particular risk for patients with compromised immune systems, despite it being “well known” before they were first sold in Australia. The federal court is currently deliberating on a landmark class action involving hundreds of women who have sued the multinational giant over the impact of its vaginal mesh devices. The mesh was surgically implanted to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, common complications of childbirth. It was marketed to surgeons as a simple, safe and affordable implant, which would boost their profits and speed up operations considerably. But the devices left many women in debilitating pain and unable to have sex, ruining lives and causing long-term impairment. Over a six-month hearing, the federal court heard allegations that Johnson &amp; Johnson either knew of the risks or failed to properly test the devices before launching them on the Australian market. On Monday, the women won the right to add a new allegation to its case: that Johnson &amp; Johnson knew the devices posed an added risk for patients with compromised immune systems but failed to warn women. Kathryn Gill, the lead applicant in the case, was among those who were not warned, the court heard. Gill suffered from psoriasis but says she was not told of the added risk she faced in undergoing the surgery. She said she never would have gone ahead with the procedure had she known. It was not until after Gill’s operation that warnings about immune problems were added to the instructions for a number of the mesh devices. The warning read: “In patients with compromised immune systems or other conditions that would compromise healing, the risks and benefits should be carefully weighed.” The court was also told that US regulators wrote to the manager of regulator affairs at Ethicon, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s product development arm, in October 1990, well before the products were first sold in Australia. The letter “adverted to potentially delayed wound healing in patients with compromised health due to a number of factors”, according to the federal court. The court also heard from a biomaterials expert, Prof Paul Santerre, who said it was well known that immune system problems made it more difficult for biomaterials to integrate with tissue. Santerre cited a 1997 report on the issue. Mesh was not sold in Australia until after 1997. The allegations about the immune system response were not initially included in the class action against Johnson &amp; Johnson. But lawyers for the women launched a late bid to have them included in their formal pleadings, which was opposed by the company. Federal court justice Anna Katzmann allowed the pleading to be changed in a judgment handed down on Monday afternoon. She rejected the arguments that doing so would put the company in an unfair position, having already argued its case. “Having given careful consideration to the points raised by both parties, I am not satisfied that the amendments would cause any injustice to the respondents,” she said. Katzmann has also allowed the women to seek an injunction that would prevent the mesh devices being sold or marketed in Australia without a comprehensive warning about the risks. The company had attempted to argue that was a role best left to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), an argument Katzmann rejected. Katzmann has reserved her full judgment in the case and it will be handed down at a later date."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2018/apr/09/film-flop-most-rented-ben-affleck-the-accountant","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T10:32:11Z","webTitle":"From The Accountant to Idiocracy: the films that became hits without anyone noticing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/apr/09/film-flop-most-rented-ben-affleck-the-accountant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2018/apr/09/film-flop-most-rented-ben-affleck-the-accountant","fields":{"headline":"From The Accountant to Idiocracy: the films that became hits without anyone noticing","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"These are hard times for Ben Affleck, what with everyone snarking about his tummy and his tattoo and the general manner in which he greets each day with a bone-deep, mournful billion-yard stare. Times are so hard that every positive should be clung to, no matter how minuscule. So here’s a minuscule positive: it has been announced that Affleck’s film The Accountant was the most rented movie of 2017 in the US. More people rented The Accountant than Moana. More people rented The Accountant than Beauty and the Beast. More people rented it than Rogue One, Wonder Woman and Guardians of the Galaxy 2. Sure, The Accountant only scraped in at 19th place in digital purchases. If we’re talking physical sales (ie DVDs), it didn’t even crack the top 30. But digital rentals – the cheap, muddy middle ground between “There is no way in hell I’d ever watch this at the cinema” and “I don’t want to wait three years until this turns up on Netflix for free” – is where The Accountant can finally shine. You’ll notice, of course, that The Accountant is not a good film. It isn’t even a particularly memorable one. Starring Affleck as a man with autism and a machine gun, it opened on a quiet weekend in October 2016 – its meagre competition included Kevin Hart: What Now? and a Harry Potter Imax marathon – gained a middling 52% on Rotten Tomatoes and then quickly dropped out of sight. And yet here we are. A year and a half later and The Accountant is so much of a hit that Warner Bros are developing a sequel. But The Accountant is not alone. Dig around enough and plenty of other mostly forgotten films begin to stand out as stealth hits. Despite being a repository for some of the finest feature films ever made, back in 2016 Netflix revealed that its most-watched movie of all time was The Ridiculous 6, an Adam Sandler Netflix-exclusive western spoof most notable for looking like the sort of thing you’d watch if you found Grown Ups 2 a little too highbrow. Late last year, kiosk-based rental service Redbox revealed its most-rented movies of all time. And, although the number one film – The Hunger Games – was a genuine hit, number three was revealed to be Identity Thief. You know, Identity Thief; the film where Melissa McCarthy does something and then pulls a face and then it ends. You know, it’s that film you literally haven’t thought about once since before it even came out, unless you’re really into Redbox. Even weirder, in a year when it invested heavily in prestigious fare such as Manchester by the Sea, the most streamed film on the Amazon Prime Video service in Canada last year was Wanted, a solidly mediocre decade-old Angelina Jolie action film that most people now remember for its nightmarishly Photoshopped poster. Not that this is an entirely bad phenomenon. Quite often decent films will flop theatrically, only to find their natural audience in the home entertainment market. 2012’s Dredd is a perfect case in point. Much better than the Sylvester Stallone movie that preceded it – and a remake of The Raid in all but name – it failed to recoup its budget in cinemas, before effortlessly racking up $10m in DVD sales. Idiocracy, Mike Judge’s far-fetched fantasy movie about the dystopia created when a lowbrow celebrity is elected president, made 20 times more in DVD rentals than it ever did theatrically. Showgirls, written off as tacky and schlocky at original time of release, is now reportedly the biggest-selling MGM DVD of all time. True, the success of some of these films seems truly inexplicable, but this is heartening nonetheless. It’s a feelgood story. Yes, your dumbly generic Melissa McCarthy vehicle or bland Affleck project might initially be met with a shrug, but give it a second chance and it could finally achieve the attention it deserves. Listen, if they can make a third Johnny English film, anything is possible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/09/amber-rudd-home-office-violent-crime-report-leaked","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T08:22:18Z","webTitle":"Amber Rudd denies seeing leaked Home Office violent crime report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/amber-rudd-home-office-violent-crime-report-leaked","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/amber-rudd-home-office-violent-crime-report-leaked","fields":{"headline":"Amber Rudd denies seeing leaked Home Office violent crime report","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The home secretary, Amber Rudd, has denied seeing documents from her department, leaked to the Guardian, which said government cuts to the police had “likely contributed” to a rise in serious violent crime. On the morning she was due to launch the government’s new strategy for tackling the problem, Rudd insisted that a recent rise in violent crime, including a high-profile series of murders in London, was not connected to police funding cuts. “It is not all about police numbers,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday. “I think it is a mistake, and we do a disservice to the communities and the families who have seen these tragedies, by just pointing to police numbers.” Asked about the leaked Home Office documents, which said policing cuts “may have encouraged” violent offenders, Rudd said: “I haven’t seen this document.” She added: “There are a lot of documents that go around the Home Office. We do a lot of work in these areas. Of course violent crime is a priority, and as I say I think that you do a disservice to the communities and the families by making this a political tit-for-tat about police numbers.” The shadow policing minister, Louise Haigh, said Rudd’s admission was shocking. Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons home affairs committee, tweeted: The row threatens to overshadow the government’s anti-violence strategy, which officials and ministers have been working on for months. It will include tougher powers to seize acid from people who cannot provide a reason for carrying it, and a crackdown on so-called zombie knives. In preparation for the launch, officials in February prepared a document on the factors behind the rise in violent crime. The document was marked as “official – sensitive”. A section on police resources says: “Since 2012-13, weighted crime demand on the police has risen, largely due to growth in recorded sex offences. At the same time officers’ numbers have fallen by 5% since 2014. “So resources dedicated to serious violence have come under pressure and charge rates have dropped. This may have encouraged offenders. [It is] unlikely to be the factor that triggered the shift in serious violence, but may be an underlying driver that has allowed the rise to continue.” A highlighted box emphasises the point: “Not the main driver but has likely contributed.” Responding to this, Rudd said violent crime was a complex area, “and you cannot arrest your way out of this”. She said a reduction in some areas in the number of police community support officers (PCSOs) was down to local decisions. “It’s up to different police and crime commissioners to make their decisions about how the money is spent,” she said. “Some forces are increasing their numbers of PCSOs, some are cutting them in order to have more funds available for local policing of a different type.” Home Office statistics show the number of police officers fell from 143,734 in March 2010 to 123,142 in March 2017. Figures released in November showed a 20% annual rise in gun, knife and serious violent crime across England and Wales, even as the crime survey estimated there had been a 9% overall drop in crime. The Home Office says “traditional crime” nationwide has dropped by almost 40% since 2010. Speaking before Rudd on Today, Haigh said it would be wrong to make a direct correlation between the number of police and a rise in certain crimes, but that the home secretary had serious questions to answer. Haigh said: “Now to me there’s two options for her: either she saw that research and she chose to say the exact opposite in yesterday’s Sunday Telegraph, or she commissioned that research and she didn’t see it. Either she’s incompetent or she chose to mislead the public.” After Rudd said she had not seen the documents, Haigh tweeted:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/10/dutton-urged-to-allow-refugee-families-in-australia-to-apply-for-us-resettlement","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T03:53:32Z","webTitle":"Dutton urged to allow refugee families in Australia to apply for US resettlement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/dutton-urged-to-allow-refugee-families-in-australia-to-apply-for-us-resettlement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/10/dutton-urged-to-allow-refugee-families-in-australia-to-apply-for-us-resettlement","fields":{"headline":"Dutton urged to allow refugee families in Australia to apply for US resettlement","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Split up refugee families stuck in limbo because of Australian government policy could be reunited if Peter Dutton let them apply for US resettlement from Australia, the opposition has said. The comment follows revelations by Guardian Australia that a family of four had been split between Nauru and Australia since 2014. Australian Border Force has told the 27-year-old daughter on Nauru that they could be reunited but only if her mother and sister returned to the island. The mother is in Australia confined to a wheelchair and awaiting surgery, and doctors have said she cannot go back. While the mother and one daughter are in Australia they cannot apply for resettlement in the US, offered under a deal struck between the Australian government and the Obama administration. More than 220 have been resettled, out of a promise of “up to 1,200”. “Labor strongly supports the US refugee resettlement agreement and wants all eligible refugees – including those in Australia for medical treatment – to have the opportunity to apply for resettlement in the US,” the shadow minister for immigration, Shayne Neumann, said. “The long-term issue of asylum seekers from Manus Island and Nauru in Australia could have been avoided entirely if Peter Dutton simply allowed eligible refugees in Australia the opportunity to apply to resettle in the United States.” Previous queries to the Department of Home Affairs have been directed towards comments from department secretary Michael Pezzullo to Senate estimates earlier this year. Asked about the case of a young man separated from his wife and baby, Pezzullo said people were – in general – expected to return to Nauru or Manus Island to apply. “If there is a particular vulnerability, or for compassionate reasons, I can see there could be a circumstance where the minister or the minister’s delegate might allow them to come to a different view,” he said. There are no cases Guardian Australia is aware of where people have been allowed to apply from Australia. Narges and her brother Daryoush, who are currently languishing on Nauru, have suffered mental and physical illnesses while there, and psychiatrists and health providers contracted by the Australian government have repeatedly recommended the family be reunited, to no avail. The Greens senator and immigration spokesman, Nick McKim, said the family deserved safety and the right to be together. “This has been denied to them,” he said. “It’s difficult to comprehend what a horrible bind Narges and her family have been placed in because of the cruelty of Peter Dutton’s decisions. “There is no possible purpose to be served by forcibly separating this family and indefinitely detaining them, other than cruelty for cruelty’s sake. “Basic compassion and dignity should not be too much to ask, even after all they have been through.” McKim called for the family’s immediate reunification in Australia. Neumann said Dutton had also failed to respond to the recommendations made by a Senate inquiry into allegations of abuse, self-harm and neglect at Australia’s offshore processing centres. The inquiry determined the Australian government had to admit it controlled the detention centres and had a duty of care to asylum seekers and refugees. To suggest anything else was “fiction”, it said. Other recommendations included increasing Australia’s refugee intake, more funding to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, a regional processing framework and an immediate external review of the department’s medical transfer procedures. The inquiry was called following Guardian Australia’s publication of the Nauru Files, which detailed more than 2,000 leaked incident reports from the detention centre including numerous instances of abuse and trauma, and widespread mismanagement by service providers and government. The reports included revelations about the government’s efforts to avoid transferring people to Australia, including in the case of a young woman who had been raped. Every service provider and authority on the island, including the Nauruan government, had recommended she be transferred to Australia but the request were ignored for months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2018/apr/10/the-jobs-boom-continues-but-not-for-everyone","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T18:00:05Z","webTitle":"The jobs boom continues – but not for everyone | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/apr/10/the-jobs-boom-continues-but-not-for-everyone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2018/apr/10/the-jobs-boom-continues-but-not-for-everyone","fields":{"headline":"The jobs boom continues – but not for everyone","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The strong employment growth of last year should continue for some time in light of the continued growth of job vacancies. But while overall the opportunities are better now for those looking for work than have been for some time, the picture remains extremely varied, depending on where you live and what type of work you are looking to do. Last year certainly was a good year from employment. Over the year, total employment grew by 3.4% – the best annual growth since September 2005, and the number of hours worked grew by 3%, the best since 2010. And while the growth levels do seem to have come off their peak a bit in the start of this year, employment is still growing very solidly: And generally the signs are good for this employment growth continuing, with the latest job vacancy figures showing a 4.4% increase in private sector vacancies in February compared with the three months to November last year: Again this is showing a slight fall from the peak quarterly growth of 5.3% that we had in the middle of last year, but it remains extremely solid – and marks now 18 consecutive quarters of growth, which breaks the previous record by a year. Of course the number and growth of job vacancies does not tell us everything – especially if the size of the labour force is growing faster. This is why economists use the “job vacancy rate,” which measures the number of vacancies as a percentage of the labour force. On this score again things are very good – in fact better than ever. In February, the vacancy rate was a record 1.7% – higher than even at the peak of the mining boom: And this good figure is also reflected in the number of unemployed per vacancy. In February there was, on average across the nation, just 3.3 unemployed per vacancy – the lowest rate since May 2011. And while underemployment remains at near record levels, even if we include those workers (always a bit perilous given being underemployed does not mean you are looking for a job, you may merely wish to get more hours in the job you are currently doing) the level of underutilised workers per job vacancy is 8.3 – the lowest for six years: Now yes, a national average is all well and good, but if you live in Adelaide, you’re not very likely going to be answering a job advert in Brisbane. Across each state, New South Wales, Victoria, the ACT and Northern Territory are all performing better than the national average. But while in NSW there are just 2.8 unemployed per vacancy, in South Australia there are 5.9 – the highest in the nation: But even South Australia is doing better now than it was five years ago – as are most states. Queensland hasn’t seen much improvement, and in Western Australia the end of the mining boom continues to bite. When the mining boom was in full swing there were just 1.2 unemployed per vacancy in the WA, now there are 4.3: But a case could be made that given the current level of job vacancies, that the unemployment rate should be lower. Economists compare the vacancy rate with the unemployment to gauge how well the labour market is clearing unemployed. Generally the higher the vacancy rate – ie the more vacancies per people in the labour force, the lower the unemployment rate should be because it is easier to find work. This relationship (known as the Beveridge curve) has held up well over the past 40 years, but at the moment it seems things are a bit “sticky” to use the economic term: Given the current vacancy rate, you would expect the unemployment rate to be much lower – nearer 4%. And it is here that we see the continued issues of our changing economy. While the Bureau of Statistics does provide a breakdown of vacancies by industry, the department of jobs’ monthly vacancy report breaks down the vacancies by occupation. Since the end of 2016, when the nice boom in employment began, the biggest growth in job vacancies have been for professionals. This in itself is not surprising – professionals make up the biggest chunk of all employed – some 24% of all workers. But the growth in job vacancies has greatly outpaced the number of people working in those occupations. Vacancies for professionals accounted for 35% of the growth in all vacancies since December 2016: By contrast, labourers, sales persons, and community and personal service workers have all been occupations where the growth in vacancies is below what would be expected given the level of people employed in such work. The situation for labourers is quite stark. In 2007, labourer jobs accounted for 11% of all vacancies and for 11% of all employed. Now they account for 10% of all employed but just 6.4% of all vacancies: The economy is very much moving towards both a services sector, but also a more educated/skills-orientated workforce. That means that for some, in some parts of the nation, opportunities are as good now as ever before. But for others, the risks of being left behind are greater than in the past. That means the need for improving the skills and education of those looking for work – and for those about to enter the labour force – remains paramount.

Dutton told Guardian Australia over the weekend he had ambitions to lead the Liberal party one day – a message he repeated on Monday – while Morrison used an interview on the ABC to signal he was interested in the event the party leadership fell vacant. Morrison told the ABC on Monday night he would not prosecute his ambitions while Turnbull remained in the top job, and he insisted the incumbent remained the right prime minister to lead the party not just to the next election “but beyond”. But the treasurer said that, “down the track, if an opportunity presented itself”, he would be interested in putting his hand up. Dutton is the favoured candidate of government conservatives but Morrison also has aspirations. Both are currently expressing loyalty to Turnbull. While cabinet colleagues rallied both to defend Turnbull, and also stake out their own territory in the event current internal calculations changed, Tony Abbott continued to stir the pot on energy during a tour of coal communities in Victoria. The former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce also entered the fray. Joyce said Turnbull would need to consider a transition in the event he could not turn around the government’s political fortunes, “much deeper into the year”, in December. “I think Malcolm’s not a fool, he’d know that himself,” Joyce told Sky News. “We’re stating here the bleeding obvious. “Nobody wants to actually go to a federal election which you know you’re going to lose because it’s like playing in the losing grand final. No one wants to play in the losing side. “And you’d have an obligation to all around you that, if you honestly believe that is the case, then you must do something about it and do the honourable thing and start grooming an alternative”. The National party does not determine who leads the Liberal party but Joyce’s comments perhaps reciprocate an effort by Turnbull earlier in the year to ratchet up pressure on his leadership of the junior Coalition partner at the height of the imbroglio over his personal life. With positioning in play around him, Turnbull dug in to defend his record and snapped back at Abbott for his outspoken comments on energy policy, and a specific suggestion on Monday that the federal government should force AGL to keep its ageing coal-fired power station open. Turnbull flatly rejected that as a course of action. He said the Liberal party was founded in the 1940s to prevent Labor nationalising assets and the Coalition should be resolute in opposing such things. Turnbull also said his government did not want to start building new coal-fired power stations because that was the private sector’s job. “I’m the leader of the ‘Liberal’ party, do you remember the Liberal party?” he said during a Daily Telegraph interview broadcast live on the internet. “That’s the one that believes in free enterprise. It’s the Labor party that wants to nationalise things and have the government doing everything.” Abbott used Monday’s Newspoll, which showed the Turnbull government has trailed Labor for 30 consecutive polls, to advise Turnbull on the direction he thinks the Coalition ought to be taking to ensure it wins the next election. Pushing the argument that coal-fired power must be included in Australia’s future energy mix - a theme from last week’s “Monash forum” controversy - Abbott told 2GB radio’s Ray Hadley on Monday that AGL should not be allowed to close its ageing Liddell power station in New South Wales if it will leave the National Electricity Network with a shortfall in dispatchable generation capacity. Last December AGL confirmed it would close Liddell in 2022 and replace the coal plant with a mix of renewables, gas power for peak periods and battery storage, which prompted the energy market operator to warn that an additional 850 megawatts of dispatchable generation capacity would be needed in NSW if AGL failed to complete all three stages of its transition plan. The company’s decision to retire the coal plant defied extraordinary public pressure from the Turnbull government. Turnbull has been pushing AGL to prolong the operating life of Liddell until the Snowy Hydro 2.0 scheme becomes operational, earmarked for 2025. “Governments should be very reluctant to compulsory acquire assets but, let’s face it, it is an essential service,” Abbott told 2GB radio on Monday. “Electricity is not an optional extra in the modern world, it is an absolute essential service, and if a company is threatening an essential service it is up to the government to take appropriate action and keep that essential service going. “There has been a lot of jawboning of AGL but perhaps it is the time for strong-arming because we just cannot afford to lose Liddell.” Abbott made the comments during his Pollie Pedal charity ride as it passed through Victoria’s coal country. On Sunday, he had filmed a video of himself and Liberal MP Kevin Andrews standing outside the de-commissioned Hazelwood coal-fired power station in the La Trobe Valley to say wholesale power prices in Victoria had risen substantially since it had closed. “It’s a tragedy that this station closed,” he said in the video. “We can’t afford to lose more coal-fired power stations closing soon.” Turnbull hit back on Monday afternoon, reminding Abbott that the federal government was not in the business of building power stations. “This talk about strong-arming and nationalising assets, I mean that’s not the way we operate,” he told the Daily Telegraph’s Miranda Devine. “Nationalising assets is what the Liberal party was founded to stop governments doing actually. One of the great motivating factors behind the growth and the victory of Robert Menzies in 1949 was to stop the Labor party from nationalising the banks.” Asked if he thought he could win the next election, Turnbull said: “Yes, absolutely.” Dutton provided some support for Turnbull’s views on Monday, saying he was very reluctant to pick winners or nationalise any industries. “I expressed instinctive reluctance about us nationalising or being involved in or picking winners or investing tax payers money into particular projects,” he told Sky News. “It is a no, but with this caveat – there is market failure, there is concern within families and businesses who are trying to compete with companies in New Zealand or within our part of the world and further abroad, and they are paying some of the highest energy costs in the world. “I think Josh Frydenberg has come up with an elegant solution, and ultimately though, what we want to deliver … is affordable prices for households and businesses.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/09/deutsche-bank-ousts-british-ceo-after-two-week-boardroom-battle","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T07:46:25Z","webTitle":"Deutsche Bank ousts British CEO after two-week boardroom battle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/09/deutsche-bank-ousts-british-ceo-after-two-week-boardroom-battle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/09/deutsche-bank-ousts-british-ceo-after-two-week-boardroom-battle","fields":{"headline":"Deutsche Bank ousts British CEO after two-week boardroom battle","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Deutsche Bank has ousted its British chief executive, John Cryan, after years of losses and promoted the retail banking arm co-head to the top job. Following a two-week boardroom battle, Deutsche appointed Christian Sewing as chief executive on Monday with immediate effect. He vowed to take “tough decisions” to return the bank to profitability. Cryan, a Yorkshireman who took the helm in June 2015, will leave at the end of this month, two years before his contract was due to end. Deutsche has had three years of losses, and its net loss widened in the fourth quarter. Cryan has been criticised for being too slow in pushing through cost-cutting measures at the bank, which employs 100,000 people worldwide. As part of the boardroom shake-up, Garth Ritchie will become sole head of the corporate and investment bank. He had shared the role with Marcus Schenck, who earlier said he would leave the bank after the annual meeting on 24 May. Ritchie and Karl von Rohr, an executive board member, were appointed deputy CEOs. Sewing, 47, started working for Deutsche as an apprentice in 1989 and has held roles including head of group audit and management positions in risk. He told staff in a letter published on the bank’s website that he would thoroughly analyse how Deutsche wants to position its investment bank in a difficult market environment. “The priority is to leverage our strengths and to allocate our investments accordingly. And at the same time, we will look to free up capacity for growth by pulling back from those areas where we are not sufficiently profitable,” he said. Octavio Marenzi of the consultancy Opimas said there could be job losses in London as a result. “We can expect a much stronger emphasis on the domestic German market, with a focus on commercial and retail banking, and wealth management. It looks like the board of directors is capitulating on the investment banking front,” he said. “This will hit Deutsche Bank’s London presence particularly hard, where the bulk of its investment banking activity is based. We expect to see those activities right-sized or sold off, with attendant headcount reductions.” Deutsche’s chairman, Paul Achleitner, thanked Cryan for the “critical role” he played in his relatively short tenure as CEO, but said “we came to the conclusion that we need a new execution dynamic in the leadership of our bank”. Cryan took a €400,000 (£348,000) pay cut last year and was paid €3.4m. He and the rest of the 13-member management board waived their bonuses for 2017, but their collective pay still rose from €25.9m in 2016 to €29.2m. The UBS analysts Daniele Brupbacher and Mate Nemes said Sewing’s appointment sent out signals of stability and continuity, and underlined the importance of the German business. “Christian Sewing’s first statements do not indicate major strategic shifts, but a continued focus on costs and getting the structures right, particularly in investment banking, where we would expect further adjustments to the footprint. Also, a focus on rigorous and faster execution could be the result,” they said. They said the investment banking strategy remained the key strategic question mark and achilles heel of Deutsche."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/11/nauru-protesters-who-lost-appeal-rights-to-australias-high-court-have-bail-upheld","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T22:00:42Z","webTitle":"Nauru protesters who lost appeal rights to Australia's high court have bail upheld","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/11/nauru-protesters-who-lost-appeal-rights-to-australias-high-court-have-bail-upheld","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/11/nauru-protesters-who-lost-appeal-rights-to-australias-high-court-have-bail-upheld","fields":{"headline":"Nauru protesters who lost appeal rights to Australia's high court have bail upheld","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Three of the “Nauru 19” who had their appeal rights to the high court of Australia extinguished by the Nauru government, have had their bail continued by a Nauruan court. In a long-running case that has gone to the very operation of Nauru’s justice system and democracy, the three protesters also won the right to continue to speak about the case, after a government attempt to impose a gag order on them failed. John Jeremiah, Job Cecil and Josh Kepae were charged, and pleaded guilty to public order charges over a 2015 protest at the Nauruan parliament. They were part of a hundreds-strong protest against several MPs being banned from parliament for making comments critical of the government. In total, 19 people, including a former minister and former president of the country, were charged. The three were in the process of appealing their prison sentences to the high court of Australia – the final court of appeal in the Nauruan legal system – when the Nauru government unilaterally, and secretly, terminated that right of appeal. The Nauru parliament has not yet sat to consider new legislation to create a new appellate court. In a late-night sitting of the Nauru supreme court last week, the director of public prosecution argued for the immediate remand of the men in custody, telling the court that no appeal right existed anymore and that their sentences must therefore be served. But written submissions to the court from Australian barrister Stephen Lawrence argued the three were “now in the unfortunate and possibly unique situation of having had their existing appeal rights removed by service of a notice by the executive: the same entity who prosecutes them”. “The broader circumstance is that the Republic of Nauru now appears not to have an appellate court. These are truly extraordinary circumstances and this honourable court should respond in a way befitting a court of inherent jurisdiction to ensure justice and with a broad power to prevent injustice. “It is clear that the executive has intervened in these proceedings in a way gravely to the detriment of the applicants,” Lawrence said. Chief Justice Filimone Jitoko granted bail until June pending the establishment of a Nauruan appellate court. In an extraordinary development, the DPP also sought to impose an “immediate gag order” preventing the defendants, other accused, and lawyers in the case from making any comment to the media. The chief justice declined to grant the order. Mathew Batsiua is a former justice minister of Nauru and was one of the parliamentarians whose suspensions sparked the initial protests. He is also a member of the “Nauru 19” charged over the demonstration. He said the gag order application by the prosecution was especially concerning, and he welcome the court’s decision not to grant it. “Our Nauruan constitution protects the rights of free speech and open justice. The Waqa government has restricted these rights including by passing anti-public assembly laws and the like. I am calling on the executive government to respect free speech and the other rights of citizens in our country,” Batsiua said. The Nauruan government announced its plan to create a Nauruan court of appeal in February, as part of the country’s celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of its independence. The justice minister, David Adeang, said in March that the current cost of appeals to the high court of Australia were prohibitive. “At the moment, litigants contemplating further appeals to the high court are often discouraged both by the costs involved and the distance of a court in a foreign country. “This move also reflects our self-confidence as a nation state and reinforces our sovereignty.” Adeang said the government, under the president, Baron Waqa, was proud of the reforms it had brought to the nation’s justice system. “The former system which saw only one judge and one magistrate was open to corruption and cronyism, but we have created arguably the most transparent and accountable justice system in the Pacific, and have appointed several highly respected international judges to serve in our court.” But the government did not state publicly it had unilaterally terminated its appeal court agreement with Australia on 12 December, which meant that the high court no longer had jurisdiction to hear the appeal of the three protestors when it came before the court in March. Nauru’s criminal justice system has, for several years, been criticised as politically compromised and as failing to act independently of the government. Previous magistrates and judges have been summarily dismissed and deported from the island for making decisions the government has disagreed with."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/10/timothy-disken-from-coma-to-commonwealth-games-in-six-months","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T18:00:05Z","webTitle":"Timothy Disken: from coma to Commonwealth Games in six months | Kate O'Halloran","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/10/timothy-disken-from-coma-to-commonwealth-games-in-six-months","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/10/timothy-disken-from-coma-to-commonwealth-games-in-six-months","fields":{"headline":"Timothy Disken: from coma to Commonwealth Games in six months","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Just six months ago, Timothy Disken lay in a coma in Canada, with doctors unsure if he would survive emergency brain surgery. He had been due to compete at the para world swimming championships the day after. Disken suffers from hydrocephalus – the excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid on the brain. The tube he had fitted as a child to help with drainage of that fluid had suddenly broken – an unusual occurrence – and within eight hours of the first signs of a headache, he was comatose. “When I was about a month old, I had a stroke which caused the hydrocephalus,” Disken explains. “So they put a shunt in, which is effectively a valve with some tubing that drains the spinal fluid from my brain down into my stomach where it dissipates. Normally, if the system blocks, symptoms progress over three days. But because the tubing just broke, it was 12 hours from first signs of a small headache to emergency brain surgery.” Originally, the para swimming world championships had been scheduled for Mexcio, but earthquakes caused the tournament to be rescheduled. The Australian team then diverted to swim in Canada instead – something Disken is now grateful for. “It was kind of a blessing we didn’t go to Mexico,” he says. “Where we were in Canada, we were right next to a world-renowned neurosurgical hospital, so I was incredibly lucky.” Now, just six months later, Disken is a dual Commonwealth Games gold medallist, and has, at the time of writing, won the equal-highest number of individual golds of any Australian athlete competing on the Gold Coast. “I’ve surprised myself, to be honest, with how well I’ve bounced back,” he says. Humbly, Disken adds that he thinks he has “done well to be back where he is” given he has only been in training for four months post-operation. “I had to have four weeks out of the water, and another four weeks with no strenuous exercise after surgery, to allow the brain and everything else to heal. I’m pretty on top of the world to have performed as well as I have.” On top of the hydrocephalus, Disken was also born with a mild form of cerebral palsy, the combination of which he says can make him “fatigue very quickly”. He took up swimming as a boy to help him with the stiffness he experiences with cerebral palsy. “My left side is a lot weaker than my right, so there’s an imbalance in strokes like freestyle, breastroke and butterfly – the left side droops a lot more,” he says. “My legs are also weaker than my arms, so my right arm is the one that does most of the work. It stiffens up and gets tight a lot [as a result]. The swimming really helps to reduce the spasticity though, because you don’t have to contend with gravity. That’s why I started swimming in the first place. It’s fantastic for stiffness.” Thanks to the integration of para and other sports in this year’s Commonwealth Games program, Disken and other para athletes have finally been able to share their stories with a wider audience. Disken has also had plenty of support from the Australian crowds, with over 10,000 at each of his medal swims. “It has been really special,” he said. “This is my first Commonwealth Games and it’s a really unique experience to be able to able to walk around the village and just be a part of the same team [as the other athletes].” Disken says the experience has been “very inspiring” personally, and after the Games, wants to “better himself as a person as well as an athlete.” Currently, he is based in Canberra (at the Australian Institute of Sport), where he also volunteers as a teaching aide at a school for children with intellectual impairments. He hopes to continue in this line of work. “Eventually when I hang up the togs and move back home to my base in Melbourne, I want to work as a teaching aide for kids with disabilities,” he says, “just to give back to the community that has given me so much.” He has a particular school in mind, too: Glenallen School in Mount Waverley, where he completed his senior years of high school. His school were so proud of his Paralympic debut in Rio (where he won gold), that they named the high school pool after him – something Disken says ranks as even more special than being awarded an Order of Australia medal in 2017. “The naming of the school pool was particularly special to me given how much the school and all the students there mean to me, and how much they helped progress me as a person. I wouldn’t be where I am today without them.” Apart from that, the man they call “Disco” says he has plans to continue his love affair with music – possibly by taking up DJing. Disken has played piano for over 14 years, also taken up to help with stiffness, while his trademark is to walk out onto the pool deck with a pair of headphones blasting electronic dance music. “Music is a massive part of my life. The first 12 months of my life I was stuck in hospital, and music was used as a way to relax me and calm me down. So from day dot, I was using essentially using music as a tool. I’ve still got a ballon in my place in Melbourne that says “happy 100 days” [in hospital]. I think it was from a day in February that was just before my due date, because I was born at 24 weeks. It’s a really special momento that I look at every now and then to remind me how far I’ve come.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/09/fears-parts-of-world-longest-sea-bridge-are-floating-away","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T05:29:51Z","webTitle":"Fears parts of world's longest sea bridge are floating away","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/09/fears-parts-of-world-longest-sea-bridge-are-floating-away","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/09/fears-parts-of-world-longest-sea-bridge-are-floating-away","fields":{"headline":"Fears parts of world's longest sea bridge are floating away","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Authorities overseeing construction of the world’s longest sea bridge are working to allay concerns that parts of the massive structure are starting to drift away in the sea. Construction of the 55km bridge connecting Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China involves the building of artificial islands, new roads, and an undersea tunnel. Photos taken earlier this month showed a jagged shoreline around one of the islands as wave-absorbing concrete blocks appeared separated from the protective barrier and partly submerged. The photos have prompted concern about the structural integrity of the island, built by a Chinese contractor, which connects the bridge to an undersea tunnel. Hong Kong’s highway department sent its director of highways to the mainland city of Zhuhai to meet project officials, and has said it would monitor the works of the bridge to ensure “quality meets the relevant requirements”. In response to the release of the photos, officials at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Authority in Zhuhai said the placement of the blocks was by design. “We have our ways to do it, and you [Hong Kong] may have your ways to do it. You seem to presume that part of the structure had sunk … but it has been designed as such. We do not think there is any problem with that. There are rules and standards for us to follow,” said the authority’s deputy director Yu Lie, according to the Hong Kong-based paper, the South China Morning Post. Previously the bridge authority said the blocks, known as “dolosse” were purposely arranged in a “random manner” to alleviate pressure on the undersea tunnel. The project, now in construction for nine years, has been dogged by delays, lawsuits and budget overruns. The bridge, originally slated to open in 2016, is expected to be operational sometime this year, according to Hong Kong officials. Supporters of the project say that by connecting the three cities of Hong Kong, Macau and Zhuhai to China’s Pearl River Delta region, the area will emerge as a major economic hub. Critics say the bridge is just another way for China to tighten its hold over Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous special administrative region that has chafed under Beijing’s authority. The bridge authority also released photos of the island before and after the deadly Typhoon Hato last August to show that the blocks’ protective functions had worked. Hong Kong’s top official has also tried to assuage concerns. Chief executive Carrie Lam said on Friday that the “stability of construction works is a scientifically proven thing.” “I hope that just because some individuals have taken photos or made some comments, that everyone will not jump in and doubt the project’s design,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/apr/09/commonwealth-games-2018-day-five-weightlifting-gymnastics-shooting-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T12:21:23Z","webTitle":"Commonwealth Games day five: Simbine stuns Blake in 100m, pain for Philip and Peaty – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/apr/09/commonwealth-games-2018-day-five-weightlifting-gymnastics-shooting-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/apr/09/commonwealth-games-2018-day-five-weightlifting-gymnastics-shooting-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"Commonwealth Games day five: Simbine stuns Blake in 100m, pain for Philip and Peaty – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Well, what an exciting finish to day five of the Commonwealth Games. Australia have had another productive session, collecting plenty of medals in the pool, there was a squash final to savour for England’s James Willstrop, Adam Peaty being stunned by Cameron van Der Burgh and it finished with the surprise of Yohan Blake failing to produce in the men’s 100m final. Thanks for reading. Bye. Akani Simbine rips away from the field to win in 10.03sec! Henricho Bruintjies, another South African, takes silver and Jamaica’s Yohan Blake, who was the favourite, started poorly out of the blocks and had to settle for bronze after making up for it with a strong finish. He just about saw off Nigeria’s Seye Ogunlewe, who looked like he was going to finish third for much of the race. Simbine can’t quite believe it. He was a bit of an outsider - but he’s a 100m champion now! The men’s 100m final is about to begin. Usain Bolt is the favourite. Chad Le Clos is too strong for the field in the men’s 100m butterfly final. England’s James Guy is more than happy to settle for silver after swimming 51.31sec to 51.50sec from Australia’s Grant Irvine. “That’s shocking,” England’s Asha Philip says after finishing fourth in the 100m final. “On to the next one. I’ve just got to get over these hiccups.” It’s the first gold for a female athlete at the Commonwealth Games! Michelle-Lee Ahye is the sprinter who’s made history for her country. Jamaica’s Christania Williams had a poor start but recovered to take silver ahead of her team-mate, Gayon Evans. Asha Philip finished fourth. It’s almost time for the women’s 100m final. Can England’s Asha Philip get herself on the podium? It’s all happening! Alys Thomas has won the women’s 200m butterfly final, beating two Australians, Laura Taylor and Emma McKeown. Tomas Walsh was too strong for Nigeria’s Chukwuebuka Enekwechi and Canada’s Tim Nedow. Uganda’s Stella Chesang has also won the women’s 10,000m final. This time it’s Tatjana Schoenmaker in the women’s 100m butterfly. Canada’s Kierra Smith takes silver, pushing Australia’s Georgia Bohl into bronze. “I’ve been off my best all week,” Adam Peaty says. “But I’m enjoying it, so that’s what counts.” Cameron Van der Burgh had something to say all right! The South African swims his heart out during the men’s 50m breaststroke final, even though Adam Peaty’s on his tail throughout, and he holds off the favourite in a photo finish! Van der Burgh swam in 26.58sec - Peaty finished in 26.62sec. England’s James Wilby took bronze. The men’s 50m breaststroke final is 10 minutes away. It’s Adam Peaty’s gold medal to lose, you’d imagine. Unless you’re Cameron Van der Burgh. Sophie Pascoe takes the women’s SB9 100m breaststroke final! The Australian, Paige Leonhardt and Madeline Scott, take silver and bronze respectively. The men were too strong for Nigeria in the team final, winning 3-0. The Guardian’s James Willstrop has done it at last, a gold medal his to cherish in his final Commonwealth Games, New Zealand’s Paul Coll no match for him! What a proud day for this newspaper! That’s the story, isn’t it? There’s been another gold for Australia in the pool: Matthew Levy edged out South Africa’s Christian Sadie and Singapore’s Wei Soongh Toh in the men’s S7 50m final. India’s Muhammed Anas Yahiya wins the third men’s 400m semi-final. Jamaica’s Rusheen McDonald is second and Trinidad &amp; Tobago’s Machel Cenadio is third in 46.19sec. Nigeria’s Chidi Okezie wins the second 400m men’s semi-final. Michael Mathieu of the Bahamas is second and Kimorie Shearman of St Vincent and the Grenadines is third in 45.92sec. It’s 1-0 to England’s James Willstrop in his squash final against New Zealand’s Paul Coll. Shock! Botswana’s Isaac Makwala has won the first men’s 400m semi-final. Jamaica’s Javon Francis finishes second. Australia’s Steven Solomon was third in 45.55sec. Ariane Titmus dominates the women’s 800m freestyle final, and her compatriots Jessica Ashwood and Kiah Melverton take silver and bronze respectively. Melverton was almost pipped to third by England’s Holly Hibbott. It’s Hollie Arnold with a world record effort of 44.43m in the F46 javelin final! England have taken bronze in the men’s team table tennis, beating Singapore 3-0. It’s an Australian 1-2-3 in the men’s 200m backstroke final. Mitch Larkin takes the gold, Bradley Woodward takes silver and Josh Beaver takes the bronze. England’s Luke Greenbank finishes fourth. The men’s 200m backstroke final is about to begin... It was a brilliant comeback from England’s Sarah-Jane Perry, but she’ll have to settle for silver. Joelle King wins the fifth game 11-8 and with it she takes the gold! Joelle King was 5-0 up in the fifth game. Her lead’s been whittled down by Sarah-Jane Perry, though. It’s 8-6... You have to hand it to England’s Sarah-Jane Perry. She was 2-0 down to New Zealand’s Joelle King in the women’s squash final, but she’s just won the fourth game 13-11 and they’re all square at two games all! The athletics session is about to resume. Remember, we’ve got 100m finals later. The swimming is also set to begin soon. It’s on! Sarah-Jane Perry wins the third game 11-6. Are they going the distance? England’s Sarah-Jane Perry is fighting back in the third game of the squash final... Honk! Honk! Honk! It’s finished Australia 78-32 England in Pool A in the women’s basketball. It’s 2-0 to Joelle King. New Zealand’s squash hope took a less dramatic second game 11-8 and Sarah-Jane Perry is staring up a mountain now. They’re deep into the second game, by the way, and Joelle King has a slender advantage over Sarah-Jane Perry. In the women’s squash, England’s Sarah-Jane Perry is taking on New Zealand’s Joelle King in the gold medal match. King won a tight first game 16-14. England are still getting hammered in the women’s basketball. Make it stop, make it stop! Australia are showing no mercy. It’s Australia 49-20 England in that women’s basketball match. Two quarters left. Or one half. On the BBC, we watch highlights of a boxing bout that finished a few hours ago. Over in the women’s basketball, Australia are giving England a bit of a lesson in Pool A. They lead 28-12 in the first quarter. It’s agony for the English sprinter! He tweaked an adductor muscle in his semi-final and has been advised not to aggravate the injury. That’s got to hurt. England’s Nile Wilson has done it in the men’s horizontal bar, a score of 14.533 enough to earn him the main prize. Canada’s Cory Paterson is second and it’s, er, a one-three for England, with James Hall in bronze. It’s not enough from Alice Kinsella. The women’s floor final is over and the big gong goes to Australia’s Alexandra Eade. Silver goes to Latalia Bevan, bronze to Canada’s Shallon Olsen. Though the Canadian coaches seem to be mounting some kind of protest with the judges. It seems they also think that Elisabeth Black, who’s in fourth place, should also be in the medal positions. But the inquiry has been rejected! The result stands! Canada will have to settle for one medal. What drama! England’s Alice Kinsella, who won gold in the women’s balance beam, is closing out the women’s floor final here. She’ll need a big performance to clamber into the top three. Scotland’s Frank Baines closes out the men’s horizontal bar final with a stylish performance. His effort did contain a minor error, though, and that’s enough to keep him off the podium. The margins are that tight. Thanks, Richard. On my television at the moment, we’re watching the women’s floor exercise final. There’s lots of smiling. In the women’s balance beam final, there’s been a gold for Ingerlund’s Alice Kinsella, silver for Australia’s Georgia-Rose Brown and a bronze for Ingerlund’s Kelly Simm. Well, as in every good relay there comes a time to pass on the baton – no pressure obviously, but watch carefully in the next few seconds to see if years of training is about to be poured down the drain. Richard Parkin here in Australia signing off, but I’ll leave you in the more than capable hands of Jacob Steinberg. A massive evening in store with none other than Yohan Blake in action in the men’s 100m final. Can anyone stop him? Reboil the kettle, settle in and find out first, here. Two big results in gymnastics and shooting has seen an unlikely mover up the overall leader board, with Cyprus grabbing back-to-back golds to secure their third and fourth majors of the meet, leaving the tiny mediterranean nation on track for its best ever Commonwealth Games. Gymnast Marios Georgiou has continued his golden Games, picking up his second win, this time in the men’s parallel bars event by the narrowest of margins to relegate England’s Nile Wilson to silver, and Scotland’s Frank Baines to bronze. Both Wilson and Georgiou finished with a score of 14.533 but for the second time in as many days an English athlete has lost out on a tie-break, with Georgiou’s execution score of 8.533 just edging his opponent. Elsewhere, in the men’s skeet shooting final compatriot Georgios Achilleos has edged Wales’ Ben Llewellin by one shot, 57 to 56, to take gold, with Northern Ireland’s Gareth McAuley (no, not the centre back) finishing with the bronze. Llewellin hit 35 marks in a row before wobbling with two consecutive misses to hand the advantage to the Cypriot, who held his nerve to close. Around the grounds Some bad news filtering in for Wales in the athletics, with confirmation that former world 400m champion Dai Greene has withdrawn from the Games with a hamstring injury. Greene won the European and Commonwealth titles in 2010 and was crowned world champion a year later in Daegu, South Korea. “I am really disappointed to miss out on what would have been my fourth Commonwealth Games,” the 31-year-old said. “It’s been an emotional 18 months and this is hard to take at such a late stage.” A better result for the Welsh in the lawn bowls with confirmation that men’s pair Daniel Salmon and Marc Wyatt have clinched Wales’ first gold medal on the bowls rink as they fought back from a 5-1 deficit to beat defending champions Paul Foster and Alexander Marshall of Scotland, 12-10. As mentioned earlier, the Cook Islands’ pair Aidan Zittersteijn and Taiki Paniani took bronze with a 17-11 win over Malta’s Shaun Parnis and Brendan Aquilina to grab the nation’s first ever Commonwealth Games. And, finally a boilover in the women’s 75kg boxing – where favourite England’s Natasha Gale has crashed out, going down 30-26 in an unanimous points decision across all five judges to Australian hopeful Caitlin Parker. Some big news coming out of Carrara, with confirmation that New Zealand’s Laurel Hubbard – for many the handsdown favourite in the women’s 90+kg category – has withdrawn from the event with injury. Chasing her own Commonwealth record of 132kg in the snatch component, Hubbard dramatically injured her elbow, with the transgender athlete unable to return for the clean and jerk element. Disaster for Hubbard, but it opens the field up with everyone now chasing Samoa’s Feagaiga Stowers for the gold. Meanwhile in the 90kg category Australia’s Kaity Fassina has finished with a silver medal after a stunning final clean and jerk lift of 128kg. Under tough competition from Cameroon’s Clementine Noumbissi the Tasmanian posted a 104kg lift in the snatch to lead the division, with Noumbissi unable to match in the clean and jerk, and resigned to settle for the bronze. Fiji’s Eileen Cikamatana then joined the competition knowing exactly what she needed to beat, and made short work of a remarkable 130kg first attempt to secure the gold, just the Pacific nation’s fourth of all-time. And in the 90+kg category it has been Stowers who’s swept the field, courtesy her 10kg advantage over the rest of the field following the snatch component. Nauru’s Charisma Amoe-Tarrant and England’s Emily Campbell are now locked neck and neck for the silver and bronze. A remarkable final lift of 139kg from Campbell – a whopping 10kg above her previous mark has put her second; Amoe-Tarrant will now need to lift 142kg to grab the silver. And she’s stuck it! Eighteen-year-old Amoe Tarrant with silver for Nauru, Campbell takes the bronze; Stowers of Samoa walks away with the gold. In a discipline that’s been largely dominated by England and Canada at these Games finally some good news for fans of Australian gymnastics, with Chris Remkes posting two very impressive runs to land the gold medal in the men’s vault final. Having qualified third behind the impressive English duo of Courtney Tulloch and Dominick Cunningham, the South Australian stuck both his efforts, with the judges rewarding Remkes with scores of 9.266 and 9.133, as both Remkes and Tulloch elected to take on difficulty levels of 5.600 for both runs. It’s validation for Remkes’ hard work and sacrifice, with the Philippines-born and Adelaide-raised athlete electing to move to Canberra four years ago to aid his training. Not a move anyone ever makes lightly, so congratulations Chris and the training program at the AIS! Tulloch and Cunningham finished with the silver and bronze respectively, with the former narrowly missing his third gold of the Games. Netball – Australia v Fiji It’s a comfortable start for the Diamonds in their fourth Pool A group encounter with Fiji. With six minutes to play in the second quarter the gold-medal favourites have already raced to a 46-12 lead. Fiji are yet to record a win at these Games and it appears both Australia and Jamaica are nicely poised to take the qualifying spots irrespective of what transpires in their final game showdown on Wednesday. As mentioned earlier the real interest here will be what happens in Pool B as England and New Zealand are still yet to play each other, with the Kiwis still presumably reeling from their shock loss to Malawi yesterday. It all matters come the knockout stages as goal difference could yet play a factor in determining the semi-final pairings. Women’s weightlifting – possible injury And back to Carrara, it’s becoming apparent that it could be a two-horse race here with New Zealand’s Laurel Hubbard seemingly in a league of her own alongside Samoa’s Feagaiga Stowers, with the rest of the field pinned around the 100kg mark. Emily Campbell of England was successful with her third lift of 103kg to move into the bronze medal position at the conclusion of the snatch component. Stowers, this remarkable woman from Samoa, just 17 years old, then opened with a successful lift of 108kg, before Hubbard allowed the bar to move to 120kg before she made her first attempt of the meet. The New Zealander paused, took her time before rising, before flashing a terrific smile of relief once the green light signalled. Stowers attempted to go with her, but was unsuccessful at 120kg. Hubbard then pushed to 127kg but couldn’t quite stick it. With her third and final lift though she raised the bar further to 132kg with an eye on her Commonwealth record of 131kg. The lift started nicely; Hubbard appeared to have the leg strength but a slight over-correction took a potentially disastrous turn, with the 2017 World Championship silver medallist now facing an anxious wait to see if a potential elbow injury has put her out of the competition! A horrific turn here, we wait to see how this now plays out. What a nail-biter! It’s finished 18-16 after fifteen ends with the lead oscillating several times, but the host nation have held off South Africa to claim lawn bowls gold. The Australians failed to score in four consecutive ends as they looked to have squandered a comfortable 9-3 lead, with South Africa bringing it back to 9-10. But that power-drive from Natasha Scott (see earlier) proved a pivotal moment, as the local girls steadied the ship winning three consecutive ends. “It was pretty exciting game and to get over the line at the end was unreal”, said Scott, with team-mate Carla Krizanic paying tribute to the team’s closeknit nature. “We’re a solid team that’s played a fair bit together over the past three years ... the previous experience as a four has definitely helped”, said Krizanic. Congratulations, Australia has its first gold of the day. Weightlifting - women’s 90kg and 90+kg finals We’re in the early stages over at the Carrara Sports and Leisure Centre, where the strong women of Commonwealth weightlifting are strutting their stuff. There will be many eyes tracking this one keenly following the participation of Laurel Hubbard the transgender weightlifter from New Zealand who’s inclusion has divided opinion. Commonwealth Games Federation chief executive David Grevemberg has called on Hubbard’s country to get behind the weightlifter. “I hope all New Zealanders ... would get behind one of their athletes that has gone through the pathway to achieve greatness, and within the rules of the sport,” Grevemberg said. But it hasn’t prevented other nations’ federations from criticising, with Samoa’s Jerry Wallwork deeming her inclusion “unfair” to other female weightlifters. Nauru’s Charisma Amoe-Tarrant has just made a clean opening lift of 98kg, but no such luck for England’s Emily Campbell who has faltered on 99kg. Local hope Deborah Acason, née Lovely, has just got the crowd roaring with a successful 99kg lift. You might remember the name from the Melbourne 2006 Games, where she took home gold in the 75kg category. Great to see Deborah still competing at the very top. Latest medal tally And with those medals earlier in shooting, weightlifting and bowls, here’s how we stand: India move back onto the podium courtesy Jitu Rai’s gold in the men’s 10m air pistol. The subcontinental giants have been the big movers thus far, grabbing one gold, two silver and two bronze in the four events thus reconciled today. Lawn bowls – women’s four gold medal match, Australia v South Africa Over at the Broadbeach Bowls Club we’ve got an absolute humdinger going down in the fight for bowls gold in the women’s four. We’re currently in the 12th end and it’s Australia leading a fast-finishing South Africa. It was nicely set up with RSA looking at one or two here, but a power-drive from Natasha Scott has blasted an Australian ball into the prime spot. A knowledgeable crowd responds appreciatively, as the local team take a point and edge to a 15-12 lead. Don’t look away from this one but, this is set to go down to the wire. Or right to the turf. Insert bowls-appropriate analogy here. Netball – Pool B, England v Wales Let’s go first to the Gold Coast Exhibition and Convention Centre, where there’s very much an exhibition going down with Tracey Neville’s women riding roughshod over their geographical neighbours – it’s currently 79-25 with around six minutes to play. So avert your eyes if you’re in a Welsh/Anglo bordertown and partial to leeks, or at least pretend you’re from Chester not Wrexham today. It’s a more emphatic performance from one of the favourites following a nervy test against Uganda in their second pool match. They survived that one 55-49, but face a big show down with New Zealand in their next outing – their antipodean rivals no doubt smarting after a shock loss to Malawi. Tl;dr – it’s bubbling nicely for England in Pool B thus far. Kia ora koutou – wherever this finds you around this glorious Commonwealth of ours! If you missed last night’s action it was another bumper for Australia on track and in pool; the redemption of Matthew Glaetzer leading the way. There’s a very lovely feature on the oldest female competitor at the Games, NZ’s Sue Curran. And a more sombre but incredibly important counterpoint to the national euphoria surrounding the Games. There’s been early action already today including Cook Islands first ever Commonwealth Games medal, with lawn bowls pair Taiki Paniani and Aidan Zittersteijn etching their names in local folklore with bronze. Wales and Scotland took gold and silver respectively. Congratulations too to Australia’s Kerry Bell who’s grabbed a silver in the men’s 10m air pistol, with Samoa grabbing gold in the men’s 105kg weightlifting thanks to Sanele Mao’s combined lift of 360kg. Phwaor. Here’s what’s still to come on day five. Remember, all times are local – the Gold Coast is GMT +10:00 and EST +14:00.

No other country, not even Germany or Great Britain upon which the ludicrously misnamed “Great War” had a far more profound impact, have spent with such reckless abandon to commemorate dead soldiers. Having spent more than half a billion dollars on commemorating Anzac since 2014 alone, Australia now apparently has a plan, needless and reckless in my view, to blow another $500m – this time to renovate the Australian War Memorial. But wait, there’s more: Australia will this month open the $100m Sir John Monash interpretive centre at Villers-Bretonneux in Northern France – an arguably unnecessary museum dedicated to the already duly commemorated 46,000 Australians who died on Europe’s western front during the first world war. Add it up. From 2014 to 2028, when the (still sketchy) proposed war memorial addition would be funded, Australia will have committed or spent at least $1.1bn (in today’s terms) on new war commemoration projects, presumably excluding recurrent funding of the memorial itself. We should honour and never forget our war dead, of course. But this money would surely be far better spent on the living, not least the many hundreds of veterans, their partners and children, whose suffering is compounded by their struggles to win medical acknowledgment of, and government compensation for, service-related injury. The war memorial plan, apparently hatched by AWM director, former defence minister Brendan Nelson, seems to tug at the patriotic heartstrings of political bipartisanship in order to create a vast underground complex at the 76-year-old memorial in which to display hardware like planes and helicopters, and to tell the story of current military operations. The memorial already has a huge warehouse in the outer-Canberra suburb of Mitchell where some of its larger items are kept and displayed to the public on open days. An apparent justification for the investment appears to be that only some 4% of the memorial’s collection is ever displayed; this is standard or above average for major cultural institutions where only minuscule proportions of hard collections can ever be concurrently displayed. Indeed, the trend in current museological practice emphasises digitisation, often ahead of bricks and mortar expansion, to democratise access to larger items and the things that are rarely displayed. It also comes as Australia’s national institutions, including the National Library of Australia and the National Archives, the National Museum of Australia, the national gallery, portrait gallery and the Museum of Australian Democracy, have faced redundancies and service constraints due to budget cuts and annual “efficiency dividends”. A curious tone underscores the soft public announcement late last week, through the ABC, of the planned expansion of the war memorial. Such an ambitious, expensive cultural or infrastructure plan would ordinarily be the subject of ministerial announcement as well as considerable public and political debate (witness the recent controversy in New South Wales over since modified plans to spend $2bn replacing sports arenas). But federal political bipartisanship regarding this one seems to be safely assumed. As Nelson told the ABC, “As a nation we have a responsibility perhaps to do better and in this regard we have received very strong support from our government, supported by our opposition.” On the potential cost of the venture, Nelson was quoted, “Whatever the cost is, as one man said to me, ‘We’ve already paid. We’ve paid in blood, and whatever the government spends on the Australian War Memorial ... will never be enough’.” To publicly challenge such emotive signalling for public funding is to run the risk of being portrayed as heretical, even treasonous, of course. So be it. The memorial plan coincides with a parliamentary committee inquiry into all aspects of funding for the national institutions where many senior executives rankle at the persuasiveness of Anzac when it comes to matters of dollars and sense. Reverence for Anzac is, of course, nothing new. What is, is the extent of its pervasiveness. As Donald Horne observed in his totemic 1964 polemic The Lucky Country, “When Anzac Day (the Australian folk festival) is commemorated on a Sunday the protests of the churches are likely to be met by the counter-claim that Anzac Day is more important ...” Horne was as unintentionally prescient on this as he was about much else. Official Anzac commemoration has, especially since the 1980s, grown disproportionately compared with other momentous and more formative episodes of Australian happening (especially frontier conflict which, by some accounts, claimed as many Indigenous lives as members of the 1st Australian Imperial force). Incidentally, there is still no official monument to frontier war in the national capital, Canberra, whose built official landscape supposedly symbolises the national story. I’ve written recently about how the insidious militarisation of Australian consciousness has come to monopolise our culture and national identity. And there can be little doubt, though many of us continue to argue the alternatives, that Anzac, with its rhetoric around “spirit”, “sacrifice” and the “fallen” (never the dead or the killed) has become Australia’s quasi-religion and the memorial our secular shrine. Traditionally, at the start of recent parliamentary years, many federal MPs worship together in an interdenominational religious service. In recent years they have also begun attending in ever greater numbers a service at the war memorial on the same day. Anzac has inveigled into Australian consciousness, national identity and culture like nothing else and in a fashion that would surprise, bemuse and perhaps anger many living and dead veterans. The proposed $500m expansion of the war memorial might yet be the ultimate example of how thoroughly it monopolises Australian politics too.

At stake was the fate of the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, whom international media love to describe in dramatic, but ultimately euphemistic, terms such as “Europe’s bad boy” or “Europe’s flame thrower”. Based on the near-final results, Orbán’s Fidesz-KDNP “coalition” won a staggering 48.9% of the vote, up by 4%, and a new constitutional majority of 134 seats. They were followed, at a considerable distance, by the Movement for a Better Hungary (Jobbik), the notorious far-right party that had campaigned on a relatively moderate anti-Fidesz-corruption platform, with 19.3% and 25 seats – a loss of almost 1%, but a gain of two seats. The centrist coalition vote was split over three parties this time. The Hungarian Socialist party–Dialogue for Hungary (MSZP) coalition got 12.25% and 20 seats, whereas the Democratic Coalition (DK) got 5.54% and nine seats. In 2014, the two had contested together under the misnomer “Unity” and had achieved almost 8% and nine seats more. The nominally Green “Politics Can Be Different” (LMP), finally, got 6.9% of the vote and eight seats, a gain of 1.6% and three seats. Orbán has been in power for eight straight years, during which he first transformed Hungary from a troubled liberal democracy into an illiberal kleptocracy, before taking on the European status quo, and in particular German chancellor Angela Merkel, on a broad variety of issues, but most notably immigration policies. He regained power in 2010 with a relatively moderate conservative agenda centered on a vague program of change. He used his two-thirds majority to change the constitution, appoint cronies to each and every new and old political institution, and lay the groundwork for a long-term reign. His electoral engineering paid off in 2014, when his Fidesz-KDNP “coalition” maintained its constitutional majority on the basis of the votes of “Hungarians abroad” – Hungarian speakers in bordering countries, whom Orbán had offered Hungarian citizenship, for which they rewarded him by voting almost unanimously for Fidesz-KDNP. Since then Orbán has further consolidated his “illiberal state” at home, while becoming the most influential voice of the radical right in Europe abroad. Putting traditional radical right leaders like Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders in his shadow – both openly support him and Orbán has met several radical right leaders, including Wilders, who has a Hungarian wife – Orbán has adopted all the far-right conspiracy theories and has build his campaign and regime on them. Over the past years the Orbán government has paid tens of millions of dollars for nativist campaigns against immigrants, including a failed referendum, as well as the European Union. Barring a few remaining outlets, the Hungarian media has been made into a propaganda machine of the regime, bombarding the citizens with terrifying stories about (Muslim) immigrants, while staying silent on the massive corruption scandals surrounding the Orbán kleptocracy. Polls had consistently shown that this was successful and they turned out to have been largely accurate. Many in the opposition had believed that if turnout was high, Fidesz would be vulnerable, and some delusional opposition leaders even openly spoke of forming a government. But while turnout was indeed high across the country, the highest in this century, it was up both in the pro-government countryside and in the pro-opposition capital. The net effect seems to have been marginal or possibly even strengthening Fidesz. Hungary has an electoral system with the highest disproportionality in terms of translating votes into seats of all the EU member states – a well-engineered outcome from the previous election reform, but there is no denying that Orbán is by far the most popular politician in the country. Similarly, while the OSCE published a “damning verdict” on the elections, which might have been “free” but were certainly not “fair”, the opposition was mainly defeated by its own incompetence. The price that they, and their supporters, will continue to pay for this could become even higher. In his last campaign speech, Orbán explained to his supporters what was at stake: “For us Hungary comes first; for them George Soros and the power he offers comes first. Because for power and money they are capable of anything.” In a previous Facebook post, he had already warned that “we must stop any organization that promotes illegal migration for ideological or other reasons that have no democratic mandate”. On election night, the secretary of state for public diplomacy and relations, Zoltán Kovács, made clear that this was not just election talk. Quite ominously, he told the website Index.hu that “the loopholes still present in the legal system which allow unauthorized organizations to rummage around, so to speak, in the doings of political life, in political decision-making, need to be closed.” Despite the Orbán government’s obsessive nativist rhetoric about saving the Hungarian nation, Hungary has the second-worst negative population growth in the EU. The country has a net loss of one person every 16 minutes. While this sharp decline of the Hungarian population predates Orbán’s rule, his government policies to boost the native population by financially rewarding (large) families have not made a dent in the national decline. In fact, the situation is worse today than it was when he took over in 2010. And the net figures hide an even bigger tragedy, the extraordinary brain drain of highly educated, younger people, who move to the west. His re-election will undoubtedly lead to a new exodus and will strengthen the opinion of many previous expats that there is nothing to return to. This is Hungary’s lost generation, which will haunt the country even after Fidesz is finally ousted. In short, Orbán’s Hungary is not the future of Europe, it is its declining, nationalist past. It is a country with an ageing and ever decreasing population, turned in on itself, scared of everything outside, and increasingly inside, its borders. Ironically, it mainly survives because of the very future it rejects, ie subsidies by the much-maligned European Union.

He was told to stop but refused, and the situation escalated. By the time it was over, Dungay was dead. When the 26-year-old Dunghutti man refused to stop eating the biscuits, corrective services staff called the Immediate Action Team, which specialises in cell extractions. Dungay was given two minutes to comply with the order before the IAT rushed his cell, manoeuvred him face-down on to his mattress and handcuffed him behind his back. Dungay told officers he couldn’t breathe, to which one responded: “If you can talk, you can breathe.” He was picked up, moved to another cell and held face-down again. Officers positioned themselves on top of him, pulling down his green prison uniform pants and calling for a nurse, who injected 10 milligrams of the sedative midazolam. Then they retreated to the doorway. Moments later, Dungay stopped breathing. Staff from the mental health unit and paramedics tried to resuscitate Dungay for almost an hour, but his death was declared at 3.42pm. Dungay’s death is subject to an inquest scheduled for July. The initial autopsy report was unable to determine the cause of death, but found a series of “abnormalities” could have contributed to it. The autopsy found evidence that compression of Dungay’s torso and neck while he was held down could have contributed to asphyxia, which “may result in hypoxia and/or cardiac arrest”. The report also noted the short time between the midazolam injection and Dungay’s death, but because intramuscular injections typically have a slow onset, it “may have been unlikely to have had a significant effect”. Further expert assessment was recommended. At least one other death in custody has been directly attributed to the combination of midazolam and restraint, and two others associated with it. There are many more individually attributed to prone physical restraint or to midazolam used during a chemical restraint procedure. Guardian Australia has spoken to a dozen experts and medical practitioners about the circumstances of Dungay’s death. Many said the combination of prone physical restraint and chemical restraint carried a life-threatening risk if not done properly. Police said Dungay’s death was not suspicious and a corrective services investigation found no criminal negligence, but his family and supporters have continued to protest. “It didn’t even look like my son’s body. His face was caved in, bruises all around, stitches here and there,” says his mother, Leetona Dungay. “I had a feeling then, I knew that over-aggressive force was used on my son by the correctional services officers.” Dungay grew up in Kempsey on New South Wales’s mid-north coast. His mother has fond memories of his younger years, especially his love of rugby league. His sister Christine Dungay remembers her younger brother falling in with the wrong crowd. He was in and out of juvenile homes for a while, she tells Guardian Australia, but mostly kept out of trouble until he was arrested and convicted of assault, aggravated attempted sexual intercourse and party to robbery in 2009. From a young age diabetes played a defining role in Dungay’s life. When his blood sugar levels spiked his behaviour changed radically, Leetona says. “That’s why I think they diagnosed him with schizophrenia.” Dungay was admitted to the mental health unit after suffering psychosis a month before his death. According to a Justice Health report obtained by Guardian Australia, the unit’s staff documented perceptual disturbances, aggressive behaviour and a number of violent episodes – the last of which culminated in the confrontation that ended his life. Members of Dungay’s immediate family have watched the footage of his death as part of a review of evidence submitted to the inquest. His mother still has nightmares. “I have flashes that I’m trying to fight back for my son,” she says. Dr Hugh Grantham, professor of paramedics at Flinders University, says midazolam’s common side effects may be exacerbated by prone physical restraint. “The key element is planning – ensuring that there are adequate numbers of experienced personnel supported by appropriate monitoring and emergency equipment,” he says. If the people carrying out the procedure aren’t adequately trained, or don’t have the right equipment, backup or support, “then that could be a potentially difficult and dangerous situation”. Other experts variously described the combination as a “potentially dangerous situation” and “scientifically consistent with being able to kill someone”. The Justice Health investigation found staff involved in Dungay’s death “had not been involved in prior emergency response incidents and have very little primary healthcare experience”. It also found discrepancies in understanding among staff on “what nursing staff should do following the administration of enforced medication”, with an unclear demarcation of responsibility between them and corrections staff. According to the report, the nurses attending Dungay’s restraint said they “did not feel safe going back into the cell despite the IAT presence and the patient stating that he could not breathe”. An addendum said the department would “review and amend facility policy as necessary to clearly communicate what the staff roles and responsibilities are”. Justice Health has since detailed multiple training programs for staff since 2016, including in responding to and coordinating care during an emergency response, and training all nurses to take on the role of “team leader” during an emergency. “Emergency response simulation and team leader training is ongoing for all staff in Long Bay Hospital,” a spokeswoman said. “In addition, all clinical staff in the Hospital undergo annual mandatory training in Basic Life Support and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).” Justice Health implemented training for medical officers in “emergency sedation, seclusion and restraint” this year, and is currently reviewing its policy on medications used in emergency sedation. Although midazolam is safely used in various settings, experts say monitoring a patient’s airways after the administration of the drug is crucial because one of the most common effects is to slow – or stop – breathing. Current Justice Health guidelines, last updated in 2016, simultaneously tell medical staff to remove themselves from the vicinity – which the nurses involved in Dungay’s restraint did – and to continue monitoring the patient’s health and airways. A medical emergency response team, trained to deal with incidents such as Dungay’s, was disbanded some years before his death. Investigators were “unable to ascertain” why. Dr Peg LeVine, an associate professor of psychiatry at Monash Health, says recommending changes to department policy is not enough. “If indeed a nurse was instructed to inject 10mg of midazolam to a man positioned on his stomach with officers sitting on him, and knew there was no way to monitor their patient and they complied, then all medical people in attendance of this behaviour are reportable to [the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency] and it requires an investigation.” Guidelines for the safe use of chemical and physical restraint vary between states and institutional sectors. After the death in custody of William Wallace in 2008, South Australian paramedics were given new guidelines recommending the prevention of the combined use of midazolam and prone physical restraint. Months before Dungay’s death NSW emergency departments changed their preferred sedative for rapid tranquilisation (the term for the procedure used on Dungay) to droperidol in response to feedback from frontline staff. NSW health department guidelines state that patients should not be held in a prone position for more than two to three minutes, and emergency room guidelines for rapid tranquilisation procedures recommend the team leader closely monitors the patient’s airway and physical condition. Professor Bernadette McSherry, who is conducting a review of restraint legislation, says there is a lack of nationally agreed definitions of restraint, and of monitoring in corrections facilities. “Traditionally we don’t have any mechanism for independent oversight of what actually happens in these places,” she says. “Unfortunately, people don’t know that [restraint] occurs. And I think it’s only when you have a death … that this gets highlighted.” At least one other person, Shaun Coolwell, has died after being physically restrained and administered midazolam. Paramedics and police responded to an incident at his sister’s residence on the outskirts of Brisbane. Coolwell was held in the prone position and administered midazolam after an altercation with police. He later died in Logan hospital. The coroner has yet to report his findings after an inquest in March into Coolwell’s death. In 2010, Lyji Vaggs, an Indigenous man from Townsville, died in custody after being physically restrained and administered midazolam as well as an antipsychotic. The coroner’s report, as in Dungay’s case, noted the short period between midazolam being administered and Vaggs showing signs of distress. “A short time after the midazolam was administered – witnesses variously estimate the period to be two to five or six minutes – Mr Vaggs suddenly stopped struggling, calling out and breathing,” it said. Most experts called during the inquest agreed the drug played some role in Vaggs’s death, although there was some disagreement about the extent. The coroner ruled Vaggs’s death was “a result of the combined effects of the drugs administered to him and the length and nature of the restraint to which he was subject”. In 2008, William Wallace died in custody in circumstances that also involved the combination of midazolam and restraint. But the coroner found “whilst connection between the administration of midazolam and Mr Wallace’s collapse is a standout feature of the circumstances, it is simply impossible to say that on a balance of probabilities it had made any contribution at all”. Coolwell, Vaggs and Dungay were all Indigenous men and Vaggs and Dungay had also been diagnosed with schizophrenia. “An Aboriginal-identified person is vulnerable enough in our western-centric culture,” LeVine says. “One’s social status is reduced even more by being labelled as socially deviant or mentally ill. All those social statuses make them more vulnerable to trauma experiences – and in the case of medical restraint, they have no say in those decisions that lead to more trauma or death.” Corrective Services NSW said deeply regretted Dungay’s death and extended its deepest sympathies to the family. A spokeswoman said the organisation fully supported the coronial inquiry. “The investigation report into Mr Dungay’s death resulted in many changes to policy and training procedures,” she said. “Serious consideration will be given to any coronial recommendations addressed to the Commissioner of Corrective Services NSW.” The Dungay family hopes the inquest will get to the bottom of David’s death, but they say correctional services and Justice Health should be held accountable for what happened. “What correctional services and the medical staff are doing, they’re trying to sweep it under the rug and make it out like they did nothing wrong – when we know they did something wrong,” says Ernie Dungay, David’s older brother. “The screws that did it are still working, they have to get charged with something – they took my brother’s life. “All I want is justice for my little brother, so we can put his soul to rest.” The coronial inquiry into Dungay’s death is scheduled to take place on 16 July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/09/unions-call-for-tough-new-penalties-after-restaurants-accused-of-ripping-off-staff","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T05:57:30Z","webTitle":"Unions call for tough new penalties after restaurants accused of ripping off staff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/09/unions-call-for-tough-new-penalties-after-restaurants-accused-of-ripping-off-staff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/09/unions-call-for-tough-new-penalties-after-restaurants-accused-of-ripping-off-staff","fields":{"headline":"Unions call for tough new penalties after restaurants accused of ripping off staff","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Underpayment of superannuation and wage theft are so common in the hospitality industry that unions are calling on state governments to introduce tough new penalties that would make ripping off staff a criminal offence. Two well-known restaurants – Bar Coluzzi in Sydney and Vue de Monde in Melbourne – have been accused of underpaying workers. On Monday Fair Work New South Wales issued a statement saying the owner of Bar Coluzzi, Tibor Vertes, had been penalised $9,720 while his company, Robit Nominees Pty Ltd, was fined a further $87,345. An Italian cook who was sponsored by the cafe on a 457 skilled worker visa took the owners to court after being made to work 54 hours each week, despite her contract stating she would work a 40-hour week and be paid an annual wage of $56,000. The restaurant also told her to repay $13,952 of her wages over a 15-month period from August 2014 until she resigned in November 2015, after telling her she had to pay the money back to the restaurant. She was told the payments were required to cover tax and superannuation contributions. The acting fair work ombudsman, Kristen Hannah, said she was concerned that cashback schemes were being used by unscrupulous operators in an attempt to get around record-keeping laws and disguise serious underpayment of wages. “It is hard to see a legitimate reason why an employer would require employees to be regularly paying back significant parts of their wage,” she said. Vertes and Robit Nominees acknowledged to the federal court that the cook had agreed to the cashback payments because she was worried about losing her job and visa. Both admitted to breaking workplace laws and have back paid the money owed to her, which totalled $39,686. The ABC reported that several staff at the fine-dining Melbourne establishment Vue de Monde and its now-closed sister establishment Cafe Vue were regularly required to work more than 50 hours each week despite contracts requiring a working week of 38 to 40 hours. A former chef at Cafe Vue told the ABC he often worked an 80-hour week and was underpaid about $500 each week. Vue Group has denied the allegations. Jess Walsh, the secretary of United Voice Victoria, the union representing hospitality workers, said the allegations that staff in one of Melbourne’s most expensive restaurants “could be ripped off by tens of thousands of a year” were appalling. “If proven, it fits with a broader trend in hospitality of systematic wage theft,” she said. “We need to change the rules so wage thieves face real consequences.” The union and Victorian Trades Hall Council has called on the state government to introduce a new section into Victoria’s Crimes Act that would criminalise wage theft. They want a new section added that would define wage theft as “a person who dishonestly withholds from an employee wages” and which could attract a maximum jail time of 10 years, and fines of up $190,000. The secretary of the liquor and hospitality division of United Voice in NSW, Tara Moriarty, said staff underpayment was common in the hospitality industry, particularly among cafes and restaurants. “Huge swathes of the industry are not even paid on the books,” she said. “Our union has been campaigning for better right of entry laws and stiffer penalties for wage theft and underpayment of entitlements. Unpaid superannuation, in particular, is a ticking time bomb for the Australian economy.” A recent report from the Centre for Future Work at the Australia Institute, found superannuation funds could be short by as much as $100bn due to wage theft. “A large percentage of hospitality workers are under 35, and that’s when we know it’s critical to start putting super aside to compound. But as things stand, we’re going to see millions of hospitality workers forced rapidly on to the old-age pension when they should have been able to rely on their super,” Moriarty said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/04/barcelona-v-roma-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T20:38:20Z","webTitle":"Barcelona 4-1 Roma: Champions League quarter-final first leg – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/04/barcelona-v-roma-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/04/barcelona-v-roma-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-live","fields":{"headline":"Barcelona 4-1 Roma: Champions League quarter-final first leg – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Barcelona will travel to Rome knowing that their Italian opponents will need an extraordinary turnaround next Tuesday. Roma haven’t been in a European Cup final since 1984 and it seems that their long wait will go on after Luis Suarez’s late goal gave Barcelona a three-goal lead to take into the second leg. That should be too big a hurdle for Roma to overcome. Yet there could have been a very different feel. Roma were in it after Edin Dzeko made it 3-1 near the end, only for a dreadful error from Federico Fazio to gift a goal to Suarez, who had been pretty poor for most of the night. That twist had a feeling of finality to it. Barcelona didn’t flow and Lionel Messi didn’t score, but they ruthlessly capitalised on moments of good fortune and will be confident of going through. That’s all from me tonight. Thanks for reading. Bye. That’s that. 90 min+3: There will be three added minutes. 90 min: Defrel’s fouled 25 yards from goal. Kolarov fancies this. Roma desperately need this after that Fazio howler. But the left-back’s curling effort is too high. 89 min: Fazio, though! Paulinho feeds Semedo on the right. His chipped cross is pushed away by Alisson. Denis Suarez picks up possession on the left. He pings a low ball into the middle. Fazio decides he’s got all the time in the world and takes a touch. Why not? It’s a dreadful piece of defending. The ball comes to Luis Suarez, who ruthlessly rams it low past Alisson. That is pathetic from the Roma centre-back, who’s ruined his team’s good work. 86 min: Kevin Strootman pulls Messi back. Yellow card. 85 min: Barcelona make their final change, Denis Suarez trotting on in place of the marvellous Andres Iniesta. 84 min: Messi spins and tries to release Suarez. Alisson storms out of his area to clear. 83 min: Andre Gomes replaces Sergi Roberto. 82 min: Alba pulls a cross back to Messi, who leans back and wallops it over in the style of Andy Carroll. Undeterred by Ter Stegen’s acrobatics, Roma keep pushing. They look invigorated now. Perotti dribbles inside from the left, looks up and slithers a ball into the area. It makes it way through to Dzeko, who turns and holds off Alba before pushing a low finish to Ter Stegen’s right. Roma have the away goal and this tie is alive again! 78 min: Bored, Ter Stegen tries a bit of skill with the ball at his feet. He’s good, but he’s not that good and he ends up losing it under pressure from Dzeko, leaving his team in big trouble. El Shaarawy lifts the ball into the area and Defrel brings it down. He looks certain to score. But who’s charging back into his goal? It’s Ter Stegen, who makes a wondrous save to deny the substitute. He’s at it again moments later, soaring to his right to push Perotti’s thunderous drive from 25 yards over. 77 min: Roma make their final change, Gregoire Defrel replacing Daniele de Rossi, the scorer of the first own goal. It’s probably no consolation to the veteran that he’s respectfully applauded off. 76 min: Ter Stegen claims Kolarov’s corner. This tie is in dire need of a Roma goal. 75 min: Semedo overruns the ball and Perotti is able to storm down the right. He cleverly cuts the ball back to Strootman, but Pique deflects the Dutchman’s shot over. 74 min: Suarez looks slow. That is all. 72 min: Stephan El Shaarawy replaces Alessandro Florenzi. 69 min: Rakitic drills a sumptuous pass from left to right, looking for Sergi Roberto. The midfielder scampers on to it and pulls the ball back to Messi, who disappointingly shoots straight at Alisson. Roma look beaten at the moment. 67 min: Rakitic sends the corner to Messi, who’s 25 yards out and ambitious enough to try something special, but the little magician is no Paul Scholes. 66 min: Peres heads Messi’s ball to Suarez behind for a corner. That’s the cue for Paulinho to replace Sergio Busquets. 64 min: No. Well, not yet. 63 min: Roma force a couple of corners. Can they haul themselves back into the tie? 62 min: Roma desperately need to score. You can’t see them turning this round in the second leg unless they salvage something here. 61 min: Maxime Gonalons replaces Lorenzo Pellegrini. With Roma forced to commit men forward, there’s space for Barcelona on the break. Messi skips down the right and he has time and space to make up his mind. He chooses a ball with the outside of the left boot to Suarez, who’s unmarked on the left. He cuts inside and tries to find the far corner with a low shot. Alisson pushes the ball out, but Roma’s luck isn’t in tonight. Pique’s there to tap home the rebound. This has escalated quickly. 58 min: Rakitic, looking to take this tie away from Roma, shoots from 20 yards. Alisson dives to his left to save adroitly. The corner’s taken short. Rakitic dribbles inside and plays a one-two with Messi, two Roma defenders drawn to the ball. Here’s trouble. Rakitic skips to the byline and drives a low ball into the middle. Umtiti attacks it, but the stretching Manolas turns the ball against the right post. The ball pings back, hits Umtiti and goes in off Manolas. Poor Roma. They trail thanks to two messy own-goals. 55 min: Iniesta has a shot deflected wide for a corner. 53 min: Thing is, though, it doesn’t take much for Barcelona to increase their threat. Iniesta suddenly glides through the middle and slips a pass to the right for Messi. He shoots from 15 yards with his right foot, but his effort’s too close to Alisson. There’s the danger for Roma, though. 51 min: The Barcelona fans are urging their team to wake up. The way this is going, it’ll be 1-1 soon. 50 min: Roma hoist another ball into the Barcelona area. Umtiti tries to bring it down in his own six-yard box, which feels like a questionable move. Florenzi immediately pounces on the dithering defender, but he can’t stop the ball from going out for a goal-kick. 49 min: Kolarov’s cross from the left beats everyone and goes out for a throw. It was a good ball. Barcelona look nervous at the back. Moments later Florenzi shoots high and wide from the right. 47 min: The ball’s popped out to Alba on the left. His chest control tees him up for a shot and he belts it at Alisson, who spills the ball into Suarez’s path. The off-colour forward pokes the rebound over. He was offside anyway. 46 min: Roma get the second half underway. They attack immediately. Deep on the right Florenzi curves a fine cross towards the far post, where Roma have an overload. Barcelona are outnumbered and Perotti should score. He has to score. He doesn’t score. He heads wide from six yards. What a miss. That was a sitter. The half ends with Messi seeing another shot blocked. Barcelona won’t mind to much. They’re ahead thanks to Daniele De Rossi’s freakish own goal, though Roma have played well and definitely aren’t out of this yet. 44 min: Kolarov’s booked for a cynical trip on Messi, who was starting to motor. 42 min: Roma might be annoyed that they’ve not got a penalty, but they do have a free-kick right on the edge of the Barcelona area. It’s in a central position. Kolarov and Pellegrini are both standing over it. Either could hit it. Pellegrini does. He tries to send it underneath the wall. But his crafty plan’s read by the Barcelona defenders, who block his effort and clear the ball. 41 min: A loose ball breaks to Pellegrini on the edge of the Barcelona area. He beats Umtiti to it and steps round the defender, who hangs out a leg. Pellegrini goes down and Roma scream for a penalty. The referee awards a free-kick instead. There were inches in that. It looked the right call. 40 min: All of a sudden, Roma look rattled. Messi hurtles into the area again. Manolas charges across and bundles Messi over just as he looks poised to score. No penalty despite the crowd’s noisy appeals. Messi finds Iniesta on the edge of the area and continues his run. Iniesta knows his old mate’s to his right and he tries to find him. Realising the ball’s running into the path of the unmarked Messi, who’ll finally have a clear sight of goal, De Rossi desperately tries to intervene. But he’s facing his own goal. He sticks out a leg and all he can do do is send the ball low to Alisson’s left from 15 yards! That’s rotten luck for the veteran. 37 min: At some point you fancy that Messi is going to earn the half a yard he needs to shoot with his left foot from 20 yards. But every times he’s threatened to do so far, Roma’s defending has been brilliantly alert. Barcelona are desperately trying to break down the white wall. Manolas steams in on Suarez, who stays down. He slowly gets back to his feet while Barcelona continue to attack. Suddenly the ball’s poked through to Messi. This looks like the moment. Until Manolas makes a cracking challenge. 34 min: The Camp Nou is quiet. 32 min: A sluggish touch from Semedo allows Perotti to have an adventure down the left. He cuts back and crosses towards Dzeko. Pique’s header goes behind for a corner, Semedo unable to keep it in. But Kolarov’s delivery is poor. Barcelona try to counter, but Iniesta quickly runs out of ideas. 31 min: Iniesta shoots over from 20 yards. 29 min: Messi’s tackled on the edge of the Roma area and the Italians are able to break for the first time in a while. Dzeko lifts a ball from right to left, looking for Perotti, who’s in space. Not for long, though. Semedo races back to push him off the ball. Moments later Iniesta glides into the area and falls over with Peres nearby. He’s told to get up. 28 min: This is better from Barcelona, Suarez playing a one-two with Messi and bursting into the area on the left. He shoots low and hard, but Alisson gets down smartly to push the ball to safety. 26 min: Roma are containing Barcelona well. The balance of this Barcelona team is strange. They could do with some surging from Paulinho or incision from Ousmane Dembele. 23 min: Rakitic runs down the right, into space vacated by Kolarov. He feeds Messi again.Into the area he goes. De Rossi steps in. 22 min: Messi looks like he’s fashioned space for a shot with his left foot from 20 yards. A trio of Roma defenders do their best to delay him, though. He keeps going, though, turning and almost dribbling through with a magnificent piece of skill. An Italian foot diverts the ball to Rakitic, who sees a deflected shot fizz over. 19 min: A couple of yellow balloons have drifted on to the pitch. Presumably that’s a statement in support of Catalan independence. 18 min: A raking pass from the back finds Alba, who cushions the ball back to Suarez. His shot from 25 yards takes a deflection and spins wide for a corner. Rakitic’s corner’s headed away. But the ball stays alive and Roma make a mess of getting it away for good. Two defenders go for the same ball and it ends up at the feet of Rakitic, who’s crept into the area from the left. From a tight angle, he looks to take everyone by surprise by opening up his body and aiming for the far corner with his right foot. The ball zips through the legs and, with Alisson unsighted and unable to react in time, looks destined for the back of the net. Instead it comes back off the base of the post! The rebound comes to Suarez, but he’s rushed and blazes over. 17 min: A lot of possession for Barcelona. Not much bite, though. There’s a lack of width in this starting line-up. 14 min: Umtiti strides forward and slides a pass inside Peres to Alba. Peres recovers, however, and slides to whip the ball off Alba’s toes. That was a vital challenge. Alba was in. 11 min: Messi, always up to something, turns 25 yards from goal and decides to have a crack. Alisson fields his low effort, gathering the ball at the second attempt. 10 min: Perotti pushes a pass into the Dzeko’s path. The ball’s on his favoured left foot and he could shoot. He’s got a sight of goal. Instead, he feels contact from Semedo and collapses in an attempt to win a penalty. The Dutch referee looks unimpressed and awards a goal-kick. 7 min: Suarez and Alba flick the ball between them on the left. Then Iniesta pings a stunning first-time pass through to Suarez. Roma have been effortlessly prised apart here and Suarez takes the ball in his stride, opens up his body and shoots low past Alisson. But Roma can breathe easy. The flag’s up again. Suarez was a yard or two off. 6 min: Dzeko tries to bustle through the middle. He’s blocked off by Umtiti and the ball breaks into the Barcelona area. Pique has to boot clear with Florenzi closing in quickly. 5 min: Dzeko looks to lead a counter down the left. Pique cuts out his crossfield pass and Barcelona immediately look forward, Iniesta lifting a pass over the top for Messi. For a moment it seems that Roma have got their offside trap wrong. But only for a moment. The flag goes up as Messi controls on his chest. 4 min: Semedo, who’ll need to provide lots of width on the right, combines with Sergi Roberto. He’s stopped in his tracks soon enough, though. 3 min: Semedo steps in to win the ball on the right. The ball comes to Busquets, who quickly looks for Messi on the edge of the Roma area. He’s up against two Roma defenders and looks to make space for a shot. The visitors stand up to him, though, and the danger passes. Peep! Barcelona, kicking from left to right, get the game underway. They’re in red and blue and they’re kicking from left to right. Roma are all in white. The visitors win the ball immediately and look to attack. They’ve set up with a high press. Out they come! The players of Barcelona and Roma march out at the Camp Nou. Lionel Messi’s at the back of the queue for the home team. Leave the best till last. Kick-off will be in a few minutes. First it’s time for a bit of Zadok. Pre-match reading Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets are back for Barcelona, while Nelson Semedo is in at right-back. Out go Philippe Coutinho, Paulinho and Ousmane Dembele from the side that drew 2-2 with Sevilla on the weekend. Roma are without the influential Radja Naingollan. They’ve made two changes to the side that drew 1-1 with Bologna on Saturday. Patrik Schick and Stephan El Shaarawy drop out, Bruno Peres and Lorenzo Pellegrini step up. Barcelona: Ter Stegen; Semedo, Pique, Umtiti, Alba; Busquets, Roberto; Rakitic, Iniesta; Messi, L Suarez. Subs: Cillessen, Vermaelen, D Suarez, Gomes, Paulinho, Alcacer, Dembele. Roma: Allison; Peres, Fazio, Manolas, Kolarov; De Rossi, Florenzi, Strootman; Pellegrini, Dzeko, Perotti. Subs: Skorupski, Jesus, Schick, Gonalons, Defrel, Gerson, El Shaarawy. Referee: Danny Makkelie (Netherlands). It’s been a while since Roma made it to a European Cup semi-final. Not only have they never managed to get that far in the Champions League era, they haven’t been in the last four since 1984. That’s a fair old wait for one of Italy’s biggest clubs, even if the last of their three Serie A titles came 17 years ago. They’ve seen plenty of their Italian rivals fare well in this competition since then - Milan had their late-80s and mid-90s dominance, Juventus were champions in 1996 and finalists in 1997, 1998, 2003, 2015 and 2017, and Internazionale did it Jose Mourinho’s way in 2010 - but the Giallorossi haven’t been able to trouble the big boys in modern times. Is that about to change? Well, there are reasons for Roma to be optimistic. They were placed in a tough group with Atletico Madrid and Chelsea, but finishing top of it owed much to an impressive 3-0 home win over Antonio Conte’s Premier League champions. They were handed an awkward draw against Shakhtar Donetsk, who had qualified at the expense of Serie A pacesetters Napoli, but made it past the talented Ukrainians thanks to the revitalised Edin Dzeko. It’s clear that Eusebio Di Francesco’s team can play. But you know what’s coming next. That’s right: it’s our old friend Reality, who’s been itching to point out that Roma probably don’t have much of a chance against Barcelona, especially now that Cristiano Ronaldo’s awe-inspiring overhead kick against Juventus has thrown down the gauntlet to Lionel Messi. As Sevilla and Juventus discovered in their respective first legs against Bayern Munich and Real Madrid last night, the super clubs have their game faces on and Roma could be in for a long night at the Camp Nou if Barcelona are in the mood. Or, more specifically, if Messi brings his Chelsea-destroying form to the table. It’s not hard not to favour the team with the little Argentinian on their side. Much of Roma’s hopes will rest on how well they’ve prepared for Messi. Ernesto Valverde’s Barcelona might have lost a little of the old confiscate-your-breath magic, but the same can’t be said of their talismanic No10. Messi remains as deadly and inspirational as ever, as he proved when he preserved Barcelona’s unbeaten league record against Sevilla on Saturday, and the wait for Roma, who lost 6-1 when they visited this ground in 2015, will go on if their primary focus isn’t on stopping him. Kick-off: 7.45pm BST, 8.45pm CET."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/03/janka-nabay-bubu-music-sierra-leone","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T14:46:18Z","webTitle":"Janka Nabay: musical evangelist who took bubu to the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/03/janka-nabay-bubu-music-sierra-leone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/03/janka-nabay-bubu-music-sierra-leone","fields":{"headline":"Janka Nabay: musical evangelist who took bubu to the world","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"By now the idea of a “musical revolutionary” has become so cliched that it can easily lose its meaning. But Janka Nabay is one artist for whom the phrase stands up. The Sierra Leonean musician has died aged 54, but he leaves a legacy as a bandleader and ethnomusicologist who not only kept his home country’s traditional bubu music alive by futureproofing it with dazzlingly Technicolor beats, but also brought the little-known sound to the world. Nabay was a local star in Sierra Leone in the 1990s, during the country’s decade-long civil war. Bubu music, a style that originated from the Temne region, was until then only associated with old folk traditions; it was used in witchcraft ceremonies and later, with the arrival of Islam, in religious processions to mark the end of Ramadan. But Nabay modernised bubu by pairing its percussive bamboo cane flutes, wooden boxes and metal pipes (often made from repurposed parts of cars) with synthesisers and drum machines. He wanted his music to provide solace in war-torn Sierra Leone but also to establish a musical legacy for a country whose artists at the time were borrowing from reggae, hip-hop and R&amp;B. “I’m the first guy who made it pleasant for people to come back to the culture, to love their culture,” he said in one interview. His brightly lit electronic interpretation – which he said took inspiration from “Michael Jackson, Bob Marley and God” and was sung in a combination of his native Temne, English, Arabic and Sierra Leone’s common language, Krio – espoused messages of peace, good governance and female empowerment. It was both hypnotic and danceable, with fast, flickering, rhythmic lines that knotted together into something restlessly uplifting. Nabay’s popularity, however, was a double-edged sword. His music was adopted by young rebel groups who, according to one biography, used “his tapes to sound their battle cry, blasting it out to the villages they invaded to lure people from their hiding spots”. At one point, they reportedly captured Nabay to make him perform for the troops and gear them up for battle. When the civil war ended in 2002, Nabay fled to the US, where he worked in fast-food joints to make ends meet and unsuccessfully tried to start a band between shifts. Five years later, his old recordings were rediscovered by the journalist Wills Glasspiegel while sifting through a haul of cassettes that he’d received from the BBC. Nabay’s tape – made during his last night in Sierra Leone at Forensic Studios in Freetown – stood out and Glasspiegel tracked Nabay down to a fried-chicken shop in Philadelphia. In Brooklyn, Nabay eventually found a group of like-minded musicians. He began playing at cult club Zebulon, which piqued the interest of various indie-experimentalists from the bands Skeletons, Chairlift, Highlife and Saadi. They became Nabay’s “Bubu Gang” and in 2010 released their first EP, Bubu King, which featured some of his last recordings in Freetown and is widely considered to be the first ever international bubu record. A debut album, En Yay Sah (which translates as I’m Scared), followed in 2012 on David Byrne’s Luaka Bop label and encapsulated the live shows he’d been playing with the gang at international festivals, a psychedelic trip that found acclaim with the indie music press. Nabay’s last album, 2017’s Build Music, made his frenetically entangled beats more pronounced (not unlike South Africa’s Shangaan electro sound); his previous rockier freestyles with his hipster acolytes were swapped for housier, poppier beats, as on the tracks Santa Monica and Stop Jealous. The album also built on Nabay’s themes of migration and displacement. As a conflicted and apparently self-described “black cowboy” trying to make it as a musician in the US, he wanted to be a spokesperson for his traditional music while updating it for new audiences. He was hailed as an innovator but often risked being exoticised (an early photoshoot shows him looking uncomfortable in a traditional grass skirt and flamboyant crocheted top, operating a deep-fat fryer). In many ways, Nabay’s trajectory feels familiar in today’s independent music circuit: Ata Kak, William Onyeabor and Hailu Mergia are all African artists who faded into obscurity only to be “rediscovered” by a boutique record label, their careers subsequently resuscitated for a largely western audience. But while Nabay’s story has a similar arc, his goal seemed to be not only to survive as an artist and give his home country a sound to be proud of, but also to inspire others to play it. He said in an interview last year: “I hope that people will concentrate on my music. I want to hear somebody in London play bubu music, somebody in Germany play bubu music. Somebody in South Africa, Nigeria, something like that. That’s my hope.” Hope is one word that ricochets through those spirited Casio tones. Uncertain yet playful and optimistic, Nabay’s unique music deserves to live on now he has gone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global/2018/apr/10/weekly-notes-queries-what-matters","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T10:59:25Z","webTitle":"What matters?

In comments to Guardian Australia, Dutton has again rejected claims that Australia has retracted its offer to white South African farmers to settle them in Australia on humanitarian visas. The difference of opinion suggests Australia has attempted to smooth over offence by walking back the home affairs minister’s earlier comments that South African farmers deserved “special attention” but will still consider any applications for visas in the existing humanitarian stream. Dutton triggered outrage in March when he said the farmers deserved “special attention” for visas to Australia to flee their “horrific circumstances” for a “civilised country”. Ndivhuwo Mabaya, a spokesman for the South African Department of International Relations and Cooperation, said South African officials had met the Australian high commissioner initially to confirm the accuracy of the reports because they “could not believe that this comments were correct[ly] reported”. When Australia confirmed the statements, the South African government demanded a retraction. “The high commissioner returned to us and indicated to us that our relationship … is based on the Australian immigration policy, not on what Dutton said,” Mabaya said. “We then received a letter from the [Australian] foreign minister in which she says that it’s our foreign policy and our immigration policy [that is pertinent] and not what was said in public by the home affairs minister.” The Australian high commissioner reassured South Africa’s government that Australia did not consider it an “uncivilised” country. The South African government says it will not release the letter because of diplomatic conventions. “When the minister of foreign affairs says judge us on our policy, that’s what we will do, not [on] what politicians will say ... the policy does not say what Mr Dutton says,” Mabaya said. “Our strong relationship with Australia goes back to the time under apartheid and today we can take the letter from the ministry and move on to focusing on beating the Australians in the next Test.” On Tuesday Dutton told Guardian Australia he had only seen the public comments from South Africa’s foreign minister, Lindiwe Sisulu, claiming Australia had retracted its offer. He responded: “There has been no retractions of my comments or our desire to assess some of these cases.” Dutton told Australian Associated Press he was considering “several” applications from South African farmers for refugee or humanitarian status in Australia. He said he had seen a letter from Bishop to Sisulu but it contained no suggestions of repudiation or retraction. “I’m not sure what domestic issues are at play in terms of the politics in South Africa that would bring this comment out but it’s not based on any factual statement of anyone within the Australian government,” he told Sky News. Dutton said the government’s position was “as I stated it a couple of weeks ago” – that the refugee and humanitarian program was available to eligible people, with cases considered on an individual basis. In March the Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and Bishop, appeared to contradict suggestions of “special attention” by stressing the non-discriminatory nature of the humanitarian visa program. But neither explicitly rejected the claim that South African farmers would qualify. Dutton’s call was supported by the former prime minister Tony Abbott and prompted a group of seven MPs in the ruling Coalition parties to raise the matter in the party room. MPs were told that applications from white South African farmers, including from referrals in Australia, would be considered. Bishop stressed the consistency of her stance with Dutton’s because both agree that South Africans would qualify under existing humanitarian visa rules. Dutton’s comments were triggered by reports of violence after a legal change allowing the expropriation of farm lands to redress the land confiscations of the colonial and apartheid era. with Australian Associated Press"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/03/no-10-tries-to-calm-russia-row-amid-cold-war-rhetoric","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T14:03:59Z","webTitle":"No 10 tries to calm Russia row amid cold war rhetoric","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/03/no-10-tries-to-calm-russia-row-amid-cold-war-rhetoric","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/03/no-10-tries-to-calm-russia-row-amid-cold-war-rhetoric","fields":{"headline":"No 10 tries to calm Russia row amid cold war rhetoric","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Downing Street has issued a plea for “proportionate” action from Russia to the Salisbury poisoning row after its foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, warned that relations with the west are now worse than during the cold war. Theresa May is visiting Scandinavia next week with the international security threat from Russia expected to be at the top of the agenda. Her one-day visit to Denmark and Sweden was announced after Lavrov appeared to suggest that UK secret services may have been involved in the 4 March attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury. He said the incident could have been “beneficial” to the British government to distract attention from Brexit. Speaking in Moscow, Lavrov said there was “a lot of talk about a ‘cold war’, about the situation being worse than it was during the classic cold war, because then there were some rules, and some decency was observed”. He added: “I believe that our western partners, I mean primarily the United Kingdom, the United States and some countries that blindly follow them, have cast away all decency, they are resorting to open lies, blatant misinformation.” It came as a former Russian military official Lt-Gen Evgeny Buzhinsky warned that the conflict could even end up as “the last war in the history of mankind”. In a thinly veiled threat, he said the diplomatic crisis could result in a “very, very bad outcome” and accused the west of “cornering Russia” which, he argued, was a “very dangerous thing”. The deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, called the poisoning of Sergei Skripal a “provocation arranged by Britain” in order to justify high military spending because “they need a major enemy”. However, Downing Street in effect called for calm at its weekly briefing for political reporters, simply saying it expected the wider dispute with Russia would not be settled for a long time. A No 10 spokesman said: “We need to respond in a proportionate way to this aggressive behaviour from Russia and that’s what we’re doing.” He added: “As the prime minister has made clear, the UK would much rather have in Russia a constructive partner ready to play by the rules. But this attack in Salisbury was part of a pattern of increasingly aggressive Russian behaviour, as well as a new and dangerous phase in Russian activity within the continent and beyond. As the prime minister has said, we must face the facts, and the challenge of Russia is one that will endure for years to come.” Russia is also keeping up the pressure on the UK to provide consular access to Skripal’s daughter, Yulia, now she is recovering in a Salisbury hospital. Reports from Russia claim that a cousin has contacted the British and Russian authorities to be given permission to go to the UK to be by her bedside. Lavrov said it was outrageous that the UK was not letting diplomatic staff see Yulia Skripal. The Russian embassy in London claims the UK is in breach of article 36 of the Vienna convention by refusing consular access to a Russian national. Downing Street raised the possibility that the 33-year-old may have requested that consular access be denied. It said access was based on a number of considerations “including consent from the individual”. Russia also warned it would not accept any international scientific findings on the nerve agent used to poison the Skripals unless its scientists were involved in testing the nerve agent samples. Moscow spelt out its conditions for cooperation before an emergency meeting it has convened for Wednesday of the executive of the Organisation for Prevention of Chemical Weapons in The Hague. The OPCW is the internationally recognised body responsible for overseeing the 1997 chemical weapons convention and has been testing samples provided by British scientists from the Skripals. The first results about the nature of the poison - which the UK believes to be novichok, a nerve agent of Russian origin – are expected in days. Alexander Shulgin, Russia’s permanent representative to the OPCW, complained that Russian scientists have been barred from the tests owing to British objections. The OPCW is not able to ascribe responsibility for the attack, but identification of the nerve agent as novichok would strengthen the view that Russian state forces were involved. Russia insists it destroyed its entire chemical weapons stock. If the dispute over the nature of the Salisbury nerve agent cannot be resolved, Russia could withdraw from the OPCW. This would be a severe blow to global efforts to control chemical weapons. Moscow has already challenged OPCW findings about the Syrian government’s responsibility for chemical weapons attacks on its civilians. May’s meetings with the Swedish and Danish leaders in Stockholm next Monday will also cover trade and the Brexit negotiations.

There is a church and a tennis court and a tranquil blue lake. Laundry snaps on the line in well-tended backyards; Sullivan’s Travels is playing at the local picture palace. It’s 1942 and the world is at war. But unremarkable Overland sits apart from the conflict. It is only at ground level that the facade starts to flake. The Overland diner serves only coffee and doughnuts. The fire hydrants emit not water but steam. And the tranquil blue lake is a vast sheet of tarpaulin: toss an apple on to its surface and the fruit risks being sucked down a vent and dropped on to the shop floor of the Lockheed aircraft factory that is concealed down below. The town, it transpires, is more involved in the war than it would have us believe. The concept of the ersatz American town is almost as old as the American town itself, typically built at speed and aping older architectural styles. It’s there in Nathanael West’s 1939 novel The Day of the Locust, with its pick-and-mix of “Samoan huts, Mediterranean villas, Swiss chalets and Tudor collages” and on screen in films such as Pleasantville and The Truman Show. But Graham Rawle’s tale of fakery is grounded in fact. In the immediate wake of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the US War Department recruited the services of the major Hollywood studios for what became known as “Operation Camouflage”. This involved disguising air bases and factories on the coast of California to the point where they blended in with the surrounding neighbourhoods. The Lockheed Corporation plant covered 40 hectares and employed 25,000 workers. But from the air it could pass for a suburb of Burbank. Rawle’s master illusionist is George Godfrey, God for short, an art director on loan from the Warner Bros lot, who explains: Warner Brothers studios are about the same size as the Lockheed plant. Same number of employees, give or take. Everybody working together to manufacture their product. Lockheed puts out one B-24 bomber a week, plus a number of smaller planes and parts. Warners puts out one class-A feature plus a number of B-movies and shorts. Some of those take off and fly; some of them get shot down. Godfrey is determined his Overland will be bought by the public. It certainly casts a spell on the Lockheed employees who find their way above ground. First Japanese-American Kay scrambles through the vent to emerge in the lake “like Botticelli’s Venus”. Then pregnant starlet Queenie begins pushing a doll in a pram about the suburban streets, disappointed to discover there are no speaking parts on this set. Possibly Overland has even come to seduce its creator. When the project is mothballed, Godfrey cannot let it go. He wants to build a windmill to “add character” and insists that every road should be named. He steals a Baker Street sign from a Sherlock Holmes movie. Rawle cut his teeth as an artist and designer (his “Lost Consonants” series used to run in the Guardian’s Weekend magazine) and this sparky, inventive novel betrays his pedigree. Overland is printed in the landscape format with the spine at the top, so that you read it as you might leaf through a flip-book. There are asterisks and footnotes and cutaways to news items. All of which gives the tale a gimmicky, PT Barnum-esque flavour. It reminds us that the story we’re reading is itself an illusion; a world tipped on to its side and framed as a breathless B-movie. If there is little depth to Rawle’s characters, that may be partly the point. He moves his cast around in much the same manner as the film crew reposition the prop sheep in the field. In Godfrey’s opinion there is little difference between the Hollywood dream factory and the Burbank aircraft plant. Equally it might be argued that not much separates the fake town from the real. It is this conceit, finally, that makes Overland so appealing. Having arranged his stage-flats and his harum-scarum performers, Rawles manages to make them all feel of value. Thrown to the winds, their lives in ruins, his main players struggle to retrace their steps. They find themselves pining for the little cabin by the lake. They stagger through bland suburbia in search of Shangri-La. Maybe every town is a shell waiting to be furnished; every fiction a fake until we consent to meet it halfway. Overland was jerry-rigged over an existing structure. The fields are felt and the taps don’t work and the perfect little cabin commands a view of tarpaulin. The place is an illusion, but that doesn’t mean it’s not home. • Xan Brooks’s The Clocks in This House All Tell Different Times is published by Salt.

Music isn’t a central part of growing up any more. For me it was everything: a window on to this other world. I can’t believe I’m going to be 65 this year. I’m very fit and I’ve written six books in the last six years – I haven’t slowed down, I’ve picked up the pace. My generation is exploring a different way of getting old. Fitness has been important to me for a long time. I’ve been with the same personal trainer, Fred, for 13 years. I think everyone needs one – it’s not human nature to push yourself the way a trainer will push you. It keeps me lean, strong and calm, and helps me sleep. About five years ago, I did my back in sparring. That was a horrible feeling, when you can’t defy age any more. But I did yoga for two years and it fixed my back. Yoga is a very intimidating thing for a man to do – far more so than boxing or a martial art – but I’d recommend it. You’ve got to keep your body strengthened, lengthened and toned. When I became a father in my 20s, I had this illusion of immortality, but becoming a parent again in my 40s I realised that time is finite, you need to make a conscious effort to stick around to bring this child up. The first half of my 20s was screaming madness really. In your 40s you reach some kind of stability. Jasmine was a part of me wanting to get fit and be healthy. I like a big glass of red wine to draw a line under the day, that I’ve put in a good shift, I’ve done good work, I’ve trained hard and I’ve fulfilled my duties to my family. What I wish someone had told me when I was young is that your career will not be linear. There will be setbacks and disappointments and reverses at every step of the way. There will never be a time when you have ‘made it’. Success is largely determined by how we respond to disappointment.

Paul Walton A: Sam Taylor is an author and the translator of nearly 30 French novels including HHhH by Laurent Binet, and Lullaby by Leila Slimani There are two answers to this question. One: one doesn’t. Two: judge for yourself. These answers may seem contradictory, but they’re not really. It all comes down to what you define as a “good translation”. Take the recent controversy about Deborah Smith’s translation of Han Kang’s The Vegetarian, which won the 2016 Man Booker International prize. Most readers and critics loved it, so in that sense it was certainly a “good translation”. Then came the backlash: Korean academics complaining about mistakes and a major alteration in the text’s tone and diction. So does that make it a “bad translation”? Ultimately, it’s a question of taste. My personal ideal for a translation is one that makes the reader forget they are reading a translation at all, but not everyone feels the same way. There is no alternative translation of The Vegetarian as yet, so we have no point of comparison, but with most foreign classics there are several versions available. In that case, what you should do is read a few sentences – the same sentences – from each translation, and pick the one that you most enjoy. In the end, short of learning the language yourself, that is the only way to judge a good translation.

My main commute is between Baltimore and São Paulo, as I am the music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and the São Paulo Symphony Orchestra, and the time zones almost line up. It’s about letting my body do what it needs to do; if I’m up at 2am I just do some work. The latest I get up is 6am and I go to the gym. The cross trainer and running help me focus. When you do late-night concerts it’s hard to get an early night, so I’m fortunate I can get by on six hours’ sleep. Eat At home in Baltimore, my favourite thing is to eat with my family. In São Paulo, there are some wonderful restaurants. I’m a carnivore, so I do enjoy a steak. I like to eat something small, like a sandwich, before and after a performance. Often people go out for dinner after a concert, but I don’t sleep well after a big meal late at night, so I avoid that if I can. I don’t drink much alcohol; I don’t like feeling impaired. Work I work for pleasure. It doesn’t feel like a burden. I have a good grasp of what music I need to be studying for future performances. It stresses me out if I feel my time is short for preparation. You can’t force relationships when you’re working with a new orchestra.

Richard Mutabazi and Akim Muzidwa Muhiirwe were arrested last month in possession of 24 bags of maize flour, each weighing 60kg, nine jerrycans of cooking oil and other items meant for preparing meals at Kyaka II camp in Kyegegwa district. Eight refugees were also arrested. The men have been suspended by the council pending the outcome of the case. “They were intercepted and arrested while offloading the relief food. We have charged them with theft,” said Patrick Onyango, Uganda’s deputy police spokesman. They are expected to appear before the anti-corruption court in Kampala this week. If convicted, the defendants face up to 10 years in jail. The camp is home to about 44,000 refugees who have fled violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s north-eastern Ituri province. Uganda is home to almost 1.4 million refugees, the majority from South Sudan. Jean-Christophe Saint-Esteben, the Danish Refugee Council’s country director for Uganda and Tanzania, said he was “very disappointed” at the arrests. “We take this case very seriously because the theft of food reduces the vital relief available to refugees who are in an extremely vulnerable situation. Theft constitutes gross misconduct according to the DRC policy, and therefore DRC will take appropriate action if any staff member is found guilty of theft,” said Saint-Esteben. “DRC’s humanitarian food assistance programmes aim at ensuring the availability of, access to, and consumption of safe and nutritious food for the most vulnerable people.” Saint-Esteben said the council will conduct a full review of its procedures as a result of the arrests. Claire Nevill, a spokeswoman from the World Food Programme in Kampala, said in a statement that the agency is conducting a detailed stocktake to check for missing items. “WFP has zero tolerance for theft, fraud and corruption,”, said Nevill. “WFP is committed to accountability and integrity in its use of donor funds, and works with all staff and partners to promote the highest standards in delivering assistance.” She added that the organisation launched a free helpline in September last year so that refugees could report theft, fraud or corruption. The case comes as the Ugandan government continues its investigation into alleged fraud and mismanagement of funds to support refugees in the east African nation. Apollo Kazungu, commissioner for refugees in the office of the prime minister, and three of his senior staff – Walter Omondi, John Baptist Sentamu and Francis Nkwasibwe – are suspended while investigations are made into their alleged collusion with staff from the UN refugee agency, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, and the WFP to inflate and exaggerate refugee figures."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/04/kim-wilde-maybe-aliens-are-using-me-to-put-out-a-record-with-them-on-it","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T11:21:14Z","webTitle":"Kim Wilde: ‘Maybe aliens are using me to put out a record with them on it’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/04/kim-wilde-maybe-aliens-are-using-me-to-put-out-a-record-with-them-on-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/04/kim-wilde-maybe-aliens-are-using-me-to-put-out-a-record-with-them-on-it","fields":{"headline":"Kim Wilde: ‘Maybe aliens are using me to put out a record with them on it’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The first man I fell in love with carried a photo of Kim Wilde in his wallet when I met him. For a while, she was my jokey love rival, but I think I was probably a bit in love with her, too. In the 80s, it felt as if everyone was. Kids in America, her 1981 debut single, was a global hit and Wilde went on to sell more records that decade than any other female British pop star. Hits included Chequered Love, You Keep Me Hanging On and You Came; she won a Brit award; she toured with Michael Jackson. And then she seemed to vanish. She resurfaced briefly around 2000, presenting TV shows about gardening for the BBC. Another dozen years later, she became an accidental YouTube star when someone posted footage of Wilde and her brother treating a commuter train carriage to a drunken impromptu concert. The pair were on their way home to Hertfordshire from a Christmas party in London and, in the festive spirit, belted out a few numbers to startled passengers. The charming video went viral and led to the release of an album of classic Christmas covers in 2013. Now, Wilde has released an album of new material, Here Come the Aliens, and last weekend she embarked on her first full solo UK tour in 30 years. We meet 10 days earlier, when the final details of stage outfits (black catsuit and cape) are being perfected, footwear has just been purchased (she holds up a pair of glittery, chunky lace-up ankle boots to be admired) and Wilde is waiting to hear if her album will make the UK charts. (It does, two days later, entering at No 21). I hear her before I see her. The sound carrying across the lobby of a London hotel is the same unmistakably husky, sugared voice that sang Kids in America. At 57, her face is still instantly recognisable. She is wearing a black leather jacket and crimson lipstick, her blond hair scrunched up in a messy knot. She could not look like a happier pop star. Her new album is a collaboration with her brother Rick and features her niece Scarlett. Music has always been a family affair for the daughter of 50s rocker Marty Wilde and Joyce Baker of the girl band the Vernons Girls, who together took care of her career. “That gave me a ridiculous amount of emotional freedom, which I really needed, because when I started out I needed to know things were being taken care of,” she says. There was a downside, however: “Before I knew it, I was 30 and I didn’t know how to really take care of myself.” She had never had to buy a household appliance, fill out a mortgage form, file a tax return. “The stuff that enables you to navigate through life on a practical level, I didn’t really know how to do that.” Wilde is a funny mixture of earnest intimacy and irreverent nonchalance. “I knew someone was tapping on the window of my mind all the time, saying: You’ve really got to get a grip, Kim, because this is something you need to do in order to grow up properly, to become a grownup,” she says, sounding uncommonly self-aware. Then she adds: “Also, my career ground to a bit of a halt. And, anyway, I was really quite bored.” Wilde moved to rural Hertfordshire, converted a barn and married the actor Hal Fowler in 1996. During her first pregnancy the following year, she enrolled in horticultural college. “I was so out of my comfort zone. I had to relearn who I was, learn how to be a parent, learn about gardening, do my homework, get my assignments in.” The couple had a second child and Wilde became a professional gardener. She says she was only too happy to leave her pop fame behind. “One of the most liberating things I ever did – I was so ready for it – was to change my passport name [to her married name]. And then I changed my chequebook, and then I changed my driving licence, and I saw Fowler written on it and that made me feel great. I felt like maybe how one of those Russian diplomats feels when they get given a new identity. I’d had a career. It was exhausting, that career, and I was so relieved to be Mrs Fowler, under the radar completely and bringing up kids and taking them to school and cooking toad in the hole.” But being a mum and a gardener, she soon discovered, was harder work than people think. “My life got exhausting again. The busiest time of my life was when I got married and got into gardening and had children and got into horticulture. Everyone has this dreamy, dewy idea of ‘Oh, she got married and had children and started planting seeds, she grew vegetables and they ate them in the kitchen’, you know, which is true. We did all of that. But I don’t know what people think about what it’s like having two children within two years. It’s the hardest struggle in the world. Yet everyone imagines that that’s a really relaxing thing.” She can’t explain how she then “ended up making TV programmes about gardening”, but by 2001 she was presenting the BBC’s Garden Invaders. “It all just sort of happened. It all felt good, but it was absolutely exhausting having another career that I hadn’t planned on having. I certainly wasn’t looking for it. I’d had a career. I didn’t want another career. It just became one.” Before long she was writing gardening books and newspaper columns, too. To complicate matters further, she never gave up making music or touring. She released singles in 2001 and 2002, which sold in mainland Europe – where she has been performing for the past 15 years – as did new albums in 2006, 2010 and 2011. She has toured the UK three times since 2003 with other nostalgia bands, as part of an 80s revival show. I ask what keeps motivating her when she has created another life in the country that clearly makes her very happy. She grins and shrugs. “This is my destiny.” As Wilde talks, I begin to realise that, although her new album sounds contemporary, her register belongs to the particular sensibility of 80s pop stars, a world away from the nakedly calculating ambition of today’s generation. Wilde affects a casual carelessness about her career that makes me nostalgic for the time when performers could plausibly pass off success as something that just happened to them. The artlessness is possibly disingenuous, but hugely likable. She sounds just as relaxed about almost every other aspect of her life. When her children were growing up, “I was good cop. Their dad’s been sort of bad cop.” Now 18, her daughter is a singer-songwriter; her son, 20, is “an incredible guitarist”. When I ask if their opinion of her music matters to her, she chuckles. “Not really, you know. It’s not an issue for me.” Wilde found being the daughter of a pop star difficult, “because he often wasn’t around and also because I was always ‘Marty Wilde’s daughter’ rather than being Kim, so that kind of took away a lot of my self-worth.” But when I ask how her kids feel about her fame, she says: “I really don’t know, if I’m honest with you. I think they’re probably more on the embarrassed side, but I actually don’t know how they feel about it. It’s an irrelevance to them, you know, as long as I help them and maybe get some of their washing done from time to time and give them a lift when they need one.” The music industry has changed beyond all recognition since her first hit 37 years ago, but Wilde is sanguine about its future. “Somehow it will evolve and it will survive. It has to.” She isn’t troubled, either, by the hyper-sexualisation of female pop. “Well, not when I look at Adele, so, no, I don’t let it bother me too much.” Other older women in the industry may feel pressure to undergo cosmetic surgical procedures – Toyah Willcox wrote a book about having a facelift – “And each to their own is what I say. But it’s not for me. I’ve never really cared about what people think of me, not that much. Definitely not to the degree that I would let someone put a knife in my face.” What about her voice box – has she taken measures to protect it? She laughs. “I haven’t, no. I think I’ve inherited my dad’s vocal box. I’m just very, very lucky.” Wilde doesn’t come across as blase, just strikingly content. The only subject that makes her intently animated is, of all things, extraterrestrial life. She considers herself psychic and is convinced that she saw a UFO above her back garden in 2009. “I have had a lot of time to talk about it and think about it and I do think, obviously, that aliens have been here for ever. They’ve been watching us for ever. They’re in a situation where they know we have to evolve, in the way that we have to let our children grow up to a degree without our intervention. But we have to intervene sometimes, in case they kill themselves, so I think they’re reaching more of a point where they’re getting a bit, like: ‘We might actually have to do something here, guys. We might actually have to start raising the vibration in this planet for humans to understand that we’re real.’ Maybe they even are using me, to put out a pop record with them on it.” She is not joking; her new album features aliens on the cover. “Maybe it’s just part of the plan. Maybe they’re just saying: ‘We’re going to have to get everyone used to the fact that we’re here.’ I mean, if they know so much, why wouldn’t they? They might think: actually, there’s that girl in Hertfordshire, the Kids in America girl. Yes, maybe we can get her, because she might get people to listen.” Here Come the Aliens is out now.

This is the question posed by our archive issue this week; contentious in our current post #MeToo climate perhaps, but a serious concern in 1971 for white-collar workers. As Barry the banker worked his way up the greasy pole he didn’t realise that one day his wife – let’s call her Laura – would be ‘vetted’ to assess whether he was a credible candidate for promotion: a terrifying prospect for any self-respecting businessman with a strong-willed wife. According to a study, ‘The Wives of Management’, a businessman’s trouble-and-strife could be just that and more. ‘She can ruin his career, ‘from drinking too much, or dressing outlandishly, to pushing him too much – or not enough’. Despite the worry that they’d have one sherry too many and flash the CEO, wives played a pivotal role in their husbands’ careers, particularly when it came to shmoozing and boozing. The reason for this? The businessman’s wife was thought to reveal an inner portal into the true character of said businessman, but she was also a valuable tool to win over in case Barry needed reprimanding over his liquid lunches. In order to set up these cross-examinations, drinks parties and formal dinners were arranged, because, after all: ‘It is less embarrassing if the firm arranged to vet the wives at an informal occasion.’ After speaking to more than 88 businessmen, sociologists Raymond and Janice Pahl noted that bringing their wives to work events often triggered feelings of panic in their spouses. One wife’s behaviour at a company dinner became something of an urban legend. ‘The wife of the CEO had been invited to a party and in the midst of a particularly witty piece of conversation she suddenly realised that she had just leant across and cut her companion’s dinner up into small pieces for him.’ Lucky him, I say."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"games/2018/apr/03/sea-of-thieves-review-x-box-pc-rare-microsoft","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T13:00:16Z","webTitle":"Sea of Thieves review – short-lived hilarity on the high seas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/apr/03/sea-of-thieves-review-x-box-pc-rare-microsoft","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/apr/03/sea-of-thieves-review-x-box-pc-rare-microsoft","fields":{"headline":"Sea of Thieves review – short-lived hilarity on the high seas","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There are moments of astonishing beauty in pirate adventure Sea of Thieves.

There are plenty of moments like this if you play for a while. In Sea of Thieves, you spend much of your time on the ocean, sailing between the desert islands. It’s currently a game about fetching stuff. You begin alone, with a single crew member or as a squad of four, and then you’re out into the world, taking on jobs for the seafaring organisations that set up tents at every outpost. For the Gold Hoarders, you’re looking for buried treasure; for the Order of Souls, it’s the skulls of defeated foes; for the Merchant Alliance, it’s ferrying goods – mostly animals – from one place to another. The jobs are always the same: accept the mission, find the island, do the task, return to an outpost, collect payment. The first challenge is mastering the ship. Sailing is deliberately analogue. One person steers, one navigates, someone mans the sails or loads the cannons. Once in a while, you’ll spot a sail on the horizon and know that a battle with a group of strangers is likely. These are intense encounters, cannonballs flying, crew members sneaking aboard each other’s vessels to cut down foes with swords or pistols, treasure chests being spirited away, hulls bursting open and taking on water (which you can then drain by the bucketload). Sometimes there are bigger events: the tentacles of the Kraken erupt from the foaming seas, or a skeleton fort opens up, its treasure room loaded with booty. To face these challenges you may need more than one boat, so uneasy alliances form. The potential for moments of great bravery – and of outright hilarity – is ever-present. When you’re playing with others (and Sea of Thieves is only fun with other people – alone, it is entirely flat), you need a headset with voice chat capabilities. Though there are emotes, visual gestures and simple statements, most of the appeal of the game is lost if you can’t communicate – because Sea of Thieves isn’t really a game about finding treasure, but about messing around with other people, bellowing and following instructions, experimenting with group strategies and laughing together when something goes horribly wrong. The experience is best with friends, although once in a while you’ll pick up a crew of strangers and everything will click. The fun-to-boredom ratio of this may remind older players of using internet chat rooms in the late 90s. There’s a chance you’ll laugh more in your first three hours with Sea of Thieves than you’ve ever laughed with a game before. We’re already seeing thousands of these little moments hitting YouTube – all four crew members playing the accordion while the Kraken attacks; firing each other from the cannons into a skeleton watch tower; chasing pigs through the trees while drunk on grog; accidentally leaving someone on an island. But then … the allure fades. There is no progression in the game – you can’t buy better ships or weapons. In a way, this is a good thing: everyone enters the game as an equal, whether it’s their first time or their 1,000th. But the bigger problem with Sea of Thieves is that the islands, little knuckles of sand and grass jutting from the waves, are all extremely similar, and they all feel empty. There are little tasks and secrets hidden around the world, but not enough that you can just set sail and find a surprise. The only non-player enemies are skeletons, and though there are different sorts, with different abilities, after a few hours you start yearning for something new. There is a vast and complicated argument about longevity and value in the video game industry. It is very strange to see players complaining that they’ve had hours of hilarity and joy with Sea of Thieves, but feel it is not a good game because now they’re bored. Those hours are worth something. This is a game where the whole lore, the whole purpose, the whole backstory, the whole future, is shared between the players – in Sea of Thieves, the burden of design and experience is on us. For better or worse. If you have Game Pass, Microsoft’s monthly subscription service, Sea of Thieves is free – and a must. You’ll have moments in this game that you’ve never had in a game before. If you’re buying it outright, you may want to wait, because Rare will surely start building on these promising foundations. It is no wonder Sea of Thieves has drawn comparisons with No Man’s Sky – at its best, when it’s firing on all cylinders and you let yourself sink into its peculiar vision, it is majestic. The glint of the sun on the choppy waters, the friend who always gets lost in the caves, saving a hold full of chickens from drowning, standing on an island after a battle and watching your ship sink beneath the foam. These moments are the treasure. But are they enough? The problem is not only that there’s too little to do; it’s that you want so much more. Sea of Thieves is out now, £49.99; free with a Microsoft Game Pass subscription."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/03/fireman-matt-parziale-masters-augusta-amateur-golf-tradition","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T15:49:00Z","webTitle":"The fireman keeping the amateur flame burning brightly at Augusta | Andy Bull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/03/fireman-matt-parziale-masters-augusta-amateur-golf-tradition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/03/fireman-matt-parziale-masters-augusta-amateur-golf-tradition","fields":{"headline":"The fireman keeping the amateur flame burning brightly at Augusta","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Around Augusta, amateur isn’t an insult. Anything but. The Masters started as a private tournament precisely so its founding member, Bobby Jones, could play in it without going pro. Jones, who won the grand slam while he was working as a lawyer, once described professional golfers as “uneducated club servants”. That was back when gentlemen thought it was vulgar to get paid to play. Cricket had a similar arrangement. Sometime in the mid-20th century it switched. Professional became the compliment, amateur the put-down. Except around here, where they like to think they still play Jones’s way. There are six amateurs in the field this year. Five of them are kids, between 17 and 22, who came through regional amateur championships. For them, amateurism is just a phase. They all have plans to go pro soon. And then there is Matt Parziale, 30. He used to have a dream about playing as a professional too and spent three years chasing after it on the mini-tour circuit. He woke up from it when he crashed out of a qualifying tournament for the US Open in 2012. These days he works full-time as a fireman in his home town of Brockton, a half-hour drive south of Boston but still plays in his spare time. Parziale won the US Mid-Amateur last year. The tournament is open to anyone 25 or over who has a USGA handicap under 3.4. First prize is a spot in the field at the Masters and the US Open. Typically the men who win it work well-paid, white-collar jobs. Of the past 10, five worked in financial management, two in real estate, and another was an insurance executive. So Parziale is a rare bird in Augusta, a blue-collar golfer. “Brockton is a tough city,” he says, “it’s gone pretty downhill since my dad was a kid but I love it. I’m building a house there.” Right now around 19% of the residents live below the poverty line. Parziale was not a country-club kid. His father, Vic, taught him how to play at the Brockton Fairgrounds, with a bucket of balls, an old club and an empty stretch of turf.Vic Parziale was a fireman too, for 32 years. He retired last November. Now his only job is caddying for his boy. “We were taking a shower right after I had won the Mid-Am,” Parziale says, “and the first thing he said was: ‘I don’t think I can caddie at the Masters.’ And I said: ‘What do you mean?’ And he said: ‘I can’t read the putts. I told him he hasn’t read a putt for me in 12 years, so I don’t know why he would start now.” Vic thinks his boy quit professional golf too soon but was proud he decided to become a fireman. Matt says his favourite memory is the time they fought a fire together. He doesn’t care to talk much about the work. It’d be too much like bragging. He just says it’s a “dangerous job”. He’s actually had to take this year off, because he was worried he would get injured. He has already had to miss five months when he bust his knee. Had to reschedule his wedding, too, because it clashed with the US Open. “Usually every house fire we go into, you leave a little banged up,” Parziale says. “I mean, we’re pulling walls, ceilings, cutting holes in roofs. We’re pretty much destroying the house, is what we’re doing. Because you’re trying to find the fire. It gets in the walls and the attic. You have stuff flying everywhere, people swinging tools everywhere. “A lot of things can happen and you can’t see a thing. You might as well close your eyes. It’s pitch black. It’s not like the movies.” He is too plainspoken to pretend the pressure helps his game. “Just because I fought a fire doesn’t mean golf’s any easier.” Parziale says the hours suit him. He works a 24-hour shift, has two days off, then another 24-hour shift and four days off. Which means he can be on the course six days out of eight. But still. When he won the Mid-Am he got home at 2am and started work at 7am. When he was playing a tournament at Brookline last summer, he shot 66 in the second round, went home, worked an overnight shift, came back in the morning, shot 71 and won.“The way I look at this game, you can make what you want of it,” he says. “I just put a lot of work in to get here, so that’s all I see it as.” Like every other golfer his age, Parziale was inspired by Tiger Woods. He is hoping to play a practice round with him on Wednesday. Woods wrote Parziale a letter congratulating him on the Mid-Am. Maybe Woods gets it. He once spent weeks training with the US special forces, on and off, even dreamed about joining up. Just like his father, Earl, who was a Green Beret. He wanted to know what life was like outside the professional bubble, working some more serious cause. He can ask Parziale all about it. “I make all decisions with no regrets. I don’t look back. So, yeah, I enjoy where I am. I’m very fortunate to be able to do two things I love doing – playing competitive golf and then have a career I really do enjoy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2018/apr/04/missing-link-why-disabled-people-cant-afford-delete-facebook-social-media","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"The missing link: why disabled people can’t afford to #DeleteFacebook","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/04/missing-link-why-disabled-people-cant-afford-delete-facebook-social-media","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/apr/04/missing-link-why-disabled-people-cant-afford-delete-facebook-social-media","fields":{"headline":"The missing link: why disabled people can’t afford to #DeleteFacebook","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s 10.32 on a Friday night and I am staring at the glow of my iPhone screen. It is almost three hours since I checked in to social media. It is also more than two months since I left the house. After falling ill with flu complications in January, I have been at home recovering, too ill to go outside or even to have visitors. Everyday social interactions – going to the pub with friends or chatting in the office – have become phantoms, replaced by four walls and my (disappointingly dull) inner monologue. Instead, I have turned to the internet: browsing “wish you were here” photos on Instagram; reading the details of a friend’s week on Facebook Messenger; keeping up with news on Twitter; receiving “get well” emojis on WhatsApp. When it comes to my mental health, social media has been invaluable. This is an increasingly unpopular opinion. The Cambridge Analytica scandal has made an unprecedented dent in the appeal of social media, with #DeleteFacebook embodying this mood shift. Even before this, it felt as if the tide was turning against social media, with piece after piece in the traditional media (including the Guardian) advocating a “digital detox”, as if the internet were now a poison to be purged. There are apps dedicated to helping users break their online habit, with trackers such as Moment promising to measure how much time you spend looking at your screen. There are plenty of good reasons for this unease. The revelations about Facebook’s data harvesting make it hard to see such platforms, or time spent on them, as harmless fun. There are also valid concerns about the impact on mental health, particularly where young people are concerned. One US study found that teenagers who use social media and the internet the most are twice as likely to be unhappy. I worry increasingly that I feel a discomforting twitch if my phone isn’t near me day and night. But I can’t help but wonder if only privileged people can afford to take a position of social media puritanism. For many, particularly people from marginalised groups, social media is a lifeline – a bridge to a new community, a route to employment, a way to tackle isolation. “Without social media, life would be so much harder,” says Philip Green, 56, from London. Green has arthritis in his spine, as well as mental health problems, and lives with severe pain that means going out to socialise is often impossible. “I’m relatively lucky to have some really good close friends, but my most frequent communication with them is via Facebook or WhatsApp,” he says. Because he lives on disability benefits, he can rarely afford a trip to the cinema or lunch with friends. “On top of this, if I get a flare-up of pain, all plans have to be cancelled.” This sort of isolation is a common experience: recent research showed that almost half of disabled people in Britain are “always or often” lonely. Hannah Hodgson, from a hamlet on the outskirts of Lancaster, agrees. “My world would be tiny without the internet, especially on days when my body makes me a prisoner in my own bed,” she says. “I’d be lost without it.” The 20-year-old was diagnosed with a life-limiting condition as a teenager – she has intestinal failure and hearing loss and collapses several times a day. As her friends went off to university, she found herself stuck at home with her parents in a tiny community. In response, she used YouTube to create a community for people with rare health conditions, which a year later has more than 2,000 subscribers. “Off the back of my YouTube channel I’ve started a letter-writing PO box, where people can send me letters if they feel lonely or like they could do with a friend,” she says. “I have friends down south, even one in Australia, and I feel very loved [even] when I have never physically met a lot of my friends.” If social media can facilitate friendships for people such as Green and Hodgson, it can also give a sense of power and opportunity to those who might otherwise lack it. For Alice Strick, social media has created new communities and a dream job she thought she would never have. The 28-year-old was unable to complete her art degree in 2011 due to severe depression and borderline personality disorder and she worried that her mental health had “totally scuppered” her chance of success as an artist. Unable to find an art workshop she could afford during her recovery, she used Facebook to set up her own; after others shared the event, 1,000 people asked to attend. Now, 18 months later, putting on workshops for women with mental health problems is Strick’s full-time job. After forming a connection via Instagram, she has been commissioned to hold one at the Tate. “Without social media, I wouldn’t have had a career that I love and I’m proud of,” she says. “I wouldn’t be so far along in my mental health recovery.” As a mixed-race woman, Strick also uses Twitter to be part of a community she has struggled to find offline (“I’ve always felt I don’t really belong in white or Indian communities,” she says). Many LGBT, BME and disabled people tell similar stories. Ruth Sullivan, from Brighton, has used social media to find what she calls her “little niche part of the queer community” after struggling in the local club scene. “On Twitter, the bi community is way more visible and I’ve been able to find people to chat with and celebrate those elements of myself I felt were keeping me on the outside,” she says. When Laura Elliot, 26, fell severely ill in 2016 with intermittent paralysis, vertigo and joint dislocations, she found a disability community online to tell her she wasn’t alone. “As the months went on, and doctors kept telling me it was stress, disabled and chronically ill people on Twitter were an absolute lifeline,” she says. Elliot, who lives in Sheffield, has since been diagnosed with the rare condition hypermobile Ehler‑Danlos syndrome. Although mostly housebound, she has used her journalism degree to start a politics podcast from her bedroom, working with disability activists online to campaign about everything from universal credit to wheelchair provision. “Before I became unwell, I was quite critical of people who were always on their phones,” she says. “Without social media, I’m not sure I’d still be here today. I’m not sure how I’d have stayed sane.” This is the paradox of social media and mental wellbeing. While social media can exacerbate problems – Green, for example, takes breaks during periods of heightened anxiety – it can also improve one’s mental state. Sullivan, who has depression, credits Twitter with saving her life when she felt suicidal in 2009. Having become isolated in the offline world after signing off sick from work, she began speaking regularly to people online. One day, she made a suicide plan and stopped logging in. “Those people who’d been with me every day, some hour by hour, realised that I wasn’t around and worked out how to reach out to me by phone,” she says. “Without those strangers online, I wouldn’t be here today.” Despite its evident benefits, social media still has a way to go to improve the experience for marginalised groups. Laura Kalbag, author of Accessibility for Everyone and part of the Indienet initiative to create “a more equal internet”, says that, as in other areas of society, marginalised groups are most vulnerable to potentially unethical practices such as data harvesting. “They’re often less likely to have the resources and time required to seek out the technology that is least harmful to them,” she says. “Much of this is a result of the majority of mainstream technology being designed and built by wealthy, white, straight, non-disabled, cis men from similar backgrounds, building products either to benefit people who are exactly the same as them or to attempt to exploit people who are not.” Further progress will come by making the internet more accessible. “We assume the internet is open to all when it’s not,” says Astra Taylor, author of The People’s Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age. For example, disabled people are less likely to have online access (in 2017, more than one-fifth of disabled people in the UK had never used the internet, compared with only one in 10 of the adult population overall), while people from poorer and rural areas are often excluded from high‑speed broadband. “The first level [for improvements] is getting people online in a real way – a phone really doesn’t suffice if you need to apply for a job or do your homework,” Taylor says. “In addition to the problem of connectivity, the platforms and services we use have minimal incentives to be truly accessible. Every travel navigation service should immediately offer accessible routes. Every image should have a visual description. Every video should be captioned.” For Kalbag, dealing with the concerns about social media will lead to improvements for all of us. “We must regulate, and extend our laws, to protect people from the worst harms caused by these businesses. And we must fund and build alternative, ethical technology, including ethical alternative social media platforms,” she says. “It’s not realistic to tell people they should just leave social media, which has become vital social infrastructure. We have to give people a place to go.” Green is concerned about the Cambridge Analytica reports, but he is wary of quick calls to quit Facebook. “As with much in life, the choices people can make come down to privilege,” he says. “I don’t have the luxury of simply signing out, as I’d once again become isolated.” In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

The warning from maritime security experts follows a series of recent Chinese moves to put pressure on Taiwan’s pro-independence government. These include a vow last month by China’s president that Taiwan would face the “punishment of history” if it pursued a separatist course. “Any actions and tricks to split China are doomed to failure and will meet with the people’s condemnation,” Xi Jinping said. The latest rupture came at the weekend after Taiwan’s premier, William Lai, told parliament in Taipei he was a “Taiwan independence worker” and that Taiwan was a sovereign, independent country. China, which calls Taiwan a renegade province, quickly condemned his comments as “dangerous and presumptuous”. The Chinese Communist party-published Global Times said an international warrant could be issued for Lai’s arrest under the 2005 anti-secession law. “If evidence of his crimes is cast-iron, then a global ‘wanted’ notice can be issued for him,” it said. China has accelerated efforts to isolate Taiwan diplomatically in recent months, using its economic clout to pressure countries and international institutions into breaking ties with the island. It has curbed bilateral trade, cultural exchanges and tourism. Beijing has also increased naval exercises and fighter-bomber sorties over the strategically important Taiwan Strait. China’s raised military profile includes escorted bomber “encirclement flights” and the recent deployment of an aircraft carrier off Taiwan. Discussing possible Chinese moves to seize Taiwan by force, a panel of maritime security experts convened by the Atlantic Council thinktank in Washington noted that by controlling Taiwan, China would gain direct access to the western Pacific and extend its influence in disputed areas of the East and South China seas, where it is establishing military bases on reclaimed land. Sarah Kirchberger of the Institute for Security Policy at the University of Kiel in Germany suggested the US, which is bound, de facto, to uphold Taiwan’s peace and security under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, should compare the present situation to that existing before Russia’s forcible annexation of Crimea in 2014. Kirchberger quoted a senior Chinese naval official as saying: “We should do what Putin did in Crimea to Taiwan”. The increased pressure on Taipei is in line with the politically dominant Xi’s pursuit of a more hardline, nationalist approach towards international and domestic affairs, exemplified by the harsh treatment of pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. The situation poses a particular challenge for the US, which remains Taiwan’s principal foreign ally and arms supplier. Since taking office, Donald Trump has assiduously courted Xi, inviting him to Florida, visiting Beijing, and frankly admitting he needs China’s help in pressurising North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons programmes. But Trump has also launched a fight with China on tariffs, sparking Chinese retaliation in what could yet become an all-out trade war. Meanwhile, Trump last month signed into law the Taiwan Travel Act, whose express purpose is to encourage bilateral official exchanges with Taiwan “at all levels”. China said the law was a “mistake” and violated agreed “One China” policy. During a weekend meeting in Taipei with Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s pro-independence president, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a senior member of the US Congress, declared the US-Taiwan relationship was stronger than ever. For many in Beijing, this is akin to waving a rag at a bull in a red china shop. The worry now is that China, aware of Trump’s vulnerability over North Korea, angry at his tariff war and sensing his lack of interest in the western Pacific’s military balance may be tempted to test US resolve over Taiwan. Inviting the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to the White House in a phone call last week, Trump appeared to have forgiven and forgotten all about Crimea. So how safe, really, is Taiwan?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/14/ross-raisin-on-yorkshire-looking-for-home","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T08:59:17Z","webTitle":"Ross Raisin on Yorkshire: 'What I am looking for, beyond the fauna and Flora tubs, is home'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/14/ross-raisin-on-yorkshire-looking-for-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/14/ross-raisin-on-yorkshire-looking-for-home","fields":{"headline":"Ross Raisin on Yorkshire: 'What I am looking for, beyond the fauna and Flora tubs, is home'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"About half a mile from Heathrow airport, in the thick of an urban wasteland of warehousing and carriageways and industrial units, there is, improbably, a crop field. There are field mice and foxes, thriving in the turned earth. Molehills. A two-dozen flock of goldfinches darting about the seedheads of thistles at the field edge. In the single large tree, a nest for a pair of sparrowhawks. For several years, I have stared out over this peculiar field, increasingly aware that what I am in fact looking for, beyond the fauna and Flora tubs, is home. Home, for me, is a field in Yorkshire. Enclosed by its tumbled drystone walls, I would build fires, or sledge, or sit alone watching for movements in the grass. From the top of the field I scanned the horizon for distant towns, forests, and the ghostly green land that as a child I believed was a faraway continent; then, later, Riddlesden Golf Club. That field was the base from which I understood and felt the world, beneath my arse and through my fingertips. When I started to write, it was from there that I reached outwards. Writing a fictional narrative is charged with the idea of home. You build the imagined physical structures of a house, a community, a landscape – and, more than that, you imagine your way inside what belonging means to a character. There is a Welsh word, hiraeth, which means something like a longing of the soul to come home to the place where your spirit lives. I’m pretty sure there is no Yorkshire term that expresses the same idea – it’s a little too lyrical for Yorkshire –but it is a word that I understand innately, and a yearning that is present in most of the characters I have ever created: home sometimes a tangible place, sometimes a psychological one. It is this feeling, hiraeth, that I think I am experiencing when I gawp out at that Heathrow field. A borrowed impression of home. Yorkshire – as both an emotional pull and also, more and more, a physical one. My wife is also from a field in Yorkshire. (Different field, way beyond Riddlesden Golf Club.) We talk often about moving back. Doubts, however, quickly play on me at the prospect of it. The thought of being an imposter, an “off-comed”, wanting to implant myself in a community that never felt the need to move away. Our children, mind you, seem up for it. In part because they were recently scared shitless by a visit to Buckingham Palace. They started climbing the railings and one of the Guardsmen – that most London of symbols – broke out of his living statue to scream at them and point his bayonet at their terrified skulls. If I was looking for a sign that it is time to go home, there it is. • A Natural is published in paperback by Vintage.

My wardrobe calamities began three years ago, boarding a plane home from England to Northern Ireland. Seatbelt fastened, I realised my favourite sweater was missing. I had, presumably, idly dropped it around the departure gates. But I’d never know. The flight took off. My grey Sunspel sweatshirt with its cute hound dog print was gone, for ever. Things escalated from there. I mislaid a jacket in Osaka, costly shorts in south-west Ireland, another sweater goodness knows where, and the losses got to me. My mother had become unwell and I was travelling home often, trying to hold on to everything – time, memories, my mum – as much as possible. I needed the everyday to be in its right place when everything else was going so wrong, but if I wasn’t packing and unpacking, I was doing laundry, and in the melee items went awol. When I interviewed men about the most cherished items they’d lost, it became clear that the impact was more than just a gap in the wardrobe. Yes, the things we lose are often valuable in themselves: a peaked cap that’s the perfect once-in-a-lifetime fit; a pair of brogues so beautiful they ruin every substitute tried on since. But often a trip to Lost Property comes with other baggage. There’s something else we can’t get back: a connection, a memory, a person. I loved that sweater; but I loved the time before I lost it more. That was irreplaceable. Introduction by Colin Crummy The tweed cap: Oliver Jeffers, 40, children’s author and illustrator There’s barely a photo of me from 2005-2008 where I’m not wearing my Stetson peaked cap. I picked it up in Germany and it was instantly a good fit. I wore an old-time style back then – a peacoat, secondhand second world war boots and grandad cardigans – so the cap suited that. I am a hat man. My girlfriend’s mum used to think I was bald because she never saw me without a hat. But I didn’t really like peaked caps until I saw this one. It was a herringbone tweed, tannish, in a newspaper boy style, and cost about £70. I wore it from spring to autumn and often in the studio, which became part of the problem. There was a spot of blue paint just on the peak that I had stopped noticing. I realised the cap was missing as soon as my girlfriend and I got back to New York from a trip home to Belfast. There was a note from the Transportation Security Administration in the top of my luggage saying they’d rummaged through the bag. I assumed the cap had fallen out of the suitcase. For two years, I was shaking my fist at the TSA for losing my favourite hat. I got married in 2010, which is when my new mother-in-law, Rosemary, came clean. The TSA hadn’t lost my hat. She, in a fit of charity, had tried to get the paint off it in the washing machine, where it just exploded into pieces. She immediately got rid of the evidence. Rosemary is one of the most kind-hearted, gentle women on the planet, so I couldn’t be mad. She told me her heart sank when she reached into the machine for the ball of fluff. But I was glad to get closure. The cotton pullover: Diébédo Francis Kéré, 52, award-winning architect My father was the village chief of Gando. He was illiterate, so when he received letters he would wait weeks for someone from the city to come and read them for him. In the rainy season, it might take months. In 1972, he sent me, his first son, to school in the city, so I could learn to read and write. I was seven years old. I was the first child in the village to go to school. When my father told me, I wondered, what is a school? Then I realised I would leave my family and live with my uncle in Tenkodogo, 20km away. The city seemed far from home and dangerous. I was also the first child in my family to get clothes. In the village, children ran around naked. My father saw that I was afraid to leave, so he bought me a cotton pullover. It cost him a fortune, the equivalent of four chickens. The gift was my father’s way of protecting me, of telling me not to be afraid. At night it got cold, so I used to bring the pullover over my knees. It acted as a second skin. But it also connected me to my family. I returned home four times a year for school holidays. I’d wear my pullover and all the kids would join me on a little hill in Gando and repeat what I’d learned in school, like the alphabet, which they’d sing back. The pullover went missing three years later, after it was left out to dry. I assumed someone liked it as much as I did, but I didn’t really know if it had been stolen or if the wind took it away. I just knew I had lost my protection and the connection to my father. I thought, what will I wear when I go back to the village? What will he say? But my father didn’t punish me. When I returned home, people gathered in the village. My father addressed the crowd. He said that the pullover was old; it was time to get a new one. That I was a good boy and he was very proud. He wanted my education to serve the community, so after I became an architect, I asked the people of Gando to join me in creating my first building, a school in the village, which opened in 2001. The beige brogues: Tan France, 34, stylist on Netflix’s Queer Eye I saw these beige brogues in Office on a break from work at British Gas in Manchester. The shoes stood out: they were the perfect shape, with a rounded toe, a curve to the arch and a higher heel than usual. I’m average height, 5ft 9in, but that extra half-centimetre gave me confidence. It was like I was tiptoeing in them. The brogues originally cost £130, which was too much for a 19-year-old to afford. But I got the last pair in a sale for £40. I wore them with a pair of slim-fit, indigo Diesel jeans. This was around 2002, when Diesel was hot. The combination was killer. I’d wear them on nights out to Tribeca or Gaia, the dressier bars near Canal Street, where they wouldn’t get trashed. They were the most beautiful, slender shoes; every gay man remarked upon them. On a trip to New York, I took the shoes in my carry-on luggage to keep them safe. But on the way back, after buying several pairs of heavy Timberland boots, I put the lighter brogues into checked-in luggage to avoid going over the weight limit. When the bag didn’t turn up on the baggage carousel at Manchester airport, I got that gut feeling similar to when you think you’ve lost your wallet. I spoke to the baggage agent and I was so panicked, she thought I was seriously unwell. The shoes were that important to me. They were just so beautiful. When I see a shoe, I deconstruct it in my head. It comes from spending childhood summers around my grandad’s denim factory in Bury, watching the machinists turn fabric into clothes. After I lost the brogues – which Office had discontinued by this stage – I asked shoemakers in Asia to help me make a similar pair. But they were too hard to replicate. We couldn’t get the specs right. If it had been a piece of clothing, I would have figured it out and made it myself. But making shoes is an art form. The slogan T-shirt: Hans Ulrich Obrist, 49, artistic director of the Serpentine Galleries I lost a lot of things on my travels but my Felix Gonzalez-Torres T-shirt was the dearest to me. It’s about friendship. The designer Agnès B is one of my oldest friends. She made the T-shirt with Felix, a Cuban conceptual artist, in 1994 and it was so beautiful. It was a very empty T-shirt, blank on the front and on the back it read “Nobody Owns Me”. Felix was a visionary artist. He made these amazing pieces where people could take away the artworks, such as his 1991 Untitled (Portrait of Ross in LA), an installation that is a mound of sweets visitors are encouraged to take from until it disappears. The T-shirt slogan was a statement for personal freedom and independence but also that art belongs to everyone. Felix’s work inspired the French artist Christian Boltanski and me to create the show Take Me (I’m Yours) in 1995. Created in dialogue with Felix, it was an exhibition where you could touch the art, exchange it or take it away. Much of Felix’s work, like Untitled, was about his late partner, Ross Laycock, who died of complications from Aids. Felix died of an Aids-related illness in 1996. He was only 38 years old. After that, the T-shirt took on new significance for me. It was an amazing, very personal thing of Felix’s to have and it became a way to remember him. I always carried it with me when I travelled. When my suitcase was lost in transit in 2000, it was the first thing I thought of. Everything else was replaceable. I think about that T-shirt all the time. I wonder where it is. Of all the things I’ve lost, it’s the most significant because it’s about the fact that we lost Felix. The jade pendant: Christopher Shannon, 37, menswear designer The only item that I have been really devastated to lose is a jade Buddha pendant that my grandmother, Joan, gave me during my GCSEs in 1996. Her grandfather was Chinese, so she had an affection for chinoiserie. My mum and aunts and uncles all wore a jade pendant or ring. All my great-aunts’ houses were decorated with Chinese figurines and hangings. This was before Buddhas were as commonplace as they are now; people didn’t have them all over their gardens. I had heard the story of my great-great-grandfather since I was a kid. Dang Chang came from the Shunde district in China to England for an eye operation in 1899. He opened the first Chinese laundry in Europe, so the legend goes, at 113 Pitt Street in Liverpool. My grandmother died quite suddenly shortly after she gave me the jade pendant. The morning of her funeral, I discovered that the chain was broken. The pendant was given as a rite of passage and was meant to bring luck. It was our family’s superstition that if the jade broke, it was time to stop wearing it. But I wore the jade pendant for a while; I was going through my teenage stoner phase, so it worked with my look: black denim with a plaid shirt and Dr Martens boots. When I discovered nightclubs, it didn’t really work with dressing up to go out. I kept it safe in a box somewhere instead but I think someone stole it after a night out. I was really distressed; the pendant was the only thing from my nan, apart from a blanket she made me, and it was special to me because I really loved her. Her sisters and cousins married into other Chinese families but she married my grandfather, who was a barrow boy of Irish decent. The jade was a way of hanging on to her heritage. • Commenting on this piece?
